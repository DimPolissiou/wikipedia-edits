Over the years, the school has been through several structural changes, such as when the [[1944 Cornwall\u2013Massena earthquake]] destroyed the middle of the building which then had to be demolished and reconstructed.  In the mid-1970s, the centre core again underwent major renovations.  Additional changes were made during the summer months of 2011 and 2012 to help accommodate the students from [[General Vanier Intermediate School]] for the 2011\u201312 school year, and later to assist with the transition of the Kinsmen-Vincent Massey school for the 2012\u201313 school year.\n\nIn a 2002 controversial decision, the school's grade 9 and 10 students were moved to St. Lawrence and General Vanier, while grade 11 and 12 students from those schools were subsequently moved to CCVS in an effort to cut costs.  This was changed back in 2010, which resulted in CCVS becoming a 7\u201312 school following the General Vanier Intermediate School closure at the conclusion of the 2010\u201311 school year.\n\nToday, CCVS is an ethnically diverse school which reflects the changing demographics in the city of Cornwall.  Due to its long history, CCVS offers many scholarship, bursary and award opportunities that total more than $150,000 for its graduating students. Notable among these is the Arthur F. Battista memorial bursary.  It is awarded to 30 graduates each year, 15 to college bound students and 15 to university bound students. The bursary awards the university bound students with $4,000 over two years, and $3,500 to college bound students.\n\nCurrently, CCVS offers Special High Skills Majors in Arts and Culture and Communication and Technology.  Students can earn a red seal on their diploma if they successfully complete a certain number of credits in these areas of study.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:High schools in Cornwall, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1806]]\n\n\n{{Ontario-school-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox school\n|name                  = Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School\n|image                 = \n|caption               = \n|address               = 437 Sydney St.\n|city                  = [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]]\n|province              = [[Ontario]]\n|postcode              = \n|country               = Canada\n| coordinates = {{coord|45.02271|N|74.72810|W|region:CA-ON|display=inline,title}}\n|schooltype            = [[High school#Canada|High school]]\n|motto                 = Labor Ipse Voluptas (lat.

Walker was born in [[Hope, Arkansas]] where he attended Yerger High School until 1952. In 1965, Walker began the general practice of law in Little Rock, Arkansas with the emphasis on civil rights. In 1968, he opened one of the first three racially integrated law firms in the south, first known as Walker and Chachkin. Between 1965 and his death in 2019, Walker was personally  involved in most of the reported cases which involve racial discrimination in the state of Arkansas.  Many of them are landmark having created new law and opened doors to school houses and work places throughout the state of Arkansas and surrounding states. One case took his time since 1965, the Little Rock school case started by the late Wiley Branton and LDF general counsel/later Supreme Court Justice [[Thurgood Marshall]]. Many of Walker's early cases involved classes of people discriminated against by mega corporate environments due to their race. A recent case of Walker's was the only nationwide racial discrimination case ever successfully prosecuted against Wal-Mart. It involved a class of African American truck drivers.\n\nHe died at his home in Little Rock on October 28, 2019 at the age of 82.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://katv.com/news/local/arkansas-lawmaker-and-civil-rights-leader-john-walker-dies-at-82|title=Arkansas lawmaker and civil rights leader John Walker dies at 82|first=Scott|last=Carroll|date=Oct 28, 2019|website=KATV|accessdate=Oct 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nWalker graduated from [[Yates High School|Jack Yates High School]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], in 1954. He was the first African American undergraduate student admitted to the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] after the ''Brown'' decision in 1954 but was not allowed to attend for racial reasons.

Many of Walker\u2019s early cases involved classes of people discriminated against by mega corporate environments due to their race.

Since US military service members were a large source of the hostess bars clientele, this effectively closed all hostessing themed establishments nearby all US military bases in Korea.\n\n== Policies ==\nForeign policies between the United States and Republic of Korea determined the U.S.'s occupation and influence in South Korea. Through collaboration between Korean leaders and the U.S. military, an institutionalized system transpired which tolerated and regulated prostitution. The arrival of American GIs resulted in greater demand for Korean sex workers and an increase in clientele for R&R (Rest and Relaxation{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=85}}) establishments.\n\n=== Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law ===\nThe Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law (Public Act No. 7) was passed on November 11, 1947 and took effect on February 14, 1948. The U.S policy was installed in order to alter the system of licensed prostitution which was established in Korea under Japan's rule. Despite the abolishment of licensed prostitution, it only led to the \u201cprivatization\u201d of prostitution and the widespread dispersement of prostitutes throughout the area.{{sfn|Lee|2007|pp=466\u2013468}} This made its difficult for the government to systematically regulate prostitutes and their activities; specifically, mandatory STD exams for prostitutes could no longer be enforced. This resulted in a large spike of STD's among prostitutes and the U.S. military{{sfn|Lee|2007|p=469}} Rehabilitation and welfare assistance for prostitutes were supposed to be a part of the new law; however, policymakers denied national funds towards these programs.\n\nThrough the Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law, the U.S. military government replaced licensed establishments of prostitution to camptowns near military bases. This provided a communal space for prostitutes and U.S. military men.\n\n=== Mutual Defense Treaty ===\nThe United States' involvement in aiding South Korea during the Korean War (1950-1953) resulted in the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1953 that declared the Republic of Korea and the United States as military alliances. Through this treaty, the Republic of Korea formally granted military facilities, areas, and status for U.S. troops in Korea for an indefinite period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/us-korea-military-alliance|title=US-Korea Military Alliance|last=Oh|first=Daniel|website=Wilson Center Digital Archive|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usfk.mil/About/SOFA/|title=Status of Forces Agreement|website=www.usfk.mil|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Korea |url=https://www.usfk.mil/Portals/105/Documents/SOFA/A01_SOFA.Art.I-XXXI.pdf |website=www.usfk.mil |accessdate=10 June 2019 |date=9 July 1966}}</ref> The presence of U.S. military troops, under the Mutual Defense Treaty, were the product of high kijich'on prostitution rates.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=29}}\n\n=== Nixon Doctrine ===\nIn 1969, the Nixon Doctrine declared the need to reduce the United States' military involvement from Asia. This resulted in 20,000 U.S. servicemen being removed from South Korea and the formal withdrawal of American GIs from the DMZ.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=59}} Due to the economic dependence on the U.S. military's presence for jobs and income, prostitution decreased but competition significantly heightened among clubs, other businesses, and sex workers. Newspapers reported the significant economic losses and the widespread dislocation that occurred after the removal of U.S. troops. It was publicized that some establishments went from making $200 to $300 per night to a profit of $4 to $5.{{sfn|Moon|2006|pp=68-69}} Many who lived near U.S. bases needed to relocate to more concentrated areas while others found work in different industries. The removal of U.S. troops under the Nixon Doctrine caused an increase in camptown problems and great resentment towards the United States.\n\n== Kijich'on (Military Camptown) ==\nThe large army [[Kijich'on|camptowns]] are mainly located near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which is between North and South Korea.{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=7}} The most popular camp towns are P\u2019yLngt\u2019aek, P\u2019aju, Tongduch\u2019Ln, and OijLngbu which have developed near main U.S. army bases.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Na Young|date=2006|title=The Construction of U.S. Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Trans/Formation and Resistance|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4162/umi-umd-3959.pdf;sequence=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Kijich\u2019on towns are neighbored to U.S. military camp bases and contain a combination of American and Korean residents.{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=17}} These towns consist of businesses and entertainment that serve the interests of U.S. military men.

Since US military service members were a large source of the hostess bars clientele, this effectively closed all hostessing themed establishments nearby all US military bases in Korea.\n\n== Policies ==\nForeign policies between the United States and Republic of Korea determined the U.S.'s occupation and influence in South Korea. Through collaboration between Korean leaders and the U.S. military, an institutionalized system transpired which tolerated and regulated prostitution. The arrival of American GIs resulted in greater demand for Korean sex workers and an increase in clientele for R&R (Rest and Relaxation{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=85}}) establishments.\n\n=== Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law ===\nThe Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law (Public Act No. 7) was passed on November 11, 1947 and took effect on February 14, 1948. The U.S policy was installed in order to alter the system of licensed prostitution which was established in Korea under Japan's rule. Despite the abolishment of licensed prostitution, it only led to the \u201cprivatization\u201d of prostitution and the widespread dispersement of prostitutes throughout the area.{{sfn|Lee|2007|pp=466\u2013468}} This made its difficult for the government to systematically regulate prostitutes and their activities; specifically, mandatory STD exams for prostitutes could no longer be enforced. This resulted in a large spike of STD's among prostitutes and the U.S. military{{sfn|Lee|2007|p=469}} Rehabilitation and welfare assistance for prostitutes were supposed to be a part of the new law; however, policymakers denied national funds towards these programs.\n\nThrough the Abolishment of Public Prostitution Law, the U.S. military government replaced licensed establishments of prostitution to camptowns near military bases. This provided a communal space for prostitutes and U.S. military men.\n\n=== Mutual Defense Treaty ===\nThe United States' involvement in aiding South Korea during the Korean War (1950-1953) resulted in the Mutual Defense Treaty in 1953 that declared the Republic of Korea and the United States as military alliances. Through this treaty, the Republic of Korea formally granted military facilities, areas, and status for U.S. troops in Korea for an indefinite period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/resource/modern-korean-history-portal/us-korea-military-alliance|title=US-Korea Military Alliance|last=Oh|first=Daniel|website=Wilson Center Digital Archive|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usfk.mil/About/SOFA/|title=Status of Forces Agreement|website=www.usfk.mil|access-date=2019-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Facilities and Areas and the Status of United States Armed Forces in Korea |url=https://www.usfk.mil/Portals/105/Documents/SOFA/A01_SOFA.Art.I-XXXI.pdf |website=www.usfk.mil |accessdate=10 June 2019 |date=9 July 1966}}</ref> The presence of U.S. military troops, under the Mutual Defense Treaty, were the product of high kijich'on prostitution rates.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=29}}\n\n=== Nixon Doctrine ===\nIn 1969, the Nixon Doctrine declared the need to reduce the United States' military involvement from Asia. This resulted in 20,000 U.S. servicemen being removed from South Korea and the formal withdrawal of American GIs from the DMZ.{{sfn|Moon|2006|p=59}} Due to the economic dependence on the U.S. military's presence for jobs and income, prostitution decreased but competition significantly heightened among clubs, other businesses, and sex workers. Newspapers reported the significant economic losses and the widespread dislocation that occurred after the removal of U.S. troops. It was publicized that some establishments went from making $200 to $300 per night to a profit of $4 to $5.{{sfn|Moon|2006|pp=68-69}} Many who lived near U.S. bases needed to relocate to more concentrated areas while others found work in different industries. The removal of U.S. troops under the Nixon Doctrine caused an increase in camptown problems and great resentment towards the United States.\n\n== Kijich'on (Military Camptown) ==\nThe large army [[Kijich'on|camptowns]] are mainly located near the demilitarized zone (DMZ) which is between North and South Korea.{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=7}} The most popular camp towns are P\u2019yLngt\u2019aek, P\u2019aju, Tongduch\u2019Ln, and OijLngbu which have developed near main U.S. army bases.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Na Young|date=2006|title=The Construction of U.S. Camptown Prostitution in South Korea: Trans/Formation and Resistance|url=https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/4162/umi-umd-3959.pdf;sequence=1|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Kijich\u2019on towns are neighbored to U.S. military camp bases and contain a combination of American and Korean residents.{{sfn|Moon|1997|p=17}} These towns consist of businesses and entertainment that serve the interests of U.S. military men.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}</ref> Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was canceled in June 1969, at the height of the [[Apollo program]], after it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}}  Sputnik had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11-12}}\n\nOn August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}\n\nOriginally Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket, but in the new [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]]ordered that Dyna-Soar be launched into orbit.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara gave tacit approval for the development of a space station using Dyna-Soar or NASA's [[Gemini spacecraft]]. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a spacecraft (a modified  that became known as [[Blue Gemini]]) and a [[Titan III]] launch vehicle. The space station was expected to provide a [[shirt-sleeve environment]] for a crew of four for up to 30 days.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}} On 9 November 1962, Zuckert submitted his proposals to McNamara. For fiscal year 1964, he asked for $75 million for MODS and $102 million for Blue Gemini.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=10}} On 21 January 1963, McNamara and [[NASA Administrator]] reached an agreement on the management of Project Gemini. {{sfn|Hacker|Grimwood|2010|pp=120-122}} \n\nThe [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}} Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara cancelled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} MOL was a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]] spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n==Modules==\n===Specifications===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Crew: 2\n*Maximum duration: 40 days\n*Orbit: Sun synchronous or polar\n*Length: {{convert|21.92|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Diameter: {{convert|3.05|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Habitable volume: {{convert|11.3|m3|cuft|abbr=on}}\n*Gross mass: {{convert|14476|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Payload: {{convert|2700|kg|lb|abbr=on}}\n*Power: [[fuel cell]]s or [[solar cell]]s\n*[[Reaction control system|RCS]] system: [[dinitrogen tetroxide|{{chem2|N2O4}}]]/[[Monomethylhydrazine|MMH]]\n*Reference:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/m/mol.html |title=MOL |website=Astronautix.com |access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:MOL 01.jpg|MOL main features\nImage:Proposed USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory - GPN-2003-00094.jpg|Early 1960s MOL conceptual drawing that did not use the Gemini spacecraft\nImage:Dorian 21.jpg|Integral launch dual compartment laboratory\nImage:Dorian_25.jpg|MOL variations\nImage:MOL spacesuit.jpg|MOL spacesuit\nFile:USAF_Astronaut_Maneuvering_Unit.jpg|Astronaut Maneuvering Unit (AMU), developed for MOL\n</gallery>\n\n==Spacecraft==\nThe Gemini capsule was redesigned for MOL and named Gemini B.

It used a Gemini B spacecraft as a reentry vehicle.\n\nThe crew were to be launched using a [[Titan 3M]] with the stacked Gemini B and MOL, and returned to Earth in the Gemini B. They would conduct up to 40 days of military reconnaissance using large optics, [[camera]]s, and side-looking [[radar]].\n\nThe [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] (AMU) was developed for the MOL project.  NASA chief astronaut [[Deke Slayton]] later speculated in his autobiography that the AMU may have been developed for MOL because the Air Force \"thought they might have the chance to inspect somebody else's satellites.\"{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|p=174}}\n\nIn response to the announcement of the MOL, the [[Soviet Union]] commissioned the development of its own military space station, [[Almaz]]. Three Almaz space stations flew as [[Salyut]] space stations, and the program also developed a military add-on used on [[Salyut 6]] and [[Salyut 7]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |title=The Almaz program |publisher=Russian Space Web |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514000112/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/almaz.html |archive-date=14 May 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |title=Almaz |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |first=Mark |last=Wade |access-date=12 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119184429/http://astronautix.com/project/almaz.htm |archive-date=19 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Almprog/almprog.htm |title=The Almaz Space Station Program |publisher=Sven's Space Place |first=Sven |last=Grahn |access-date=12 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Test flight===\n[[File:Titan-3C MOL-Gemini-B-Test 3.jpg|thumb|MOL test launch [[OPS 0855]], 3 November 1966, Cape Canaveral, FL]]\nMOL Test flight [[OPS 0855]] was launched from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Launch Complex 40]] on 3 November 1966 at 13:50:42 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]], on a [[Titan IIIC]]-9. The flight consisted of a MOL [[mockup]] built from a [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] propellant tank, and the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|refurbished capsule]] from the [[Gemini 2]] mission as a [[prototype]] {{nowrap|Gemini B}} spacecraft.\n\nAfter the [[Gemini spacecraft No. 2|Gemini B prototype]] separated for a sub-orbital [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]], the MOL mockup continued into [[orbit]] and released three satellites. A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]\u2014intended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations\u2014was tested during the capsule's reentry. The Gemini capsule was recovered near [[Ascension Island]] in the South Atlantic by the {{USS|La Salle|AGF-3|6}} after a flight of 33 minutes.\n\n===Proposed===\n* 1970 December 1 -  MOL 1 - First uncrewed Gemini-B/[[Titan IIIM]] qualification flight (Gemini-B flown alone, without an active MOL)\n* 1971 June 1 -  MOL 2 - Second uncrewed Gemini-B/Titan 3M qualification flight (Gemini-B flown alone, without an active MOL)\n* 1972 February 1 -  MOL 3 - A crew of two ([[James M.

This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the uncrewed [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|crewed space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. MOL program director [[Bernard Schriever]] commissioned a report in May 1966 examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.<ref name=\"day20190319\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Space Review: The measure of a man: Evaluating the role of astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=2018-03-19 |website=The Space Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMOL was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}} as it was determined the capabilities of uncrewed spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of crewed MOL missions.\n\nAl Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], first launched a few months after the 1966 report, he knew that manned MOL would be canceled. NASA offered those MOL astronauts 35 years of age and under the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 astronauts were 35 or younger and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: Future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C.

The project was developed from several early Air Force and [[NASA]] concepts of crewed [[space station]]s to be used for [[reconnaissance]] purposes.  MOL evolved into a single-use laboratory, with which crews would be launched on 40-day missions and return to Earth using a '''Gemini B''' spacecraft, derived from [[NASA]]'s [[Project Gemini]].\n\nThe MOL program was announced to the public on 10 December 1963 as an inhabited platform to prove the utility of putting people in space for military missions.<ref name=\"press release\">{{cite press release |url=http://www.nro.gov/foia/declass/mol/6.pdf |title=Air Force to Develop Manned Orbiting Laboratory |publisher=Department of Defence |date=10 December 1963}}</ref> Astronauts selected for the program were later told of the reconnaissance mission for the program. The contractor for the MOL was the [[Douglas Aircraft Company]]. The Gemini B was externally similar to NASA's Gemini spacecraft, although it underwent several modifications, including the addition of a circular hatch through the heat shield, which allowed passage between the spacecraft and the laboratory.\n\nMOL was canceled in June 1969, at the height of the [[Apollo program]], after it was shown that uncrewed [[reconnaissance satellite]]s could achieve the same objectives much more cost-effectively. U.S. space station development was instead pursued with the civilian NASA [[Skylab]] (Apollo Applications Program) which flew in the mid-1970s.\n\n== Background ==\nAt the height of the [[Cold War]] in the mid-1950s, the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was particularly interested in reconnaissance from space, as there was intense interest in the [[Soviet Union]]'s military and industrial capabilities. In July 1957\u2014before anyone had flown in space\u2014the USAF [[Wright Air Development Center]] had published a paper the employment of space vehicles that considered the development of a space station equipped with telescopes and other observation devices.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=2}} The launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the first [[satellite]], by the Soviet Union on October 4, 1957, came as a profound shock to the American public, which had complacently assumed American technical superiority, and sparked a search for initiatives to counter its psychological impact.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}}  Sputnik had a silver lining: no government protested Sputnik's overflying their territory, thereby tacitly acknowledging the legality of satellites. While there was a big difference between the innocuous Sputnik and a spy satellite, it made it all that much harder for the Soviets to object to one.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=11-12}}\n\nOn August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}} This left the USAF with a small number of programs with a direct military impact.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=4}} One was a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} The USAF remained interested in space, and March 1959, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[Thomas D. White]] asked the USAF Director of Development Planning to prepare a long-range plan for a USAF space program. One project identified in the resulting document was a \"manned orbital laboratory\".{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}}\n\nThe USAF [[Air Research and Development Command]] (ARDC) issued a request to the [[Aeronautical Systems Division]] (ASD) at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] on 1 September 1959 for a formal study to be conducted of a military test space station (MTSS). The ASD asked components of the ARDC for suggestions as to what sort of experiments would be suitable for an MTSS, and 125 proposals were received. Twelve contractors made proposals. A [[request for proposal]] (RFP) was then issued on 19 February 1960, and twelve firms responded. On 15 August, [[General Electric]], [[Lockheed Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]], [[McDonnell Aircraft]], and [[General Dynamics]] were awarded $574,999 for a study of the MTSS.{{sfn|Berger|2015|p=5}} Their preliminary reports were submitted in January 1961, and final reports were received by July. With these in hand, on 16 August 1961 the USAF submitted a request for $5 million in funding for space station studies in [[fiscal year]] 1963, but no funding was forthcoming.{{sfn|Berger|2015|pp=6-8}}\n\nOriginally Dyna-Soar was to be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket, but in the new [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]]ordered that Dyna-Soar be launched into orbit.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} In a 22 February memorandum to the  [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]], McNamara gave tacit approval for the development of a space station using Dyna-Soar or NASA's [[Gemini spacecraft]]. With this in hand, the USAF staff and the [[Air Force Systems Command]] (AFSC) began planning for a space station, which was now known as a [[Manned Orbital Development System|military orbital development system]] (MODS). By the end of May, a a proposed system package plan (PSPP) had been drawn up for MODS, which was designated Program 287. MODS consisted of a space station, a spacecraft (a modified  that became known as [[Blue Gemini]]) and a [[Titan III]] launch vehicle.

A hatch installed in the Gemini's [[heat shield]]\u2014intended to provide access to the MOL during crewed operations\u2014was tested during the capsule's reentry.

This camera system was codenamed ''Dorian'' and given the designation [[KH-10 Dorian|KH-10]]. The project was canceled on 10 June 1969 before any operational flights occurred.\n\nThe KH-10 intended for the MOL program was succeeded by the uncrewed [[KH-11 Kennan]], which launched in 1976 as the Soviet Union was winding down its [[Almaz|crewed space reconnaissance program]].  The KH-11 is said to have achieved the goal of {{convert|3|in|mm|0|adj=on}} imaging [[Optical resolution|resolution]] and introduced video transmission of images back to Earth.\n\n==Cancellation==\nA few months after MOL development began, the program also began developing an unmanned version, replacing the crew compartment with several film reentry vehicles. MOL program director [[Bernard Schriever]] commissioned a report in May 1966 examining humans' usefulness on the station. The report concluded that they would be useful in several ways, but implied that the program would always need to justify the cost and difficulty of manned MOL versus the unmanned version.<ref name=\"day20190319\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3456/1 |title=The Space Review: The measure of a man: Evaluating the role of astronauts in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory program (part 1) |last=Day |first=Dwayne A. |date=2018-03-19 |website=The Space Review |access-date=2019-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMOL was canceled on 10 June 1969 with the first projected flight three years away. Between 1965 and 1969, MOL's projected cost rose from $1.5 billion to $3 billion while the Vietnam War took larger portions of the defense budget. While Defense Secretary [[Melvin R. Laird]] and the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] strongly supported the station, [[Central Intelligence Agency]] head [[Richard Helms]] did not support the project because he feared that the death of a MOL astronaut might ground launches and thus damage the nation's satellite reconnaissance program. President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Henry Kissinger]] agreed to the [[Bureau of the Budget]]'s proposal to cancel MOL,{{sfn|Heppenheimer|1998|pp=204\u2013205}} as it was determined the capabilities of uncrewed spy satellites met or exceeded the capabilities of crewed MOL missions.\n\nAl Crews said in 2015 that when he saw high-resolution photographs from [[KH-8 Gambit 3]], first launched a few months after the 1966 report, he knew that manned MOL would be canceled. NASA offered those MOL astronauts 35 years of age and under the opportunity to transfer to its astronaut program. Seven of the 14 astronauts were 35 or younger and took the offer, becoming [[NASA Astronaut Group 7]]: Future [[NASA Administrator]] [[Richard H. Truly]], [[Karol J. Bobko]], [[Robert Crippen]], [[C.

Aaronson''', was a British [[poetry|poet]] and a lecturer in [[economics]]. As a young man, he belonged to a group of Jewish friends who are today known as the [[Whitechapel Boys]], many of whom later achieved fame as writers and artists. Though less radical in his use of language, he has been compared to his more renowned Whitechapel friend, [[Isaac Rosenberg]], in terms of [[diction]] and verbal energy. Aaronson's poetry is characterised more as [[Georgian Poetry|'post-Georgian']] than [[Literary modernism|modernistic]], and reviewers have since been able to trace influences back to both the English poet [[John Keats]], and Hebrew poets such as [[Shaul Tchernichovsky]] and [[Zalman Shneur]].\n\nAaronson lived most of his life in London and spent much of his working life as a [[lecturer]] in economics at the [[City of London College]]. In his twenties, he converted to Christianity and a large part of his poetry focused on his conversion and spiritual identity as a Jew and an [[English people|Englishman]]. In total, he published three collections of poetry: ''Christ in the Synagogue'' (1930), ''Poems'' (1933), and ''The Homeward Journey and Other Poems'' (1946). Although he did not achieve widespread recognition, Aaronson gained a [[cult following]] of dedicated readers. Upon retiring from teaching, he moved to [[Harpenden, Hertfordshire|Harpenden]], [[Hertfordshire]], where he died from heart failure and [[coronary heart disease]] on 9 December 1966. His poetry was not widely publicised, and he left many unpublished poems at his death.\n\n==Life and career==\nAaronson was born on the 24th of December 1894{{refn|group=note|''The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History'', and some other sources, lists Aaronson's date of birth as 24 December 1894, while the later and more comprehensive entry in the ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' gives it as 18 February 1895.}} at 34 Great Pearl Street, [[Spitalfields]] in the [[East End of London]] to poor [[Orthodox Jewish]] parents who had immigrated from [[Vilna Governorate|Vilna]] in the [[Pale of Settlement]] in Eastern Europe.<ref name=\"ONDB\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Baker |first=William |title=Aaronson, Lazarus (1895\u20131966)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/105000 |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=May 2015 |accessdate=4 June 2015 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/105000 |format={{ODNBsub}}|isbn=978-0-19-861411-1 }}</ref><ref name=\"Robson\">{{cite journal |last=Robson |first=Jeremy |year=1966 |title=A Survey of Anglo-Jewish Poetry |journal=[[Jewish Quarterly]]  |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=5\u201323 |doi=10.1080/0449010X.1966.10706502|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0449010X.1966.10706502|doi-broken-date=2020-03-26 }}</ref>  His father was Louis Aaronson, a bootmaker, and his mother was Sarah Aaronson, ''n\u00e9e'' Kowalski.

The rest of the family followed in 1912, except for 17-year old Lazarus who remained in London.

In his twenties, he converted to Christianity and a large part of his poetry focused on his conversion and spiritual identity as a Jew and an [[English people|Englishman]]. In total, he published three collections of poetry: ''Christ in the Synagogue'' (1930), ''Poems'' (1933), and ''The Homeward Journey and Other Poems'' (1946).

Hodges graduated from the [[Perkins School of Theology]] at [[Southern Methodist University]] in 1963, and the [[University of Arkansas School of Law]] in 1967.  In law school he was a classmate of [[Jim Guy Tucker]], and also served as editor-in-chief of the Arkansas Law Review. He married the former Lindley Williams, also of Newport, and they are the parents of two children.\n\nDuring his career, in addition to practicing law Hodges was a farmer, Methodist lay minister, and hospital and prison chaplain.  He served as city attorney for Newport and deputy prosecuting attorney for [[Jackson County, Arkansas]] from 1967 to 1974.\n\nHodges worked for incumbent Senator [[John Little McClellan]]\u2019s campaign for senator in 1972.  McClellan defeated [[David Pryor]] in the Democratic primary, and went on to win the general election.  In 1974 Hodges coordinated Pryor's successful gubernatorial race in eastern Arkansas.\n\nIn 1975 Hodges was legislative secretary for Governor Pryor.  From 1974 to 1976 he was chairman of the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, and he was a member of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission from 1976 to 1977.\n\nIn 1977 Senator [[John Little McClellan]] died in office. Pryor appointed Hodges to serve out the remainder of McClellan's term. His time in the Senate was most noted for his stands in favor of the Panama Canal treaties and against tuition tax credits for parents of private school students. Under Arkansas law, an appointed Senator was not allowed to run for a full term. Hodges stepped down at the end of his term in 1979, and was replaced by Governor Pryor, who won the 1978 election for a full term.\n\nHodges returned to Newport after his Senate term.

Such networks can be via the [[track (rail transport)|tracks]] of either a single railroad or over those owned or controlled by multiple [[railway company|railway companies]] along a continuous route. Although Europe is crisscrossed by railways, the railroads within Europe are usually not considered transcontinental, with the possible exception of the historic [[Orient Express]].\nTranscontinental railroads helped open up unpopulated interior regions of continents to exploration and settlement that would not otherwise have been feasible. In many cases they also formed the backbones of cross-country passenger and freight transportation networks.\n\n==Central America (inter-oceanic lines)==\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|Panama Canal Railway}}\n[[File:Panama Canal Railway.svg|thumb|<center>Current Panama Canal Railway line {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Panama Canal Railway|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\nThe first railroad to directly connect two oceans (although not by crossing a broad \"continental\" land mass<ref>Otis, F.N.,''\"Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad\"'' (Harper & Bros., New York, 1861), p. 12</ref>) was the [[Panama Railway|Panama Rail Road]]. Opened in 1855, this {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} line was designated instead as an \"inter-oceanic\"<ref>''\"A Great Enterprise\"'' The Portland (Maine) ''Transcript'' [Newspaper], February 17, 1855.</ref> railroad crossing [[Central America]] at its narrowest point, the [[Isthmus of Panama]], when that area was still part of [[Colombia]]. (Panama [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|split off from Colombia]] in 1903 and became the independent nation of [[Panama]]). By spanning the isthmus, the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Given the tropical [[rain forest]] environment, the terrain, and diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], its completion was a considerable engineering challenge. The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May, 1850, cost eight million dollars, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from \"every quarter of the globe.\"<ref>Otis, p. 35</ref>\n\nThis railway was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States' [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West]] Coasts. This need was mainly triggered by the [[California Gold Rush]]. Over the years the railway played a key role in the construction and the subsequent operation of the [[Panama Canal]], due to its proximity to the canal. Currently, the railway operates under the private administration of the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and its upgraded capacity complements the cargo traffic through the Panama Canal.\n\n===Guatemala===\n[[File:Guatemala railways.svg|thumb|<center>Guatemala railway (defunct) {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Guatemala railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Guatemala}}\nA second Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1908 as a connection between [[Puerto San Jos\u00e9]] and [[Puerto Barrios]] in Guatemala, but ceased passenger service to Puerto San Jos\u00e9 in 1989.\n\n===Costa Rica===\n[[File:Costarice railway.svg|thumb|<center>Costa Rica railway network {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Costarica railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Costa Rica}}\nA third Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1910 as a connection between [[Puntarenas]] and [[Lim\u00f3n]] in {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.

Mendoza has an active connection to [[Buenos Aires]]. The old Transandino began in 1910 and ceased passenger service in 1978 and freight 4 years later. Technically a complete transcontinental link exists from [[Arica, Chile]], to [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], to Buenos Aires, but this trans-Andean crossing is for freight only.\n\nOn December 6, 2017 the Brazilian President Michel Temer and his Bolivian counterpart Morales signed an agreement for an Atlantic - Pacific railway. The construction will start in 2019 and will be finished in 2024. The new railway is planned to be 3750&nbsp;km in length. There are two possible tracks in discussion: Both have an Atlantic end in [[Santos, Brazil]] but the Pacific ends are in [[Ilo, Peru]] and [[Matarani, Peru]].<ref>http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/transkontinentale-bahnstrecke-brasilien-und-bolivien-gehen-jahrhundertprojekt-an-15327521.html</ref>\n\nAnother longer Transcontinental freight-only railroad linking [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] is under development.\n\n==Eurasia==\n{{Details|Eurasian Land Bridge}}\n* The first transcontinental railroad in Europe, that connected the [[North Sea]] or the [[English Channel]] with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], was a series of lines that included the [[Paris\u2013Marseille railway]], in service 1856. Multiple railways north of Paris were in operation at that time, such as [[Paris\u2013Lille railway]] and [[Paris\u2013Le Havre railway]].\n* The second connection between the seas of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines finalized in 1857 with the [[Austrian Southern Railway]], [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Trieste]]. There were before that railroad connections [[Hamburg]]\u2013[[Berlin]]\u2013[[Wroclaw]]\u2013[[Vienna]] (including [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway]], [[Berlin\u2013Wroc\u0142aw railway]], [[Upper Silesian Railway]] and [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]]). The Baltic Sea was also connected through the [[L\u00fcbeck\u2013L\u00fcneburg railway]].\n* The first [[Eurasia]]n transcontinental railroad was the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] (with connecting lines in Europe), completed in 1905 which connects [[Moscow]] with [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific]] coast. There are two connections from this line to [[China]]. It is the world's longest rail line at {{convert|9,289|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. This line connects the European railroad system with China, [[Mongolia]] and [[Korea]]. Since the former Soviet countries and Mongolia use a [[Russian gauge|broader gauge]], a [[break of gauge]] is necessary either at the eastern frontiers of [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] or the Chinese border. In spite of this there are through services of passenger trains between Moscow and Beijing or through coaches from Berlin to Novosibirsk. Almost every major town along the Trans-Siberian railway has its own return service to Moscow.\n* A second rail line connects Istanbul in Turkey with [[China]] via [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. This route imposes a [[break of gauge]] at the Iranian border with Turkmenistan and at the Chinese border. En route there is a [[train ferry]] in eastern Turkey across [[Lake Van]]. The European and Asian parts of Istanbul was linked 2019 linked by the [[Marmaray Tunnel|Marmaray]] [[undersea tunnel]], before that by train ferry. There is no through service of passenger trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge connection was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in [[Qazaqstan Temir Zholy|Kazakhstan]]. A decision to make the internal railways of Afghanistan {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge potentially opens up a new standard gauge route to China, since China abuts this country.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] | month=October | year=2010 | page=63 (with map)</ref>\n\n==Asia==\n* The [[Trans-Asian Railway]] is a project to link [[Singapore]] to [[Istanbul]] and is to a large degree complete with missing pieces primarily in [[Myanmar]]. The project has also linking corridors to [[China]], the central Asian states, and [[Russia]]. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, {{RailGauge|1435mm}}, {{RailGauge|1676mm}}, {{RailGauge|1520mm}} and {{RailGauge|1000mm}}, though this problem may be lessened with the use of [[variable gauge axle]] systems such as the [[SUW 2000]].\n* The TransKazakhstan Trunk Railways project by [[Kazakhstan Temir Zholy]] will connect [[China]] and Europe with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Construction is set to start in 2006. Initially the line will go to western [[Kazakhstan]], south through [[Turkmenistan]] to [[Iran]], then to [[Turkey]] and Europe. A shorter to-be-constructed {{RailGauge|1435mm}} link from Kazakhstan is considered going through Russia and either [[Belarus]] or [[Ukraine]].\n* The [[Baghdad Railway]] connects Istanbul with Baghdad and finally Basra, a sea port at the Persian Gulf. When its construction started in the 1880s it was in those times a Transcontinental Railroad.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} {{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Australia==\n\n===East-West===\n* The first [[Trans-Australian Railway]] was completed in 1917, between [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], and crosses the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. This line completed the link between the mainland state capitals of [[Brisbane]] then [[Sydney]] via [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]] to the western state capital of [[Perth]]. This route suffered from a number of [[break of gauge|breaks-of-gauge]], using {{RailGauge|1435mm}} twice, {{RailGauge|1600mm}} once, and {{RailGauge|1067mm}} thrice, with five breaks-of-gauge in all.\n\nThe Trans-Australian Railway was the first route operated by the Federal Government.\n\nIn the 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s steps were taken to rationalise the gauge chaos and connect the mainland capital cities mentioned above with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Since 1970, when the direct standard gauge line across the country was completed, the passenger train on the [[Sydney]] to [[Perth]] line has been called the ''[[Indian Pacific]]''.\n\nThe proposed [[Iron Boomerang]] would connect iron in the [[Pilbara]] with coal in [[Queensland]], so achieving loaded operations in both directions.\n\n===North-South===\n* A {{convert|820|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} land grant railway from [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] to [[Point Parker]] on the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], with branches, was proposed in the 1880s.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11563661?searchTerm=Charleville+Point+Parker#pstart265733 28 Dec 1882 \u2013 THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY.

(ARHS Digest September 2006). The standard gauge [[Inland Railway]] would ultimately extend from [[Melbourne]] to [[Cairns]].\n* Starting in 1867, Queensland built several railways going inland from several ports in a westerly direction. From the 1920s, steps were taken to connect these lines by the North-South [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast line]] from [[Brisbane]] to [[Cairns]].\n\n==Africa==\n\n===East-West===\n* There are several ways to cross [[Africa]] transcontinentally by connecting west-east railroads. One is the [[Benguela railway]] that was completed in 1929. It starts in [[Lobito]], [[Angola]] and connects through [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] to the [[Zambia railways]] system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: [[Dar es Salaam]] in Tanzania through the [[TAZARA]], and, through Zimbabwe, [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] and [[Maputo]] in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War has made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west-east corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in [[Namibia]], either [[Walvis Bay]] or [[Luderitz]] to the [[South Africa]]n rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] ( i.e. [[Durban]], [[Maputo]]).\n* A 1015&nbsp;km gap in the east-west line between [[Kinshasa]] and [[Ilebo]] filled by riverboats could be plugged with a new railway.<ref>[http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/afdb-grants-us-7-45-million-to-drc-and-congo-for-transport-system-improvement-project-study-3384/ Afdb.org]</ref>\n* There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including [[TransAfricaRail]].\n* In 2010 a [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway|proposal]] surfaced to link [[Dakar]] to [[Port Sudan]]. Thirteen countries are on the main route, while another six would be served by branches.\n\n===North-South===\n* A North-South transcontinental railroad had been proposed by [[Cecil Rhodes]]: the [[Cape-Cairo railway]]. This system was seen as the backbone for the African possessions of the [[British Empire]], and was not completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from [[Algiers]] or [[Dakar]] to [[Abidjan]] was abandoned after the [[Fashoda incident]]. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges.\n* An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways.\n* [[Transport in Libya#Railways|Libya]] has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to [[Transport in Nigeria#Railways|Nigeria]] which would connect with the proposed [[AfricaRail]] network.\n\n===African Union of Railways===\n* The [[African Union of Railways]] has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n* [[Cosmopolitan Railway]]\n* [[Transmountain railroad]]\n* [[Intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Glenn Williamson, ''Iron Muse: Photographing the Transcontinental Railroad.''

The first of these, the {{convert|1928|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[First Transcontinental Railroad|\"Pacific Railroad\"]], was built by the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to link the San Francisco Bay at [[Alameda, California]], with the nation's existing eastern railroad network at [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]/[[Omaha, Nebraska]], thereby creating the world's first transcontinental railroad when it opened in 1869. Its construction was made possible by the US government under [[Pacific Railroad Acts|Pacific Railroad Acts of 1862, 1864, and 1867]].\n\n====Transcontinental railroad====\n{{main|First Transcontinental Railroad}}\n\nThe world's [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was built between 1863 and 1869 to join the eastern and western halves of the United States. Begun just before the [[American Civil War]], its construction was considered to be one of the greatest American technological feats of the 19th century. Known as the \"Pacific Railroad\" when it opened, this served as a vital link for trade, commerce, and travel and opened up vast regions of the North American heartland for settlement. Shipping and commerce could thrive away from navigable watercourses for the first time since the beginning of the nation. Much of this route, especially on the Sierra grade west of Reno, Nevada, is currently used by Amtrak's ''[[California Zephyr]]'', although many parts have been rerouted.<ref>{{cite book| title=Riding the Transcontinental Rails: Overland Travel on the Pacific Railroad 1865\u20131881| author=Cooper, Bruce Clement| year=2005| publisher=Philadelphia: Polyglot Press, 445 pages| isbn=1411599934}} p. 1-15</ref>\n\nThe transcontinental railroad provided fast, safe, and cheap travel. The fare for a one-week trip from Omaha to San Francisco on an emigrant sleeping car was about $65 for an adult. It replaced most of the far slower and more hazardous [[stagecoach]] lines and [[wagon train]]s. The number of emigrants taking the [[Oregon Trail|Oregon and California Trail]]s declined dramatically.  The sale of the railroad land grant lands and the transport provided for timber and crops led to the rapid settling of the \"Great American Desert\".<ref>Richard White, '' Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America'' (2012)</ref>\n\nThe Union Pacific recruited laborers from Army veterans and [[Irish people|Irish]] immigrants, while most of the engineers were ex-Army men who had learned their trade keeping the trains running during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Collins|first=R.M.|title=Irish Gandy Dancer: A tale of building the Transcontinental Railroad|year=2010|publisher=Create Space|location=Seattle|isbn=978-1-4528-2631-8|pages=198}}</ref>\n\nThe Central Pacific Railroad faced a labor shortage in the more sparsely settled West. It recruited [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] laborers in China, who did prodigious work building the line over and through the Sierra Nevada mountains and then across [[Nevada]] to their meeting in northern Utah.\n* One motive for the [[Gadsden Purchase]] of land from Mexico in 1853 was to obtain suitable terrain for a southern transcontinental railroad, as the southern portion of the [[Mexican Cession]] was too mountainous. The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] was completed in 1881.\n* The [[Pacific Railway Act|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]] (based on an earlier bill in 1856) authorized land grants for new lines that would \"aid in the construction of a railroad and [[telegraph]] line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean\".<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html \"An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes] 12 Stat. 489, July 1, 1862</ref>\n* The rails of the \"[[First Transcontinental Railroad]]\" were joined on May 10, 1869, with the ceremonial driving of the [[golden spike|\"Last Spike\"]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], after track was laid over a {{convert|1,756|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} gap between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Omaha, Nebraska]]/[[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]<ref>[http://cprr.org/Museum/Lincoln_1864.html Executive Order of Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, Fixing the Point of Commencement of the Pacific Railroad at Council Bluffs, Iowa, March 7, 1864] 38th Congress, 1st Session SENATE Ex.

In central [[Utah]], the D&RG acquired a number of independent [[narrow gauge]] companies, which were incorporated into the first (1881-1889) [[Utah Division (D&RGW)|Denver and Rio Grande Western Railway]] (D&RGW). Tracks were extended north through [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], while simultaneously building south and eastward toward Grand Junction. The D&RG and the D&RGW were linked on March 30, 1883, the extension to [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] (where it met the Central Pacific) was completed on May 14, 1883, and through traffic between Denver and Ogden began a few days later. The [[break of gauge]] made direct interchange of [[rolling stock]] with [[standard gauge]] railroads at both ends of this [[bridge line]] impossible for several years. The D&RG in 1887 began rebuilding its mainline in standard gauge, including a new route and tunnel at [[Tennessee Pass (Colorado)|Tennessee Pass]]. The first D&RGW was reincorporated as the [[Utah Division (D&RGW)|Rio Grande Western]] (RGW) in June 1889 and immediately began the conversion of track gauge. Standard gauge operations linking Ogden and Denver were completed on November 15, 1890.<ref name=\"Beebe_1963\">[[Lucius Beebe|Beebe, Lucius]] and [[Charles Clegg|Clegg, Charles]], \u201cRio Grande, Mainline of the Rockies\u201d, Howell-North Books 1962.</ref>\n* The [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]] completed its route connecting the AT&SF at [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], via [[Flagstaff, Arizona]], to the Southern Pacific at [[Needles, California]], on August 9, 1883. The SP line into Los Angeles was leased by the A&P in 1884 (and purchased in 1911); this gave the AT&SF (the A&P's parent company) a direct route into [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"Myrick_1990\" /> This route now forms the western portion of [[BNSF]]'s [[Southern Transcon]].\n* The [[Northern Pacific Railway]] (NP) completed the fifth independent transcontinental railroad on August 22, 1883, linking [[Chicago]] with [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]]. The [[Northern Pacific Railroad Completion Site, 1883|Completion Ceremony]] was held on September 8, 1883, with former [[U.S. President]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] contributing to driving the Final Spike.\n* The [[California Southern Railroad]] (chartered January 10, 1882) was completed from National City on San Diego Bay via Temecula Ca\u00f1on to Colton and San Bernardino in September, 1883, and extended through the Cajon Pass to Barstow, a junction of the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad]], in November, 1885. In September, 1885, the line of the Southern Pacific from Colton to Los Angeles, a distance of 58 miles, had been leased by the California Central with equal rights and privileges thus allowing the Santa Fe's Transcontinental route to be completed by the connection with the California Southern and A&PRR. The SP grade was used until the completion of the California Central's own line between San Bernardino and Los Angeles in June, 1887, a distance of 62.84 miles, which was part of the old Los Angeles and San Gabriel Valley Railroad, which had been acquired by purchase. In August, 1888, the California Central completed its Coast Division south from Los Angeles to a junction with the California Southern Railroad near Oceanside, a distance of 80.90 miles, and these two divisions comprised the main line of the California Central, forming, in connection with the California Southern, a direct line between Southern California and the East by way of the Atlantic and Pacific and Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroads.<ref>\"Eleventh Annual Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of California for the year ending December 31, 1890\" Sacramento: California State Office, J.D.

Hill]] in 1893; it stretched from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]].\n* The [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific]] reached [[Santa Rosa, New Mexico]], from the east in late 1901, shortly before the [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway|El Paso & Northeastern]] arrived from the southwest. The two were connected on February 1, 1902, thus forming an additional link between the Midwest and southern California.<ref name=\"Myrick_1990\" /> Through passenger service was provided by the ''[[Golden State Limited]]'' (Chicago\u2014Kansas City\u2014Tucumcari\u2014El Paso\u2014Los Angeles) jointly operated by the Rock Island and the Southern Pacific (EP&NE's successor) from 1902 to 1968.\n* The [[San Pedro, Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad]] completed its line connecting Los Angeles through [[Las Vegas]] to Salt Lake City on May 1, 1905. Through passenger service from Chicago to Los Angeles was provided by Union Pacific's ''[[Los Angeles Limited]]'' from 1905 to 1954, and the ''[[City of Los Angeles (train)|City of Los Angeles]]'' from 1936 to 1971.\n* The [[Western Pacific Railway]] (WP), financed by the Denver & Rio Grande on behalf of the [[Gould transcontinental system|Gould System]], completed its new line from Oakland to Ogden in 1909, in direct competition with the Southern Pacific\u2019s existing route. Through passenger service (Oakland-Salt Lake City-Denver-Chicago) was provided by the ''[[Exposition Flyer]]'' 1939 to 1949 and its successor, the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' 1949 to 1970, both jointly operated by the WP, the [[D&RGW]] and the [[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy]].\n* In 1909, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul (or [[Milwaukee Road]]) completed a privately built Pacific extension to Seattle. On completion, the line was renamed the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific]]. Although the Pacific Extension was privately funded, predecessor roads did benefit from the [[Pacific Railway Acts|federal land grant]] act, so it cannot be said to have been built without federal aid.\n* [[John D. Spreckels]] completed his privately funded [[San Diego and Arizona Railway]] in 1919, thereby creating a direct link (via connection with the Southern Pacific lines) between [[San Diego, California]] and the [[Eastern United States]]. The railroad stretched {{convert|148|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} from San Diego to [[Calexico, California]], of which {{convert|44|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} were south of the border in [[Mexico]].\n* In 1993, [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' daily railroad train was extended eastward to [[Miami, Florida]], later rerouted to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], making it the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental [[passenger train]] route in the United States to be operated by a single company. [[Hurricane Katrina]] cut this rail route in [[Louisiana]] in 2005. The train now runs from Los Angeles to New Orleans.\n\n====The Gould System====\n{{main|Gould transcontinental system}}\n\n[[George J. Gould]] attempted to assemble a truly transcontinental system in the 1900s. The line from [[San Francisco, California]], to [[Toledo, Ohio]], was completed in 1909, consisting of the [[Western Pacific Railway]], [[Denver and Rio Grande Railroad]], [[Missouri Pacific Railroad]], and [[Wabash Railroad]]. Beyond Toledo, the planned route would have used the [[Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1899-1916)|Wheeling and Lake Erie Railroad (1900)]], [[Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway]], [[Little Kanawha Railroad]], [[West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway]], [[Western Maryland Railroad]], and [[Philadelphia and Western Railway]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} but the [[Panic of 1907]] strangled the plans before the Little Kanawha section in [[West Virginia]] could be finished. The [[Alphabet Route]] was completed in 1931, providing the portion of this line east of the [[Mississippi River]]. With the merging of the railroads, only the Union Pacific Railroad and the [[BNSF Railway]] remain to carry the entire route.\n\n===Canada===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Culture of Saskatchewan]] -->\n[[Image:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada.jpg|thumb|[[Lord Strathcona]] driving the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|\"Last Spike\"]] of [[Canada]]'s first transcontinental railroad, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], in 1885]]\n\nThe completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway with the driving of the [[Last Spike (Canadian Pacific Railway)|Last Spike]] at [[Craigellachie, British Columbia]], on November 7, 1885, is an important milestone in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]]. Between 1881 and 1885, the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) completed a line that spanned from the port of Montreal to the Pacific coast, fulfilling a condition of [[British Columbia]]'s 1871 entry into the [[Canadian Confederation]]. The City of [[Vancouver]], incorporated in 1886, was designated the western terminus of the line. The CPR became the first transcontinental railway company in North America in 1889 after its [[International Railway of Maine]] opened, connecting CPR to the Atlantic coast.\n\nThe construction of a transcontinental railway strengthened the connection of British Columbia and the [[Northwest Territories]] to [[Canada]] they had recently joined, and acted as a bulwark against potential incursions by the United States.\n\nSubsequently, two other transcontinental lines were built in Canada: the [[Canadian Northern Railway]] (CNoR) opened another line to the Pacific in 1912, and the combined [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] (GTPR)/[[National Transcontinental Railway]] (NTR) system opened in 1917 following the completion of the [[Quebec Bridge]], although its line to the Pacific opened in 1914. The CNoR, GTPR, and NTR were [[nationalized]] to form the [[Canadian National Railway]], which currently is now Canada's largest transcontinental railway, with lines running all the way from the Pacific Coast to the Atlantic Coast.\n\n==Central America (inter-oceanic lines)==\n\n===Panama===\n{{Main|Panama Canal Railway}}\n[[File:Panama Canal Railway.svg|thumb|<center>Current Panama Canal Railway line {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Panama Canal Railway|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\nThe first railroad to directly connect two oceans (although not by crossing a broad \"continental\" land mass<ref>Otis, F.N.,''\"Illustrated History of the Panama Railroad\"'' (Harper & Bros., New York, 1861), p. 12</ref>) was the [[Panama Railway|Panama Rail Road]]. Opened in 1855, this {{convert|48|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} line was designated instead as an \"inter-oceanic\"<ref>''\"A Great Enterprise\"'' The Portland (Maine) ''Transcript'' [Newspaper], February 17, 1855.</ref> railroad crossing [[Central America]] at its narrowest point, the [[Isthmus of Panama]], when that area was still part of [[Colombia]]. (Panama [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|split off from Colombia]] in 1903 and became the independent nation of [[Panama]]). By spanning the isthmus, the line thus became the first railroad to completely cross any part of the Americas and physically connect ports on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. Given the tropical [[rain forest]] environment, the terrain, and diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[cholera]], its completion was a considerable engineering challenge. The construction took five years after ground was first broken for the line in May, 1850, cost eight million dollars, and required more than seven thousand workers drawn from \"every quarter of the globe.\"<ref>Otis, p. 35</ref>\n\nThis railway was built to provide a shorter and more secure path between the United States' [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West]] Coasts. This need was mainly triggered by the [[California Gold Rush]]. Over the years the railway played a key role in the construction and the subsequent operation of the [[Panama Canal]], due to its proximity to the canal. Currently, the railway operates under the private administration of the Panama Canal Railroad Company, and its upgraded capacity complements the cargo traffic through the Panama Canal.\n\n===Guatemala===\n[[File:Guatemala railways.svg|thumb|<center>Guatemala railway (defunct) {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Guatemala railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Guatemala}}\nA second Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1908 as a connection between [[Puerto San Jos\u00e9]] and [[Puerto Barrios]] in Guatemala, but ceased passenger service to Puerto San Jos\u00e9 in 1989.\n\n===Costa Rica===\n[[File:Costarice railway.svg|thumb|<center>Costa Rica railway network {{nowrap|([[ShareMap:public/Costarica railways|interactive version]])}}</center>]]\n{{Main|Rail transport in Costa Rica}}\nA third Central American inter-oceanic railroad began operation in 1910 as a connection between [[Puntarenas]] and [[Lim\u00f3n]] in {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.

Mendoza has an active connection to [[Buenos Aires]]. The old Transandino began in 1910 and ceased passenger service in 1978 and freight 4 years later. Technically a complete transcontinental link exists from [[Arica, Chile]], to [[La Paz]], [[Bolivia]], to Buenos Aires, but this trans-Andean crossing is for freight only.\n\nOn December 6, 2017 the Brazilian President Michel Temer and his Bolivian counterpart Morales signed an agreement for an Atlantic - Pacific railway. The construction will start in 2019 and will be finished in 2024. The new railway is planned to be 3750&nbsp;km in length. There are two possible tracks in discussion: Both have an Atlantic end in [[Santos, Brazil]] but the Pacific ends are in [[Ilo, Peru]] and [[Matarani, Peru]].<ref>http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/transkontinentale-bahnstrecke-brasilien-und-bolivien-gehen-jahrhundertprojekt-an-15327521.html</ref>\n\nAnother longer Transcontinental freight-only railroad linking [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] is under development.\n\n==Eurasia==\n{{Details|Eurasian Land Bridge}}\n* The first transcontinental railroad in Europe, that connected the [[North Sea]] or the [[English Channel]] with the [[Mediterranean Sea]], was a series of lines that included the [[Paris\u2013Marseille railway]], in service 1856. Multiple railways north of Paris were in operation at that time, such as [[Paris\u2013Lille railway]] and [[Paris\u2013Le Havre railway]].\n* The second connection between the seas of Northern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea, was a series of lines finalized in 1857 with the [[Austrian Southern Railway]], [[Vienna]]\u2013[[Trieste]]. There were before that railroad connections [[Hamburg]]\u2013[[Berlin]]\u2013[[Wroclaw]]\u2013[[Vienna]] (including [[Berlin\u2013Hamburg Railway]], [[Berlin\u2013Wroc\u0142aw railway]], [[Upper Silesian Railway]] and [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway]]). The Baltic Sea was also connected through the [[L\u00fcbeck\u2013L\u00fcneburg railway]].\n* The first [[Eurasia]]n transcontinental railroad was the [[Trans-Siberian railway]] (with connecting lines in Europe), completed in 1905 which connects [[Moscow]] with [[Vladivostok]] on the [[Pacific]] coast. There are two connections from this line to [[China]]. It is the world's longest rail line at {{convert|9,289|km|mi|abbr=on}} long. This line connects the European railroad system with China, [[Mongolia]] and [[Korea]]. Since the former Soviet countries and Mongolia use a [[Russian gauge|broader gauge]], a [[break of gauge]] is necessary either at the eastern frontiers of [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]] or the Chinese border. In spite of this there are through services of passenger trains between Moscow and Beijing or through coaches from Berlin to Novosibirsk. Almost every major town along the Trans-Siberian railway has its own return service to Moscow.\n* A second rail line connects Istanbul in Turkey with [[China]] via [[Iran]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kazakhstan]]. This route imposes a [[break of gauge]] at the Iranian border with Turkmenistan and at the Chinese border. En route there is a [[train ferry]] in eastern Turkey across [[Lake Van]]. The European and Asian parts of Istanbul was linked 2019 linked by the [[Marmaray Tunnel|Marmaray]] [[undersea tunnel]], before that by train ferry. There is no through service of passenger trains on the entire line. A uniform gauge connection was proposed in 2006, commencing with new construction in [[Qazaqstan Temir Zholy|Kazakhstan]]. A decision to make the internal railways of Afghanistan {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge potentially opens up a new standard gauge route to China, since China abuts this country.<ref>[[Railway Gazette International]] | month=October | year=2010 | page=63 (with map)</ref>\n\n==Asia==\n* The [[Trans-Asian Railway]] is a project to link [[Singapore]] to [[Istanbul]] and is to a large degree complete with missing pieces primarily in [[Myanmar]]. The project has also linking corridors to [[China]], the central Asian states, and [[Russia]]. This transcontinental line unfortunately uses a number of different gauges, {{RailGauge|1435mm}}, {{RailGauge|1676mm}}, {{RailGauge|1520mm}} and {{RailGauge|1000mm}}, though this problem may be lessened with the use of [[variable gauge axle]] systems such as the [[SUW 2000]].\n* The TransKazakhstan Trunk Railways project by [[Kazakhstan Temir Zholy]] will connect [[China]] and Europe with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Construction is set to start in 2006. Initially the line will go to western [[Kazakhstan]], south through [[Turkmenistan]] to [[Iran]], then to [[Turkey]] and Europe. A shorter to-be-constructed {{RailGauge|1435mm}} link from Kazakhstan is considered going through Russia and either [[Belarus]] or [[Ukraine]].\n* The [[Baghdad Railway]] connects Istanbul with Baghdad and finally Basra, a sea port at the Persian Gulf. When its construction started in the 1880s it was in those times a Transcontinental Railroad.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} {{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Australia==\n\n===East-West===\n* The first [[Trans-Australian Railway]] was completed in 1917, between [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] and [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], and crosses the [[Nullarbor Plain]]. This line completed the link between the mainland state capitals of [[Brisbane]] then [[Sydney]] via [[Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide]] to the western state capital of [[Perth]]. This route suffered from a number of [[break of gauge|breaks-of-gauge]], using {{RailGauge|1435mm}} twice, {{RailGauge|1600mm}} once, and {{RailGauge|1067mm}} thrice, with five breaks-of-gauge in all.\n\nThe Trans-Australian Railway was the first route operated by the Federal Government.\n\nIn the 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s steps were taken to rationalise the gauge chaos and connect the mainland capital cities mentioned above with standard gauge {{RailGauge|1435mm}}. Since 1970, when the direct standard gauge line across the country was completed, the passenger train on the [[Sydney]] to [[Perth]] line has been called the ''[[Indian Pacific]]''.\n\nThe proposed [[Iron Boomerang]] would connect iron in the [[Pilbara]] with coal in [[Queensland]], so achieving loaded operations in both directions.\n\n===North-South===\n* A {{convert|820|mi|km|adj=on|abbr=on|order=flip}} land grant railway from [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]] to [[Point Parker]] on the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], with branches, was proposed in the 1880s.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11563661?searchTerm=Charleville+Point+Parker#pstart265733 28 Dec 1882 \u2013 THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILWAY.

The [[Adelaide-Darwin railway]] is standard or {{RailGauge|1435mm}} gauge, though the original line to Alice Springs (never fully completed line) was {{RailGauge|1067mm}} gauge.\n* In 2006, proposals for new lines in Queensland that would carry both intrastate coal traffic and interstate freight traffic would see [[standard gauge]] penetrate the state in considerable stretches for the first time. (ARHS Digest September 2006). The standard gauge [[Inland Railway]] would ultimately extend from [[Melbourne]] to [[Cairns]].\n* Starting in 1867, Queensland built several railways going inland from several ports in a westerly direction. From the 1920s, steps were taken to connect these lines by the North-South [[North Coast railway line, Queensland|North Coast line]] from [[Brisbane]] to [[Cairns]].\n\n==Africa==\n\n===East-West===\n* There are several ways to cross [[Africa]] transcontinentally by connecting west-east railroads. One is the [[Benguela railway]] that was completed in 1929. It starts in [[Lobito]], [[Angola]] and connects through [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] to the [[Zambia railways]] system. From Zambia several ports are accessible on the Indian Ocean: [[Dar es Salaam]] in Tanzania through the [[TAZARA]], and, through Zimbabwe, [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] and [[Maputo]] in Mozambique. The Angolan Civil War has made the Benguela line largely inoperative, but efforts are being taken to restore it. Another west-east corridor leads from the Atlantic harbours in [[Namibia]], either [[Walvis Bay]] or [[Luderitz]] to the [[South Africa]]n rail system that, in turn, links to ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] ( i.e. [[Durban]], [[Maputo]]).\n* A 1015&nbsp;km gap in the east-west line between [[Kinshasa]] and [[Ilebo]] filled by riverboats could be plugged with a new railway.<ref>[http://www.afdb.org/en/news-events/article/afdb-grants-us-7-45-million-to-drc-and-congo-for-transport-system-improvement-project-study-3384/ Afdb.org]</ref>\n* There are two proposals for a line from the Red Sea to the Gulf of Guinea, including [[TransAfricaRail]].\n* In 2010 a [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway|proposal]] surfaced to link [[Dakar]] to [[Port Sudan]]. Thirteen countries are on the main route, while another six would be served by branches.\n\n===North-South===\n* A North-South transcontinental railroad had been proposed by [[Cecil Rhodes]]: the [[Cape-Cairo railway]]. This system was seen as the backbone for the African possessions of the [[British Empire]], and was not completed. During its development, a competing French colonial project for a competing line from [[Algiers]] or [[Dakar]] to [[Abidjan]] was abandoned after the [[Fashoda incident]]. This line would have had four gauge islands in three gauges.\n* An extension of Namibian Railways is being built in 2006 with the possible connection to Angolan Railways.\n* [[Transport in Libya#Railways|Libya]] has proposed a Trans-Saharan Railway connecting possibly to [[Transport in Nigeria#Railways|Nigeria]] which would connect with the proposed [[AfricaRail]] network.\n\n===African Union of Railways===\n* The [[African Union of Railways]] has plans to connect the various railways of Africa including the [[Dakar-Port Sudan Railway]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Railways}}\n* [[Cosmopolitan Railway]]\n* [[Transmountain railroad]]\n* [[Intercontinental and transoceanic fixed links]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Glenn Williamson, ''Iron Muse: Photographing the Transcontinental Railroad.''
