Casa Grande grew slowly, and suffered several setbacks both in 1886 and 1893, when fires ravaged the town, destroying all wooden housing structures within it.<ref name=\"COC\" /> When the mining boom slowed in the 1890s, the town was nearly abandoned, but with the advent of agriculture, the town remained alive and well, and was eventually incorporated in 1915.<ref name=\"COC\" />\n\nOne of the founding fathers of Casa Grande was Thompson Rodney Peart. Peart Road, Peart Park, and the Peart Center, all of which are notable fixtures of Casa Grande, are named after him.\n\nCasa Grande was home to a collective farm society which was part of the New Deal.\n\nAccording to historian David Leighton, during World War II, from 1942 to 1945, a Japanese-American relocation camp was set up outside of Casa Grande, known as the [[Gila River War Relocation Center]]. Two notable people that were interned there were future actor [[Pat Morita]] and baseball player [[Kenichi Zenimura]], who constructed a baseball field and set up a league in the relocation camp.<ref>[http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-miracle-mile-went-to-big-house/article_37f7e4c2-c122-11e4-b233-4784ecf60fe8.html David Leighton, \"Street Smarts: Miracle Mile went to 'Big House',\" Arizona Daily Star, Feb. 3, 2015]</ref>\n\nCasa Grande is home to [[Francisco Grande]] Hotel & Golf Resort, former spring training location for the [[San Francisco Giants]].

[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]]. According to U.S. Census estimates, the population of the city is 57,232 as of 2018.<ref name=\"FactFinder\"/> It is named after the [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]], which is actually located in [[Coolidge, Arizona|Coolidge]]. \"Casa Grande\" is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for \"big house\".

In January 1880, the community of Terminus, meaning \"end-of-the-line,\" was established despite consisting of just five residents and three buildings.<ref name=\"COC\">[http://www.casagrandechamber.org/area_information/cghistory.htm \"Casa Grande History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701083305/http://www.casagrandechamber.org/area_information/cghistory.htm |date=July 1, 2015 }}, retrieved September 10, 2013</ref> In September 1880, railroad executives renamed the settlement Casa Grande, after the [[Hohokam]] ruins at the nearby [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument]]. Casa Grande grew slowly, and suffered several setbacks both in 1886 and 1893, when fires ravaged the town, destroying all wooden housing structures within it.<ref name=\"COC\" /> When the mining boom slowed in the 1890s, the town was nearly abandoned, but with the advent of agriculture, the town remained alive and well, and was eventually incorporated in 1915.<ref name=\"COC\" />\n\nOne of the founding fathers of Casa Grande was Thompson Rodney Peart. Peart Road, Peart Park, and the Peart Center, all of which are notable fixtures of Casa Grande, are named after him.\n\nCasa Grande was home to a collective farm society which was part of the New Deal.\n\nAccording to historian David Leighton, during World War II, from 1942 to 1945, a Japanese-American relocation camp was set up outside of Casa Grande, known as the [[Gila River War Relocation Center]]. Two notable people that were interned there were future actor [[Pat Morita]] and baseball player [[Kenichi Zenimura]], who constructed a baseball field and set up a league in the relocation camp.<ref>[http://tucson.com/news/blogs/streetsmarts/street-smarts-miracle-mile-went-to-big-house/article_37f7e4c2-c122-11e4-b233-4784ecf60fe8.html David Leighton, \"Street Smarts: Miracle Mile went to 'Big House',\" Arizona Daily Star, Feb. 3, 2015]</ref>\n\nCasa Grande is home to [[Francisco Grande]] Hotel & Golf Resort, former spring training location for the [[San Francisco Giants]]. Then owner, [[Horace Stoneham]], began developing the property in 1959. The first exhibition game was played in Casa Grande in 1961, with Willie Mays hitting a {{convert|375|ft|m|adj=on}} home run.

Main St.]] \nThe economy of Casa Grande was historically based on rural, agricultural industries such as cotton and dairy farms. Over time, the city has become home to many Phoenix or Tucson urbanites who own homes in Casa Grande. Most residents either commute north to work in the Phoenix metropolitan area, or to the south, to work in Tucson. This trend has contributed to growth in the service industry of Casa Grande. Many new businesses such as restaurants, gas stations, and retail outlets are opening throughout the city in order to keep up with demand from the growing population.\n\nAn outlet mall operates in southern Casa Grande. Phase one of The Promenade at Casa Grande opened on November 16, 2007. Built by Westcor and the Pederson Group, it is similar to [[Desert Ridge Marketplace]] (an outdoor shopping center in northeast [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]). The Promenade at Casa Grande is an open-air outdoor mall, built on a {{convert|100|acre|km2|adj=on}} patch of desert, and contains nearly a million square feet. An additional $11 million was spent by the city to fund the reconstruction of the Florence Blvd./I-10 freeway overpass.\n\n[[Ehrmann Commonwealth Dairy]] operates a major dairy processing facility in the town that opened in 2013 and employs about 110 people.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/10/17/ehrmann-commonwealth-dairy-to-open.html|title=Ehrmann Commonwealth Dairy to open $50M Casa Grande plant|newspaper=Phoenix Business Journal|date=October 17, 2013|accessdate=December 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\n;Cars\nOn November 29, 2016, officials from the state and the [[Lucid Motors]] car company announced a $700 million manufacturing plant will be constructed in Casa Grande that will employ up to 2,000 workers by 2022.<ref name=ohns1>{{cite web|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2016/11/29/lucid-motors-has-a-1000hp-tesla-challenger-now-to-find-the-cash-to-build-it/ |title=Lucid Motors Has A 1000HP Tesla Challenger; Now To Find The Cash To Build It|date=November 29, 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/economy/2016/11/29/electric-vehicle-company-plans-casa-grande-plant-lucid-motors/94610502/ |title=Tesla rival Lucid Motors plans Casa Grande plant |author=Ronald J.

It also includes an area of bays dotted with cottages to the south, and just north of Kettle Lakes Provincial Park. Recently Barber's Bay has seen a growth in its year-long residents, most notably around the densely developed Finn Bay.\n\n==Connaught==\nA small village just west of Barbers Bay, where the Frederick House River flows into Frederick House Lake.  Sometimes all of the extreme eastern portion within Timmins' city limits (Barbers Bay, Hoyle and Connaught) is referred to as Connaught because the village contains the only post office in the area.  It borders both [[Iroquois Falls]] and [[Black River-Matheson]].\nConnaught was also the location of the Frederick House outpost of the Hudson`s Bay Company.\n\n==Hill District==\nLocated in the northeast portion of Timmins, it is North of Algonquin Boulevard and generally East of the streets with names of trees.  It does not really have any precise boundaries, but much of it is located on a hill, thus its name.  Both Gillies Lake and the [[Timmins and District Hospital]] are located here.

Schumacher, who sank the first [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] in the community during the [[Porcupine Gold Rush]]. It was once home to one of Canada's largest [[Croatia]]n communities.  Although it still has many people of Croatian and other European descent, more recently, many people of Aboriginal heritage (mainly [[Cree]]) have taken up residence.  Schumacher was part of Tisdale Township until the township was amalgamated into the City of Timmins in 1973.\n[[File:YUL816770-MainstreetSchumacher.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, Schumacher, Ont., early 1900s]]\n\nPorcupine Gold Mines is currently engaged in a surface diamond drilling program on the previous Hollinger and McIntyre properties. This activity aims to better determine the location and extent of underground mine workings in the area, which have caused [[sinkholes]] to appear. In addition, it is done to evaluate the potential to mine remnant gold mineralization as part of a possible future open-pit mining operation. The ongoing evaluation of the properties is part of the closure planning process that Porcupine Gold Mines is completing for the [[Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (Ontario)|Ministry of Northern Development and Mines]].  Preliminary indications show the possibility of more than 4 million ounces of gold in the area.\n\nThe area is also home to the McIntyre mine and the [[McIntyre Community Building]], the primary sporting facility in Timmins, both of which were named for another early prospector, Sandy McIntyre. The McIntyre arena is also where Schumacher's most famous resident first donned his skates; [[Frank Mahovlich]], a [[Liberal Party of Canada]] [[Senate of Canada|Senator]], National Hockey League Hall of Fame member, and recipient of the Order of Canada, was born in Schumacher. Mahovlich's NHL contemporary, [[Dean Prentice]], was also born in Schumacher.\nThis arena was also where Canada's own Barbara-Ann Scott taught figure skating in the 1950s.\n\n===Gold Centre===\n\nGold Centre is a small planned town site situated just a half km southeast of Schumacher.  The town site though small is still an active community of less than 100 residents today.  Although still identified by its name, many consider it to be a part of Schumacher.\n\n==South Porcupine==\n[[File:Old Tisdale Township Municipal Building in South Porcupine, Timmins, Ontario.jpg|thumb|right|Old Tisdale Township Municipal Building in South Porcupine]]\n\nSouth Porcupine was founded on the southwestern shore of Porcupine Lake, due to its proximity to the mines. Locally, South Porcupine is traditionally known as \"South End\" and also more recently called \"SoPo\".<ref name=Barnes/>{{rp|86,123}}\n\nThe arrival of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO) rail system in 1911 accelerated the growth of the area; until then, the trek to the South Porcupine was done by canoe and by foot from Haileybury. That same year, (two days after the first train arrived in the South Porcupine), the entire area was destroyed in the fire of 1911.<ref name=Barnes/>{{rp|86,107}} Because of the importance of the gold discoveries, very few people abandoned the area and it was rebuilt in two months.\n[[File:YUL816762-TNORailwayTimmins.jpg|thumb|right| T& N.O railway station in South Porcupine]]\nThe Township of Tisdale, which later included the townsite of Schumacher (established in 1911) and the town of South Porcupine, was incorporated in 1909. The Township was later amalgamated and became part of Timmins.\n\nNotable people from South Porcupine include [[Jim Prentice]], [[Gordon Thiessen]], [[Bob Nevin]], [[Murray Costello]], [[Don Lever]], [[Pete Babando]], [[Bruce McCaffrey]], [[Danny Belisle]], [[Les Costello]], [[Clayton Hill]].\n\n===Connaught Hill===\n\nA neighbourhood found within South Porcupine at its southernmost portion.  It is located near the southwestern part of Porcupine Lake.  It is not to be confused with the village of Connaught located within city limits on Frederick House Lake.  It was built on a small hill as its name suggests.  A railroad station once existed at the bottom of the hill.\n\n==Mining property neighbourhoods==\n\n===Buffalo Ankerite===\nBuffalo Ankerite is an old mining area and there are some homes.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the residents of the houses were evicted due to the expansion of the open pit mining operation.\n\n===Pamour===\nPamour was a small settlement, which housed workers of the nearby Pamour mine. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the houses were abandoned and then razed due to the expansion of the open pit mining operation.

The Ontario Government Complex which services the Timmins area is located here.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n==Schumacher==\n[[File:Dwyer Block in Schumacher, Timmins, Ontario.jpg|thumb|right|Dwyer Block in Schumacher]]\nSchumacher, once known as Aura Lake, is named after early settler and mining prospector Fredrick W. Schumacher, who sank the first [[shaft mining|mine shaft]] in the community during the [[Porcupine Gold Rush]]. It was once home to one of Canada's largest [[Croatia]]n communities.  Although it still has many people of Croatian and other European descent, more recently, many people of Aboriginal heritage (mainly [[Cree]]) have taken up residence.  Schumacher was part of Tisdale Township until the township was amalgamated into the City of Timmins in 1973.\n[[File:YUL816770-MainstreetSchumacher.jpg|thumb|right|Main Street, Schumacher, Ont., early 1900s]]\n\nPorcupine Gold Mines is currently engaged in a surface diamond drilling program on the previous Hollinger and McIntyre properties. This activity aims to better determine the location and extent of underground mine workings in the area, which have caused [[sinkholes]] to appear. In addition, it is done to evaluate the potential to mine remnant gold mineralization as part of a possible future open-pit mining operation. The ongoing evaluation of the properties is part of the closure planning process that Porcupine Gold Mines is completing for the [[Ministry of Northern Development and Mines (Ontario)|Ministry of Northern Development and Mines]].  Preliminary indications show the possibility of more than 4 million ounces of gold in the area.\n\nThe area is also home to the McIntyre mine and the [[McIntyre Community Building]], the primary sporting facility in Timmins, both of which were named for another early prospector, Sandy McIntyre. The McIntyre arena is also where Schumacher's most famous resident first donned his skates; [[Frank Mahovlich]], a [[Liberal Party of Canada]] [[Senate of Canada|Senator]], National Hockey League Hall of Fame member, and recipient of the Order of Canada, was born in Schumacher. Mahovlich's NHL contemporary, [[Dean Prentice]], was also born in Schumacher.\nThis arena was also where Canada's own Barbara-Ann Scott taught figure skating in the 1950s.\n\n===Gold Centre===\n\nGold Centre is a small planned town site situated just a half km southeast of Schumacher.  The town site though small is still an active community of less than 100 residents today.  Although still identified by its name, many consider it to be a part of Schumacher.\n\n==South Porcupine==\n[[File:Old Tisdale Township Municipal Building in South Porcupine, Timmins, Ontario.jpg|thumb|right|Old Tisdale Township Municipal Building in South Porcupine]]\n\nSouth Porcupine was founded on the southwestern shore of Porcupine Lake, due to its proximity to the mines. Locally, South Porcupine is traditionally known as \"South End\" and also more recently called \"SoPo\".<ref name=Barnes/>{{rp|86,123}}\n\nThe arrival of the Temiskaming & Northern Ontario Railway (T&NO) rail system in 1911 accelerated the growth of the area; until then, the trek to the South Porcupine was done by canoe and by foot from Haileybury. That same year, (two days after the first train arrived in the South Porcupine), the entire area was destroyed in the fire of 1911.<ref name=Barnes/>{{rp|86,107}} Because of the importance of the gold discoveries, very few people abandoned the area and it was rebuilt in two months.\n[[File:YUL816762-TNORailwayTimmins.jpg|thumb|right| T& N.O railway station in South Porcupine]]\nThe Township of Tisdale, which later included the townsite of Schumacher (established in 1911) and the town of South Porcupine, was incorporated in 1909. The Township was later amalgamated and became part of Timmins.\n\nNotable people from South Porcupine include [[Jim Prentice]], [[Gordon Thiessen]], [[Bob Nevin]], [[Murray Costello]], [[Don Lever]], [[Pete Babando]], [[Bruce McCaffrey]], [[Danny Belisle]], [[Les Costello]], [[Clayton Hill]].\n\n===Connaught Hill===\n\nA neighbourhood found within South Porcupine at its southernmost portion.  It is located near the southwestern part of Porcupine Lake.  It is not to be confused with the village of Connaught located within city limits on Frederick House Lake.  It was built on a small hill as its name suggests.  A railroad station once existed at the bottom of the hill.\n\n==Mining property neighbourhoods==\n\n===Buffalo Ankerite===\nBuffalo Ankerite is an old mining area and there are some homes. There is also a lake near by. If you continued down the road you would reach the GoldCorp mining area.\n\n===Delnite===\n\n==Former neighbourhoods demolished due to mining activity==\n\n===Aunor===\n\n===Dome Property===\n\n===Dome Extension===\nOften called \"Dome Ex\", it was an abandoned residential community which surrounded the [[Dome Mine]].\nIt was \"abandoned\" due to the company evicting the residents in order to open pit mine the area\n\n===Hallnor Mine Town site===\nThe Hallnor Mine Site was a small settlement, which housed workers of the nearby Pamour mine. In the late 90's and early 2000's, the residents of the houses were evicted due to the expansion of the open pit mining operation.\n\n===Pamour===\nPamour was a small settlement, which housed workers of the nearby Pamour mine. Through the 1980s and 1990s, the houses were abandoned and then razed due to the expansion of the open pit mining operation. The site was eventually entirely engulfed by the pit.\n\n===Preston Property===\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geography of Timmins]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Cochrane District]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typos (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhoods_in_Timmins"}

Dates in the World Calendar occur with no more than two days difference from Gregorian calendar dates.\n\n===Religious objections===\nThe main opponents of the World Calendar in the 20th century were leaders of religions that worship according to a seven-day cycle. For Jews, Christians and Muslims, particular days of worship are ancient and fundamental elements of their faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748231,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|title=Calendar Reform|date=17 December 1934|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nJews observe Saturday as ''[[Shabbat]]'', on the basis of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]'s injunction to \"[[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]\" (Exodus 20:8). Christians worship on [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sunday]], the [[Lord's Day]], on which they believe Christ rose from the dead. Muslims perform the ''[[jumu'ah]]'' prayer in Mosques on Fridays, the day they believe Adam was created. Likewise, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are required to worship every Saturday.\n\nAdherents of these religions object that intercalary days are counted outside the usual seven-day week and disrupt the traditional weekly cycle. A week with a Worldsday would be eight days long. Adherents of these religions insist that they would have to continue observing their holidays every seventh day, causing the worship days to drift by one day each year (two on a leap year), relative to the World Calendar week. The day of rest would then no longer coincide with the weekend.\n\nThese concerns played a role in the United States government's decision at the United Nations in 1955 not to recommend further study.<ref>Your Washington Review by Congressman Jerry Ford, For Release 5 May 1955, [http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/fordcong/4525448.pdf From page 11 of an online collection of Box D1 of the Gerald R. Ford Congressional Papers at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library.] Jerry Ford wrote: \"... I haye received numerous letters in opposition to the proposed world caleridar change. I am in complete agreement with the opinions expressed in these letters and I will oppose any calendar change. The Department of State advises me that the United Nations may set up a study group on calendar reform. Secretary John Foster Dulles and our representatives at the U. N. are not in favor of this action and the United States will officially oppose setting up this U.N. study group on calendar reform. I have also been informed that our State Department will hold to that position until there is Congressional authorization for the calendar study. From my observations it seems that Congress is in no mood to tamper with the calendar.\"</ref>\n\nSupporters of the World Calendar do not deny that their system is at odds with the traditions of a significant portion of the world's population, but argue that Worldsdays and Leapyear Days can be treated as \"double\" holidays by those who wish to maintain the seven-day week sequence.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n===ISO 8601===\nThe World Calendar, unlike some other proposals, is not compatible with the international standard [[ISO 8601]], which is based upon, but differs from, the Gregorian calendar. They differ regarding the first weekday of the week (Sunday vs. Monday) and ISO 8601 does not support intercalary dates (e.g. in notation). The World Calendar, however, modifies the Gregorian calendar less than other calendar reform proposals to achieve the sought after improvements of a simpler and perpetual calendar.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Calendar reform]]\n* [[List of calendars]]\n*[[Perennial Calendar]]\n*[[International Fixed Calendar]]: another calendar reform proposed before the World Calendar\n*[[World Season Calendar]], proposed by [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1973 and almost identical to the World Calendar\n*[[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]]: another perennial calendar, but with a seven-day cycle that avoids the religious opposition to the World Calendar\n*[[Holocene calendar]] a reform in year numbering\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theworldcalendar.org/ The World Calendar Association Website]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/achelis.html Biography of Elisabeth Achelis]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calendar-reform.html Calendar Reform]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Calendars}}\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Chronology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Calendar, The}}\n[[Category:Proposed calendars]]\n[[Category:Specific calendars]]\n[[Category:1930 in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1930 in science]]\n[[Category:1930 works]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the calendar in common use|Gregorian calendar}}\nThe '''World Calendar''' is a proposed [[Calendar reform|reform]] of the [[Gregorian calendar]] created by [[Elisabeth Achelis]] of [[Brooklyn]], New York in 1930.\n\n==Features==\nThe World Calendar is a 12-month, [[perennial calendar]] with equal quarters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theworldcalendar.org/TWCandDescription.pdf |title=The World Calendar Description |publisher=The World Calendar Association |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nEach quarter begins on a Sunday and ends on a Saturday.

For Jews, Christians and Muslims, particular days of worship are ancient and fundamental elements of their faith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,748231,00.html|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|title=Calendar Reform|date=17 December 1934|accessdate=6 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nJews observe Saturday as ''[[Shabbat]]'', on the basis of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]]'s injunction to \"[[Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy]]\" (Exodus 20:8). Christians worship on [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sunday]], the [[Lord's Day]], on which they believe Christ rose from the dead. Muslims perform the ''[[jumu'ah]]'' prayer in Mosques on Fridays, the day they believe Adam was created. Likewise, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] are required to worship every Saturday.\n\nAdherents of these religions object that intercalary days are counted outside the usual seven-day week and disrupt the traditional weekly cycle. A week with a Worldsday would be eight days long. Adherents of these religions insist that they would have to continue observing their holidays every seventh day, causing the worship days to drift by one day each year (two on a leap year), relative to The World Calendar week. The day of rest would then no longer coincide with the weekend.\n\nThese concerns played a role in the United States government's decision at the United Nations in 1955 not to recommend further study.<ref>Your Washington Review by Congressman Jerry Ford, For Release 5 May 1955, [http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/fordcong/4525448.pdf From page 11 of an online collection of Box D1 of the Gerald R. Ford Congressional Papers at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library.] Jerry Ford wrote: \"... I haye received numerous letters in opposition to the proposed world caleridar change. I am in complete agreement with the opinions expressed in these letters and I will oppose any calendar change. The Department of State advises me that the United Nations may set up a study group on calendar reform. Secretary John Foster Dulles and our representatives at the U. N. are not in favor of this action and the United States will officially oppose setting up this U.N. study group on calendar reform. I have also been informed that our State Department will hold to that position until there is Congressional authorization for the calendar study. From my observations it seems that Congress is in no mood to tamper with the calendar.\"</ref>\n\nSupporters of The World Calendar do not deny that their system is at odds with the traditions of a significant portion of the world's population, but argue that Worldsdays and Leapyear Days can be treated as \"double\" holidays by those who wish to maintain the seven-day week sequence.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\n===ISO 8601===\nThe World Calendar, unlike some other proposals, is not compatible with the international standard [[ISO 8601]], which is based upon, but differs from, the Gregorian calendar. They differ regarding the first weekday of the week (Sunday vs. Monday) and ISO 8601 does not support intercalary dates (e.g. in notation). The World Calendar, however, modifies the Gregorian calendar less than other calendar reform proposals to achieve the sought after improvements of a simpler and perpetual calendar.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Calendar reform]]\n* [[List of calendars]]\n*[[Perennial Calendar]]\n*[[International Fixed Calendar]]: another calendar reform proposed before the World Calendar\n*[[World Season Calendar]], proposed by [[Isaac Asimov]] in 1973 and almost identical to the World Calendar\n*[[Hanke-Henry Permanent Calendar]]: another perennial calendar, but with a seven-day cycle that avoids the religious opposition to the World Calendar\n*[[Holocene calendar]] a reform in year numbering\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.theworldcalendar.org/ The World Calendar Association Website]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/achelis.html Biography of Elisabeth Achelis]\n*[http://myweb.ecu.edu/mccartyr/calendar-reform.html Calendar Reform]\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Calendars}}\n{{Time Topics}}\n{{Time measurement and standards}}\n{{Chronology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:World Calendar, The}}\n[[Category:Proposed calendars]]\n[[Category:Specific calendars]]\n[[Category:1930 in New York (state)]]\n[[Category:1930 in science]]\n[[Category:1930 works]]\n", "name_user": "VirguloMane", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Calendar"}
