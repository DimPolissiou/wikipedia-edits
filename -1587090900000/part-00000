Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].  The city's largest institution of higher education, the [[University of Cincinnati]], was founded in 1819 as a municipal college and is now ranked as one of the 50 largest in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rieselman|first=Deborah|title=Brief history of University of Cincinnati|url=http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|work=UC Magazine|publisher=University of Cincinnati University Relations|accessdate=February 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219091343/http://magazine.uc.edu/editors_picks/fun/briefhistory.html|archive-date=February 19, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Cincinnati is home to historic architecture with many structures in the urban core having remained intact for 200 years.

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The downturn in industry in the late 20th century caused a loss of many jobs, leaving many people in poverty.

Throughout much of the 19th century, it was listed among the top 10 U.S. cities by population, surpassed only by [[New Orleans]] and the older, established settlements of the United States eastern seaboard, as well as being the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1840|sixth-biggest city]] for a period spanning 1840 until 1860. Cincinnati was the first city founded after the [[American Revolution]], as well as the first major inland city in the country.\n\nCincinnati developed with fewer immigrants and less influence from Europe than East Coast cities in the same period. However, it received a significant number of German-speaking immigrants, who founded many of the city's cultural institutions.  By the end of the 19th century, with the shift from steamboats to railroads drawing off freight shipping, trade patterns had altered and Cincinnati's growth slowed considerably. The city was surpassed in population by other inland cities, particularly [[Chicago]], which developed based on strong commodity exploitation, economics, and the railroads, and [[St. Louis]], which for decades after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] served as the gateway to westward migration.\n\nCincinnati is home to three major sports teams: the [[Cincinnati Reds]] of [[Major League Baseball]]; the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] of the [[National Football League]]; and  [[FC Cincinnati]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Prior to 1924, City council members were elected through a system of [[Ward (politics)|wards]].  The ward system was subject to corruption due to partisan rule. From the 1880s to the 1920s, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] dominated city politics, with the [[political machine]] of  George B. [[George B. Cox|\"Boss\" Cox]] exerting control.\n\nA reform movement arose in 1923, led by another Republican, [[Murray Seasongood]]. Seasongood founded the Charter Committee, which used ballot initiatives in 1924 to replace the ward system with the current at-large system. They gained approval by voters for a [[council\u2013manager government]] form of government, in which the smaller council (compared to the number of previous ward representatives) hires a professional manager to operate daily affairs of the city.  From 1924 to 1957, the council was elected by [[proportional representation]] and single transfer voting (STV). Starting with Ashtabula in 1915, several major cities in Ohio adopted this electoral system, which had the practical effect of reducing ward boss and political party power. For that reason, such groups opposed it.\n\nIn an effort to overturn the charter that provided for proportional representation, opponents in 1957 fanned fears of black political power, at a time of increasing civil rights activism.<ref name=\"amy\">[https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/polit/damy/articles/Brief%20History%20of%20PR.htm Douglas J.

The second step will begin on 11 May, assuming the first step is implemented without problems, at which time other shops and schools can be opened.  The tThird step begin on 8 June with the easing of restrictions on vocational schools, universities, museums, zoos and libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rte.ie/news/coronavirus/2020/0416/1131999-switzerland-coronavirus/ |title=Switzerland announces gradual easing of Covid-19 restrictions |date=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n|width =\n|align = center\n|image1=Voie du Chariot.jpg|alt1=\n|image2=Voie du Chariot (Coronavirus).jpg|alt2=\n|footer = The [[Le Flon (Lausanne)|Flon]] in Lausanne before and during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n}}\n\n==Statistics==\n\nAs with most countries, the number of people actually infected with COVID-19 in Switzerland is likely to be much higher than the number of confirmed cases,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lau|first=Hien|last2=Khosrawipour|first2=Veria|last3=Kocbach|first3=Piotr|last4=Mikolajczyk|first4=Agata|last5=Ichii|first5=Hirohito|last6=Schubert|first6=Justyna|last7=Bania|first7=Jacek|last8=Khosrawipour|first8=Tanja|date=2020-03-14|title=Internationally lost COVID-19 cases|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118220300736|journal=Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.jmii.2020.03.013|pmid=32205091|pmc=7102572|issn=1684-1182}}</ref> especially as, since 6 March 2020, the Swiss government has had an official policy of not testing people with only mild symptoms.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.derbund.ch/schweiz/standard/bund-sucht-nicht-mehr-alle-coronainfizierten/story/20389898|title=Bund sucht nicht mehr alle Corona-Infizierten|work=Der Bund|access-date=2020-03-31|language=de|issn=0774-6156}}</ref>\n\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/Switzerland medical cases}}\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|type=line\n|linewidth=1\n|showSymbols=1\n|width=800\n|colors=#FF6347\n|showValues=\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|x=25 Feb, 26 Feb, 27 Feb, 28 Feb, 29 Feb, 1 Mar, 2 Mar, 3 Mar, 4 Mar, 5 Mar, 6 Mar, 7 Mar, 8 Mar, 9 Mar, 10 Mar, 11 Mar, 12 Mar, 13 Mar, 14 Mar, 15 Mar, 16 Mar, 17 Mar, 18 Mar, 19 Mar, 20 Mar, 21 Mar, 22 Mar, 23 Mar, 24 Mar, 25 Mar, 26 Mar, 27 Mar, 28 Mar, 29 Mar, 30 Mar, 31 Mar, 1 Apr, 2 Apr, 3 Apr, 4 Apr, 5 Apr, 6 Apr, 7 Apr, 8 Apr, 9 Apr, 10 Apr\n|yAxisTitle=No. of cases\n|y1= 2, 3, 8, 13, 18, 22, 40, 55, 72, 102, 198, 263, 328, 376, 505, 640, 880, 1223, 1530, 2153, 2327, 2650, 3815, 5118, 6427, 7385, 8160, 9395, 10117, 11217, 11801, 13512, 14251, 15228,16141, 17097, 18055, 19109,19835,20773, 21176, 21663, 22841, 23372, 24259, 24551\n|y1Title=Confirmed cases\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n}}\n\n{{Graph:Chart\n|width=800\n|colors=#F46D43\n|showValues=\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|type=rect\n|x= 25 Feb, 26 Feb, 27 Feb, 28 Feb, 29 Feb, 1 Mar, 2 Mar, 3 Mar, 4 Mar, 5 Mar, 6 Mar, 7 Mar, 8 Mar, 9 Mar, 10 Mar, 11 Mar, 12 Mar, 13 Mar, 14 Mar, 15 Mar, 16 Mar, 17 Mar, 18 Mar, 19 Mar, 20 Mar, 21 Mar, 22 Mar, 23 Mar, 24 Mar, 25 Mar, 26 Mar, 27 Mar, 28 Mar, 29 Mar, 30 Mar, 31 Mar, 1 Apr,2 Apr, 3 Apr, 4 Apr, 5 Apr, 6 Apr, 7 Apr, 8 Apr, 9 Apr, 10 Apr\n|yAxisTitle=No. of new cases\n|legend=Legend\n|y1=0,\t1,\t5,\t5,\t5,\t4,\t18,\t15,\t17,\t30,\t96,\t65,\t65,\t48,\t129,\t135,\t240,\t343,\t307,\t623,\t174,\t323,\t1165,\t1303,\t1309,\t958,\t775,\t1235,\t722,\t1100,\t584,\t1711,\t739,\t977,\t913,\t956,\t958,\t1054,\t726,\t938,\t403,\t487,\t1178,\t531,\t887,  292\n\n|y1Title=New cases per day\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n}} {{Graph:Chart\n|width=800\n|colors=#0000FF\n|showValues=\n|xAxisTitle=Date\n|xAxisAngle=-40\n|type=rect\n|x= 27 Feb, 28 Feb, 29 Feb, 1 Mar, 2 Mar, 3 Mar, 4 Mar, 5 Mar, 6 Mar, 7 Mar, 8 Mar, 9 Mar, 10 Mar, 11 Mar, 12 Mar, 13 Mar, 14 Mar, 15 Mar, 16 Mar, 17 Mar, 18 Mar, 19 Mar, 20 Mar, 21 Mar, 22 Mar, 23 Mar, 24 Mar, 25 Mar, 26 Mar, 27 Mar, 28 Mar, 29 Mar, 30 Mar, 31 Mar\n|yAxisTitle=Growth factor\n|legend=\n|y1=6.00, 0.83, 1.00, 0.80, .50, 0.83, 1.13, 1.76, 3.20, 0.58, 1.71, 0.20, 7.16, 0.99, 1.82, 1.40, 0.90, 2.03, 0.28, 1.88, 3.55, 1.13, 1.01, 0.74, 0.80, 1.22, 1.07, 1.03, 1.14, 1.03, 0.85, 0.68, 1.14, 0.32\n|y1Title=Growth factor\n|yGrid= |xGrid=\n}}\n\nGrowth factor is defined as '''today's new cases''' / '''new cases on the previous day.'''

This matter includes [[gas]] in [[ion]]ic, [[atom]]ic, and [[molecular]] form, as well as [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[cosmic ray]]s. It fills [[interstellar space]] and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic space]]. The [[energy]] that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.\n\nThe interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The interstellar medium is composed, primarily, of [[hydrogen]], followed by [[helium]] with trace amounts of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]] comparatively to hydrogen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Eric|date=1995|title=Chemistry in The Interstellar Medium|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|volume=46|pages=27\u201354|bibcode=1995ARPC...46...27H|doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.46.100195.000331|pmid=}}</ref> The thermal [[pressures]] of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. [[Magnetic field]]s and [[turbulent]] motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are, typically, more important, [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamically]], than the thermal pressure is.\n\nIn all phases, the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in molecular form, and reaches number [[density|densities]] of 10<sup>6</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup> (1 million molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>). In hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the density may be as low as 10<sup>\u22124</sup> ions per cm<sup>3</sup>. Compare this with a number density of roughly 10<sup>19</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup> for air at sea level, and 10<sup>10</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup> (10 billion molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>) for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber. By [[mass]], 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust.<ref name=Boulanger>{{cite conference |author1=Boulanger, F. |author2=Cox, P. |author3=Jones, A.

David | pages = 251 | bibcode=2000isat.conf..251B}}</ref> Of the gas in the ISM, by number 91% of atoms are [[hydrogen]] and 8.9% are [[helium]], with 0.1% being atoms of elements heavier than hydrogen or helium,<ref name=Ferriere2001>{{harv|Ferriere|2001}}</ref> known as \"[[metallicity|metals]]\" in astronomical parlance. By mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of [[primordial nucleosynthesis]], while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result of enrichment in the process of [[stellar evolution]].\n\nThe ISM plays a crucial role in [[astrophysics]] precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, which ultimately contributes to [[molecular cloud]]s and replenishes the ISM with matter and energy through [[planetary nebula]]e, [[solar wind|stellar winds]], and [[supernova]]e. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.\n\n''[[Voyager 1]]'' reached the ISM on August 25, 2012, making it the first artificial object from Earth to do so. Interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the mission's end in 2025.

Their modeled ISM consisted of a cold dense phase (''T''&nbsp;<&nbsp;300&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (''T''&nbsp;~&nbsp;10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. {{harvtxt|McKee|Ostriker|1977}} added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (''T''&nbsp;~&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) gas which had been shock heated by [[supernova]]e and constituted most of the volume of the ISM.\nThese phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past three decades. However, the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known.<ref name=Ferriere2001 />\n\n===The atomic hydrogen model===\nThis model takes into account only atomic hydrogen: Temperature larger than 3000 K breaks molecules, lower than 50 000 K leaves atoms in their ground state. It is assumed that influence of other atoms (He ...) is negligible.  Pressure is assumed very low, so that durations of free paths of atoms are larger than the ~ 1 nanosecond duration of light pulses which make ordinary, temporally incoherent light.\n\nIn this collisionless gas, Einstein's theory of coherent light-matter interactions applies, all gas-light interactions are spatially coherent. \nSuppose that a monochromatic light is pulsed, then scattered by molecules having a quadrupole (Raman) resonance frequency. If \u201clength of light pulses is shorter than all involved time constants\u201d (Lamb (1971)), an \u201cimpulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) \u201d (Yan, Gamble & Nelson (1985)) works: While light generated by incoherent Raman at a shifted frequency has a phase independent on phase of exciting light, thus generates a new spectral line, coherence between incident and scattered light allows their interference into a single frequency, thus shifts incident frequency.\nAssume that a star radiates a continuous light spectrum up to X rays. Lyman frequencies are absorbed in this light and pump atoms mainly to first excited state. In this state, hyperfine periods are longer than 1 ns, so that an ISRS \u201cmay\u201d redshift light frequency, populating high hyperfine levels. Another ISRS \u201cmay\u201d transfer energy from hyperfine levels to thermal electromagnetic waves, so that redshift is permanent. Temperature of a light beam is defined from frequency and spectral radiance by Planck's formula. As entropy must increase, \u201cmay\u201d becomes \u201cdoes\u201d. \nHowever, where a previously absorbed line (first Lyman beta, ...) reaches Lyman alpha frequency, redshifting process stops and all hydrogen lines are strongly absorbed. But the stop is not perfect if there is energy at frequency shifted to Lyman beta frequency, which produces a slow redshift. Successive redshifts separated by Lyman absorptions generate many absorption lines, frequencies of which, deduced from absorption process, obey a law more dependable than Karlsson's formula.\n\nThe previous process excites more and more atoms because a de-excitation obeys Einstein's law of coherent interactions: Variation dI of radiance I of a light beam along a path dx is dI=BIdx,  where B is Einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium.  I is the modulus of Poynting vector of field, absorption occurs for an opposed vector, which corresponds to a change of sign of B. Factor I in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones (competition of modes). Emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance I provided by random zero point field. After emission of a flare, weak B increases by pumping while I remains close to zero: De-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field, as observed close to quasars (and in polar auroras).\n\n===Structures===\n[[File:Three-dim-pillars-creation.jpg|thumb|Three-dimensional structure in [[Pillars of Creation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pillars of Creation Revealed in 3D|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1518/|accessdate=14 June 2015 |publisher=European Southern Observatory |date=30 April 2015}}</ref>]]\n[[File:The Local Interstellar Cloud and neighboring G-cloud complex.gif|thumb|200px|Map showing the [[Sun]] located near the edge of the Local Interstellar Cloud and [[Alpha Centauri]] about 4 [[light-year]]s away in the neighboring [[G-Cloud]] complex]]\n\nThe ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM.\n\n[[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures \u2013 of varying sizes \u2013 can be observed, such as [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in [[radio telescope]] maps.\n\nThe [[Sun]] is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].\n\n===Interaction with interplanetary medium===\n[[File:Short, narrated video about IBEX's interstellar matter observations.ogv|thumb|left|350px|Short, narrated video about [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX's]] interstellar matter observations.]]\nThe interstellar medium begins where the [[interplanetary medium]] of the [[Solar System]] ends. The [[solar wind]] slows to [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities at the [[termination shock]], 90\u2013100 [[astronomical unit]]s from the [[Sun]]. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the [[heliosheath]], interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind. [[Voyager 1]], the farthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html |title=Voyager: Fast Facts |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}</ref>), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] on August 25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM {{harvard citation|Stone|Cummings|McDonald|Heikkila|2005}}.\n\n===Interstellar extinction===\n\nThe ISM is also responsible for [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] and [[interstellar reddening|reddening]], the decreasing [[Radiance|light intensity]] and shift in the dominant observable [[wavelength]]s of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of [[photon]]s and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky. The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the [[Milky Way]] \u2013 a uniform disk of stars \u2013 are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.\n\n[[Far ultraviolet|Far ultraviolet light]] is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of the ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic [[hydrogen]] lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] transition. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.\n\n== Heating and cooling ==\n\nThe ISM is usually far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Collisions establish a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities, and the 'temperature' normally used to describe interstellar gas is the 'kinetic temperature', which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly that of an [[Stellar classification#Class A|A star]] (surface temperature of ~10,000 [[Kelvin|K]]) highly diluted. Therefore, [[energy level|bound levels]] within an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] in the ISM are rarely populated according to the Boltzmann formula {{harv|Spitzer|1978|loc=&sect; 2.4}}.\n\nDepending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the [[gas]].\n\n=== Heating mechanisms ===\n\n; Heating by low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s: The first mechanism proposed for heating the ISM was heating by low-energy [[cosmic rays]]. [[Cosmic ray]]s are an efficient heating source able to penetrate in the depths of molecular clouds. [[Cosmic ray]]s transfer energy to [[gas]] through both ionization and excitation and to free [[electron]]s through [[Coulomb]] interactions. Low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s (a few [[MeV]]) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s.\n\n; Photoelectric heating by grains: The [[ultraviolet]] radiation emitted by hot [[star]]s can remove [[electron]]s from dust grains. The [[photon]] is absorbed by the dust grain, and some of its energy is used to overcome the potential energy barrier and remove the [[electron]] from the grain. This potential barrier is due to the binding energy of the electron (the [[work function]]) and the charge of the grain. The remainder of the photon's energy gives the ejected [[electron]] [[kinetic energy]] which heats the gas through collisions with other particles. A typical size distribution of dust grains is ''n''(''r'')&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''r''{{sup|\u22123.5}}, where ''r'' is the radius of the dust particle.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Mathis, J.S. | author2=Rumpl, W. | author3=Nordsieck, K.H. | title=The size distribution of interstellar grains|journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=217 | pages=425 | bibcode=1977ApJ...217..425M | doi=10.1086/155591| year=1977 }}</ref> Assuming this, the projected grain surface area distribution is ''\u03c0r''{{sup|2}}''n''(''r'')&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''r''{{sup|\u22121.5}}.

This heating mechanism dominates in H&nbsp;II regions, but is negligible in the diffuse ISM due to the relative lack of neutral [[carbon]] [[atom]]s.\n\n; [[X-ray]] heating: [[X-ray]]s remove [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s and [[ion]]s, and those photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is often low, this heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic medium (as the column density is small). For example, in molecular clouds only hard [[x-ray]]s can penetrate and [[x-ray]] heating can be ignored. This is assuming the region is not near an [[x-ray]] source such as a [[supernova remnant]].\n\n; Chemical heating: Molecular [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) can be formed on the surface of dust grains when two [[Hydrogen|H]] atoms (which can travel over the grain) meet. This process yields 4.48&nbsp;eV of energy distributed over the rotational and vibrational modes, kinetic energy of the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, as well as heating the dust grain. This kinetic energy, as well as the energy transferred from de-excitation of the hydrogen molecule through collisions, heats the gas.\n\n; Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas atoms and molecules with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is not important in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.\n\nGrain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high.\n\nGas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds (especially at high densities). Far [[infrared]] radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient:\n:<math>\\alpha = \\frac{T_2 - T}{T_d - T}</math>\nwhere ''T'' is the gas temperature, ''T<sub>d</sub>'' the dust temperature, and ''T''<sub>2</sub> the post-collision temperature of the gas atom or molecule. This coefficient was measured by {{harvard citation|Burke|Hollenbach|1983}} as ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.35.\n\n; Other heating mechanisms: A variety of macroscopic heating mechanisms are present including:\n:* [[Gravitational collapse]] of a cloud\n:* [[Supernova]] explosions\n:* [[Stellar wind]]s\n:* Expansion of [[H II region|H&nbsp;II regions]]\n:* [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] waves created by supernova remnants\n\n=== Cooling mechanisms ===\n\n; Fine structure cooling: The process of fine structure cooling is dominant in most regions of the Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot [[gas]] and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant [[atom]]s having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: C&nbsp;II and O&nbsp;I in the neutral medium and O&nbsp;II, O&nbsp;III, N&nbsp;II, N&nbsp;III, Ne&nbsp;II and Ne&nbsp;III in H&nbsp;II regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which will carry the energy out of the region.\n\n; Cooling by permitted lines: At lower temperatures, more levels than fine structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example, collisional excitation of the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 level of [[hydrogen]] will release a Ly-\u03b1 photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational lines of [[carbon monoxide|CO]] is important. Once a [[molecule]] is excited, it eventually returns to a lower energy state, emitting a photon which can leave the region, cooling the cloud.\n\n== Radiowave propagation ==\n[[File:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|400px|Atmospheric attenuation in [[decibel|dB]]/km as a function of frequency over the EHF band. Peaks in absorption at specific frequencies are a problem, due to atmosphere constituents such as water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nRadio waves from \u224810&nbsp;kHz ([[very low frequency]]) to \u2248300&nbsp;GHz ([[extremely high frequency]]) propagate differently in interstellar space than on the Earth's surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on Earth.

However, they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of \"interstellar\" space. The term appears to have been first used in print by {{harvtxt|Bacon|1626|loc=&sect; 354\u20135}}: \"The Interstellar Skie.. hath .. so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the Starre.\" Later, [[natural philosopher]] {{harvard citations|first=Robert | last=Boyle | year=1674 | txt=yes | authorlink=Robert Boyle}} discussed \"The inter-stellar part of heaven, which several of the modern [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] would have to be empty.\"\n\nBefore modern [[electromagnetic theory]], early [[physicist]]s postulated that an invisible [[luminiferous aether]] existed as a medium to carry lightwaves. It was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space, as {{harvtxt|Patterson|1862}} wrote, \"this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] which fills the interstellar spaces.\"\n\nThe advent of deep photographic imaging allowed [[Edward Emerson Barnard|Edward Barnard]] to produce the first images of [[dark nebula]]e silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy, while the first actual detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Johannes Hartmann]] in 1904<ref>{{Citation|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|first=Isaac|last=Asimov|title=Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology|edition=2nd|title-link=Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology}}</ref> through the use of [[absorption spectrum|absorption line spectroscopy]]. In his historic study of the spectrum and orbit of [[Delta Orionis]], Hartmann observed the light coming from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed before it reached the Earth. Hartmann reported that absorption from the \"K\" line of [[calcium]] appeared \"extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp\" and also reported the \"quite surprising result that the calcium line at 393.4&nbsp;nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the [[spectroscopic binary]] star\". The stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of Delta Orionis, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star. This discovery launched the study of the Interstellar Medium.\n\nIn the series of investigations, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]] introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds.<ref>{{Citation | title= To Victor Ambartsumian on his 80th birthday | author=S. Chandrasekhar | author-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | journal= Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy | volume=18 | issue=1 | pages=408\u2013409 | doi=10.1007/BF01005852|bibcode = 1988Ap.....29..408C | year= 1989 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hartmann's identification of interstellar calcium absorption, interstellar [[sodium]] was detected by {{harvtxt|Heger|1919}} through the observation of stationary absorption from the atom's \"D\" lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nanometres towards Delta Orionis and [[Beta Scorpii]].\n\nSubsequent observations of the \"H\" and \"K\" lines of calcium by {{harvtxt|Beals|1936}} revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of [[Epsilon Orionis|Epsilon]] and [[Zeta Orionis]]. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the \"K\" line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]]. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either [[Blueshift|blue-shifted]] or [[Red shift|red-shifted]] (respectively) from the lines' rest wavelength, through the [[Doppler Effect]]. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.\n\n[[File:Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar.jpg|thumb|This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust resembles a [[caterpillar]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1335a/|work=Image Archive|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> ]]\n\nThe growing evidence for interstellar material led {{harvtxt|Pickering|1912}} to comment that \"While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn]], is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous [[molecule]]s are certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the [[Sun]] and [[star]]s.\"\n\nThe same year [[Victor Francis Hess|Victor Hess]]'s discovery of [[cosmic rays]], highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year the Norwegian explorer and physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] wrote: \"It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric [[ion]]s of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or [[nebula]]e, but in 'empty' space\" {{harv|Birkeland|1913}}.\n\n{{harvtxt|Thorndike|1930}} noted that \"it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void.

This matter includes [[gas]] in [[ion]]ic, [[atom]]ic, and [[molecular]] form, as well as [[cosmic dust|dust]] and [[cosmic ray]]s. It fills [[interstellar space]] and blends smoothly into the surrounding [[Outer space#Intergalactic space|intergalactic space]]. The [[energy]] that occupies the same volume, in the form of [[electromagnetic radiation]], is the '''interstellar radiation field'''.\n\nThe interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The interstellar medium is composed, primarily, of [[hydrogen]], followed by [[helium]] with trace amounts of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]], and [[nitrogen]] comparatively to hydrogen.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Herbst|first=Eric|date=1995|title=Chemistry in The Interstellar Medium|journal=Annual Review of Physical Chemistry|volume=46|pages=27\u201354|bibcode=1995ARPC...46...27H|doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.46.100195.000331|pmid=}}</ref> The thermal [[pressures]] of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. [[Magnetic field]]s and [[turbulent]] motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are, typically, more important, [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamically]], than the thermal pressure is.\n\nIn all phases, the interstellar medium is extremely tenuous by terrestrial standards. In cool, dense regions of the ISM, matter is primarily in molecular form, and reaches number [[density|densities]] of 10<sup>6</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup> (1 million molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>). In hot, diffuse regions of the ISM, matter is primarily ionized, and the density may be as low as 10<sup>\u22124</sup> ions per cm<sup>3</sup>. Compare this with a number density of roughly 10<sup>19</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup> for air at sea level, and 10<sup>10</sup> molecules per cm<sup>3</sup> (10 billion molecules per cm<sup>3</sup>) for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber. By [[mass]], 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust.<ref name=Boulanger>{{cite conference |author1=Boulanger, F. |author2=Cox, P. |author3=Jones, A.

By mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of [[primordial nucleosynthesis]], while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result of enrichment in the process of [[stellar evolution]].\n\nThe ISM plays a crucial role in [[astrophysics]] precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, which ultimately contributes to [[molecular cloud]]s and replenishes the ISM with matter and energy through [[planetary nebula]]e, [[solar wind|stellar winds]], and [[supernova]]e. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.\n\n''[[Voyager 1]]'' reached the ISM on August 25, 2012, making it the first artificial object from Earth to do so. Interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the mission's end in 2025. Its twin, ''[[Voyager 2]]'' entered the ISM in November 2019.\n\n[[File:Voyager.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Voyager 1]] is the first artificial object to reach the ISM.]]\n\n==Interstellar matter==<!--Molecular cloud links here, as of 2008 July 24, primarily for components of the ISM table-->\n\nTable 1 shows a breakdown of the properties of the components of the ISM of the Milky Way.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Table 1: Components of the interstellar medium'''<ref name=\"Ferriere2001\"/>\n|- align=center bgcolor=#eeeeee\n!Component||Fractional <br /> volume||Scale height<br />([[parsec|pc]])||Temperature<br />([[Kelvin|K]])||Density<br />(particles/cm<sup>3</sup>)||State of [[hydrogen]] || Primary observational techniques\n|- align=center\n|[[Molecular cloud]]s|| < 1% || 80 || 10\u201320 || 10<sup>2</sup>\u201310<sup>6</sup> || molecular || [[Radio astronomy|Radio]] and [[Infrared astronomy|infrared]] molecular emission and absorption lines\n|- align=center\n|Cold neutral medium (CNM) || 1\u20135% || 100\u2013300 || 50\u2013100 || 20\u201350 || neutral atomic || [[Hydrogen line|H&nbsp;I 21&nbsp;cm line]] absorption\n|- align=center\n|Warm neutral medium (WNM) ||10\u201320% || 300\u2013400 ||6000\u201310000 || 0.2\u20130.5 || neutral atomic|| [[Hydrogen line|H&nbsp;I 21&nbsp;cm line]] emission\n|- align=center\n|Warm ionized medium (WIM)||20\u201350%|| 1000 || 8000 || 0.2\u20130.5 || ionized || [[H\u03b1]] emission and [[Dispersion (optics)#Dispersion in pulsar timing|pulsar dispersion]]\n|- align=center\n|[[H II region|H&nbsp;II regions]] || < 1% || 70 || 8000 || 10<sup>2</sup>\u201310<sup>4</sup> || ionized || [[H\u03b1]] emission and [[Dispersion (optics)#Dispersion in pulsar timing|pulsar dispersion]]\n|- align=center\n|[[Galactic corona|Coronal gas]]<br />Hot ionized medium (HIM)||30\u201370% || 1000\u20133000 || 10<sup>6</sup>\u201310<sup>7</sup> || 10<sup>\u22124</sup>\u201310<sup>\u22122</sup> || ionized<br />(metals also highly ionized) || [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] emission; absorption lines of highly ionized metals, primarily in the [[Ultraviolet astronomy|ultraviolet]]\n|}\n\n===The three-phase model===\n\n{{harvtxt|Field|Goldsmith|Habing|1969}} put forward the static two ''phase'' equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM. Their modeled ISM consisted of a cold dense phase (''T''&nbsp;<&nbsp;300&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (''T''&nbsp;~&nbsp;10<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. {{harvtxt|McKee|Ostriker|1977}} added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (''T''&nbsp;~&nbsp;10<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]) gas which had been shock heated by [[supernova]]e and constituted most of the volume of the ISM.\nThese phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the past three decades. However, the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well known.<ref name=Ferriere2001 />\n\n===The atomic hydrogen model===\nThis model takes into account only atomic hydrogen: Temperature larger than 3000 K breaks molecules, lower than 50 000 K leaves atoms in their ground state. It is assumed that influence of other atoms (He ...) is negligible.  Pressure is assumed very low, so that durations of free paths of atoms are larger than the ~ 1 nanosecond duration of light pulses which make ordinary, temporally incoherent light.\n\nIn this collisionless gas, Einstein's theory of coherent light-matter interactions applies, all gas-light interactions are spatially coherent. \nSuppose that a monochromatic light is pulsed, then scattered by molecules having a quadrupole (Raman) resonance frequency. If \u201clength of light pulses is shorter than all involved time constants\u201d (Lamb (1971)), an \u201cimpulsive stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) \u201d (Yan, Gamble & Nelson (1985)) works: While light generated by incoherent Raman at a shifted frequency has a phase independent on phase of exciting light, thus generates a new spectral line, coherence between incident and scattered light allows their interference into a single frequency, thus shifts incident frequency.\nAssume that a star radiates a continuous light spectrum up to X rays. Lyman frequencies are absorbed in this light and pump atoms mainly to first excited state. In this state, hyperfine periods are longer than 1 ns, so that an ISRS \u201cmay\u201d redshift light frequency, populating high hyperfine levels. Another ISRS \u201cmay\u201d transfer energy from hyperfine levels to thermal electromagnetic waves, so that redshift is permanent. Temperature of a light beam is defined from frequency and spectral radiance by Planck's formula. As entropy must increase, \u201cmay\u201d becomes \u201cdoes\u201d. \nHowever, where a previously absorbed line (first Lyman beta, ...) reaches Lyman alpha frequency, redshifting process stops and all hydrogen lines are strongly absorbed. But the stop is not perfect if there is energy at frequency shifted to Lyman beta frequency, which produces a slow redshift. Successive redshifts separated by Lyman absorptions generate many absorption lines, frequencies of which, deduced from absorption process, obey a law more dependable than Karlsson's formula.\n\nThe previous process excites more and more atoms because a de-excitation obeys Einstein's law of coherent interactions: Variation dI of radiance I of a light beam along a path dx is dI=BIdx,  where B is Einstein amplification coefficient which depends on medium.  I is the modulus of Poynting vector of field, absorption occurs for an opposed vector, which corresponds to a change of sign of B. Factor I in this formula shows that intense rays are more amplified than weak ones (competition of modes). Emission of a flare requires a sufficient radiance I provided by random zero point field. After emission of a flare, weak B increases by pumping while I remains close to zero: De-excitation by a coherent emission involves stochastic parameters of zero point field, as observed close to quasars (and in polar auroras).\n\n===Structures===\n[[File:Three-dim-pillars-creation.jpg|thumb|Three-dimensional structure in [[Pillars of Creation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pillars of Creation Revealed in 3D|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1518/|accessdate=14 June 2015 |publisher=European Southern Observatory |date=30 April 2015}}</ref>]]\n[[File:The Local Interstellar Cloud and neighboring G-cloud complex.gif|thumb|200px|Map showing the [[Sun]] located near the edge of the Local Interstellar Cloud and [[Alpha Centauri]] about 4 [[light-year]]s away in the neighboring [[G-Cloud]] complex]]\n\nThe ISM is [[turbulence|turbulent]] and therefore full of structure on all spatial scales. [[Star formation|Stars are born]] deep inside large complexes of [[molecular clouds]], typically a few [[parsec]]s in size. During their lives and deaths, [[star]]s interact physically with the ISM.\n\n[[Stellar wind]]s from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant [[HII region]]s surrounding them) and [[shock wave]]s created by [[supernova]]e inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures \u2013 of varying sizes \u2013 can be observed, such as [[stellar wind bubble]]s and [[superbubble]]s of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in [[radio telescope]] maps.\n\nThe [[Sun]] is currently traveling through the [[Local Interstellar Cloud]], a denser region in the low-density [[Local Bubble]].\n\n===Interaction with interplanetary medium===\n[[File:Short, narrated video about IBEX's interstellar matter observations.ogv|thumb|left|350px|Short, narrated video about [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer|IBEX's]] interstellar matter observations.]]\nThe interstellar medium begins where the [[interplanetary medium]] of the [[Solar System]] ends. The [[solar wind]] slows to [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities at the [[termination shock]], 90\u2013100 [[astronomical unit]]s from the [[Sun]]. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the [[heliosheath]], interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind. [[Voyager 1]], the farthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/fastfacts.html |title=Voyager: Fast Facts |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}</ref>), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the [[Heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]] on August 25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM {{harvard citation|Stone|Cummings|McDonald|Heikkila|2005}}.\n\n===Interstellar extinction===\n\nThe ISM is also responsible for [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinction]] and [[interstellar reddening|reddening]], the decreasing [[Radiance|light intensity]] and shift in the dominant observable [[wavelength]]s of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of [[photon]]s and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky. The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the [[Milky Way]] \u2013 a uniform disk of stars \u2013 are caused by absorption of background starlight by molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth.\n\n[[Far ultraviolet|Far ultraviolet light]] is absorbed effectively by the neutral components of the ISM. For example, a typical absorption wavelength of atomic [[hydrogen]] lies at about 121.5 nanometers, the [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]] transition. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at that wavelength from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen.\n\n== Heating and cooling ==\n\nThe ISM is usually far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Collisions establish a [[Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution]] of velocities, and the 'temperature' normally used to describe interstellar gas is the 'kinetic temperature', which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly that of an [[Stellar classification#Class A|A star]] (surface temperature of ~10,000 [[Kelvin|K]]) highly diluted. Therefore, [[energy level|bound levels]] within an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] in the ISM are rarely populated according to the Boltzmann formula {{harv|Spitzer|1978|loc=&sect; 2.4}}.\n\nDepending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the [[gas]].\n\n=== Heating mechanisms ===\n\n; Heating by low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s: The first mechanism proposed for heating the ISM was heating by low-energy [[cosmic rays]]. [[Cosmic ray]]s are an efficient heating source able to penetrate in the depths of molecular clouds. [[Cosmic ray]]s transfer energy to [[gas]] through both ionization and excitation and to free [[electron]]s through [[Coulomb]] interactions. Low-energy [[cosmic ray]]s (a few [[MeV]]) are more important because they are far more numerous than high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s.\n\n; Photoelectric heating by grains: The [[ultraviolet]] radiation emitted by hot [[star]]s can remove [[electron]]s from dust grains. The [[photon]] is absorbed by the dust grain, and some of its energy is used to overcome the potential energy barrier and remove the [[electron]] from the grain. This potential barrier is due to the binding energy of the electron (the [[work function]]) and the charge of the grain. The remainder of the photon's energy gives the ejected [[electron]] [[kinetic energy]] which heats the gas through collisions with other particles. A typical size distribution of dust grains is ''n''(''r'')&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''r''{{sup|\u22123.5}}, where ''r'' is the radius of the dust particle.<ref>{{cite journal | author1=Mathis, J.S. | author2=Rumpl, W. | author3=Nordsieck, K.H. | title=The size distribution of interstellar grains|journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=217 | pages=425 | bibcode=1977ApJ...217..425M | doi=10.1086/155591| year=1977 }}</ref> Assuming this, the projected grain surface area distribution is ''\u03c0r''{{sup|2}}''n''(''r'')&nbsp;\u221d&nbsp;''r''{{sup|\u22121.5}}.

This heating mechanism dominates in H&nbsp;II regions, but is negligible in the diffuse ISM due to the relative lack of neutral [[carbon]] [[atom]]s.\n\n; [[X-ray]] heating: [[X-ray]]s remove [[electron]]s from [[atom]]s and [[ion]]s, and those photoelectrons can provoke secondary ionizations. As the intensity is often low, this heating is only efficient in warm, less dense atomic medium (as the column density is small). For example, in molecular clouds only hard [[x-ray]]s can penetrate and [[x-ray]] heating can be ignored. This is assuming the region is not near an [[x-ray]] source such as a [[supernova remnant]].\n\n; Chemical heating: Molecular [[hydrogen]] (H<sub>2</sub>) can be formed on the surface of dust grains when two [[Hydrogen|H]] atoms (which can travel over the grain) meet. This process yields 4.48&nbsp;eV of energy distributed over the rotational and vibrational modes, kinetic energy of the H<sub>2</sub> molecule, as well as heating the dust grain. This kinetic energy, as well as the energy transferred from de-excitation of the hydrogen molecule through collisions, heats the gas.\n\n; Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas atoms and molecules with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This is not important in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It is also not important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.\n\nGrain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high.\n\nGas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds (especially at high densities). Far [[infrared]] radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient:\n:<math>\\alpha = \\frac{T_2 - T}{T_d - T}</math>\nwhere ''T'' is the gas temperature, ''T<sub>d</sub>'' the dust temperature, and ''T''<sub>2</sub> the post-collision temperature of the gas atom or molecule. This coefficient was measured by {{harvard citation|Burke|Hollenbach|1983}} as ''\u03b1''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.35.\n\n; Other heating mechanisms: A variety of macroscopic heating mechanisms are present including:\n:* [[Gravitational collapse]] of a cloud\n:* [[Supernova]] explosions\n:* [[Stellar wind]]s\n:* Expansion of [[H II region|H&nbsp;II regions]]\n:* [[Magnetohydrodynamic]] waves created by supernova remnants\n\n=== Cooling mechanisms ===\n\n; Fine structure cooling: The process of fine structure cooling is dominant in most regions of the Interstellar Medium, except regions of hot [[gas]] and regions deep in molecular clouds. It occurs most efficiently with abundant [[atom]]s having fine structure levels close to the fundamental level such as: C&nbsp;II and O&nbsp;I in the neutral medium and O&nbsp;II, O&nbsp;III, N&nbsp;II, N&nbsp;III, Ne&nbsp;II and Ne&nbsp;III in H&nbsp;II regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which will carry the energy out of the region.\n\n; Cooling by permitted lines: At lower temperatures, more levels than fine structure levels can be populated via collisions. For example, collisional excitation of the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 level of [[hydrogen]] will release a Ly-\u03b1 photon upon de-excitation. In molecular clouds, excitation of rotational lines of [[carbon monoxide|CO]] is important. Once a [[molecule]] is excited, it eventually returns to a lower energy state, emitting a photon which can leave the region, cooling the cloud.\n\n== Radiowave propagation ==\n[[File:Micrwavattrp.png|thumb|400px|Atmospheric attenuation in [[decibel|dB]]/km as a function of frequency over the EHF band. Peaks in absorption at specific frequencies are a problem, due to atmosphere constituents such as water vapor (H<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).]]\n\nRadio waves from \u224810&nbsp;kHz ([[very low frequency]]) to \u2248300&nbsp;GHz ([[extremely high frequency]]) propagate differently in interstellar space than on the Earth's surface. There are many sources of interference and signal distortion that do not exist on Earth. A great deal of [[radio astronomy]] depends on compensating for the different propagation effects to uncover the desired signal.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvKDoQVevAI | title= Interstellar Medium Interference (video) | author=Samantha Blair | work=SETI Talks}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lkb0o-oUbso | title=Voyager 1 Experiences Three Tsunami Waves in Interstellar Space (video) | work=JPL}}</ref>\n\n==Discoveries==\n[[Image:Great Refractor Potsdam.jpg|thumb|right|300px| The [[Potsdam Great Refractor]] a double telescope with a 80cm (31.5\") and 50 cm (19.5\") lenses inagurated in 1899, used to discover interstellar calcium in 1904.]]\nIn 1864, William Huggins uses spectroscopy to determine that a nebula is made of gas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/first-planetary-nebula-spectrum-08142014/|title=The First Planetary Nebula Spectrum|date=2014-08-14|website=Sky & Telescope|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref> Huggins had a private observatory with a 8-inch telescope, with a lens by Alvin Clark;  but it was equipped for spectroscopy which enabled breakthrough observations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/Bios/huggins.html|title=William Huggins (1824-1910)|website=www.messier.seds.org|access-date=2019-11-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 1904, one of the discoveries made using the [[Potsdam Great Refractor]] telescope was of Calcium in the interstellar medium.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VYvQ_8I_kTwC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=hartmann+interstellar+matter+potsdam#v=onepage&q=hartmann%20interstellar%20matter%20potsdam&f=false|title=The Cosmic Connection: How Astronomical Events Impact Life on Earth|last=Kanipe|first=Jeff|date=2011-01-27|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9781591028826|language=en}}</ref> The astronomer [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Professor Hartmann]] determined from spectrograph observations of the binary star [[Mintaka]] in Orion, that there was the element [[calcium]] in the intervening space.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nInterstellar gas was further confirmed by Slipher in 1909, and then by 1912 interstellar dust was confirmed by Slipher.<ref>[http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/lowell/VMSlipher.xml]</ref> In this way the overall nature of the interstellar medium was confirmed in a series of discoveries and postulizations of its nature.<ref>[http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/lowell/VMSlipher.xml]</ref>\n\n==History of knowledge of interstellar space==\n[[File:Herbig-Haro object HH 110.jpeg|thumb|[[Herbig\u2013Haro 110]] object ejects gas through interstellar space.<ref>{{cite news|title=A geyser of hot gas flowing from a star|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1210/|accessdate=3 July 2012|newspaper=ESA/Hubble Press Release}}</ref> ]]\n\nThe nature of the interstellar medium has received the attention of astronomers and scientists over the centuries, and [[Timeline of knowledge about the interstellar and intergalactic medium|understanding of the ISM has developed]]. However, they first had to acknowledge the basic concept of \"interstellar\" space. The term appears to have been first used in print by {{harvtxt|Bacon|1626|loc=&sect; 354\u20135}}: \"The Interstellar Skie.. hath .. so much Affinity with the Starre, that there is a Rotation of that, as well as of the Starre.\" Later, [[natural philosopher]] {{harvard citations|first=Robert | last=Boyle | year=1674 | txt=yes | authorlink=Robert Boyle}} discussed \"The inter-stellar part of heaven, which several of the modern [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] would have to be empty.\"\n\nBefore modern [[electromagnetic theory]], early [[physicist]]s postulated that an invisible [[luminiferous aether]] existed as a medium to carry lightwaves. It was assumed that this aether extended into interstellar space, as {{harvtxt|Patterson|1862}} wrote, \"this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the [[Aether (classical element)|ether]] which fills the interstellar spaces.\"\n\nThe advent of deep photographic imaging allowed [[Edward Emerson Barnard|Edward Barnard]] to produce the first images of [[dark nebula]]e silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy, while the first actual detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space was made by [[Johannes Franz Hartmann|Johannes Hartmann]] in 1904<ref>{{Citation|authorlink=Isaac Asimov|first=Isaac|last=Asimov|title=Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology|edition=2nd|title-link=Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology}}</ref> through the use of [[absorption spectrum|absorption line spectroscopy]]. In his historic study of the spectrum and orbit of [[Delta Orionis]], Hartmann observed the light coming from this star and realized that some of this light was being absorbed before it reached the Earth. Hartmann reported that absorption from the \"K\" line of [[calcium]] appeared \"extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp\" and also reported the \"quite surprising result that the calcium line at 393.4&nbsp;nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the [[spectroscopic binary]] star\". The stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of Delta Orionis, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line-of-sight to this star. This discovery launched the study of the Interstellar Medium.\n\nIn the series of investigations, [[Viktor Ambartsumian]] introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds.<ref>{{Citation | title= To Victor Ambartsumian on his 80th birthday | author=S. Chandrasekhar | author-link=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | journal= Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy | volume=18 | issue=1 | pages=408\u2013409 | doi=10.1007/BF01005852|bibcode = 1988Ap.....29..408C | year= 1989 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Hartmann's identification of interstellar calcium absorption, interstellar [[sodium]] was detected by {{harvtxt|Heger|1919}} through the observation of stationary absorption from the atom's \"D\" lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nanometres towards Delta Orionis and [[Beta Scorpii]].\n\nSubsequent observations of the \"H\" and \"K\" lines of calcium by {{harvtxt|Beals|1936}} revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of [[Epsilon Orionis|Epsilon]] and [[Zeta Orionis]]. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]]. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the \"K\" line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different [[Radial velocity|radial velocities]]. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth) the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either [[Blueshift|blue-shifted]] or [[Red shift|red-shifted]] (respectively) from the lines' rest wavelength, through the [[Doppler Effect]]. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.\n\n[[File:Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar.jpg|thumb|This light-year-long knot of interstellar gas and dust resembles a [[caterpillar]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hubble sees a cosmic caterpillar|url=http://www.spacetelescope.org/images/opo1335a/|work=Image Archive|publisher=ESA/Hubble|accessdate=9 September 2013}}</ref> ]]\n\nThe growing evidence for interstellar material led {{harvtxt|Pickering|1912}} to comment that \"While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by [[Jacobus Kapteyn|Kapteyn]], is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous [[molecule]]s are certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the [[Sun]] and [[star]]s.\"\n\nThe same year [[Victor Francis Hess|Victor Hess]]'s discovery of [[cosmic rays]], highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year the Norwegian explorer and physicist [[Kristian Birkeland]] wrote: \"It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric [[ion]]s of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or [[nebula]]e, but in 'empty' space\" {{harv|Birkeland|1913}}.\n\n{{harvtxt|Thorndike|1930}} noted that \"it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void. Terrestrial aurorae are not improbably excited by charged particles emitted by the [[Sun]].<!--transcription: one of these phrases may be duplicative--> If the millions of other [[star]]s are also ejecting [[ion]]s, as is undoubtedly true, no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy.\"\n\nIn September 2012, [[NASA|NASA scientists]] reported that [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons|polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)]], subjected to ''interstellar medium (ISM)'' conditions, are transformed, through [[hydrogenation]], [[Oxygenate|oxygenation]] and [[hydroxylation]], to more complex [[Organic compound|organics]] \u2013 \"a step along the path toward [[amino acids]] and [[nucleotides]], the raw materials of [[proteins]] and [[DNA]], respectively\".<ref name=\"Space-20120920\">{{Citation|author=Staff |title=NASA Cooks Up Icy Organics to Mimic Life's Origins|url=http://www.space.com/17681-life-building-blocks-nasa-organic-molecules.html|date=September 20, 2012 |publisher=[[Space.com]] |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |postscript=}}</ref><ref name=\"AJL-20120901\">{{Citation |last1=Gudipati |first1=Murthy S. |last2=Yang |first2=Rui|title=In-Situ Probing Of Radiation-Induced Processing Of Organics In Astrophysical Ice Analogs\u2014Novel Laser Desorption Laser Ionization Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectroscopic Studies|date=September 1, 2012 |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]] |volume=756 |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/756/1/L24|bibcode = 2012ApJ...756L..24G |issue=1 |pages=L24 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/ede2f6ae9403982583fc2496a25fb07fa7c2891a }}</ref> Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic signature]] which could be one of the reasons \"for the lack of PAH detection in [[interstellar ice]] [[Cosmic dust#Dust grain formation|grains]], particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of [[protoplanetary disks]].\"<ref name=\"Space-20120920\" /><ref name=\"AJL-20120901\" />\n\nIn February 2014, [[NASA]] announced a greatly upgraded database<ref>{{cite web |title=PAH IR Spectroscopic Database |url=http://www.astrochem.org/pahdb/ |work=The Astrophysics & Astrochemistry Laboratory |publisher=[[Ames Research Center|NASA Ames Research Center]] |accessdate=October 20, 2019}}</ref> for tracking [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs) in the universe.

The work may be difficult, dangerous, climatically challenging or underpaid. Workers in sweatshops may work long hours with low pay, regardless of laws mandating overtime pay or a [[minimum wage]]; [[child labor]] laws may also be violated.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective. In 2014 Apple was caught \"failing to protect its workers\" in one of its Pegatron factories. Overwhelmed workers were caught falling asleep during their 12-hour shifts and an undercover reporter had to work 18 days in a row.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463|title=Apple 'failing to protect Chinese factory workers' |website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 10, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops in question carry characteristics such as compulsory pregnancy tests for female laborers and terrorization from supervisors into submission.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/leading-article-the-gruesome-reality-of-sweatshops-2094318.html|title=Leading Article: The Gruesome Reality of Sweatshops |work=Independent.co.uk |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=April 2, 2013}}</ref> Workers then go into a state of forced labor, if even one day of work is not accounted for, most are immediately fired. These working conditions have been the source of suicidal unrest within factories in the past.

Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike's image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers\u2019 life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights.<ref name=\"businessinsider.com\">Nisen, M.

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure.

Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor.

However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

In Pakistan, several sweatshops closed, including ones run by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Reebok]], and other corporations\u2014which caused some of those Pakistani children to turn to prostitution. In Nepal, a carpet manufacturing company closed several sweatshops, resulting in thousands of Nepalese girls turning to prostitution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |title=Third World Workers Need Western Jobs |publisher=Foxnews.com |date=May 6, 2004 |access-date=March 31, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816030549/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,119125,00.html |archive-date=August 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\nA 1996 study of corporate codes of conduct in the apparel industry by the U.S. Department of Labor has concluded that corporate codes of conduct that monitor labor norms in the apparel industry, rather than boycott or eliminate contracts upon the discovery of violations of internationally recognized labor norms, are a more effective way to eliminate child labor and the exploitation of children, provided they provide for effective monitoring that includes the participation of workers and their knowledge of the standards to which their employers are subject.<ref>{{citation |title=The Apparel Industry and Codes of Conduct: A Solution to the International Child Labor Problem? |author=U.S. Department of Labor |url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202211838/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/apparel/overview.htm |archive-date=February 2, 2014 |df= }}</ref>\n\nArguably, the United States underwent a similar process during its own industrialization where child labor and the suppression of worker organizations were prevalent.  According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty. According to a November 2001 [[BBC]] article, in the previous two months, 100,000 sweatshop workers in Bangladesh had been put off work.

To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and inadequate labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruptions and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops. Without reasonable law restrictions, capitalists are able to set up fashion manufacturing plants at a lower cost. According to Zamen (2012),<ref>Zamen, I.

According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels. Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004)<ref>Harrison, A. & Scorse, J. (2004) The Nike effect: Anti-sweatshop activists and labor market outcomes in Indonesia. Economics department of Yale University.</ref> mentions that most of the workers do not know about their rights, such as matters about wages and supposed working conditions, thus they have no skill set to fight for their labour rights through collective bargain (such as strike or work to rule). Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought. According to the International Labour Office (2013),<ref>International Labor Office (2013). Making progress against child labour. Retrieved from http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---ipec/documents/publication/wcms_221513.pdf.</ref> more than 250 million children are in the employment of which 170 million of them are engaged in textiles and garments industry in developing countries. In hopes of earning a living, many girls in these countries, such as Bangladesh and India, are willing to work at low wages for long working hours, said Sofie Ovaa, an officer of Stop Child Labour (Moulds, 2013).<ref>Moulds, J. (2013) Child labor in the fashion supply chain. theguardian. Retrieved from https://labs.theguardian.com/unicef-child-labour/.</ref> Most fashion manufacturing chains employ low-skilled labour and as child labour are easier to manage and even more suitable than adult labour for certain jobs such as cotton picking, it becomes a particular problem in sweatshops as they are vulnerable with no backups.\n\n===Environmental pollution===\nNot only workers are impacted by sweatshops, but the neighboring environment as well, through lax environmental laws set up in developing countries to help reduce the production cost of the fashion industry. Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste. The Burigana River in Bangladesh is now black in colour and pronounced biologically dead because neighbouring leather tanneries are discharging more than 150 cubics of liquid waste daily.

The terms ''sweater'' for the middleman and ''sweat system'' for the process of subcontracting [[piecework]] were used in early critiques like [[Charles Kingsley]]'s ''Cheap Clothes and Nasty'', written in 1850, which described conditions in London, England. The workplaces created for the '''sweating system''' (a system of subcontracting in the [[tailor]]ing trade) were called ''sweatshops'' and might contain only a few workers or as many as 300 and more.\n\nBetween 1832 and 1850, sweatshops attracted the rural poor to rapidly growing cities, and attracted immigrants to places such as London and New York City's garment district, located near the [[tenement]]s of New York's [[Lower East Side]]. These sweatshops incurred criticism: labor leaders cited them as crowded, poorly ventilated, and prone to fires and [[rat]] infestations: in many cases, there were many workers crowded into small tenement rooms.\n\nIn the 1890s, a group calling itself the [[National Anti-Sweating League]] was formed in [[Melbourne]] and campaigned successfully for a [[minimum wage]] via trade boards.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/goldstein-vida-jane-6418|title=Goldstein, Vida Jane (1869\u20131949)|last=Brownfoot|first=Janice N.|publisher=National Centre of Biography, Australian National University|location=Canberra}}</ref> A group with the same name campaigned from 1906 in the UK, resulting in the [[Trade Boards Act 1909]].<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43\u201364 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]] was founded to try to improve the condition of these workers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://womenshistory.about.com/od/worklaborunions/a/ilgwu.htm|title=ILGWU|website=About.com Education|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of garment sweatshops became a major force behind workplace safety regulation and [[labor laws]]. As some journalists strove to change working conditions, the term ''sweatshop'' came to refer to a broader set of workplaces whose conditions were considered inferior. In the United States, [[investigative journalism|investigative journalists]], known as [[muckraker]]s, wrote expos\u00e9s of business practices, and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] politicians campaigned for new laws. Notable expos\u00e9s of sweatshop conditions include [[Jacob Riis]]' [[photo journalism|photo documentary]] ''[[How the Other Half Lives]]'' and [[Upton Sinclair]]'s book, ''[[The Jungle]]'', a fictionalized account of the [[meat packing industry]].\n\n[[File:Millville, New Jersey - Dresses.

The pivotal role of this time and place is chronicled at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, part of the [[Lower East Side Tenement National Historic Site]]. While trade unions, [[minimum wage]] laws, [[fire safety]] codes, and labour laws have made sweatshops (in the original sense) rarer in the [[developed world]], they did not eliminate them, and the term is increasingly associated with factories in the [[developing world]].\n\nIn a report issued in 1994, the United States [[Government Accountability Office]] found that there were still thousands of sweatshops in the United States, using a definition of a ''sweatshop'' as any \"employer that violates more than one federal or state labor law governing minimum wage and overtime, child labor, industrial [[homeworker|homework]], occupational safety and health, workers' compensation, or industry registration\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/he95029.pdf |title=Garment Industry : Efforts to Address the Prevalence and Conditions of Sweatshops |publisher=Gao.gov |accessdate=March 31, 2015}}</ref> This recent definition eliminates any historical distinction about the role of a middleman or the items produced, and focuses on the legal standards of developed country workplaces. An area of controversy between supporters of outsourcing production to the [[Third World]] and the anti-sweatshop movement is whether such standards can or should be applied to the workplaces of the developing world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nSweatshops are also sometimes implicated in [[human trafficking]] when workers have been tricked into starting work without [[informed consent]], or when workers are kept at work through [[debt bondage]] or mental duress, all of which are more likely if the workforce is drawn from children or the uneducated rural poor.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Because they often exist in places without effective workplace safety or environmental laws, sweatshops sometimes injure their workers or the environment at greater rates than would be acceptable in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Sometimes [[penal labor]] facilities (employing prisoners) are grouped under the sweatshop label.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} \n\nSweatshops conditions resemble prison labor in many cases, especially from a commonly found Western perspective.

Since 1850, immigrants have been flocking to work at sweatshops in cities like London and New York for more than one century. Many of them worked in tiny, stuffy rooms which are prone to fire hazards and rat infestations. The term sweatshop was used from Charles Kingsley's Cheap Clothes and Nasty (1850) describing such workplaces create \u2018sweating system\u2019 of workers. (Blackburn, 1991)<ref>Blackburn, S. (1991) Ideology and social policy. The Historical Journals.</ref> The idea of minimum wage and Labour's union was not developed until the 1890s. This issue appears to be solved by some anti-sweatshops organisation. However, the ongoing development of the issue is showing a different situation.\n\nWorld-known fashion brands such as [[H&M]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]] and [[Uniqlo]] are all involved in such issues of sweatshops. In 2015, anti-sweatshops protesters marched against the Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo in Hong Kong. Along with the Japanese anti-sweatshops organisation, [[Human Rights Now!]], Hong Kong Labour Organisation Students and Scholars against Corporate Misbehaviour ([[Students and Scholars Against Corporate Misbehaviour|SACOM]]) protested for the \"harsh and dangerous\" working conditions in Uniqlo's value-added factories in China.<ref>The Fashion Law (2015).

They are organised by the [[United Students Against Sweatshops]] (USAS) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike's contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with \"temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees\".<ref>Bain, M.

Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike's image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers\u2019 life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights.<ref name=\"businessinsider.com\">Nisen, M.

Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.\n\n==Anti-sweatshop movement==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th century [[abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom several years after the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Miers|first=Suzanne|year=2003|title=Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem|publisher=Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California}}</ref>\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the first effective [[Factory Acts|Factory Act]] was introduced in 1833 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor; but this applied only to textile factories. Later Acts extended protection to factories in other industries, but not until 1867 was there any similar protection for employees in small workshops, and not until 1891 was it possible to effectively enforce the legislation where the workplace was a dwelling (as was often the case for sweatshops). The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|title=Fair Labor Standards Act \u2013 FLSA \u2013 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8|work=finduslaw.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516054443/http://finduslaw.com/fair_labor_standards_act_flsa_29_u_s_code_chapter_8|archive-date=May 16, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOn February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of [[North Olmsted]], in the U.S. state of [[Ohio]], introduced the first piece of legislation prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners and incarcerated criminals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.villagelife.org/news/archives/12-4-97_sweatshopban.html|title=Village Life News: Ban on Sweatshop Products Becomes Rule|website=www.villagelife.org|access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> Similar legislation was subsequently passed in other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}  Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately endorsed, and he was invited by President [[Bill Clinton]] to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nClothing and footwear [[Factory|factories]] overseas have progressively improved working conditions because the high demand of [[anti-sweatshop movement]], labour right advocates.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.laborrights.org/in-the-news/anti-sweatshop-movement-achieving-gains-overseas|title=Anti-Sweatshop Movement Is Achieving Gains Overseas {{!}} International Labor Rights Forum|website=www.laborrights.org|access-date=May 17, 2016}}</ref> Sweatshops overseas have been receiving enormous amounts of pressure. Around the working conditions from college students, and other opponents of sweatshops which has led to some of the powerful companies like [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and the Gap who have agreed to cut back on [[child labour]],<ref name=\":3\" /> restrict the use of dangerous and poisonous [[Chemical substance|chemicals]], and drop the average rate of employees working 80-hour weeks, according to groups that monitor such factories. Labour advocates say, this could be a major turning point after 4 decades of workers in Asia and Latin American factories being under paid, under appreciated and working in an unsafe environment.\n\nRecently, there have been strides to eradicate sweatshops through government action, for example by increasing the minimum wage. In China, a developing country that is known to be a hub for sweatshops due to relaxed labor laws, high population and low minimum wage, the minimum wage is set to be raised by approximately 7% in 10 provinces by the end of 2018.<ref>CBNEditor. (May 26, 2018). 10 Chinese Provinces Raise Minimum Wages Levels in 2018. Retrieved September 21, 2018, from China Banking News: http://www.chinabankingnews.com/2018/05/26/10-chinese-provinces-raise-minimum-wages-level-since-start-2018/</ref> As well as this governments are also enforcing stricter labor laws such as in 2013 after the collapse of Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, a large 5 storied sweatshops that killed 1135 people due to the building not being up to code, Bangladeshi police shut down many other factories after safety checks were completed and not met. However, no action has been as beneficial to the anti-sweatshop movement as that of the rise of social media. Social media has allowed for the world to see exactly what companies are doing and how they are doing it instantaneously, for free and is distributed to a wide audience. The platforms have allowed for viral videos, hundreds of thousands of retweets of quote's or statistic's, millions of liked and shared pictures etc. to be spread to consumers in regards to companies production methods without any censorship and thus forces brands to be more transparent and ethical with their production practices. This is because it is now very for a brands exemplary reputation to be completely destroyed by a bystander with a smart phone who happens to see a brands product being made in a sweatshop where its workers are treated inhumanely and simply uploading their findings. If a brands reputation is negative they are likely to lose customers as more and more consumers begin to care about sustainable and ethical products thus the fewer consumers the fewer sales and the less profit.\n\nHowever, social media isn\u2019t just helping to expose brands who are using sweatshops and unethical production practices but also is allowing for companies that are trying to increase awareness of the anti-sweatshop movement to spread their message quickly and efficiently. For example, in May 2017 Mama Cash and The Clean Clothes Campaign, both organizations that are working towards abolishing sweatshops as well as creating a world of sustainable and ethical apparel practices, worked together to create The Women Power Fashion Pop-up.<ref name=\"fashionunited.uk\">Hendriksz, V.

Even after escaping the sweatshop industry the workers need a job to sustain themselves and their families. For example, in Bangladesh, a country in which has one of the lowest minimum wages in the world, of $68 per month,<ref name=\"theguardian.com\">The Guardian. (July 18, 2016).

In particular, he compares the [[Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire]] in 1911 New York to the [[2013 Dhaka garment factory collapse|collapse of Rana Plaza]] in 2013 Bangladesh. He argues that the former galvanized the population to political activism that eventually pushed through reforms not only pertaining to workplace safety, but also the [[minimum wage]], the [[eight-hour day]], [[workers' compensation]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]], and the [[Clean Water Act]]. American corporations responded by shifting production to developing nations where such protections did not exist. Loomis elaborates:\n\n{{quote|So in 2013, when over 1100 workers die at Rana Plaza in Bangladesh, it is the same industry as the Triangle Fire, with the same subcontracted system of production that allows apparel companies to avoid responsibility for work as the Triangle Fire, and with the same workforce of young and poor women, the same type of cruel bosses, and the same terrible workplace safety standards as the Triangle Fire. The difference is that most of us can't even find Bangladesh on a map, not to mention know enough about it to express the type of outrage our ancestors did after Triangle.

The theory holds that developing countries improve their condition by doing something that they do \"better\" than industrialized nations (in this case, they charge less but do the same work). Developed countries will also be better off because their workers can shift to jobs that they do better. These are jobs that some economists say usually entail a level of education and training that is exceptionally difficult to obtain in the developing world. Thus, economists like Sachs say, developing countries get factories and jobs that they would not otherwise. Some{{Who|date=September 2011}} would say with this situation occurs when developing countries try to increase wages because sweatshops tend to just get moved on to a new state that is more welcoming. This leads to a situation where states often don't try to increase wages for sweatshop workers for fear of losing investment and boosted GDP. However, this only means average wages around the world will increase at a steady rate. A nation only gets left behind if it demands wages higher than the current market price for that labor.\n\nWhen asked about the working condition in sweatshops, proponents say that although wages and working conditions may appear inferior by the standards of developed nations, they are actually improvements over what the people in developing countries had before. It is said that if jobs in such factories did not improve their workers' [[standard of living]], those workers would not have taken the jobs when they appeared. It is also often pointed out that, unlike in the industrialized world, the sweatshops are not replacing high-paying jobs. Rather, sweatshops offer an improvement over [[subsistence farming]] and other back-breaking tasks, or even prostitution, trash picking, or [[starvation]] by unemployment.<ref name=\"meyerson\" /><ref>{{cite news| last =Kristof| first =Nicholas| authorlink =Nicholas Kristof| title =Inviting All Democrats| work =The New York Times| date =January 14, 2004| url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| archive-url =https://archive.is/20120526094048/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE0DD1330F937A25752C0A9629C8B63| url-status =dead| archive-date =May 26, 2012| access-date =April 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe absence of the work opportunities provided by sweatshops can quickly lead to malnourishment or starvation.

According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new industrialized economy, the labor movement drove the rise in the average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.\n\nIn contrast, similar efforts in developing nations have not produced the same results, because of corruption and lack of democracy in communist nations such as China and Vietnam, worker intimidation and murder in Latin America\u2014and corruption throughout the developing world. These barriers prevent creation of similar legal protections for workers in these countries, as numerous studies by the International Labour Organization show.<ref name=\"Corporations and Worker's Rights\">{{cite web| first =Anup| last =Shah| title=Corporations and Workers Rights |publisher =Global Issues| url =http://www.globalissues.org/article/57/corporations-and-workers-rights| accessdate =May 9, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, a boycott approach to protesting these conditions is likely to hurt workers willing to accept employment even under poor working conditions, as a loss of employment would result in a comparatively worse level of poverty.

To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders in a short period of time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, \"[[The True Cost]]\" (2015), claims that sweatshops relieve pressure on retailers by passing it to factory owners and, ultimately, workers.\n\n===Government corruption and immature labour protection legislation===\nGovernment corruptions and inadequate labour protection legislation in developing countries have also contributed to the suffering of their employees. Weak law enforcement has attracted capitalists to invest in these developing countries, which is also a serious problem that leads to arisen of sweatshops.

According to the UNESCO Institute of Statistics (2016),<ref>UNESCO Insititute of Statistics, (2016) Population by minimum completed level of education.</ref> most of these sweatshops are located in countries that have low education levels.

Their ignorance makes hard for them to improve working conditions on their own.\n\n==Impacts of sweatshops==\n===Child labour===\n{{main|Child labour}}\nChild labour is one of the most serious impacts that sweatshops have brought.

Clothing manufacturing is still one of the most polluting industries in the world. Nevertheless, the environment of developing countries remained deeply polluted by the untreated waste.
