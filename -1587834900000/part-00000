The Tigers played their home games at [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] in [[Auburn, Alabama]] and competed in the Western Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by fourth-year head coach [[Gus Malzahn]]. They finished the season 8\u20135, 5\u20133 in SEC play to finish in a tie for second place in the Western Division. They were invited to the [[2017 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] where they lost to [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]].\n\n==Before the season==\n\n===Previous season===\nThe 2015 Auburn Tigers began the season as the preseason pick to win the [[SEC Championship]] and a berth in the [[College Football Playoff]]. There was also hype about junior QB [[Jeremy Johnson (American football)|Jeremy Johnson]] who sat behind [[Nick Marshall]] in 2013 and 2014, being a [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate. The hiring of [[Will Muschamp]] as defensive coordinator was a major success for the Tigers after [[Ellis Johnson (American football coach)|Ellis Johnson]] was let go after a 55-44 defeat in the 2014 [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nThe Tigers' season began with some shocking surprises. In a week one showdown against [[2015 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]] in the [[Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game]], Auburn built a 24-0 lead, but Jeremy Johnson threw three interceptions and the Cardinals came back from 24-0 before finally falling to Auburn 31-24. Auburn suffered key injuries to Carl Lawson, Tray Matthews, [[Roc Thomas]] and Jovon Robinson. This with starting corner TJ Davis out with acl and [[Joshua Holsey]] sitting out. A week later, Auburn played against FCS foe [[2015 Jacksonville State Gamecocks football team|Jacksonville State]], Auburn again had a rough outing from both Jeremy Johnson and the Tigers' defense. The Tigers would fall to 2-2 and 0-2 in SEC play after being defeated by [[2015 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] and [[2015 Mississippi State Bulldogs football team|Mississippi State]]. The Tigers defeated [[2015 San Jose State Spartans football team|San Jose State]] and then got their first SEC win of the season at [[2015 Kentucky Wildcats football team|Kentucky]].\n\nAfter beating the Wildcats, Auburn would go on to lose four out of their remaining six regular season games. Those consisted of home losses to [[2015 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]] 20-13,  [[2015 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]] 29-13, [[2015 Ole Miss Rebels football team|Ole Miss]] 27-19, and a 4 four overtime loss on the road at [[2015 Arkansas Razorbacks football team|Arkansas]] 54-46. Auburn's two only wins in that time were against [[2015 Idaho Vandals football team|Idaho]] and [[2015 Texas A&M Aggies football team|Texas A&M]]. Auburn finished the season with a 6-6 season and earned a trip to the [[2015 Birmingham Bowl (December)|2015 Birmingham Bowl]] against [[2015 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]]. The Tigers beat Memphis 31-10 in Birmingham, giving coach [[Gus Malzahn]] his first bowl win and the team's first bowl win since 2011.\n\nFollowing the season, defensive coordinator [[Will Muschamp]] left the program to become the head coach at [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], joining him were Travaris Robinson, Lance Thompson, JB Grimes moved on as well to join Cincinnati's coaching staff.\n\n[[Kevin Steele]] was hired to be Auburn's new defensive coordinator, and assistants Wesley McGriff, Travis Williams, and Herb Hand were added to the staff.\n\nThe offseason saw numerous transfers including: RB Roc Thomas, TE Chris Laye, OL Jordan Diamond, OL Will Adams, DE Gimel President, LB Javiere Mitchell and S Tim Irvin.\n\nFollowing the season OL Avery Young and OL Shon Coleman chose to forgo their remaining eligibility by entering the 2016 NFL Draft.\n\nAuburn picked up transfers in Baylor RB Kameron Martin, Illinois LB TJ Neal and Miami, OH CB Marshall Taylor.\n\nTexas RT Darius James and Ohio St CB Jamal Dean now available after sitting out 2015.\nOn August third 2016 Senior running back Jovon Robinson was dismissed from the team.\n\n=== Returning starters===\n\n*QB \u2013 [[Sean White (American football)|Sean White]] - Redshirt Sophomore\n* H Back \u2013 [[Kamryn Pettway]]- Redshirt Sophomore\n* H Back- [[Chandler Cox]]- Sophomore\n* WR \u2013 Marcus Davis- Senior\n* LT \u2013 Austin Golson- Redshirt Junior (played center in 2015)\n*LG \u2013 Alex Kozan- Redshirt Senior\n*RG \u2013 [[Braden Smith]]- Junior\n* Buck \u2013 [[Carl Lawson (American football)|Carl Lawson]]- Redshirt Junior\n* NT \u2013 [[Montravius Adams]]- Senior\n* DT \u2013 [[Dontavius Russell]]- Redshirt Sophomore\n* NB \u2013 [[Rudy Ford|Jonathan Ford]]- Senior\n* DB \u2013 [[Josh Holsey]]- Redshirt Senior \n* CB \u2013 [[Carlton Davis]]- Sophomore\n* FS \u2013 Stephen Roberts- Junior\n*SS \u2013 Tray Matthews- Redshirt Junior\n* PK \u2013 [[Daniel Carlson (American football)|Daniel Carlson]]- Redshirt Sophomore\n* P \u2013 Kevin Phillips- Redshirt Junior\n\n=== Depth chart===\n\n*  '''Quarterback'''\n**  13 [[Sean White (American football)|Sean White]] \u2013 RSO 6' 204\n**  5 [[John Franklin III]] \u2013 RJR 6'1 176\n**  6 [[Jeremy Johnson (American football)|Jeremy Johnson]] \u2013 SR 6'5 234\n** 16 Devin Adams \u2013 RJR 6'4 248 (walk on)\n** 15 Tyler Queen \u2013 RFR 6'4 241 (injured)\n**  1 Woody Barrett \u2013 FR 6'2 238 (likely redshirt)\n* '''Running back'''\n**  21 [[Kerryon Johnson]] -SO 6'1 211\n**  36 [[Kamryn Pettway]] \u2013 RSO 6'2 242\n**  9 Kamryn Martin \u2013 FR 6' 177\n**  32 Malik Miller \u2013 FR 5'11 229 (injured)\n* '''H-Back/Tight end'''\n** 27 [[Chandler Cox]] \u2013 SO 6'1 236\n** 85 Jalen Harris \u2013 RFR 6'5 258\n* '''X Receiver'''\n** 80 Marcus Davis \u2013 SR 5'10 181\n**  3 Nate Craig Myers \u2013 FR 6'2 209\n**  4 Jason Smith \u2013 RJR 6'1 188\n* '''Y Receiver'''\n** 83 Ryan Davis \u2013 SO 5'9 172\n** 33 Will Hastings \u2013 SO 5'9 179 (kicker/walk on)\n** 19 Marquis McClain -FR 6'3 219\n* '''Z Receiver'''\n** 10 Stanton Truitt \u2013 RSO 5'10 188\n** 12 Eli Stove \u2013 FR 6' 177\n* '''F Receiver'''\n**  8 Tony Stevens- SR 6'4 212\n** 82 [[Darius Slayton]] \u2013 RFR 6'2 202\n** 11 Kyle Davis -FR 6'2 213\n* '''Left Tackle'''\n** 62 Darius James \u2013 RJR 6'5 320\n** 75 Deon Mix \u2013 RJR 6'4 312\n** 58 Bailey Sharpe \u2013 RFR 6'5 293\n* '''Left Guard'''\n** 63 Alex Kozan \u2013 RJR 6'4 310\n** 67 Marquel Harrell \u2013 RFR 6'3 318\n** ??

with a home contest against the 2015 national runner-up [[2016 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]].  This is considered a [[Auburn\u2013Clemson football rivalry|rivalry game]] for both schools.  Clemson came into the game ranked number 2 in the country while Auburn was unranked.  Auburn took an early lead on a long field goal by Daniel Carlson.  Clemson, however, responded with a drive of its own, which resulted in a touchdown on 4th down and goal from the 1-yard line.  Clemson would lead 10-3 going into halftime and add another field goal in the 3rd quarter to make the score 13-3 going into the 4th quarter.  Auburn cut the lead on another field goal by Daniel Carlson, but once again Clemson responded with another touchdown.  Auburn would score a touchdown with just over 3 minutes to play in the ballgame.  Auburn would then stop Clemson on the ensuing possession, but 2 hail mary attempts by Auburn were broken up in the end zone in the last 10 seconds of the ballgame and Clemson held on for the 19-13 victory.  Auburn would fall to 0-1, making this the first opening game loss for Auburn with [[Gus Malzahn]] as coach.\n\n===Arkansas State===\n{{See also|2016 Arkansas State Red Wolves football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Auburn Tigers}} ;text-align:center;\n|state= autocollapse\n|title= Arkansas State Red Wolves at Auburn Tigers \u2212 Game summary\n|date= September 10, 2016\n|time= 6:39 p.m.\n|road= Arkansas State\n|R1=7|R2=0|R3=7|R4=0\n|home= '''Auburn'''\n|H1=14|H2=24|H3=10|H4=3\n|stadium= Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium \u2022 Auburn, Alabama\n|attendance=86,825\n|weather= Temperature: 89\u00b0 \u2022 Wind: SW 6 mph \u2022 Weather: Sunny\n|referee= Matt Loeffler\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers=Brent Musburger (play-by-play), Jesse Palmer (analyst), [[Jeannine Edwards]] (sideline reporter)\n|reference= '''Sources''':<ref>http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2016-2017/au02.html</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* AUB \u2013 Kerryon Johnson 47 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 6:58 (AUB 7-0)\n* ASU \u2013 [[Chad Voytik]] 1 yd run (J.D.

They played Arkansas State out of the [[Sun Belt Conference]].  Auburn scored first but Arkansas State quickly answered with a long pass play that set up a touchdown to tie the game at 7.  Auburn scored next and never looked back scoring 31 unanswered points.  At halftime, the Tigers lead 38-7.  The final score was 51-14.  Sean White had 3 touchdowns, more than he had in all his past Auburn games combined.  The game was Auburn's best offensive performance, according to many writers, since the 2014 season.  Overall, this was a very impressive victory for Auburn, and for [[Gus Malzahn]], who used to coach at Arkansas State in 2012.  Auburn also remains unbeaten against the Sun Belt Conference after this win.\n\n===Texas A&M===\n{{See also|2016 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Auburn Tigers}} ;text-align:center;\n|state= autocollapse\n|title= #17 Texas A&M Aggies at Auburn Tigers \u2212 Game summary\n|date= September 17, 2016\n|time= 6:11 p.m.\n|road= '''#17 Texas A&M'''\n|R1=3|R2=13|R3=3|R4=10\n|home= Auburn\n|H1=7|H2=3|H3=0|H4=6\n|stadium= Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium \u2022 Auburn, Alabama\n|attendance=87,175\n|weather=Temperature: 81\u00b0 \u2022 Wind: SW 2 mph \u2022 Weather: Cloudy\n|referee= Matt Austin\n|TV= ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Dave Flemming]] (play-by-play), [[Brian Griese]] (analyst), [[Todd McShay]] (sideline reporter)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref>http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2016-2017/au03.html</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* AUB \u2013 Kamryn Pettway 1 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 7:11 (AUB 7-0)\n* TA&M \u2013 Daniel LaCamera 46 yd field goal, 1:42 (AUB 7-3)\n;Second Quarter\n* TA&M \u2013 Josh Reynolds 5 yd pass from [[Trevor Knight]] (Daniel LaCamera kick), 12:07 (TAMU 10-7)\n* TA&M \u2013 Daniel LaCamera 35 yd field goal, 5:38 (TAMU 13-7)\n* TA&M \u2013 Daniel LaCamera 31 yd field goal, 1:52 (TAMU 16-7)\n* AUB \u2013 Daniel Carlson 37 yd field goal, 0:00 (TAMU 16-10)\n;Third Quarter\n* TA&M \u2013 Daniel LaCamera 25 yd field goal, 1:03 (TAMU 19-10)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* TA&M \u2013 Daniel LaCamera 26 yd field goal, 10:13 (TAMU 22-10)\n* TA&M \u2013 Trayveon Williams 89 yd run (Daniel LaCamera kick), 6:52 (TAMU 29-10)\n* AUB \u2013 Kerryon Johnson 2 yd run (John Franklin pass failed), 2:59 (AUB 29-16)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* TA&M \u2212 [[Trevor Knight]] 20\u201340, 247 yds, 1 TD\n* AUB \u2212 [[Sean White (American football)|Sean White]]  18\u201327, 126 yds\n;Top Rushers\n* TA&M \u2212 Trayveon Williams 8 carries, 127 yds, 1 TD\n* AUB \u2212 Kamryn Pettway 20 carries, 123 yds, 1 TD\n;Top Receiving\n* TA&M \u2212 Josh Reynolds 7 receptions 98 yds\n* AUB \u2212 Tony Stevens 8 receptions, 86 yds\n}}\nThe third game of the season is the first conference game for Auburn.

Daniel Carlson was 6-6 on field goals in the game, including a 51-yard field goal.  Auburn held LSU star running back Leonard Fournette to less than half the yards they allowed him in 2015.

They played at Mississippi State where they had not won since 2010.  However, Auburn easily won the game.  After an early interception put the Bulldogs in good field position, the Tigers defense responded, holding Mississippi State to a field goal attempt that was no good.  Auburn seized the momentum after that.  Starting running back Kerryon Johnson got hurt early in the game, but Kamryn Pettway took over the game with a 169-yard performance including 3 touchdowns.  Also, the Auburn defense scored a touchdown when Carl Lawson forced a fumble which was picked up by Montravius Adams and returned 13 yards for a touchdown. Auburn led 35-0 at halftime.  The Tigers slowed down in the second half, only attempting one pass on offense.  The final score was 38-14.  It broke a two-game losing streak to the Bulldogs and improved Auburn's record to 4-2 and 2-1 in the SEC.  The win also propelled Auburn into the AP Poll the next week, as the Tigers were ranked #23.\n\n===Arkansas===\n{{See also|2016 Arkansas Razorbacks football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Auburn Tigers}} ;text-align:center;\n|state= autocollapse\n|title= #17 Arkansas Razorbacks at #21 Auburn Tigers \u2212 Game summary\n|date= October 22, 2016\n|time=5:01 p.m.\n|road= #17 Arkansas\n|R1=0|R2=3|R3=0|R4=0\n|home= '''#21 Auburn'''\n|H1=21|H2=7|H3=14|H4=14\n|stadium= Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium \u2022 Auburn, Alabama\n|attendance= 87,451\n|weather= Temperature: 67\u00b0 \u2022 Wind: NW 10 mph \u2022 Weather: Sunny\n|referee=Ken Williamson\n|TV=ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Joe Tessitore]] (play-by-play), [[Todd Blackledge]] (analyst), [[Holly Rowe]] (sideline reporter)\n|reference='''Sources''':<ref>http://www.auburntigers.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2016-2017/au07.html</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n* AUB \u2013 Eli Stove 78 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 11:00 (AUB 7\u20130)\n* AUB \u2013 Kamryn Pettway 9 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 3:00 (AUB 14\u20130)\n* AUB \u2013 Stanton Truitt 20 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 0:57 (AUB 21\u20130)\n;Second Quarter\n* AUB \u2013 Stanton Truitt 45 yd pass from [[Sean White (American football)|Sean White]] (Daniel Carlson kick), 1:28 (AUB 28\u20130)\n* ARK \u2013 Adam McFain 54 yd field goal, 0:00 (AUB 28\u20133)\n;Third Quarter\n* AUB \u2013 [[Sean White (American football)|Sean White]] 1 yd run, 6:06 (AUB 35\u20133)\n* AUB \u2013 Kamryn Pettway 23 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 0:42 (AUB 42\u20133)\n;Fourth Quarter\n* AUB \u2013 Stanton Truitt 32 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 12:25 (AUB 49\u20133)\n* AUB \u2013 Kam Martin 51 yd run (Daniel Carlson kick), 4:27 (AUB 56\u20133)\n|stats=\n;Top Passers\n* ARK \u2212 [[Austin Allen]] 17-30, 187 yds, 1 INT\n* AUB \u2212 [[Sean White (American football)|Sean White]] 6-11, 77 yds, 1 TD\n;Top Rushers\n* ARK \u2212 Rawleigh Williams 13 carries, 22 yds\n* AUB \u2212 Kamryn Pettway 27 carries, 192 yds, 2 TD\n;Top Receiving\n* ARK \u2212 Keon Hatcher 7 receptions, 87 yds\n* AUB \u2212 Ryan Davis 3 receptions, 15 yds\n}}\nAfter their only bye week of the season, Auburn played Arkansas in the seventh game of the year.

In an offensive shootout, Ole Miss quarterback [[Chad Kelly]] set the Ole Miss school record for most passing attempt and most passing yards in a single game.  However, Auburn had just as much success rushing as Ole Miss had passing.  Kamryn Pettway had a career-high 236 yards.  The key play came late in the game with Auburn leading 33\u201329 and Ole Miss driving down the field for the go-ahead touchdown.  Ole Miss tight end [[Evan Engram]] dropped a pass which would have likely resulted in a touchdown.  On the next play, Auburn defender Josh Holsey intercepted quarterback Chad Kelly's pass and returned it the Ole Miss 30 yard line.  That set up a Kerryon Johnson touchdown that made it a two possession game, ultimately sealing the win for Auburn.  Auburn became bowl eligible with their 6th win of the year.

The Tigers played their home games at [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] in [[Auburn, Alabama]] and competed in the Western Division of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). They were led by fourth-year head coach [[Gus Malzahn]]. They finished the season 8\u20135, 5\u20133 in SEC play to finish in a tie for second place in the Western Division. They were invited to the [[2017 Sugar Bowl|Sugar Bowl]] where they lost to [[2016 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]].\n\n==Before the season==\n\n===Previous season===\nThe 2015 Auburn Tigers began the season as the preseason pick to win the [[SEC Championship]] and a berth in the [[College Football Playoff]]. There was also hype about junior QB [[Jeremy Johnson (American football)|Jeremy Johnson]] who sat behind [[Nick Marshall]] in 2013 and 2014, being a [[Heisman Trophy]] candidate. The hiring of [[Will Muschamp]] as defensive coordinator was a major success for the Tigers after [[Ellis Johnson (American football coach)|Ellis Johnson]] was let go after a 55-44 defeat in the 2014 [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nThe Tigers' season began with some shocking surprises. In a week one showdown against [[2015 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]] in the [[Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game]], Auburn built a 24-0 lead, but Jeremy Johnson threw three interceptions and the Cardinals came back from 24-0 before finally falling to Auburn 31-24. Auburn suffered key injuries to Carl Lawson, Tray Matthews, [[Roc Thomas]] and Jovon Robinson. This with starting corner TJ Davis out with acl and [[Joshua Holsey]] sitting out. A week later, Auburn played against FCS foe [[2015 Jacksonville State Gamecocks football team|Jacksonville State]], Auburn again had a rough outing from both Jeremy Johnson and the Tigers' defense.

Auburn took an early lead on a long field goal by Daniel Carlson.  Clemson, however, responded with a drive of its own, which resulted in a touchdown on 4th down and goal from the 1-yard line.  Clemson would lead 10-3 going into halftime and add another field goal in the 3rd quarter to make the score 13-3 going into the 4th quarter.  Auburn cut the lead on another field goal by Daniel Carlson, but once again Clemson responded with another touchdown.  Auburn would score a touchdown with just over 3 minutes to play in the ballgame.  Auburn would then stop Clemson on the ensuing possession, but 2 hail mary attempts by Auburn were broken up in the end zone in the last 10 seconds of the ballgame and Clemson held on for the 19-13 victory.

Auburn scored next and never looked back scoring 31 unanswered points.  At halftime, the Tigers lead 38-7.  The final score was 51-14.  Sean White had 3 touchdowns, more than he had in all his past Auburn games combined.  The game was Auburn's best offensive performance, according to many writers, since the 2014 season.  Overall, this was a very impressive victory for Auburn, and for [[Gus Malzahn]], who used to coach at Arkansas State in 2012.

Auburn seized the momentum after that.  Starting running back Kerryon Johnson got hurt early in the game, but Kamryn Pettway took over the game with a 169-yard performance including 3 touchdowns.  Also, the Auburn defense scored a touchdown when Carl Lawson forced a fumble which was picked up by Montravius Adams and returned 13 yards for a touchdown. Auburn led 35-0 at halftime.  The Tigers slowed down in the second half, only attempting one pass on offense.  The final score was 38-14.  It broke a two-game losing streak to the Bulldogs and improved Auburn's record to 4-2 and 2-1 in the SEC.

However, Auburn had just as much success rushing as Ole Miss had passing.  Kamryn Pettway had a career-high 236 yards.  The key play came late in the game with Auburn leading 33\u201329 and Ole Miss driving down the field for the go-ahead touchdown.  Ole Miss tight end [[Evan Engram]] dropped a pass which would have likely resulted in a touchdown.

Tolbert was named Offensive MVP, [[Nick Coe]] was named Defensive MVP, and Anders Carlson was named Special Teams MVP.\n{{-}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegeSecondaryStyle|Auburn Tigers}} ;text-align:center;\n|state= autocollapse\n|title= 2018 Auburn A-Day Game\n|date= April 7, 2018\n|time= 3:00 p.m.\n|road= Blue\n|R1=3|R2=0|R3=0|R4=7\n|home= '''Orange'''\n|H1=2|H2=13|H3=0|H4=3\n|stadium= [[Jordan-Hare Stadium]] \u2022 [[Auburn, Alabama]]\n|attendance= 28,033\n|weather=\n|referee=\n|TV= [[SEC Network]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Clay Matvick]] (play-by-play), [[Jordan Rodgers]] (analyst), [[Laura Rutledge]] (sideline reporter)\n}}\n\n==Preseason==\n===Award watch lists===\n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Auburn Tigers|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2018-watch-list/|title=2018 Watch List {{!}} Lott IMPACT Trophy {{!}} Honoring College Football's Defensive Best|website=lottimpacttrophy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref>\n|[[Deshaun Davis]]\n|LB\n|SR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Chuck Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2018-maxwell-bednarik-watch-list/|title=2018 Bednarik Award Watch List - Maxwell Football Club|date=2018-07-16|work=Maxwell Football Club|access-date=2018-07-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n|Javaris Davis\n|CB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Dontavius Russell]]\n|DT\n|SR\n|-\n|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Maxwell Award Watch List|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2018-maxwell-watch-list|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n|[[Jarrett Stidham]]\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Davey O'Brien Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Davey O\u2019Brien Award Watch List includes 26 players|url=http://daveyobrienaward.org/2018/07/2018-davey-obrien-award-watch-list-includes-26-players|date=July 17, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n|Jarrett Stidham\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Fred Biletnikoff Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Biletnikoff Award Watch List|url=http://biletnikoffaward.com/2018-biletnikoff-award-watch-list|date=July 19, 2018|accessdate=July 19, 2018}}</ref>\n|Ryan Davis\n|WR\n|SR\n|-\n|[[Butkus Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thebutkusaward.com/watchlist/view.aspx?t=c |title=Butkus Award - 2018 Collegiate Watchlist |date=July 23, 2018 |publisher=The Butkus Award |access-date=July 23, 2018}}</ref>\n|Deshaun Davis\n|LB\n|SR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Preseason Watch List|url=http://touchdownclub.com/nagurski-trophy/watch-list/|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|[[Derrick Brown (American football)|Derrick Brown]]\n|DL\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Marlon Davidson]]\n|DL\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=22018 OUTLAND TROPHY WATCH LIST UNVEILED|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2018/outland180724.html|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|Derrick Brown\n|DL\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Wuerffel Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Wuerffel Trophy Unveils 2018 Watch List|url=https://www.wuerffeltrophy.org/news1/wuerffel-trophy-unveils-2018-watch-list|date=July 26, 2018|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref>\n|Derrick Brown\n|DL\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Football Foundation Announces 2018 Player of the Year Preseason \u201cWatch List\u201d|last1=Carbone|first1=Al|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-football-foundation-announces-2018-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list|date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref>\n|Jarrett Stidham\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch List for 2018 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award \u00ae Presented by A.

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft's writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329210515/http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |archive-date=March 29, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n{{Clear|left}}\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

Although steel production did not begin until 1915, predictions held that Duluth's population would rise to 200,000\u2013300,000. Along with the [[Duluth Works]] steel plant, US Steel developed [[Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota|Morgan Park]], as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.\n\nThe [[Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company]] was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools. Duluth's huge wholesale Marshall Wells Hardware Company expanded in 1901 by opening branches in [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]; the company catalog totaled 2,390 pages by 1913. The Duluth Showcase Company, which later became the Duluth Refrigerator Company and then the Coolerator Company, was established in 1908. The Universal Atlas Cement Company, which made cement from the slag byproduct of the steel plant, began operations in 1917.\n\n====Immigration====\nBecause of its numerous jobs in mining and industry, the city was a destination for large waves of immigrants from Europe during the early 20th century.

From 1907 to 1941, the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] and then the IWW operated [[Work People's College]], an educational institution that taught classes from a working-class, socialist perspective. \nImmigrants from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, England, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia also settled in Duluth.<ref name=\"Port of Duluth\" /> Today, people of Scandinavian descent constitute a strong plurality of Duluth's population, accounting for more than one third of the residents identifying European ancestry.\n\n====Duluth lynchings====\n[[File:Clayton-Jackson-McGhie-memorial-Duluth-Minnesota.jpg|thumb|left|[[Duluth lynchings]] memorial]]\n\nIn September 1918, at the beginning of U.S. involvement in the [[World War I|Great War]], a group calling itself the Knights of Liberty dragged Finnish immigrant [[Olli Kinkkonen]] from his boarding house, tarred and feathered him, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] him.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with barge approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in [[Lincoln Park (Duluth)|Lincoln Park]], an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to the growing revitalization of this neighborhood, many developers are also investing in increased housing projects in anticipation of local growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/real-estate/4984156-Following-business-boom-Duluth%E2%80%99s-Lincoln-Park-sees-housing-influx|title=Following business boom, Duluth\u2019s Lincoln Park sees housing influx|last=Busche|first=Kelly|date=March 9, 2020|website=Duluth News Tribune|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

Duluth and Lake Superior coast are visible at far left]]\nEven as the city has grown, its populace has tended to hug Lake Superior's shoreline, so Duluth is primarily a southwest\u2013northeast city. The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:Large anorthosite xenolith in ophitic ilmenite gabbro (anorthosite series, Duluth Complex, Mesoproterozoic, 1099 Ma; Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) 1 (22039818790).jpg|thumb|Large [[anorthosite]] [[xenolith]] in ophitic ilmenite gabbro, Duluth Complex, Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota]]\n[[File:Agat Lake Superior - Duluth, Minnesota, USA..jpg|thumb|[[Lake Superior agate]] - Duluth, Minnesota]]\n\nThe geology of Duluth demonstrates the [[Midcontinent Rift]], formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior. Winters are long, snowy, and very cold, normally seeing maximum temperatures remaining below {{convert|32|F|C}} on 106 days (the second-most of any city in the contiguous US behind [[International Falls, Minnesota|International Falls]]), falling to or below {{convert|0|\u00b0F}} on 40\u201341 nights and bringing consistent snow cover from late November to late March.<ref name=\"Duluth NOAA\" /> Winter storms that pass south or east of Duluth can often set up easterly or northeasterly flow, which leads to occasional upslope lake-effect snow events that bring a foot (30&nbsp;cm) or more of snow to the city while areas {{convert|50|mi|km}} inland receive considerably less. The average annual snowfall is 81.5 in. The lake steams in the winter when moist, lake-warmed air at the surface rises and cools, losing some of its moisture-carrying capacity.<ref name=\"superior\">{{cite web|url=http://www.superiortrails.com/duluth_1.html|title=Duluth Minnesota Travel - Things to do and see|access-date=June 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120628231401/http://www.superiortrails.com/duluth_1.html|archive-date=June 28, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDuluth has been called \"The Air-Conditioned City\" because of the summertime cooling effect of Lake Superior. Using data on the minimum monthly temperature between 1981 and 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration developed a \"Comparative Climatic Data\" report. With a minimum average monthly low temperature of {{convert|1.5|\u00b0F}} and a maximum average monthly low temperature of {{convert|55.4|\u00b0F}}, Duluth was found to be the fifth-coldest city in the United States.<ref name=\"USA TODAY\">{{cite news|title=Brrrr: America's 50 coldest cities|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/02/28/247-wall-st-coldest-cities/24107481/|access-date=April 23, 2017|date=February 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423153831/https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2015/02/28/247-wall-st-coldest-cities/24107481/|archive-date=April 23, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSummers are warm, though nights are generally cool, with daytime temperatures averaging {{convert|76|\u00b0F}} in July, with the same figure over {{convert|80|\u00b0F|1}} inland. Temperatures reach or exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F}} on only 2 days per year, while the city has officially only seen {{convert|100|\u00b0F}} temperatures on 3 days, all during the [[1936 North American heat wave|July 1936 heat wave]], part of the [[Dust Bowl]] years.<ref name=\"Duluth NOAA\" /> The phrase \"cooler by the lake\" can be heard often in weather forecasts during the summer, especially on days when an easterly wind is expected. Great local variations are also common because of the rapid change in elevation between the nearly 900-foot hilltop and shoreside. Often this variation manifests itself as snow at the Miller Hill Mall while rain falls in Canal Park.<ref name=\"superior\" />\n\nThe record low temperature in Duluth is {{convert|-41|\u00b0F}}, set on January 2, 1885, and the record high temperature is {{convert|106|\u00b0F}}, set on July 13, 1936. On average, the first freezing temperature occurs on September 25, and the last on May 25, though a freezing temperature has occurred in August; the average window for measurable (\u2265{{convert|0.1|in|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}) snowfall is October 21 through April 23.<ref name=\"Duluth NOAA\" />\n\n{{Clear}}\n<!-- The following weatherbox is transcluded in Climate of Minnesota using labeled section transclusion. -->\n<section begin=\"weatherbox\" />{{Weather box |collapsed = Y\n|location = [[Duluth International Airport|Duluth Int'l]], Minnesota (1981\u20132010 normals,{{efn|Mean monthly maxima and minima (i.e. the expected highest and lowest temperature readings at any point during the year or given month) calculated based on data at said location from 1981 to 2010.}} extremes 1871\u2013present{{efn|Official records for Duluth were kept at downtown from August 1871 to May 1941, and at Duluth Int'l since June 1941.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]]. Tourists also may drive on the [[North Shore Scenic Drive]] to [[Gooseberry Falls State Park]], Baptism Falls (Minnesota's largest waterfall), the vertical cliff of [[Palisade Head]], [[Isle Royale National Park]] (reached via ferry), [[Grand Portage National Monument]] in Grand Portage, and High Falls of the Pigeon River (on the Canada\u2013US border). [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], can be reached by following the highway into Canada along Lake Superior.\n\nIn 2006, a volunteer task force was formed to manage the spiraling retiree health care benefit obligations that were threatening to bankrupt the city.

Free admission and near unlimited access to the tower during park hours make this attraction popular among visitors and locals.\n\n====North Shore Scenic Railroad====\nThe [[North Shore Scenic Railroad]] is a [[heritage railway|heritage railroad]] that operates between Duluth and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota]]. It is owned by the Lake Superior Railroad Museum and offers several different types of passenger excursion trains between May 28 and October 15 each year. The railroad was started in 1990, using the Lakefront Line once owned by the [[Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway]].\n\n====Fitger's Brewery====\n[[File:Fitger's Brewery Museum 02.jpg|thumb|Copper brew kettle installed in 1901, at the [[Fitger's Brewing Company|Fitger Brewery Museum]]]]\n\nThe [[Fitger's Brewing Company|original brewery]] was built in 1857 on a stream that came to be known as Brewery Creek; it was purchased by Michael Fink in 1881 and moved downstream to its present location on Superior Street. [[Fitger Brewing Company|Fink's Lake Superior Brewery]] hired a new [[brewmaster]], August Fitger, a graduate of one of Germany's premier brewing schools, and the brewery was renamed A. Fitger & Co. / Lake Superior Brewery. The brewery was successful and stayed in operation even through prohibition but finally closed in 1972 after 115 years of continual operation, making it the oldest business in Duluth. The complex was reopened in 1984 and contains a [[Microbrewery|craft brewery]], several restaurants, hotels, shops, and a museum. Fitger's Brewery Complex is listed in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Fitger's|url=http://fitgers.com/fitgers-history/|access-date=July 26, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710133750/http://fitgers.com/fitgers-history/|archive-date=July 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Canal Park====\n[[File:Duluth Canal Park Lakewalk.jpg|thumb|Lakewalk, [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]]]]\n\n[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] is a recreation-oriented district of Duluth. It is largely a conversion of an old [[warehouse district]] into restaurants, caf\u00e9s, hotels, and shops, especially those dealing in antiques and other novelties. This conversion began in the 1980s as an attempt to use Duluth's rich [[industry|industrial]] past, the decline of which had left the city in economic turmoil. A 4.2-mile lakewalk cuts through the area, offering a view of Park Point's extensive sandy dunes and beaches. Swimming is an option, though few are willing to swim in Lake Superior's icy waters. Visitors can also view the [[lighthouse]] pier, and visit the [[Lake Superior Maritime Visitor Center]], the [[Great Lakes Aquarium]], and the [[William A. Irvin]] floating ship museum. Yearly festivals include the Bayfront Blues Festival, held in Bayfront Festival Park.\n\n====Glensheen Mansion====\n[[File:Glensheen Mansion.jpg|thumb|[[Glensheen Mansion]]]]\n\nThe [[Glensheen Historic Estate]], on the shore of Lake Superior, was built as the family home for wealthy businessman [[Chester Adgate Congdon]]. Glensheen sits on {{convert|7.6|acre}} of lakefront property, has 38 rooms and is built in the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] architectural tradition, inspired by the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] styles of the era. The building was designed by Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston Sr.]], with interiors designed by William French. The formal terraced garden and English-style landscape was designed by the [[Charles Wellford Leavitt]] firm of New York. Construction began in 1905 at a cost of $854,000 (about $21 million in today's dollars), and was completed in 1908. Aside from its architectural significance, Glensheen is noteworthy for the murders of [[Elisabeth Congdon]] and her nurse on June 27, 1977. The mansion is open to tours year-round.\n\n====Duluth Children's Museum====\nFounded in 1930, the Duluth Children's Museum in the Lincoln Park neighborhood is the fifth-oldest of its kind in the United States. It features interactive exhibits, educational programs, and opportunities for creative play designed for children, their families and caregivers, and school field trips. The museum also curates an artifact collection of over 25,000 objects drawn from the lives and cultures of people who have resided in the region, particularly American Indians and immigrants.\n\n====Christmas City of the North Parade====\nEach year in November, the Christmas City of the North Parade takes place in Duluth. The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold. Even in years when instruments were too cold to produce music, the bands became choirs, using their voices to entertain the crowd. Recorded by [[Merv Griffin]] in 1962, the \"Christmas City\" song is the parade's signature sound. According to Rich's grandson, the song was written by a local resident and his grandfather asked his friend Griffin, at that time not the well-known TV personality he later became, if he would sing the song and put it to music.<ref>[http://christmascityparade.com/ Christmas City of the North Parade:<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904072214/http://christmascityparade.com/ |date=September 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>[http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ Grandson of Christmas City Parade Creator Shares History | Christmas City of the North Parade<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902015321/http://christmascityparade.com/2010/11/grandson-of-christmas-city-parade-creator-shares-history/ |date=September 2, 2013}}</ref>\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n====Gichi-Ode' Akiing====\n[[File:Mural at Gichi-Ode' Akiing Park.jpg|thumb|alt=Red, green, black, yellow and blue figures outlined in black|Gichi-Ode' Akiing memorial for [[Kechewaishke]]]]\nJust off the Lakewalk, Lake Place Park became Gichi-Ode' Akiing, Ojibwe for ''\"a grand heart place.\"''<ref>{{cite news|title=Ceremony Friday to rename Lake Place Park as Gichi-ode\u2019 Akiing|author=News Tribune|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|publisher=Duluth News Tribune and Forum Communications Company|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/incoming/1354590-Ceremony-Friday-to-rename-Lake-Place-Park-as-Gichi-ode%E2%80%99-Akiing|newspaper=Duluth News Tribune}}</ref> The [[Duluth City Council]] approved the name change in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duluth renames city park in the Ojibwe language|author=Kraker, Dan|date=June 1, 2019|accessdate=April 3, 2020|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/06/01/duluth-renames-city-park-ojibwe-language|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio}}</ref> A memorial to [[Kechewaishke]], also known as Chief Buffalo, honors his symbolic petition carried to president [[Millard Fillmore]] in 1849.<ref name=WIHS>{{cite web|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Image/IM1871|title=Symbolic Petition of the Chippewa Chiefs|accessdate=April 4, 2020|publisher=Wisconsin Historical Society}}</ref> Kechewaishke signed the [[Treaty_of_La_Pointe#1854_Treaty_of_La_Pointe|1854 Treaty of La Pointe]] a year before his death, with the provision that one square mile of land at the corner of Lake Superior be given to his adopted son [[Benjamin G.

The Dukes were Northern League champions in 1997. [[Northern League (baseball, 1902\u201371)|An earlier Northern League]], based in the Midwest, was also in operation off and on from 1902 to 1971, the longest stint being 1932\u20131971. The Dukes were a farm team for the Detroit Tigers from 1960 to 1964 and several other teams in later years before the Northern League folded in 1971. The Dukes produced notable players such as Denny McLain, Bill Freehan, Gates Brown, Ray Oyler, Jim Northrup, Mickey Stanley, John Hiller, and Willie Horton, all of whom were members of the 1968 world champion Detroit Tigers.\n\nDuluth is also home to Horton's Gym, the home gym of professional [[Boxing|boxers]] [[Zach Walters|Zach \"Jungle Boy\" Walters]] and [[Andy Kolle]], as well as a number of other professional prizefighters. Horton's Gym was run by Chuck Horton from 1994 to 2011. During that time, Horton trained some of the most recognized professional and amateur boxers in Minnesota such as Walters, Kolle, RJ Lasse, Gary Eyer and Wayne Putnam. In 2011, Horton turned the gym over to Zach Walters so that Horton could concentrate solely on training professional boxers; Walters changed the gym's name to Jungle Boy Boxing Gym. Horton is currently the trainer of Al Sands; Sands won the North American Boxing Association's U.S. Cruiserweight title in April 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wdio.com/article/stories/s3406046.shtml |title=Two Titles for Duluth's Al Sands |first1=Eyewitness |last1=Sports |date=April 20, 2014 |publisher=wdio.com |access-date=July 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714131011/http://www.wdio.com/article/stories/s3406046.shtml |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Amateur sports===\n\n====Hockey====\n{{Main|Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs men's ice hockey|Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey}}\nThe [[University of Minnesota Duluth]] [[Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs|Bulldog]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] games are a major event in town during the cold Duluth winters.<ref>[http://www.umdbulldogs.com/teams-mens-hockey.php UMD Bulldogs \u2013 Men's Hockey<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611104349/http://www.umdbulldogs.com/teams-mens-hockey.php |date=June 11, 2012}}</ref> Games are televised locally, and thousands watch the games in person at the [[Duluth Entertainment Center|Duluth Entertainment Convention Center (DECC)]].

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

The latter supplies electricity into the MP system by the [[Square Butte (transmission line)|Square Butte]] [[HVDC]] line, which ends near the town.\n\nMinnesota Power primarily uses western coal to generate electricity, but also has a number of small hydroelectric facilities, the largest of which is the [[Thomson Dam (Minnesota)|Thomson Dam]] southwest of Duluth on the Saint Louis River.\n\nIn December 2006, Minnesota Power began purchasing all the energy generated from the new 50-MW Oliver Wind I Energy Center built by NextEra Resources near Center, N.D. In 2007, Minnesota Power entered into a second 25-year wind [[power purchase agreement]] with NextEra. A 48-MW facility was built adjacent to the initial Oliver County wind farm, and the new generators began commercial operation in November 2007.\n\nConstruction began in 2010 on the 76-MW Bison Wind I Energy Center near New Salem, N.D. Bison I represents the first wave of Minnesota Power-constructed wind farms that will be built in south central North Dakota and linked to Minnesota. by way of a 465-mile direct current (DC) transmission line. ALLETE finalized an agreement January 1, 2010 to purchase a 250-kilovolt DC line between Center, N.D. and Hermantown, Minn. (near ALLETE headquarters in Duluth) and phase out a long-term contract to buy coal-generated electricity now transmitted over the line.\n\nDuluth has recently become, because of the wind energy demand, a port for wind energy parts shipments from overseas and the hub for shipments out to various wind energy sites in the midwest.\n\nThroughout its history, Duluth's sewers have overflowed when it rained, causing untreated sewage to flow into Lake Superior and the Saint Louis River. For example, in 2001 alone the overflow amounted to over 6.9 million gallons. Over the past five years the City of Duluth has taken extraordinary measures to completely eliminate sewage overflows and in 2013, the improvements are three years ahead of schedule.\n\n===Fire department===\nThe city of Duluth is protected by 132 paid, professional firefighters of the city of [[Duluth Fire Department]].<ref name=DuluthFDStudy2012-03/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duluthmn.gov/fire/|title=Fire Department : City of Duluth, MN|access-date=February 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321223935/http://www.duluthmn.gov/fire/|archive-date=March 21, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The Duluth Fire Department responded to 12,231 fire and emergency medical calls in 2015.\n\nThe Duluth Fire Department operates out of 8 fire stations throughout the city, under the command of an Assistant Chief, Squad 251.

All of the stores were located within the interior of the mall with some shops being accessible from both inside and out. The first floor had a pharmacy and a department store with groceries, a butcher shop, clothing, hardware, furniture, and a general store. The second floor had a bank, dentist office, barber shop, hair salon, hat shop, billiard room, and auditorium. The basement had a shoe store and an ice making plant which made eight tons of ice per day for the mall and for Morgan Park residents.

But Charles Watson Townsend's 1936 ''New York Times'' obituary claimed that he was the inventor, and a controversy developed. A ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' reporter read Townsend's obituary and realized that the ''Times'' had incorrectly attributed the invention to Townsend. Wanting to set the record straight, on May 23, 1936, the ''Pioneer Press'' ran a story about how the dessert was really invented at a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth in the 1880s, and indicated that the restaurant served ice cream with blueberry pie specifically. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie \u00e0 la Mode.<ref>''The New York Times'', May 21, 1936, pg.23, Charles W.

A [[Duluth pack]] is a traditional [[portage]] pack used in canoe travel. A specialized type of backpack, Duluth packs are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier. Arriving in Duluth in 1870 with a small stock of leather and tools, he began a shoe store and quickly made a go of it in what was then a booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]].

The fashion for [[beaver hats]] in Europe generated demand for pelts. French trade for beaver in the lower [[Saint Lawrence River]] had led to the depletion of the animals in that region by the late 1630s, so the French searched farther west for new resources and new routes, making alliances with the Native Americans along the way to trap and deliver their furs.\n\n[[\u00c9tienne Br\u00fbl\u00e9]] is credited with the European discovery of Lake Superior before 1620. [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson]] and [[M\u00e9dard des Groseilliers]] explored the Duluth area, [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] (Bottom of the Lake) in 1654 and again in 1660. The French soon established fur posts near Duluth and in the far north where [[Grand Portage]] became a major trading center. The French explorer [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], whose name is sometimes anglicized as \"DuLuth\", explored the [[Saint Louis River]] in 1679.\n\nAfter 1792 and the independence of the United States, the [[North West Company]] established several posts on Minnesota rivers and lakes, and in areas to the west and northwest, for trading with the Ojibwe, the [[Dakota (given name)|Dakota]], and other native tribes. The first post was where [[Superior, Wisconsin]], later developed. Known as Fort Saint Louis, the post became the headquarters for North West's new Fond du Lac Department. It had stockaded walls, two houses of 40 feet each, a shed of 60 feet, a large warehouse, and a canoe yard. Over time, Indian peoples and European Americans settled nearby, and a town gradually developed at this point.\n[[File:Old Trading Post on St. Louis River, Duluth, MN.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of old [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] trading post, 1907]]\nIn 1808, the [[American Fur Company]] was organized by German-born [[John Jacob Astor]]. The company began trading at the Head of the Lakes in 1809. In 1817, it erected a new headquarters at present-day [[Fond du Lac (Duluth)|Fond du Lac]] on the Saint Louis River. There, portages connected Lake Superior with [[Lake Vermillion]] to the north, and with the [[Mississippi River]] to the south. After creating a powerful monopoly, Astor got out of the business about 1830, as the trade was declining. But active trade was carried on until the failure of the fur trade in the 1840s. European fashions had changed and many American areas were getting over-trapped, with game declining.\n\nIn 1832 [[Henry Schoolcraft]] visited the Fond du Lac area and wrote of his experiences with the Ojibwe Indians there.  Longfellow based the [[Song of Hiawatha]], his epic poem relating the fictional adventures of an Ojibwe warrior named Hiawatha and the tragedy of his love for Minnehaha, a Dakota woman, on Schoolcraft's writings.<ref>{{cite web |title=An Ethnographic Study of Indigenous Contributions to the City of Duluth |url=http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329210515/http://www.duluthstories.net/downloads/DuluthEthnographicStudy2015.pdf |archive-date=March 29, 2020 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nNatives signed two [[Treaty of Fond du Lac|Treaties of Fond du Lac]] with the United States in the present neighborhood of Fond du Lac in 1826 and 1847, in which the Ojibwe ceded land to the American government. As part of the Treaty of Washington (1854) with the [[Lake Superior Band of Chippewa]], the United States set aside the [[Fond du Lac Indian Reservation]] upstream from Duluth near [[Cloquet, Minnesota]].\n\n===Permanent settlement===\n[[File:Minnesota Point.jpg|thumb|Minnesota Point from the hill above Duluth in 1875]]\n\nAs European Americans continued to settle and encroach on Ojibwe lands, the U.S. government made a series of treaties, executed between 1837 and 1889, that expropriated vast areas of tribal lands for their use and relegated the Native American peoples to a number of small reservations.<ref name=\"NRHP\" /> Interest in the area was piqued in the 1850s by rumors of [[copper mining]]. A government land survey in 1852, followed by a treaty with local tribes in 1854, secured wilderness for gold-seeking explorers, sparked a [[land run|land rush]], and led to the development of [[iron ore]] mining in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|title=History of Duluth, Minnesota|access-date=June 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630182218/http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h2126.html|archive-date=June 30, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAround the same time, newly constructed [[channel (geography)|channels]] and [[canal lock|locks]] in the East permitted large ships to access the area. A road connecting Duluth to the [[Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul|Twin Cities]] was also constructed. Eleven small towns on both sides of the [[Saint Louis River]] were formed, establishing Duluth's roots as a city.\n\nBy 1857, copper resources were scarce and the area's economic focus shifted to timber harvesting. A nationwide financial crisis, the [[Panic of 1857]], caused most of the city's early pioneers to leave. A history of Duluth written in 1910 relates, \"Of the handful remaining in 1859 four men were unemployed and one of those was a brewer.  Capital idea; build a brewery.

Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]] in 1855 and the contemporaneous announcement of the railroads' approach had made Duluth the only port  with access to both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Soon the lumber industry, railroads and mining were all growing so quickly that the influx of workers could hardly keep up with demand, and storefronts popped up almost overnight. By 1868, business in Duluth was booming. In a [[Fourth of July]] speech Dr. Thomas Preston Foster, the founder of Duluth's first newspaper, coined the expression \"The Zenith City of the Unsalted Seas\".\n\nIn 1869\u201370, Duluth was the fastest-growing city in the country and was expected to surpass Chicago in only a few years.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} When [[Jay Cooke]], a wealthy Philadelphia land speculator, convinced the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] to create an extension from [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] to Duluth, the railroad opened areas due north and west of Lake Superior to [[iron ore]] mining. Duluth's population on New Year's Day of 1869 consisted of 14 families; by the [[Fourth of July]], 3,500 people were present to celebrate.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nIn the first ''Duluth Minnesotian'' printed on August 24, 1869, the editor placed the following notice on the editorial page:\n\n\"Newcomers should comprehend that Duluth is at present a small place, and hotel and boarding room accommodation is extremely limited.

But by the late 1870s, with the continued boom in lumber and mining and with the railroads completed, Duluth bloomed again. By the turn of the century, it had almost 100,000 inhabitants, and was again a thriving community with small-business loans, commerce and trade flowing through the city. Mining continued in the [[Mesabi Range]] and iron was shipped east to mills in Ohio, a trade continuing into the 20th century.\n{{Clear|left}}\n{{wide image|General view from bluffs, Duluth, Minn. c1898.jpg|900px|Panoramic view, {{Circa|1898}}}}\n\n====\"The Untold Delights of Duluth\"====\nEarly doubts about the Duluth area's potential were voiced in \"The Untold Delights of Duluth,\" a speech U.S. Representative [[J.

Although steel production did not begin until 1915, predictions held that Duluth's population would rise to 200,000\u2013300,000. Along with the [[Duluth Works]] steel plant, US Steel developed [[Morgan Park, Duluth, Minnesota|Morgan Park]], as a company town for steel workers. It is now a city neighborhood within Duluth.\n\nThe [[Diamond Calk Horseshoe Company]] was founded in 1908 and later became a major manufacturer and exporter of wrenches and automotive tools. Duluth's huge wholesale Marshall Wells Hardware Company expanded in 1901 by opening branches in [[Portland, Oregon]], and [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]; the company catalog totaled 2,390 pages by 1913. The Duluth Showcase Company, which later became the Duluth Refrigerator Company and then the Coolerator Company, was established in 1908. The Universal Atlas Cement Company, which made cement from the slag byproduct of the steel plant, began operations in 1917.\n\n====Immigration====\nBecause of its numerous jobs in mining and industry, the city was a destination for large waves of immigrants from Europe during the early 20th century.

From 1907 to 1941, the [[Finnish Socialist Federation]] and then the IWW operated [[Work People's College]], an educational institution that taught classes from a working-class, socialist perspective. \nImmigrants from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Ireland, England, Italy, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Croatia, Serbia, Ukraine, Romania, and Russia also settled in Duluth.<ref name=\"Port of Duluth\" /> Today, people of Scandinavian descent constitute a strong plurality of Duluth's population, accounting for more than one third of the residents identifying European ancestry.\n\n====Duluth lynchings====\n[[File:Clayton-Jackson-McGhie-memorial-Duluth-Minnesota.jpg|thumb|left|[[Duluth lynchings]] memorial]]\n\nIn September 1918, at the beginning of U.S. involvement in the [[World War I|Great War]], a group calling itself the Knights of Liberty dragged Finnish immigrant [[Olli Kinkkonen]] from his boarding house, tarred and feathered him, and [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] him.

The [[Duluth lynchings]] took place on First Street and Second Avenue East. In the late 20th century, journalist Michael Fedo wrote ''The Lynchings in Duluth'' (1970), which began to raise awareness of the event. Community members from many different groups began to come together for reflection and education.  The men's unmarked graves were located and in 1991, gravestones were erected with funding from a local church. Vigils were held at the intersection where the men were lynched. In 2000, a grassroots committee was formed, and began to offer speakers to groups and schools. It decided to commemorate the event with a memorial. The Clayton Jackson McGhie Memorial, which includes a corner wall and plaza, was dedicated in 2003. It includes three {{convert|7|ft|m|adj=on}}-tall bronze statues of the three men.

Many people died on the rural roads surrounding the Duluth area, and historical accounts tell of victims dying while trying to outrun the fire. The ''News Tribune'' reported, \"It is estimated that 100 families were rendered homeless by Saturday's fire in the territory known as the Woodland District...

Handling and export of iron ore, brought in from the Mesabi Range, was integral to the city's economy, as well as to the steel industry in the Midwest, including in manufacturing cities in Ohio.\n\nThe [[Aerial Lift Bridge]] (earlier known as the \"Aerial Bridge\" or \"Aerial Ferry Bridge\") was built in 1905 and at that time was known as the United States' first [[transporter bridge]]\u2014only one other was ever constructed in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |title=shorpy.com, Photo of original bridge showing gondola |access-date=July 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170719112205/http://www.shorpy.com/node/4348 |archive-date=July 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1929&ndash;30, the span was converted to a vertical lift bridge (also rather uncommon).  The bridge was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]  in 1973.\n\nIn 1916, after Europe had entered the Great War (World War I), a shipyard was constructed on the Saint Louis River. A new workers neighborhood, today known as Riverside, developed around the large operation. Similar industrial expansions took place during the [[World War II|Second World War]], as Duluth's large harbor and the area's vast natural resources were put to work for the war effort. Tankers and [[submarine chasers]] (usually called \"sub-chasers\") were built at the Riverside shipyard. The population of Duluth continued to grow in the postwar decade and a half, peaking at 107,884 in 1960.\n\n====Economic decline====\n[[File:Duluth canal.jpg|thumb|[[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] with barge approaching the lift bridge]]\n\nEconomic decline began in the 1950s, when high-grade iron ore ran out on the [[Iron Range]] north of Duluth; ore shipments from the Duluth harbor had been critical to the city's economy. Low-grade ore ([[taconite]]) shipments continued, boosted by new taconite pellet technology, but ore shipments were lower overall.\n\nIn the 1970s the United States experienced a [[steel crisis]], a recession in the global steel market, and like [[Rust Belt|many American cities]] Duluth entered a period of industrial restructuring. In 1981, US Steel closed its [[Duluth Works]] plant, a blow to the city's economy whose effects included the closure of the cement company, which had depended on the steel plant for raw materials (slag). More closures followed in other industries, including [[shipbuilding]] and [[heavy machinery]]. By decade's end, unemployment rates hit 15 percent. The economic downturn was particularly hard on Duluth's West Side, where ethnic Eastern and Southern European workers had lived for decades.\n\nDuring the 1980s, plans were underway to extend [[Interstate 35]] through Duluth and up the [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]], bringing new access to the city. The original plan called for the interstate to run along the shore on an elevated concrete structure, blocking the city's access to Lake Superior. Kent Worley, a local landscape architect, wrote an impassioned letter to then mayor Ben Boo asking that the route be reconsidered.  The [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] agreed to take another look, with Worley consulting. The new plan called for parts of the highway to run through tunnels,  which allowed preservation of Fitger's Brewery, Sir Ben's Tavern, Leif Erickson Park, and Duluth's Rose Garden. Rock used from the interstate project was used to create an extensive new beach along Lake Superior, along which the city's Lakewalk was built.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/lifestyle/3320814-construction-duluths-freeway-drips-stories|title=Construction of Duluth's freeway drips with stories|last=Aug 10th 2014 - 12am|first=Mike Creger {{!}}|website=Duluth News Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref>\n[[File:Horse and carriage-Duluth-2006.jpg|thumb|left|Canal Park Lakewalk carriage ride]]\n\nWith the decline of the city's industrial core, the local economic focus gradually shifted to [[tourism]]. The interstate brought new people into the community. The downtown area was renovated to emphasize its pedestrian character: streets were paved with red brick and [[skywalk]]s and retail shops were added. The city and developers worked with the area's unique architectural character, converting old warehouses along the waterfront into caf\u00e9s, shops, restaurants, and hotels. Combined with the new rock beach and Lakewalk, these changes developed the new [[Canal Park (Duluth)|Canal Park]] as a trendy tourism-oriented district. Duluth's population, which had declined since 1960, stabilized at around 85,000.\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, Duluth has become a regional center for banking, retail shopping, and medical care for northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northwestern Michigan. It is estimated that more than 8,000 jobs in Duluth are directly related to its two hospitals. Arts and entertainment offerings, as well as year-round recreation and the natural environment, have contributed to expansion of the tourist industry. Some 3.5 million visitors each year contribute more than $400 million to the local economy.\n\n===Craft district gentrification===\n\nMore recently a collection of like-minded businesses in [[Lincoln Park (Duluth)|Lincoln Park]], an old rundown blue-collar neighborhood with high unemployment and poverty rates, was cultivated by a group of entrepreneurs who have begun rebuilding and revitalizing the area. Since 2014 at least 25 commercial real estate transactions have occurred and 17 businesses have opened, including restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and artist studios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|title=Craftsmen, backpacks, beer build hope in a needy Duluth neighborhood|last=Kraker|first=Dan|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211342/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/04/18/duluth-lincoln-park-businesses-spark-revival|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|title=The creative economy in Duluth's craft district|last=Staff|first=MPR News|website=www.mprnews.org|access-date=2019-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423211333/https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/05/12/chris-farrell-on-creative-economy|archive-date=April 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to the growing revitalization of this neighborhood, many developers are also investing in increased housing projects in anticipation of local growth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/business/real-estate/4984156-Following-business-boom-Duluth%E2%80%99s-Lincoln-Park-sees-housing-influx|title=Following business boom, Duluth\u2019s Lincoln Park sees housing influx|last=Busche|first=Kelly|date=March 9th, 2020|website=Duluth News Tribune|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=April 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width    = 450\n | image1    = Minnesota Point from Incline Railway, Duluth, Minn (NYPL b12647398-67838).tiff\n | caption1      = [[Minnesota Point]] (or Park Point) from Incline Railway, 1907\n | image2    = Duluth-Minnesota-Superior.jpg\n | caption2      = Minnesota Point in 2006\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|87.43|sqmi|sqkm|2}}; {{convert|67.79|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|19.64|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 13, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702145235/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=July 2, 2012 }}</ref> It is Minnesota's second-largest city by land area, surpassed only by [[Hibbing, Minnesota|Hibbing]].

Duluth has been called \"the San Francisco of the Midwest,\" alluding to [[San Francisco]]'s similar water-to-hilltop topography. This similarity was most evident before World War II, when Duluth had a network of streetcars and an [[funicular|inclined railroad]], the [[7th Avenue West Incline Railway]], that, like San Francisco's cable cars, climbed a steep hill. The change in elevation is illustrated by Duluth's two airports. The [[weather station]] at Sky Harbor Airport on Park Point has an elevation of 607 feet (185 m), while Duluth International Airport, atop the hill, is 820 feet higher at 1,427 feet (435 m).<ref name=wunderground>{{cite web|title=Duluth, Minnesota|publisher=The Weather Underground, Inc.

The considerable development on the hill has given Duluth many steep streets. Some neighborhoods, such as [[Piedmont Heights (Duluth)|Piedmont Heights]] and [[Bayview Heights (Duluth)|Bayview Heights]], are atop the hill with scenic views of the city. [[Skyline Parkway]] is a scenic roadway that extends from Becks Road above the [[Gary \u2013 New Duluth]] neighborhood near the western end of the city to the [[Lakeside \u2013 Lester Park (Duluth)|Lester Park]] neighborhood on the east side. It crosses nearly Duluth's entire length and affords  views of Lake Superior, the Aerial Lift Bridge, Canal Park, and the many industries that inhabit the largest inland port.\n\nA rapidly developing part of the city is [[Miller Hill Mall]] and the adjacent big-box retailer shopping strip \"over the hill\" along the Miller Trunk Highway corridor. The 2009\u201310 road reconstruction project in Duluth's [[Miller Trunk Corridor|Miller Hill]] area improved movement through the [[U.S. Highway 53]] corridor from Trinity Road to Maple Grove Road. The highway project reconstructed connector roads, intersections, and adjacent roadways. A new international airport terminal was completed in 2013 as part of the federal government's Stimulus Reconstruction Program.\n\n===Geological history===\n[[File:Large anorthosite xenolith in ophitic ilmenite gabbro (anorthosite series, Duluth Complex, Mesoproterozoic, 1099 Ma; Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota, USA) 1 (22039818790).jpg|thumb|Large [[anorthosite]] [[xenolith]] in ophitic ilmenite gabbro, Duluth Complex, Keene Creek East Skyline Parkway roadcut, Duluth, Minnesota]]\n[[File:Agat Lake Superior - Duluth, Minnesota, USA..jpg|thumb|[[Lake Superior agate]] - Duluth, Minnesota]]\n\nThe geology of Duluth demonstrates the [[Midcontinent Rift]], formed as the North American continent began to split apart about 1.1 billion years ago. As the [[Mantle (geology)|earth's crust]] thinned, [[magma]] rose toward the surface. These intrusions formed a {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}-thick [[Sill (geology)|sill]], primarily of [[gabbro]], which is known as the [[Duluth Complex]]. An intrusion of the Duluth Complex can be seen at [[Enger Tower]], which is built on a knob of exposed gabbro.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |title=An Introduction to the Geology of the North Shore |publisher=Duluth Streams |access-date=June 28, 2015 |author=Miller, Jim |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708182221/http://www.lakesuperiorstreams.org/understanding/geology.html |archivedate=July 8, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe lava flows formed the conditions for the creation of [[Lake Superior agate]]s. As the lava solidified, gas trapped within the flows formed an [[vesicular texture|amygdaloidal texture]] (literally, rock filled with small vesicles). Later, groundwater transported dissolved minerals through the vesicles depositing concentric bands of fine-grained [[quartz]] called [[chalcedony]].  The color scheme is caused by the concentration of iron present in the groundwater at the time that each new layer was being deposited.  The process went on until the cavity had been completely filled. Over time erosion freed the agates from the solidified lava, which is not as hard as quartz.\n\nThe creation of the Lake Superior basin reflects the erosive power of [[Laurentide Ice Sheet|continental glaciers]] that advanced and retreated over Minnesota several times in the past 2 million years. The mile-thick ice sheets easily eroded the [[sandstone]] that filled the axis of the rift valley, but encountered more resistance from the [[igneous rock]]s forming the flanks of the rift, now the margins of the lake basin. As the last glacier retreated, meltwaters filled the lake to as high as 500 feet above the current level; the Skyline Parkway roughly follows one of the highest levels of the ancient Lake Superior, [[Glacial Lake Duluth]].<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" /> The sandstone that buried the igneous rocks of the rift is exposed near Fond du Lac. At one time a large number of quarries produced the stone, sold as Fond du Lac or Lake Superior [[brownstone]]. It was widely used in Duluth buildings and also shipped to Minneapolis, Chicago, and Milwaukee, where it was also used extensively. The weathered sandstone forms the sandy lake bottom and shores of Park Point.<ref name=\"Duluth Streams\" />\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Spring blizzard, March 2007]]\n\nDuluth has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), slightly moderated by its proximity to Lake Superior.

Great local variations are also common because of the rapid change in elevation between the nearly 900-foot hilltop and shoreside. Often this variation manifests itself as snow at the Miller Hill Mall while rain falls in Canal Park.<ref name=\"superior\" />\n\nThe record low temperature in Duluth is {{convert|-41|\u00b0F}}, set on January 2, 1885, and the record high temperature is {{convert|106|\u00b0F}}, set on July 13, 1936.

However, on August 9, 2012 at around 11 AM, a tornado touched down on Minnesota Point. It had originally started as a waterspout in Superior Bay, two miles from Sky Harbor Airport, but briefly found its way onto the sandbar's shoreline, making it an 'official' tornado. It quickly dissipated, but soon touched down again on Barker's Island, where it again quickly dissipated. It caused no serious damage, as it was a very weak tornado, scoring only EF0 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. At the time the [[National Weather Service]] reported that it was Duluth's first tornado. Further investigation showed that more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1958|5|26}}|-1}} years ago, on May 26, 1958, Duluth had a \"miniature tornado\" that collapsed a garage and damaged two area lake cabins. It lasted only five minutes. The ''News-Tribune'' reported a possible twister on July 11, 1935: \"Swirling into the city on the wings of a torrential rain, a miniature tornado struck in the heart of the Gary-New Duluth district shortly before 8 a.m. yesterday, flattening a row of coal sheds (and) a frame garage and causing general damage to trees in the vicinity. The United States weather bureau had no means of officially recording the twister, the high wind having limited itself to the Gary-New Duluth district.\"<ref>[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/239784/ Duluth News Tribune | Duluth, Minnesota<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref name=\"Pioneer Press\">{{cite news | url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | title=Duluth tornado/waterspout might not have been a first | date=August 14, 2012 | access-date=July 19, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808170417/http://www.twincities.com/ci_21309198/duluth-tornado-waterspout-might-not-have-been-first | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1860= 80\n|1870= 3131\n|1880= 3483\n|1890= 33115\n|1900= 52969\n|1910= 78466\n|1920= 98917\n|1930= 101453\n|1940= 101065\n|1950= 104511\n|1960= 107312\n|1970= 100578\n|1980= 92811\n|1990= 85493\n|2000= 86918\n|2010= 86265\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=85884\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|access-date=May 29, 2013}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], there were 86,265 people, 35,705 households, and 18,680 families residing in the city.

It is also a major transportation center for the transshipment of coal, taconite, agricultural products, steel, limestone, and cement. In recent years it has seen strong growth in the transshipment of wind turbine components coming and going from manufacturers in both Europe and North Dakota and of oversized industrial machinery manufactured all around the world and destined for the tar sands oil extraction projects in northern Alberta.\n\nDuluth has attracted several new engineering firms including TKDA, Barr Engineering, LHB, [[Enbridge]] and Lake Superior Consulting, as well as new start-ups in various fields, including Loll Designs, an eco-friendly furniture company, and [[microbrewery]] [[Bent Paddle Brewing Company|Bent Paddle]].<ref name=CBSNews/> Women's clothing retail chain [[Maurices]] is also headquartered in Duluth. In 1989, the [[workwear]] and accessories brand [[Duluth Trading Company]] was founded on a [[barge]] in the city's shipping district. The company moved its headquarters to southern Wisconsin in 2000.\n\nDuluth is a center for aquatic biology and aquatic science. The city is home to the EPA's Mid-Continent Ecology Division Laboratory and the [[University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth]]. These institutions have spawned many economically and scientifically important businesses that support Duluth's economy. A short list of these businesses include ERA Laboratories, LimnoLogic, the ASci Corporation, Environmental Consulting and Testing, and [[Ecolab]].\n\nThe city is popular for tourism. Duluth is a convenient base for trips to the scenic [[North Shore (Lake Superior)|North Shore]] via [[Minnesota State Highway 61|Highway 61]] and to fishing and wilderness destinations in Minnesota's far north, including the [[Superior National Forest]], Lake Vermilion and the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area]].

Not a commercial success, the flights ended later that summer when the designer of the aircraft's engine crashed it. After being purchased and used for scheduled flights in Florida, the plane returned to Duluth and other locations for passenger flights in 1914, until it was ultimately damaged in a hard landing later that year in California and pronounced unsalvageable.

It is largely a conversion of an old [[warehouse district]] into restaurants, caf\u00e9s, hotels, and shops, especially those dealing in antiques and other novelties. This conversion began in the 1980s as an attempt to use Duluth's rich [[industry|industrial]] past, the decline of which had left the city in economic turmoil. A 4.2-mile lakewalk cuts through the area, offering a view of Park Point's extensive sandy dunes and beaches. Swimming is an option, though few are willing to swim in Lake Superior's icy waters.

The formal terraced garden and English-style landscape was designed by the [[Charles Wellford Leavitt]] firm of New York. Construction began in 1905 at a cost of $854,000 (about $21 million in today's dollars), and was completed in 1908.

The museum also curates an artifact collection of over 25,000 objects drawn from the lives and cultures of people who have resided in the region, particularly American Indians and immigrants.\n\n====Christmas City of the North Parade====\nEach year in November, the Christmas City of the North Parade takes place in Duluth. The parade dates to 1957, when the holiday shopping season ran particularly short. Wanting to extend Christmas shopping days, Bob Rich, who at the time owned the former WDSM-TV, now [[KBJR-TV]], came up with the idea. Since then, the parade has marched through downtown Duluth annually on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. The event has survived pouring rain, snow and frigid cold.

Wearing a thick neoprene wetsuit, or perhaps two, surfers gather at Stoney Point, a rocky bay about 15 miles north of Duluth, where waves as high as 15 feet can be expected. In a 2013 broadcast, [[Minnesota Public Radio]] featured a segment on Duluth/Lake Superior surfing, and surfer Mark Anderson from St. Paul described the Duluth surfing experience as \"...{{nbsp}}standing in the snow, jumping off of an ice-covered rock into Lake Superior to go catch waves that any surfer anywhere in the world, pro or beginner, would envy.\" Erik Wilkie, a surfer originally from California interviewed by MPR, remarked that while Lake Superior surfing may look easy, it can be dangerous. \"There's the ice-cold freshwater, which is not as buoyant as saltwater. Lake waves also appear every five seconds or so, much faster than those in the ocean. If you take off on the first or second wave and you wipe out, then you've got four, five, six, eight waves coming right behind you to smash you in the head before you can get back on your board and swim out of there to safety.\" Like surfers everywhere, Duluth surfers notify fellow surfers when the waves are up.

The first floor had a pharmacy and a department store with groceries, a butcher shop, clothing, hardware, furniture, and a general store. The second floor had a bank, dentist office, barber shop, hair salon, hat shop, billiard room, and auditorium.

But Charles Watson Townsend's 1936 ''New York Times'' obituary claimed that he was the inventor, and a controversy developed. A ''St. Paul Pioneer Press'' reporter read Townsend's obituary and realized that the ''Times'' had incorrectly attributed the invention to Townsend. Wanting to set the record straight, on May 23, 1936, the ''Pioneer Press'' ran a story about how the dessert was really invented at a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth in the 1880s, and indicated that the restaurant served ice cream with blueberry pie specifically. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie \u00e0 la Mode.<ref>''The New York Times'', May 21, 1936, pg.23, Charles W.

A [[Duluth pack]] is a traditional [[portage]] pack used in canoe travel. A specialized type of backpack, Duluth packs are nearly square in order to fit easily in the bottom of a canoe. The Duluth pack has its roots in a French-Canadian named Camille Poirier. Arriving in Duluth in 1870 with a small stock of leather and tools, he began a shoe store and quickly made a go of it in what was then a booming frontier town on the shores of Lake Superior. Out of his small shoe shop on the waterfront, Poirier began building a new style [[canoe pack]] with a [[tumpline]], sternum strap, and umbrella holder. Patented by Poirer in 1882, the original #3 Duluth Packs have changed little since they were first introduced. He sold the backpack business to the company that now does business as Duluth Pack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|title=Duluth Pack - Autobiography of Camille Poirier|first=Sheldon|last=Aubut|access-date=March 10, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614153146/http://www.cityhistory.us/duluth/stories/duluth_pack.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Chun King, Jeno's Pizza Rolls, and Bellisio Frozen Foods===\n\n{{Main|Chun King|Pizza Rolls|Bellisio Foods}}\n\nDuluth was the home of food magnate [[Jeno Paulucci]]. While working as a wholesale grocer in Hibbing in the late 1940s, Paulucci noticed a growing market for prepared Chinese food. Borrowing $2,500 from a friend, he started canning chow mein \"seasoned to [his] own Italian taste\", and selling it to retailers under the label [[Chun King]]. Chun King came to encompass an entire line of prepared Chinese food; at that time not available in grocery stores. In 1966, he sold his enterprise for $63 million. In 1968, Paulucci founded [[Totino's|Jeno's Inc.]], a company that sold frozen pizzas and a variety of other \"Italian\" foods. The most notable of these was undoubtedly his own invention, the [[pizza roll]], a snack food consisting of an Italian filling wrapped in an egg roll wrapper. He sold Jeno's Inc. for $135 million in 1985. In the 1990s, he started [[Bellisio Foods]], a leading diversified frozen food company named after Paulucci's familial home in Italy, Bellisio Solfare.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | work=The New York Times | first=Daniel E. | last=Slotnik | title=Jeno Paulucci, a Pioneer of Ready-Made Ethnic Foods, Dies at 93 | date=November 25, 2011 | access-date=February 21, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301201314/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/jeno-paulucci-a-pioneer-of-ready-made-ethnic-foods-dies-at-93.html?_r=1& | archive-date=March 1, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===Electric elevator===\n\nIn 1887, inventor [[Alexander Miles]] of Duluth patented an electric [[elevator]].

Traditional bread is baked on [[sweet flag]] leaves. Bread baking was considered an important ritual.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lithuanian traditional foods.

Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior. [[Sorrel]] is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n[[Linseed oil]] was moderately popular.\n\n==Berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants. Foraging==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

During the autumn harvest, fruit is often simmered and spiced to create fruit stews ([[kompot]]s). [[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.

There are many varieties of smoked pork, including [[ham]] and a soft [[sausage]] with a large-grained filling; these are served as a main course or thinly sliced in sandwiches. [[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]].

Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''s\u016breliai'' are popular too. Also, a big variety of different soured milk products are available in the supermarkets, though some people still prefer making their own soured milk. A Milk road route was created which leads through important objects of milk producsing in Lithuania.\n\n===Milk and milk derivatives===\n\nVariety of milk is large - milk, buttermilk, soured milk, kefir, cream, yougurt.

Several Lithuanian beers have won international awards. Local breweries are enjoying a renaissance. Beer is the most common alcoholic beverage. Lithuania has a long farmhouse beer tradition, first mentioned in 11th-century chronicles. Beer was brewed for ancient Baltic [[Festival|festivities]] and rituals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|website=www.llti.lt|page=18|title=Alus \u2013 apeiginis balt\u0173 g\u0117rimas|accessdate=22 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808021048/http://www.llti.lt/failai/05_Laurinkienes.pdf|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ancient Lithuanian god for brewing beer and mead was ''Ragutis'' or ''R\u016bgutis''. Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey. [[Baltic people]] were making ''midus'' for thousands of years. One of the first mentionings of Balts and mead was by the 9th-century traveller [[Wulfstan of Hedeby]], who visited [[Old Prussians|Prussians]].  Old Lithuanian mead was made from a solution of honey and water simmered with various spices, such as thyme, lemon, cinnamon, cherries, linden blossoms, juniper berries, and hops.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kublickas |first1=Rimantas |title=Traditional Foods |pages=339\u2013343 |chapter=Midus: A Traditional Lithuanian Mead |doi=10.1007/978-1-4899-7648-2_27 |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-4899-7646-8 }}</ref>\nOldest recipe of Lithuanian ''midus'' was recorded in a book by [[Olaus Magnus]] ''[[Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus]]'', published in Rome in 1555.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Lau\u017eikas R. |author2=Astrauskas A. |title=How the Future King of England Ate Peacock in Vilnius: the Shared Cultural, Political and Culinary History of Britain and Lithuania |date=2018 |publisher=Lietuvos kult\u016bros institutas |location=Vilnius |isbn=9786098015652 |pages=135}}</ref>  ''Midus'' was considered a drink of nobleman and gentry.

Initiatives of B.Karazija made a fruit wine a traditional drink in Lithuania. Currently blueberry, apple, apple ice wine, black currant, aronia, cherry wines being produced by smaller and bigger companies.\n\n===Other===\n*''Arbata ([[tea]])'' - [[chamomile]], [[rosehip]], [[thyme]] and other herbal teas are popular as well as black tea. Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.\n*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye. Produced domestically, its quality ranges from basic to triple-[[Distilled beverage|distilled]].\n*''Kava ([[coffee]])'' is brewed in [[espresso]] makers or [[Moka pot|moka pots]] at home, or with espresso machines in cafes. It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee. The first coffeehouses appeared in Lithuania in the 18th century and in 1814 there were 49 coffeehouses in Vilnius.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Balsevi\u010di\u016bt\u0117-\u0160lekien\u0117 |first1=Virginija |title=Vilniaus kavin\u0117s istoriniuose \u0161altiniuose ir memuaruose |url=http://www.su.lt/bylos/fakultetai/humanitarinis/ml/acta/acta-h-15/slekiene.pdf |accessdate=2 May 2019 |language=LT |format=PDF}}</ref> Journalist Rapolas Mackonis was explorer of cafe life and wrote about culture of cafes in Vilnius and Kaunas. \n*''[[Starka]]'', an aged vodka, as well as [[Krupnikas]], a honey liqueur, are traditional drinks dating from the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in the 16th - 18th centuries.\n*''[[Bitters|Trauktin\u0117]]'' (a bitter) is a strong herbal vodka; there are many varieties. It is also used as traditional medicine. ''Trejos devynerios'' (\"999\"), steeped with 27 different herbs, is one of the best known.\n* ''Vynas'' ([[wine]]) culture is firmly growing in Lithuania - wineries and specialised wine shops for Italian, French, New World wines operate in biggest cities. The wine exhibition ''Vyno dienos'' (''Days of Wine'') taking place in May, is the largest wine exhibition in Northern Europe. Lithuania historically is a wine importer, since its climate isn't very friendly for growing grapevines.\n\n==Special occasions==\n[[File:K\u016b\u010dios.JPG|thumb|right|220px|''K\u016b\u010dios'' ''(Christmas Eve)'' table]]\nEaster and Christmas (Christmas Eve) are festives which have their own table presentations and type of dishes in Lithuania.

The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served. A special bread is sometimes baked and adorned with flowers and bird-shaped decorations, or a [[\u0161akotis]] is decorated. The ideal Lithuanian wedding lasts at least two days, so a great deal of cooking and baking goes on.\n*Funerals - The bereaved family usually hosts a dinner for all the mourners at a restaurant or other similar venue.\n*Informal gatherings and cocktail parties - The hosts often serve small open-face sandwiches, similar to those at a Scandinavian [[smorgasbord]], topped with smoked fish, sausage, cucumbers, and so forth. Flavored vodkas, which may have been concocted with fruits and herbs according to the host's or hostess's own family recipe, may be served.\n\n==Contemporary cuisine and restaurants==\n[[File:Benediktas food market, Vilnius, Lithuania, June 2018.jpg|thumb|Modern food market ''Benediktas'' in Vilnius]]\n\nCurrently, Lithuania is affected by modern cuisine trends - fusion, new Nordic, craft beer, craft food.

Potatoes were introduced into Lithuania in the late 18th century, were found to prosper in its climate, and soon became indispensable.\n\n[[Cucumber]]s, [[dill pickle]]s, [[radish]]es and greens are quite popular. [[Beet]]s (''burokai'') are grown more widely than in other areas of the world and are often used for making [[borscht]] and side dishes. [[Cabbage]] is another popular vegetable, used as a basis for [[soup]]s, or wrapped around fillings (''baland\u0117liai''). [[Tomato]]es are now available year-round in stores, but those home-grown in family greenhouses are still considered superior. [[Sorrel]] is grown in the gardens for soup and salad.\n\nLithuanian herbs and seasonings include mustard seed, [[horseradish]] (''krienai''), [[dill]] (''krapai''), [[caraway]] seed (''kmynai''), [[garlic]], [[bay leaf]], [[juniper]] berries (''kadagio uogos''), hemp seeds and fruit essences.  [[Vanilla]] and [[Black pepper|pepper]] were scarce during the Soviet occupation, but were welcomed back again after restitution of the independence. The cuisine is relatively mild.\n\nPickling is a popular way to prepare vegetables for winter or just to give them a particular flavour. Cucumbers, beets, dills, homegrown tomatoes, onions, garlic is pickled and available all year round.\n\n[[Linseed oil]] was moderately popular.\n\n==Berries and mushrooms, edible wild plants. Foraging==\n\nOne of the prides of Lithuanian cuisine is its wide use of wild berries and mushrooms and this foraging tradition is pretty much alive to this day.\n\nMushrooming is a popular pastime from mid-summer to autumn. As a staple, mushrooms are usually harvested in the forest; occasionally they are purchased at roadside markets, especially on the road in the [[Dz\u016bkija]] region from [[Druskininkai]] to [[Vilnius]]; the purchasing of mushrooms in shops is rare. Despite its status as a delicacy, mushrooms are thought of by many Lithuanians as hard to digest. Dried mushrooms being used as a seasoning. A number of mushroom species are harvested from the wild, including:\n* ''Baravykas'' \u2013 [[Boletus edulis|king bolete]];\n* ''Voverait\u0117'' (literally, ''little squirrel''), ''lepe\u0161ka'' (in [[Dz\u016bkija]] region) \u2013 [[chanterelle]];\n* ''Gudukas'', ''vokietukas'', ''kalpokas'', ''vi\u0161tel\u0117'' \u2013 [[Cortinarius caperatus|gypsy mushroom]].\n\n''Baravykas'' is the most valued and sought-after species; the primary usages are drying and marinating. Dried ''baravykas'' has a strong pleasant scent and is used as a seasoning in soups and sauces. ''Voverait\u0117'' is often used fresh as a seasoning in soups or sauteed. Most common dish of this mushroom is ''voverait\u0117'' sauteed with chopped bulb onions and potatoes. ''Gudukas'', arguably the most locally abundant of edible mushrooms due to its lower popularity, is usually marinated. Other edible mushrooms, such as ''lep\u0161\u0117'' ([[Leccinum scabrum]]), ''raudonvir\u0161is'' or ''raudonikis'' (literally, \"red-topped\") ([[Leccinum aurantiacum]]), ''makavykas'' ([[Suillus variegatus]]), ''\u0161ilbaravykis'' ([[Xerocomus badius]]), are more rare, but are also gathered and may be used in the same ways as ''baravykas''.\n\nWild berries are also gathered or, even more frequently than mushrooms, purchased at roadside markets or shops. [[Bilberry|Bilberries]] (''m\u0117lyn\u0117s'') and [[Vaccinium vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (''brukn\u0117s'') are the two most abundant species of wild berries. [[Cranberry|Cranberries]] (''spanguol\u0117s'') are valued, but their cultivation is limited to certain boggy areas, such as those adjacent to [[\u010cepkeliai Marsh]]. Sour cranberry or lingonberry jam and sweet bilberry jam are all considered excellent sauces for pancakes (''blynai''). Lingonberry jam is occasionally used as a dressing for fried chicken or turkey or as a sauce for other savory dishes. Fresh bilberries may be put into a cold milk soup. [[Fragaria vesca|Wild strawberries]] (''\u017eemuog\u0117s'') are relatively scarce and are usually gathered for immediate consumption.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Foraging\" widths=\"200\" heights=\"165\" class=\"center\">\nFile:Boletus edulis EtgHollande 041031 091.jpg|Boletus, the \"King of Mushrooms\"\nFile:Chanterelle Cantharellus cibarius.jpg|[[Chanterelle]]s are popular mushrooms in Lithuania\nFile:Vaccinium vitis-idaea 20060824 003.jpg|Lingonberry\nFile:\u010cu\u010doriedky.jpg|Bilberry\nFile:Suillus brevipes 78.jpg|Butter-mushroom\nFile:Fragaria_vesca_2.jpg|Strawberry\nFile:Glyceria fluitans \u2014 Flora Batava \u2014 Volume v8.jpg|''[[Glyceria fluitans]]'' (''paprastoji mona\u017eol\u0117'').

[[Gooseberry|Gooseberries]] (''agrastai'') and [[Ribes|currant]]s (''serbentai'') are widely cultivated; they are sweetened, made into jams and baked goods, and provide a piquant touch to desserts. Small local producers make fine fruit wines from raspberries, and especially blackcurrants; apple icewine is also produced. Apple cheese which is considered a desert is very popular in autumn. Oldest apple cheese recipe in Lithuania was found in the book of [[Radziwi\u0142\u0142 family|Radvila family]] chef from the 17th century.

[[Skilandis]] is a popular Lithuanian sausage added to the list of EU's [[Protected Designation of Origin|Protected Designations of Origin]]. The art of meat smoking has long traditions in Lithuania - the right choice of woods, heat or distance from fire required a mastery. Skilandis was smoked in a special room - ''kaminas'' which was used for cooking.\n\n==Fish==\n\nFreshwater fish with exception of herring was the most popular fish in Lithuania. Fish, such as [[Northern pike|pike]], [[zander]] or [[perch]], are often baked whole or stuffed. [[Herring]] is marinated, baked, fried, or served in [[aspic]].

Dairy products play an important role in Lithuanian cuisine; [[curd cheese]] (similar to cottage cheese) may be sweet, sour, seasoned with caraway, fresh, or cured until semi-soft. Lithuanian butter and cream is unusually rich. Sour cream is so prominent in Lithuanian cuisine, that it is eaten with everything - meat, fish, pancakes, soups, desserts, salads and so on. Lithuanian curd snacks called ''s\u016breliai'' are popular too.

Lithuania is not very well known for its beer worldwide, but it is one of the few countries in Europe to have an independent beer tradition in which breweries do not simply brew beers in styles developed elsewhere. Traditional farmhouse brewing has survived into the present day in Lithuania, and during Soviet times such brewing started to be expanded to a larger scale. After independence, this process gathered speed and soon there were more than 200 breweries in the country. Many of these have since gone out of business, but Lithuania still has about 80 breweries, of which perhaps 60-70 produce beers in styles unknown in the rest of the world. Some of these are very close to the traditional brews made by farmers, while others have developed out of that tradition as a consequence of the growth of the traditional brewers into reasonably large regional breweries.\n\nFarmhouse brewing survived to a greater extent in Lithuania than anywhere else, and through accidents of history the Lithuanians then developed a commercial brewing culture from their unique farmhouse traditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garshol.priv.no/download/lithuanian-beer-guide/book.pdf|website=www.garshol.priv.no|page=5|title=Lithuanian beer - A rough guide|accessdate=22 March 2018}}</ref> Lithuania is top 5 by consumption of beer per capita in Europe in 2015, counting 75 active breweries, 32 of them are microbreweries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/uploads/mycms-files/documents/publications/2016/stats_2016_web.pdf|website=www.brewersofeurope.org|title=Beer statistics - 2016 edition|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe microbrewery scene in Lithuania has been growing in later years, with a number of bars focusing on these beers popping up in Vilnius and also in other parts of the country. Local beers have started to attract international attention after beer bloggers discovered the country, inspiring a major feature article in Beer Connoisseur magazine, prompting the New York Times to list Lithuania as one of the 42 places to visit in 2013 on the strength of the village beers. Beer routes are organized through the main breweries in northern Lithuania.\n\n===Midus===\n\n''[[Midus]]'' is said to be the most ancient Lithuanian alcoholic beverage; it is a variety of [[mead]] made from honey.

Many herbal infusions are used for medicinal purposes.\n*''Gira ([[kvass]])'' is a non-alcoholic beverage made by the natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian [[kvass]]. Those brewed from rye [[bread]] and from [[caraway]] seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.\n*''Degtin\u0117 (\"the burn\")'' is the Lithuanian version of [[vodka]], traditionally made from rye.

It is quite strong and usually sweetened. Coffeehouses (''kavin\u0117'') can be found not only on every street corner in towns but at highway rest stops and at every point of interest. First traditionally Lithuanians roasted oak acorns and made ''gili\u0173 kava'' (acorn coffee) - a substitute for natural bean coffee.

The diners touch their eggs together as a sort of toast (among the children, this custom sometimes devolves into a smashing contest). Dinner may be roast goose or ham and accompaniments. Dessert is often a cake made to resemble a birch log, or cookies shaped and decorated as mushrooms.\n*Birthdays - The family's favorite cake is served. Traditionally in Lithuania the day of the saint after whom one was named was celebrated by the family as well as one's own birth date; for instance, a John would celebrate his name day on St. John's Day ([[Jonin\u0117s]]), June 23.\n*Christmas Eve ([[K\u016b\u010dios]]) - Twelve dishes are presented on a table spread with hay and lit by candles. No animal products, including dairy products or eggs, can be consumed as part of this meal. However, fish is permitted and regularly forms part of the meal. This custom is widespread in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Eastern Europe]], but traditions vary to different families. It is supposed that rituals and servicing of the Christmas Eve table reflect the most ancient Lithuanian traditions.\n*Weddings - The widest possible variety of courses are served.

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans. Any player named to the First Team by all five of the NCAA-recognized selectors is deemed a Unanimous All-American.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |title=2010-11 NCAA Statistics Policies(updated 9/15/2010) |accessdate=December 10, 2011 |archivedate=December 10, 2011 |date=September 15, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/63plxMYlJ?url=http://www.ncaa.org/wps/wcm/connect/public/ncaa/resources/stats/statistics+policies |publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sportingnews.com/ca/ncaa-football/news/alabamas-tua-tagovailoa-2018-consensus-all-american-team/u4gei2bnxvig1jmptsbwhsj97 2018 Consensus All-America Team]</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"0\" \n|-\n!

Sports]] (Yahoo!).\n\nCurrently, the NCAA compiles consensus all-America teams in the sports of [[NCAA Division I#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-FBS]] football and Division I men's basketball using a point system computed from All-America teams named by coaches associations or media sources.  The system consists of three points for a first-team honor, two points for second-team honor, and one point for third-team honor.  Honorable mention and fourth team or lower recognitions are not accorded any points.  Football consensus teams are compiled by position and the player accumulating the most points at each position is named first team consensus all-American.  Currently, the NCAA recognizes All-Americans selected by the '''AP, AFCA, FWAA, ''TSN'', and the WCFF''' to determine Consensus and Unanimous All-Americans.
