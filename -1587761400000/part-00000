In the group stage, two points are awarded for a win, one for a no-result and none for a loss. In the event of tied scores after both teams have faced their quota of overs, a [[super over]] is used to determine the match winner. In the group stage teams are ranked on the following criteria:\n\n# Higher number of points\n# If equal, better run rate\n# If equal, highest number of wins\n# If equal, fewest losses\n# If still equal, the results of head to head meeting\n\nIn any play-off match in which there is no result, a super over is used to determine the winner. If the super over is not possible or the result of the over is a tie, the team which finished in the highest league position at the end of the regular season is deemed the winner of the match.\n\n==Teams==\nAccording to a PCB press release, around 20 parties showed an interest in buying franchises for the league before the first season.<ref name=NDTVSPORTS>{{cite news|title=PSL promises IPL style Cricket|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/248904-pakistan-super-league-glitz-glamour-and-promises-of-ipl-style-cricket|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=NDTV Sports|date=21 September 2015}}</ref> On 18 October 2015 the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] began accepting tenders for franchises with a deadline for bids of 15 November.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB invites bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/sports/pc-invites-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises/|website=Daily Pakistan|publisher=Ali Zain|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a statement by the PCB, bid winners would be granted the rights to a franchise for a term of ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB initiates bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/75259/pakistan-cricket-board-initiates-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises|publisher=[[Cricbuzz]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> Interested parties included the ARY Group, Omar Associates, Arif Habib Group, [[Haier]], [[Mobilink]] as well as international groups including [[Leonine Global Sports]] and the Qatar Lubricants Company (QALCO).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll five franchises for the first season of the league were sold on 3 December 2015, for a total price of {{US$|93 million}}, after seven bidders presented formal proposals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=The Express Tribune|author=Nabeel Hashmi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PCB sells five PSL teams for $93m|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/948267.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=3 December 2015|work=ESPNcricinfo|author=Umar Farooq}}</ref>\n[[File:PSL Map of Participating Nations.png|thumb|PSL Map of Participating Nations]]\nIn April 2017, PCB invited bids for the sixth team and the deadline set for the submission of both the financial and technical proposals was 30 May and as many as 40 national and international parties expressed an interest in buying the sixth franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/pcb-invites-bids-sixth-psl-team/|title=PCB invites bids for sixth PSL team|newspaper=Pakistan Observer|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2017, from five regions short-listed by PCB Multan was bought by [[Sch\u00f6n Properties]] for a price of {{US$|5.2 million}} per year becoming the most expensive team of the PSL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1424861/m|title=Multan becomes PSL's sixth franchise as Schon Group buys franchise|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> However, on 12 November 2018, its rights were terminated by PCB due to payment issues.

In the event of tied scores after both teams have faced their quota of overs, a [[super over]] is used to determine the match winner. In the group stage teams are ranked on the following criteria:\n\n# Higher number of points\n# If equal, better run rate\n# If equal, highest number of wins\n# If equal, fewest losses\n# If still equal, the results of head to head meeting\n\nIn any play-off match in which there is no result, a super over is used to determine the winner. If the super over is not possible or the result of the over is a tie, the team which finished in the highest league position at the end of the regular season is deemed the winner of the match.\n\n==Teams==\nAccording to a PCB press release, around 20 parties showed an interest in buying franchises for the league before the first season.<ref name=NDTVSPORTS>{{cite news|title=PSL promises IPL style Cricket|url=http://sports.ndtv.com/cricket/news/248904-pakistan-super-league-glitz-glamour-and-promises-of-ipl-style-cricket|accessdate=23 September 2015|publisher=NDTV Sports|date=21 September 2015}}</ref> On 18 October 2015 the [[Pakistan Cricket Board]] began accepting tenders for franchises with a deadline for bids of 15 November.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB invites bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://en.dailypakistan.com.pk/sports/pc-invites-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises/|website=Daily Pakistan|publisher=Ali Zain|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a statement by the PCB, bid winners would be granted the rights to a franchise for a term of ten years.<ref>{{cite web|title=PCB initiates bids for Pakistan Super League franchises|url=http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/75259/pakistan-cricket-board-initiates-bids-for-pakistan-super-league-franchises|publisher=[[Cricbuzz]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}</ref> Interested parties included the ARY Group, Omar Associates, Arif Habib Group, [[Haier]], [[Mobilink]] as well as international groups including [[Leonine Global Sports]] and the Qatar Lubricants Company (QALCO).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=3 December 2015|accessdate=3 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nAll five franchises for the first season of the league were sold on 3 December 2015, for a total price of {{US$|93 million}}, after seven bidders presented formal proposals.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistan Super League: Seven companies fight it out to buy franchises|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1002853/p|accessdate=3 December 2015|work=The Express Tribune|author=Nabeel Hashmi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=PCB sells five PSL teams for $93m|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan/content/story/948267.html|accessdate=2 July 2017|date=3 December 2015|work=ESPNcricinfo|author=Umar Farooq}}</ref>\n[[File:PSL Map of Participating Nations.png|thumb|PSL Map of Participating Nations]]\nIn April 2017, PCB invited bids for the sixth team and the deadline set for the submission of both the financial and technical proposals was 30 May and as many as 40 national and international parties expressed an interest in buying the sixth franchise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://pakobserver.net/pcb-invites-bids-sixth-psl-team/|title=PCB invites bids for sixth PSL team|newspaper=Pakistan Observer|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 June 2017, from five regions short-listed by PCB Multan was bought by [[Sch\u00f6n Properties]] for a price of {{US$|5.2 million}} per year becoming the most expensive team of the PSL.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1424861/m|title=Multan becomes PSL's sixth franchise as Schon Group buys franchise|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=2 June 2017}}</ref> However, on 12 November 2018, its rights were terminated by PCB due to payment issues.
