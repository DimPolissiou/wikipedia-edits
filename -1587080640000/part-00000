She's a very typical preteen girl, full of giggles and gossip. She is still socially shy, yet confident in her own abilities. The full extension of her indefatigable sense of character is brought out in her duties as the \"Online Oracle\" of her school, Ms. Communica8ion - although this alter ego is an absolute secret. Maddie is best friends with Saffron and Rainbow, whom she usually turns to for advice, sometimes even talk about other peoples' problems.\n\nMaddie also has a crush on Ace, every girls dream date at her school. Her confidence and intelligence usually turns into babbling nonsense, invisible around Ace. After her Imaginary Imagination tries countless of times to woo him, talking to him seems more difficult. (The Problem: There is no supportive evidence that suggest Maddison has a crush on Leet. Leet is usually distracted on his computer. (They are colleague friends), About the End Credits: Both were unpaired: They caught each-other: with usual embarrassment.)\n\n'''Saffron Parker:''' (Pina Crispo) is Maddison's best friend. She's one year older than Maddie, and thus considers herself much more mature and worldly. She's the kind of girl all the guys go for: blonde, beautiful, and highly fashionable. She loves to be noticed wherever she goes, and what attention she doesn't get from others, she gets from her two best friends Maddie and Rainbow. Saffron's brother, Stinky, is always looking for a way to pull a prank on Saffron, which she can usually foil, or at least get him caught in as well.\n\n'''Rainbow:''' (Ann Pirvu) is 13 years old, the third piece of the Maddie-Saffron puzzle. Often found stargazing and meditating, Rainbow is a very spiritual girl, often concerned more with the alignment of her chakras than the algebra due next period. Always a very clear thinker, Rainbow provides insight that the others never see, or believe! Her depth is only outshone by her eccentricity, often showing up for the wrong classes on time, and the right ones late. She hands in phenomenally written poems and essays, but often fails because they're on the wrong topic. Rainbow learns more from her mother than she does from school, taking time each day to analyze auras and balance the flow of positive chi in the classroom with Feng Shui.\n\n'''L33t; (Leet)''' (CJ Sharpe) is the school techno-geek, and extremely proud of it. His technical know-how is often how he gets attention from those who would usually overlook him. His parents put him in school early, which he found almost too easy, and was soon bumped up a grade. Now he's the youngest kid in school and gets at the bottom of the school hierarchy because of it. But because he belongs to none of the cliques in school, he can easily slip between groups, making him very well connected for an 11\u200b3\u20444 year-old.\n\nHe becomes a cool looking guy after he was wrongly accused of being called: Ms. Communica8ion. He has a crush on Maddie by the end of the series. (Leet tries to Detect, trap-capture and expose the I.P. Address of Miss. Communica8ion. He thinks of her as a Fraud. The Problem Student's: can express and identify with Miss. Communica8ion, a student who is just like them :)\n\n(One of us), (she Get it!)\n\nTo whom may it Concern?\n\n'''Ace:''' (Jack Troughton) Ace De Silva is the picture of boyhood beauty, which is a really good thing, because brainy he is not. Ace plays bass guitar and sings in the band 'Fever Meter' alongside Stinky, and their pals Mitch Michenbury and Barry Ryan. Ace is a huge soccer fan and if he isn't at band practice, he's usually out on the field. Ace is known for his shiny white smile, his smooth, sultry voice, and having his headphones basically attached to his head.\n\nAce is a strong, charismatic man of very few words, and coveted by every girl in the school, but none more than Maddie. After Her long, heartfelt, romantic Nervous talks with Ace: Ace partnerships with Maddison but is not sure of their Companionship however does not mind being with her. He never mentioned he want to be her lover; added Clout: Doubt of heart-ships, The Reality is he also could be nervous as well, No ask him \"what does he wanted?\"\n\n'''Destine Fate:''' Privilege Warning: Events are happening before Madison's eyes: (Between Ace and Leet.) Leet Rescues Madison from an attempt to Seal a Kiss in front of the whole School; that may have serious Consequences. He might embrace or Reject Maddison: assuming she (thinks) Ace is her lover. Reach out to Ace's reaction: He may get nervous, embarrass or with Bravery Courage he may have Common Courtesy: (he did not mind at all!) or become selfish in front of the whole entire school. The Problem: [Brittle as a Flower] tensions {Might Escalate} causing a confrontation if not Careful.\n\nThe same might also happen inside a Trap Room: friends could Possibility turn to (spite, with frustration or share a common Interest) not really enemies if not handled carefully. Perhaps Friendship Might gets divided or might not: The Collided Destination Event might have two meanings: End of the World or New Era. A Probably: certain numbers of Planets seen from a Observatory are coming in Aliment together only for a moment duration period of the clock. Back to Maddison Question: \"Should she still hang around Leet after she has been locked in a Maintenance Closet with him?\"\n\n(In Free-Will: No-one leads her to any direction: it is her decision) Free-Will is known to follow the leader without others not knowing your where abouts may turn into an astray abduction; This is not kidnapping. (\"You do not really know me!\") Being trapped May alter the course of a lover's history. Things that did not turn out well or peachy just might change the slightest of Attitudes: Hinder Heightens or be Positive Assertive, even if Maddison was the last Girl on the Globule Planet. Some people are Closet Phobics: does not like closed in spaces. The Question Problem: \"Is Leet still a Hero, Friend, Lover or Zero?\" Leet Considers Maddie as her best friend: even on the Last Days.\n\n''Only Madison could decide:''\n\n'''(Leet Fate:)'''\n\n'''Samuel: known as Stinky''' (Justin Richardson) is Saffron's pain in the butt twin brother, and never referred to by his real name, Samuel, by anyone, including himself. He's an average teenage boy, hopelessly lost when it comes to hygiene and high class. Stinky has few endearing traits, but is known and loved for one thing. He's very protective of his sister and her friends, and makes sure that no one causes them any trouble...except for him! He and Ace are the resident soccer geniuses and often found together, so Maddie puts up with him for the sake of Ace. Stinky is the drummer for the band Fever Meter, and regardless of his unpopularity, their band is the biggest thing in school.\n\n'''Mandii and Mac:''' (Lesley Livingston and Bob Oniskyw) are Maddie's loving parents. Mandii is the host of entertainment news show CelebriTV, and often out of the house filming and interviewing. Mac is a correspondent for a big news network and always off discovering ancient civilizations or nesting with polar bears for better insight on their habits; anything far away and fairly dangerous. Maddie sees her mom far more than she does her dad, who is on assignment 200 or more days a year and only able to talk via webcam. Mandii and Mac act as excellent role models for Maddie, even if it's only on screen. Mandii is always a source of gossip, and as popular with Maddie's friends as Maddie is.\n\n'''Amelia is Maddie's dog: Amelia Earhart''' (her name revealing Maddie's admiration for passionate, powerful women) is always an open ear for Maddie. Because of a thyroid problem,[citation needed] Amelia is overweight, and on a constant dog-diet that she never sticks to. She even has her own miniature treadmill, which she uses to expand her dust collection. Amelia is as fashion-savvy as any teenage girl, spending most of her time flipping through fashion magazines when Maddie isn't around.\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.moodystreetkids.com.au/ Moody Street Kids Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070826145411/http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/ Nine Network Website]\n\n[[Category:Australian children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Australian flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s Canadian animated television series]]\n[[Category:2008 Canadian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 Canadian television series endings]]\n[[Category:Canadian flash animated television series]]\n[[Category:Canadian children's animated fantasy television series]]\n[[Category:Nine Network shows]]\n[[Category:2008 Australian television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 Australian television series endings]]\n[[Category:2000s Australian animated television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Endemol Australia]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Victoria (Australia)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{tone|date=February 2010}}\n{{in-universe|date=February 2010}}\n{{fanpov|date=February 2010}}\n{{cleanup|date=February 2010}}\n}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = G2G: Got to Go!\n| image =\n| image_size =\n| creator = Gillian Carr\n| director = Gillian Carr\n| writer = Chris Anastassiades<br>Ray Boseley\n| voices = Esther Maloney<br>Pina Crispo<br>Ann Pirvu<br>C.J.

The main source of the fires is forested area being cleared to make room for new crops. The new crops to be planted after the smoke clears are not rice and vegetables to feed locals. A single crop is responsible: corn. \n\n\"The true source of the haze... sits in the boardrooms of corporations eager to expand production and profits.
