There are about 3,150 inhabitants living in Rauris.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe market town Rauris is located in the Pinzgau in the state Salzburg at the river Rauriser Ache at the bottom of the [[Sonnblick]] group in the heart of the Nationalpark [[Hohe Tauern]].  Rauris is the largest municipal area of the province of Salzburg.\n\nBucheben, Fr\u00f6stlberg, Grub, Hundsdorf, Marktrevier, Rauris, Seidlwinkl, Unterland, Vorstanddorf, Vorstandrevier, W\u00f6rth and W\u00f6rtherberg are all within the municipal area of Rauris.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Overview of historic development ===\n[[File:Rauris Kirche.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Church of Rauris]]\nThe valley of Rauris is one of the lesser valleys in the Tauern that is permanently populated.  Archeological findings show that these passes were used by ancient people near the Rauriser Tauern (Hochtor). A gilt neck-ring was found on the Maschlalm which originated from the time of [[La T\u00e8ne]] in about 400 B.C. In the centre of Rauris six silver-coins were found, of which three show the head of [[Philip II of Macedon]], who reigned 360 to 336 B.C. on the [[Balkan]].\n\nFurther findings are a small Hercules-statue from Roman-times, a bronze-sword from 1300 B.C., older than a scarab discovered from the time of [[Ramses II]] in about 1200 B.C.\n\n=== The settlement ===\nThe valley was first settled in the south. This began with the founding of Schwaigen in the 12th century. The present-day place of Rauris was named after the Gaisbach earlier. It was first mentioned in 1120. The name \"Rurise\" appeared for the first time in 1122, when Bishop Heinrich of Freising handed over two yards to his brother Count Friedrich of Peilstein, and marked the whole valley.\n\n=== Rauris as a resting point ===\nBy 1230, W\u00f6rth was an important resting point for people and vehicles passing south over the Tauern ([[Seidlwinkl]]) to the mining-area in ([[H\u00fcttwinkl]]).\n\nThe valley of Seidlwinkl was the eastern gateway to the Tauern (Hochtor), its advantage being that it could be open for longer. The importance of the valley led to the construction of the original Rauriser Tauernhaus that gave shelter and warmth to passing tradesmen. Much like the existing pass houses in other valleys. The Rauriser Tauernhaus got the right to sell drinks in 1491.\n\n=== Construction of the church in Rauris ===\nIn 1203 the delighted Chrysant of Ein\u00f6d constructed a chapel in honour of St. Michael. In 1339, the reconstruction of the church was applied for and in just 15 years was completed. In documents from 1411, it has been discovered that the church was reconstructed once again. However, there has only been a consecrated and independent parish of Rauris since 1858. The parish-church of Rauris is called the Church of Saint Martin and Saint James.\n\n=== Gold-mining ===\nThe valley gained providence and wealth through gold-mining. From 1377 to 1802, Rauris held an independent country and mountain-court. Mining reached its peak from the 15th to 16th centuries. The houses of the mine-workers still testify to the affluence of this time with bow-gates and bay windows. By 1500, the valley had more than 3.000 inhabitants.\n\n=== Construction of the weather station ===\nGold-operator [[Ignaz Rojacher]], who lived in the 19th century, built the weather station on [[Sonnblick]] (3.105m / 10.687 feet) in 1886 as a worldwide first and the then most highly situated meteorological observation station.\n\nThe cable car which supplied the weather station on Sonnblick was completed in 1954.

There are about 3,150 inhabitants living in Rauris.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe market town Rauris is located in the Pinzgau in the state Salzburg at the river Rauriser Ache at the bottom of the [[Sonnblick]] group in the heart of the Nationalpark [[Hohe Tauern]].  Rauris is the largest municipal area of the province of Salzburg.\n\nBucheben, Fr\u00f6stlberg, Grub, Hundsdorf, Marktrevier, Rauris, Seidlwinkl, Unterland, Vorstanddorf, Vorstandrevier, W\u00f6rth and W\u00f6rtherberg are all within the municipal area of Rauris.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Overview of historic development ===\n[[File:Rauris Kirche.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Church of Rauris]]\nThe valley of Rauris is one of the lesser valleys in the Tauern that is permanently populated.  Archeological findings show that these passes were used by ancient people near the Rauriser Tauern (Hochtor). A gilt neck-ring was found on the Maschlalm which originated from the time of [[La T\u00e8ne]] in about 400 B.C. In the centre of Rauris six silver-coins were found, of which three show the head of [[Philip II of Macedon]], who reigned 360 to 336 B.C. on the [[Balkan]].\n\nFurther findings are a small Hercules-statue from Roman-times, a bronze-sword from 1300 B.C., older than a scarab discovered from the time of [[Ramses II]] in about 1200 B.C.\n\n=== The settlement ===\nThe valley was first settled in the south. This began with the founding of Schwaigen in the 12th century. The present-day place of Rauris was named after the Gaisbach earlier. It was first mentioned in 1120. The name \"Rurise\" appeared for the first time in 1122, when Bishop Heinrich of Freising handed over two yards to his brother Count Friedrich of Peilstein, and marked the whole valley.\n\n=== Rauris as a resting point ===\nBy 1230, W\u00f6rth was an important resting point for people and vehicles passing south over the Tauern ([[Seidlwinkl]]) to the mining-area in ([[H\u00fcttwinkl]]).\n\nThe valley of Seidlwinkl was the eastern gateway to the Tauern (Hochtor), its advantage being that it could be open for longer. The importance of the valley led to the construction of the original Rauriser Tauernhaus that gave shelter and warmth to passing tradesmen. Much like the existing pass houses in other valleys. The Rauriser Tauernhaus got the right to sell drinks in 1491.\n\n=== Construction of the church in Rauris ===\nIn 1203 the delighted Chrysant of Ein\u00f6d constructed a chapel in honour of St. Michael. In 1339, the reconstruction of the church was applied for and in just 15 years was completed. In documents from 1411, it has been discovered that the church was reconstructed once again. However, there has only been a consecrated and independent parish of Rauris since 1858. The parish-church of Rauris is called the Church of Saint Martin and Saint James.\n\n=== Gold-mining ===\nThe valley gained providence and wealth through gold-mining. From 1377 to 1802, Rauris held an independent country and mountain-court. Mining reached its peak from the 15th to 16th centuries. The houses of the mine-workers still testify to the affluence of this time with bow-gates and bay windows. By 1500, the valley had more than 3.000 inhabitants.\n\n=== Construction of the weather station ===\nGold-operator [[Ignaz Rojacher]], who lived in the 19th century, built the weather station on [[Sonnblick]] (3.105m / 10.687 feet) in 1886 as a worldwide first and the then most highly situated meteorological observation station.\n\nThe cable car which supplied the weather station on Sonnblick was completed in 1954. Until then, everything which was required had to be carried from the valley to the summit.\n\n=== The 20th century ===\nAfter gold-mining almost came to a complete end at the beginning of the 20th century in Raurisertal, attempts were made to try and revive the industry.\n\nHowever, at the beginning of talks within the Rauris community, proposals to recreate the industry were rejected in fear that it could damage the environment and the region's tourism prospects.\n\n=== The Town ===\nIn 1478, the name \"market town\" was used as a title for Rauris. This was confirmed in 1884 by Emperor Franz Josef and again in 1928 more recently.\n\nIn 1732, 166 Protestants had to leave the Raurisertal during the Protestant-expulsion.\n\n== Politics ==\nSince 8 November 1989 Robert Reiter of the [[Austrian People's Party]] is mayor of Rauris.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nRauris is a popular tourist destination with over 420.000 overnight stays each year.\n\n===Rauris Hochalmbahnen===\n{{Infobox ski area\n| name           = Rauris Hochalmbahnen\n| logo           = \n| logo_width     = <!--Default is 150px-->\n| picture        = \n| caption        = \n| location       = Rauris\n| nearest_city   = \n| coordinates    = {{coord|47.223980|12.991583|type:landmark_region:ZZ|display=inline}}\n| pushpin_map    =\n| vertical       = {{convert|1235|m|abbr=on}}\n| top_elevation  = {{convert|2175|m|abbr=on}}\n| base_elevation = {{convert|940|m|abbr=on}}\n| skiable_area   = \n| number_trails  = \n| longest_run    = \n| total_length   = {{convert|32|km|abbr=on}}\n| liftsystem     = \n| lift_capacity  = \n| terrainparks   = \n| snowfall       = \n| snowmaking     = \n| nightskiing    = \n| external_link  = \n}}\nRauris is home to a [[ski resort]] within walking distance from the town center.

It is in the [[municipality]] of [[Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz]], [[Oberpullendorf]] district, [[Burgenland]] state. Until 1899 the village was officially known by the more abbreviated name of '''R\u0151t'''.\n\n==Location==\nRattersdorf is one kilometre south of [[Liebing, Austria|Liebing]], off Austrian Highway&nbsp;55 ([[Kirchschlag in der Buckligen Welt|Kirchschlager]]-[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]). For its last six kilometres before the junction with Hwy.&nbsp;61 (which extends into Hungary as Hwy.&nbsp;87), Hwy.&nbsp;55 closely follows the Austro-Hungarian border north of the K\u0151szegi [[Nature reserve|Nature Protection Zone]], near the Hungarian village of [[K\u0151szeg]]. Rattersdorf forms a part of the K\u0151szeg [[Lutheran]] parish and is the seat of the Rattersdorf [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] parish; civil records are maintained in [[Lockenhaus]].<ref>T. J.

[[Lutzmannsburg]] is 15&nbsp;km away, and the [[Austrian wine]] country of [[Oberpullendorf (district)|Mittelburgenland]], famous for [[Blaufr\u00e4nkisch]] grapes, is 25&nbsp;km away.\n\n==History==\n===Medieval times===\nThe first documented reference to the village, in the form ''Reuth'', dates to 1279, when it was recorded as a possession of \"Mons. de Reuth\", who had acquired the estate from the [[Manorialism|feudal seigneury]] of [[Lockenhaus]] (still the name of a nearby town of about 2,000 people). By 1390, the village was in the possession of the Kanizsay family.\n\nIn 1532 an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] besieged the area, abducting or killing most of the population of [[Liebing]] and Rattersdorf and destroying both villages.\n\nBy 1676, near the apogee of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman power in Europe]], the lands of [[Galanta|Gal\u00e1ntha]] (now in [[Slovakia]]) included Lockenhaus and Rattersdorf and were owned by the [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zy family]], descending from Ferenc Zerh\u00e1zy (1563\u20131594), first baron of Gal\u00e1ntha.\n\n===Austro-Hungarian boundary===\nRattersdorf's population at the 1910 census of [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] was predominantly German-speaking; indeed, the four villages of Liebing, Rattersdorf, [[:eo:Hammerteich|Hammerteich]] and Lockenhaus had a combined population of 2,381 German speakers but only 124 identifying themselves as ethnic Hungarians.<ref name=ratg>Gemeinde Mannersdorf a.d.R., [http://www.mannersdorf-adr.at/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=38 \"Rattersdorf Geschichtliches\"], retrieved 3 July 2009.</ref> After [[World War I]] the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] provisionally assigned the German-speaking Burgenland to Austria but did not settle the exact Austro-Hungarian border. Pursuant to the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], the four villages initially became a part of the K\u0151szeg subdivision of the [[Vas County (former)|Vas]] administrative district in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and a neutral boundary determination commission was created to delineate the frontier.\n\nThe new countries (Austria and Hungary) made overlapping territorial claims. The Hungarian delegation pointed out that the four villages had long-established trading ties with the Hungarian town of K\u0151szeg (known in German as ''G\u00fcns''), whilst Austria, with its greatly reduced territory, population and resources, would face considerable difficulties in adequately providing the area with food and other supplies.<ref name=ratg /> An important factor behind the Hungarian position was Prince [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|P\u00e1l Mikl\u00f3s Victor Esterh\u00e1zy]]'s vast land holdings, which included much of the area in and around Lockenhaus and which he wished to remain within Hungary's territorial boundary; the Hungarian government saw that their best interest lay in supporting his claim. As it happened, although a short-lived [[communism|communist]] government took power in 1919 under [[B\u00e9la Kun]], it failed to redistribute large Hungarian estates, such as those of Esterh\u00e1zy, to the peasantry and became embroiled in war with both [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nAs regards the economic relations of [[K\u0151szeg]] to its substantial hinterland, Austria argued that the area, considered as a single economic entity, had more connections with Austria than with Hungary and that rather than attaching the four villages to Hungary, K\u0151szeg should instead form a part of Austrian Burgenland. Furthermore, if the counterclaim were not accepted, Esterh\u00e1zy need not fear economic difficulties resulting from the alienation of his lands; Austria would willingly compensate him by allowing Austrian timber harvested from his lands to be milled in Hungary.<ref name=ratg />\n\nAustria explained to the boundary determination commission its belief that the loss of Lockenhaus, Hammerteich, Liebing and Rattersdorf would thwart the then proposed expansion of the [[Kirchschlag in der Buckligen Welt|Kirchschlag]]-[[Deutschkreutz]] railway line to Liebing and also the expansion of a line to [[Obersch\u00fctzen]]-[[Hartberg]]. Cutting off access to the hinterland would also undermine the viability of the [[Deutschkreutz]]-[[Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz|Mannersdorf]] railway line.<ref name=ratg />\n\nAustrians also feared losing Lockenhaus to Hungary, believing that local boundary changes would lead to the loss of the glassworks in [[Glash\u00fctten bei Schlaining|Glash\u00fctten]] (known in Hungarian as ''Szal\u00f3nakhuta''), which manufactured a beautiful yellow glass through the admixture of [[sulphur]]. In an April 1922 report the Austrian Ministry of Trade and Industry had declared the glassworks essential to Austrian commerce.<ref name=ratg /> The dispute was referred to the [[League of Nations]] Council in [[Geneva]], which decided on 19 September 1922 that the mostly German-speaking communities of Lockenhaus and Hammerteich \u2014 as well as of [[:de:Hagensdorf|Luising]] in the district of [[G\u00fcssing (district)|G\u00fcssing]], some 35&nbsp;km south of Rattersdorf and also claimed by Hungary \u2014 would be assigned to Austria, whilst Rattersdorf and Liebing, despite the wish of German-speaking majorities as expressed in a 1921 plebiscite, should be assigned to Hungary.\n\nAustria was unhappy with the decision on the status of Rattersdorf and Liebing. The Burgenland state government now proposed an exchange in which these two communities would be joined to Austria, while Austria would transfer its villages of Bleigraben and Prostrum to Hungary, a solution supported by most people in the latter two villages, who were largely [[Serbo-Croatian|Croatian]]-speaking.\n\nAt a meeting in [[Sopron|\u00d6denburg]] (now known by its Hungarian name ''Sopron'') on 22 November 1922 the two countries reached consensus on the proposed swap, and the Paris ''[[Conference of Ambassadors|Conf\u00e9rence des Ambassadeurs]]'' ratified the border settlement on 27 January 1923. In March 1923 the border was redrawn, and the Hungarian dictator [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] ceded Liebing (then known by its Hungarian name ''Rendek'') and Rattersdorf (''R\u0151tfalva'') to Austria, making these the youngest villages within [[Austria]]n [[Burgenland]].<ref name=allg /> At the same time the former Austrian hamlets of Bleigraben (now ''[[\u00d3lmod]]'') and Prostrum (now ''[[Szentp\u00e9terfa]]'') were transferred to [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. After both sides accepted an accurate map detailing the line of demarcation, the neutral boundary determination commission was dissolved at its last meeting in [[Sopron]] on 2 August 1924.<ref name=ratg />\n\n===Nazi occupation of Austria===\nFrom the time of the Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938 until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, Rattersdorf, as with the rest of Austria, was incorporated within [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n==Buildings==\nIn Rattersdorf, built on Roman foundations, is a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] church in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, the oldest church in Burgenland.

It is in the [[municipality]] of [[Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz]], [[Oberpullendorf]] district, [[Burgenland]] state. Until 1899 the village was officially known by the more abbreviated name of '''R\u0151t'''.\n\n==Location==\nRattersdorf is one kilometre south of [[Liebing, Austria|Liebing]], off Austrian Highway&nbsp;55 ([[Kirchschlag in der Buckligen Welt|Kirchschlager]]-[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]). For its last six kilometres before the junction with Hwy.&nbsp;61 (which extends into Hungary as Hwy.&nbsp;87), Hwy.&nbsp;55 closely follows the Austro-Hungarian border north of the K\u0151szegi [[Nature reserve|Nature Protection Zone]], near the Hungarian village of [[K\u0151szeg]].

[[Lutzmannsburg]] is 15&nbsp;km away, and the [[Austrian wine]] country of [[Oberpullendorf (district)|Mittelburgenland]], famous for [[Blaufr\u00e4nkisch]] grapes, is 25&nbsp;km away.\n\n==History==\n===Medieval times===\nThe first documented reference to the village, in the form ''Reuth'', dates to 1279, when it was recorded as a possession of \"Mons. de Reuth\", who had acquired the estate from the [[Manorialism|feudal seigneury]] of [[Lockenhaus]] (still the name of a nearby town of about 2,000 people). By 1390, the village was in the possession of the Kanizsay family.\n\nIn 1532 an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] besieged the area, abducting or killing most of the population of [[Liebing]] and Rattersdorf and destroying both villages.\n\nBy 1676, near the apogee of [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman power in Europe]], the lands of [[Galanta|Gal\u00e1ntha]] (now in [[Slovakia]]) included Lockenhaus and Rattersdorf and were owned by the [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|Esterh\u00e1zy family]], descending from Ferenc Zerh\u00e1zy (1563\u20131594), first baron of Gal\u00e1ntha.\n\n===Austro-Hungarian boundary===\nRattersdorf's population at the 1910 census of [[Austria\u2013Hungary]] was predominantly German-speaking; indeed, the four villages of Liebing, Rattersdorf, [[:eo:Hammerteich|Hammerteich]] and Lockenhaus had a combined population of 2,381 German speakers but only 124 identifying themselves as ethnic Hungarians.<ref name=ratg>Gemeinde Mannersdorf a.d.R., [http://www.mannersdorf-adr.at/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=31&Itemid=38 \"Rattersdorf Geschichtliches\"], retrieved 3 July 2009.</ref> After [[World War I]] the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)]] provisionally assigned the German-speaking Burgenland to Austria but did not settle the exact Austro-Hungarian border. Pursuant to the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]], the four villages initially became a part of the K\u0151szeg subdivision of the [[Vas County (former)|Vas]] administrative district in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], and a neutral boundary determination commission was created to delineate the frontier.\n\nThe new countries (Austria and Hungary) made overlapping territorial claims. The Hungarian delegation pointed out that the four villages had long-established trading ties with the Hungarian town of K\u0151szeg (known in German as ''G\u00fcns''), whilst Austria, with its greatly reduced territory, population and resources, would face considerable difficulties in adequately providing the area with food and other supplies.<ref name=ratg /> An important factor behind the Hungarian position was Prince [[House of Esterh\u00e1zy|P\u00e1l Mikl\u00f3s Victor Esterh\u00e1zy]]'s vast land holdings, which included much of the area in and around Lockenhaus and which he wished to remain within Hungary's territorial boundary; the Hungarian government saw that their best interest lay in supporting his claim. As it happened, although a short-lived [[communism|communist]] government took power in 1919 under [[B\u00e9la Kun]], it failed to redistribute large Hungarian estates, such as those of Esterh\u00e1zy, to the peasantry and became embroiled in war with both [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Czechoslovakia]].\n\nAs regards the economic relations of [[K\u0151szeg]] to its substantial hinterland, Austria argued that the area, considered as a single economic entity, had more connections with Austria than with Hungary and that rather than attaching the four villages to Hungary, K\u0151szeg should instead form a part of Austrian Burgenland. Furthermore, if the counterclaim were not accepted, Esterh\u00e1zy need not fear economic difficulties resulting from the alienation of his lands; Austria would willingly compensate him by allowing Austrian timber harvested from his lands to be milled in Hungary.<ref name=ratg />\n\nAustria explained to the boundary determination commission its belief that the loss of Lockenhaus, Hammerteich, Liebing and Rattersdorf would thwart the then proposed expansion of the [[Kirchschlag in der Buckligen Welt|Kirchschlag]]-[[Deutschkreutz]] railway line to Liebing and also the expansion of a line to [[Obersch\u00fctzen]]-[[Hartberg]]. Cutting off access to the hinterland would also undermine the viability of the [[Deutschkreutz]]-[[Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz|Mannersdorf]] railway line.<ref name=ratg />\n\nAustrians also feared losing Lockenhaus to Hungary, believing that local boundary changes would lead to the loss of the glassworks in [[Glash\u00fctten bei Schlaining|Glash\u00fctten]] (known in Hungarian as ''Szal\u00f3nakhuta''), which manufactured a beautiful yellow glass through the admixture of [[sulphur]]. In an April 1922 report the Austrian Ministry of Trade and Industry had declared the glassworks essential to Austrian commerce.<ref name=ratg /> The dispute was referred to the [[League of Nations]] Council in [[Geneva]], which decided on 19 September 1922 that the mostly German-speaking communities of Lockenhaus and Hammerteich \u2014 as well as of [[:de:Hagensdorf|Luising]] in the district of [[G\u00fcssing (district)|G\u00fcssing]], some 35&nbsp;km south of Rattersdorf and also claimed by Hungary \u2014 would be assigned to Austria, whilst Rattersdorf and Liebing, despite the wish of German-speaking majorities as expressed in a 1921 plebiscite, should be assigned to Hungary.\n\nAustria was unhappy with the decision on the status of Rattersdorf and Liebing. The Burgenland state government now proposed an exchange in which these two communities would be joined to Austria, while Austria would transfer its villages of Bleigraben and Prostrum to Hungary, a solution supported by most people in the latter two villages, who were largely [[Serbo-Croatian|Croatian]]-speaking.\n\nAt a meeting in [[Sopron|\u00d6denburg]] (now known by its Hungarian name ''Sopron'') on 22 November 1922 the two countries reached consensus on the proposed swap, and the Paris ''[[Conference of Ambassadors|Conf\u00e9rence des Ambassadeurs]]'' ratified the border settlement on 27 January 1923. In March 1923 the border was redrawn, and the Hungarian dictator [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] ceded Liebing (then known by its Hungarian name ''Rendek'') and Rattersdorf (''R\u0151tfalva'') to Austria, making these the youngest villages within [[Austria]]n [[Burgenland]].<ref name=allg /> At the same time the former Austrian hamlets of Bleigraben (now ''[[\u00d3lmod]]'') and Prostrum (now ''[[Szentp\u00e9terfa]]'') were transferred to [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]]. After both sides accepted an accurate map detailing the line of demarcation, the neutral boundary determination commission was dissolved at its last meeting in [[Sopron]] on 2 August 1924.<ref name=ratg />\n\n===Nazi occupation of Austria===\nFrom the time of the Austrian ''[[Anschluss]]'' of 1938 until the end of [[World War II]] in 1945, Rattersdorf, as with the rest of Austria, was incorporated within [[Nazi Germany]].\n\n==Buildings==\nIn Rattersdorf, built on Roman foundations, is a [[Catholicism|Catholic]] church in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style, the oldest church in Burgenland. Erected beside a [[holy well|sacred spring]] in 1207, it was expanded with [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] elements in the 14th and 15th centuries.

Introduced  in 1968 as a new model positioned above the 1968 [[Nissan Bluebird#510 series|Datsun Bluebird 510]], the Laurel offered the luxury of the [[Nissan Cedric#Second generation 130|Nissan Cedric 130]] in a smaller size. The [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] is a noble tree in Greek mythology, and the [[laurel wreath]] a symbol of honorable status. In Japan, the Laurel was not marketed as a Datsun, being always labeled as a Nissan.\n\nThe first Laurel was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] R&D Division and assembled at the [[Musashimurayama]] Plant of the former [[Prince Motor Company]] in 2-door and 4-door variants. Released as a Nissan after Prince merged with Nissan, Laurels shared many components and architectures with the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] range. The Laurel was not marketed new in Japan at ''Nissan Prince Shop'' locations that sold the Skyline and Gloria, former Prince products. Instead the Laurel was sold at ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Motor Shop]]'' as the junior model to the larger V8-powered [[Nissan President]].\n\nSince 1968, eight generations of Laurel have been produced in [[Japan]]. Nissan intermittently listed the Laurel for sale in various [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an markets (it was also sold in [[Chile]] and [[Panama]], as the Datsun Laurel, starting in the late seventies), and then discontinued the [[export]] of this model from 1989.\n\nThe Laurel was cancelled subsequent to Nissan's  [[Renault\u2013Nissan\u2013Mitsubishi Alliance|alliance with Renault]].\n__TOC__\n{{anchor|C30}}\n\n== First generation (C30) (1968\u20131972) ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan Laurel C30.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C30\n| production   = 1968\u20131972\n| body_style   = {{ubl\n  | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9]]\n  | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n  }}\n\n| layout       = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| platform     = \n|caption=Nissan Laurel\n| aka          = {{ubl\n\n  | Datsun Laurel\n\n  | Datsun 200L\n  | Datsun 1800 <ref>[http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html ''1968 Nissan Laurel C30'', www.earlydatsun.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208131718/http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html |date=2015-02-08 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015</ref>\n  }}\n\n| engine       = {{ubl\n\n  | 1.8 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-18|G-18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n\n  | 2.0 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]]'' I4\n  }}\n\n| transmission = {{ubl\n\n  | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n\n  | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n\n| length       = {{convert|4305|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1605|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1405|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1005|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2620|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = {{ubl\n  | [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Nissan Skyline]]\n  }}\n\n}}\n\nIn April 1968 Nissan presented its new Laurel in four-door deLuxe and Super deLuxe versions, both equipped with a 1.8 L [[inline-four engine]] and independent rear suspension. In June 1970 a two-door hardtop coup\u00e9 joined the lineup, as a junior version of the all-new [[Nissan Cedric#Third generation 230|Nissan Cedric/Gloria coupe]], and one year later a 2000&nbsp;cc engine became available in the four-door sedan as well. Its competitors at introduction were the [[Toyota Mark II#T60|Toyota Corona Mark II]] sedan, and the [[Mazda Luce#SU|Mazda Luce]] which was introduced in 1966. The Laurel did not sell as well as expected, largely because the design was too similar to that of the smaller, cheaper [[Datsun 510|Bluebird (510)]].<ref name=shiTak>{{cite journal | journal = Motor Magazine International | date = January 1974 | title = New Model: Nissan Laurel | page = 8 | ref = MMI7 | volume = 2 | number = 1 | location = Tokyo, Japan }}</ref>\n\nThis car was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] vehicle development team, but the C30 Laurel was fitted with the Prince four-cylinder [[Overhead camshaft#Single overhead camshaft|SOHC]] engine, the [[Prince G engine#G-18|G18]]. (On the other hand, the GC10 [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Skyline]] 2000GT was developed by the former Prince [[Ogikubo, Tokyo|Ogikubo]] vehicle development team, but was fitted with Nissan [[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] SOHC engine.)

The four-door sedan was originally only available with the lesser G18. The [[SU Carburettor|SU twin-carburetted]] 2000GX received sporty equipment.\n \nAugust 1970 saw the release of a modified version of the four-door sedan version, now with the same roof angle as that of the hard top.

The saloon now was endowed with a rear beam axle and leaf springs, while the coup\u00e9 clung to independent rear suspension. In addition to the 1.8 and 2.0 L four-cylinder engines, a 2.0 L inline-six was now available, joined, from October, 1973, by a 2.6 L six; the latter was replaced by a 2.8 L six in late 1975. The [[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]] 4-cylinder and L20 [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engines were equipped with [[SU carburetor|SU]] twin carburetors but were eliminated February 1976 due to emission regulations.\n\nThe styling of the coupe appears to be influenced by the 1970 [[Ford Torino#1970\u20131971: New Torino|Ford Torino]] and the 1971 [[Mercury Cougar#Second generation|Mercury Cougar]], reflecting a popular styling trend during the 1960s and 1970s called \"[[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]]\". Sales in Japan (very few were exported) ran to about 96,000 per year, with three-quarters sedans.<ref name=MMI9>[[#MMI7|Motor Magazine International (January 1974)]], pp. 9-10</ref> The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Mark II#Generation 2 (1972\u20131976) X10/X20 series|Mark II]] coup\u00e9 and sedan.\n\n[[File:Datsun 200L sedan (C130) in Norway B+W.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun 200L sedan (Europe)]]\nEngines available at the time were the four-cylinder 1815&nbsp;cc G18 and 1990&nbsp;cc G20, and the six-cylinder 1998&nbsp;cc L20. Both the G20 and L20 were available with twin SU carburettors as an option. However, only the G20 equipped cars outwardly announced this with a \"Twin Carburettor 2000GX\" badge.\n\nIn October 1973 the first Laurel with the 2565&nbsp;cc L26 six-cylinder engine was added and badged as \"2600SGL\". Since the engine was over two litres, it was not restrained by the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|size limits]] imposed by Japanese regulations, and therefore it was fitted with bigger bumpers than regular Laurels. The installation of the 2.6-litre engine in Japanese models helped identify this generation as a luxury car, as the larger engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay higher amounts of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n\nIn September 1975, in order to meet the new emissions regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753&nbsp;cc L28 six-cylinder. By October the carburettors in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770&nbsp;cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup.\n\nIn February 1976 carburetted 1.8-litre and 2.0-litre engines which met the 1976 emissions regulations were introduced, and were identified with the [[Nissan NAPS]] badge.\n\n[[File:1974 Nissan Laurel Hadtop 2000SGX rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel 2000SGX Hardtop (C130) with non-standard wheels]]\n\n==={{anchor|EV|C130-EV}} Laurel C130-EV===\nIn 1974 Nissan developed an electric passenger sedan based on the Nissan Laurel.

November 1982 saw the introduction of the Limited \"Givenchy Version\" with [[Hubert de Givenchy]] doing the TV commercials in Japan, borrowing a marketing concept for an American luxury coupe, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV Designer Editions|Lincoln Continental Mark IV]]. In 1981, the [[Nissan Sunny#B11 (1981\u20131985)|Nissan Laurel Spirit]] was offered as a smaller alternative to the Laurel, while still offering the luxury content of the larger car.\n\n[[File:1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop (C31, Chile)]]\nDevelopment Supervisor, Itirou Makoto Sakurai, was in charge of developing the Laurel together with the Skyline. The Laurel's redesign was carried out in a European style and tone. The coefficient of drag (Cd value) of the four-door hardtop is 0.38. The lowest-priced Z18 is a four-cylinder engine, as is the 2-litre Z20. The L20-series are inline-six cylinder models, also available in fuel injected L20E type, and as the turbocharged L20ET - the first turbocharged Laurel. On top of the lineup was the 2.8-litre L28E, and for some export markets the 2.4-litre L24 engine (usually carburetted) was also offered. Mostly for commercial use there was the four-cylinder LD20 diesel engine, while private users usually preferred the larger six-cylinder LD28 type which was also available with much better equipment.\n\nIn February 1981 the GX trim level was added. L20E sedan with independent rear suspension in the vehicle suspension formula (a six-link independent rear suspension was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981 the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup.\n\nIn September 1982 there was a minor change. Up a sense of luxury and large-scale extrusion in the chrome bumpers and rear license plate holder. The tail lamp design was changed as well. Instead of the Z18 series engine, the new OHC four-cylinder 1809&nbsp;cc CA18S engine was fitted to the Laurel 1.8. The engine range was overhauled at the time and now included the CA18S, L20E, turbocharged L20ET, the four-cylinder SOHC Z20S, and the diesel LD20 and LD28-6 models. The carburetted L20, the L28E, and the column-shifted LD20 (six-seater) were discontinued. The six-cylinder gasoline-powered car with automatic transmission and Super Touring equipment received an overdrive gear at the same time.\n\nIn November 1982 the Givenchy limited version was released. In February 1983 the \"50 Special\" released. In March the Givenchy II version went on sale. In May another 50 Special II vehicles were launched. In July electrically retractable fender and door mirrors were introduced, a first. In October, taxi and driver instruction vehicles with an OHC LPG four-cylinder engine (Z18P, Standard or GL equipment) were added.

It also came with the [[Nissan L engine#LD28|LD28]] diesel. In 1987 there were a minor facelift which basically were bigger bumpers, new grilles, and new lights in the front and back. The [[Nissan L engine#LD28|LD28]] diesel engine were swapped out in favor of the similarly dimensioned [[Nissan RD engine#RD25|RD28]]. This generation became the first Laurel with a [[V6 engine]].\n\nThe C32 was the last model to be sold outside Japan. In Europe the Laurel was replaced by the [[Nissan Maxima]] which was not available as a diesel and had a sportier, more luxurious air. The Laurel was often used as a taxi in Germany.\n \nThe styling of the Nissan Laurel began to resemble the larger [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] but on a slightly smaller platform, with [[Vehicle size class#Japan|reduced tax liability]] based on the vehicles dimensions. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] hardtop and the [[Toyota Mark II|Mark II]] sedan, and in 1986 the [[Honda Vigor]].\n\nIn October 1984 the C32-facelift was released. Osamu Ito, Development Supervisor of the R31/32 Skyline, was assigned to redesign the Laurel. He saw the car needed significant changes, and set about doing so. Some of the Laurel's new features included a 4-door sedan body, variations in the hardtop, an angular design (including a strong push), and the world's first electric retractable door mirrors.\n\nThe RB20E engine was equipped with six-cylinder series SOHC2.0L, VG20ET-SOHC2.0L [[V6]] turbo, CA18S-series four-cylinder (LPG and specifications), LD28-series 6-cylinder diesel SOHC2.8L. The car's system also integrated a C32 steering rack and adopted a rack-and-pinion type.\n \nIn May 1985, the Grand Extra Limited edition was released. Detail improvements were made in October 1985 and January 1986.\n\nIn October 1986 there were mechanical changes along with significant modifications to the exterior. There was a new turbocharged DOHC engine, the 2.0-liter RB20DET 24-valve six-cylinder, while the LD28 diesel engine was replaced by the new RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nIn May 1987 the \"Grande Extra White Special\" edition was release. In August of the same year, the Grande Touring Limited was added to lineup.\n \nIn February 1988 there was an improved and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the \"White Limited\" model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection was added to the lineup. In December private car and driving school versions were discontinued, leaving only taxis and other commercial models. In January 1989 Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a shift lock.\n \nThe taxi/commercial versions of the fifth generation were finally discontinued in July 1993, when they were replaced by the [[Nissan Crew]].\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel C32 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of fifth generation Laurel]]\n[[File:C32 Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist Rear 04711.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist]]{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C33}}\n\n== Sixth generation (C33) (1989\u20131993) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Laurel C33\n| image = LaurelC33.JPG\n| aka = \n| production = [[Japan]]: 1989\u20131993\n| assembly = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| platform = \n| related = [[Nissan Skyline#R32|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Cefiro#A31(1988-1994)|Nissan Cefiro]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S13|Nissan Silvia S13]]\n| layout = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| engine = 1.8 L [[Nissan CA engine|CA18i]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] <br> 2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DET]] [[turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>  2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20E]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]]  [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]] <br> 2.8 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] diesel [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual <br> 4-speed automatic <br> 5-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1365|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1330|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn December 1988, the C33 Laurel was announced. A month later, in January 1989, the C33 went on sale, originally only available as a hardtop four-door. The base engine offering again was a 1.8-litre four, the available options consisted of a 2-litre six (SOHC, DOHC or DOHC Turbo) and a 2.8-litre diesel inline-six. Early in 1991 a DOHC 2.5-litre inline-six coupled to a five-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] became available.\n\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel Medalist in Japan]]\nThe [[Nissan]] Laurel used a [[rear-wheel drive]] layout, making it a popular car to modify for drifting use. The C33 in particular is very popular as a drift car, because it has the same floor plan as the [[Nissan A31 Cefiro]] and the four-door [[Nissan Skyline R32]]. They also have many interchangeable parts which makes them ideal for modification. Suspension parts are identical to the Nissan Silvia S13 model.\n\nThe Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]], and there was also the new [[Honda Inspire]] in the same segment. The Laurel was repositioned slightly higher as a larger luxury sedan, as its exterior dimensions matched with the [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] which were exclusive to separate Japanese Nissan dealerships (''Nissan Bluebird'' for the Cedric, ''Nissan Prince'' for the Gloria). The Laurel still remained the junior sedan to the Nissan flagship [[Nissan President]] which was all new in 1989, and remained exclusive to Japanese dealership ''[[Nissan#Japan|Nissan Motor Store]]'' locations.\n\nTrim levels included the Medalist, Medalist Club S and Gran Limited. The Club S was the only C33 laurel with the RB25DE option and a front lip spoiler, with other models offering only the RB20, CA18 and RD28 engines.\n\nV6 engines were no longer available; instead, the RB20E type (SOHC), RB20DE type (DOHC), RB20DET type (single turbo DOHC) series 6-cylinder 2.0L, CA18i series four-cylinder SOHC1.8L and RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engines were offered. In addition to this, the improved HICAS-II suspension configuration was used. \nFour-cylinder model (CA18i) series and six-cylinder diesel engine (RD28) in the presence and instruction car specifications.\n \nOn January 1991, the Laurel was facelifted and a new RB20E/RB20DE-powered 5-speed AT model crept into the range. Also in November 1991, 3-series cars RB25DE Catalogue DOHC2.5L add a grade-six-cylinder engine. 2.5L existing and additional models equipped with previous generations high mount side lamp, side door airbags. Organizing models in the senior grades.\n\nIn the [[North America]]n market, this was only sold in parts of the [[Caribbean]], primarily the [[Bahamas]] under the '''Nissan Laurel Altima'''.  However, the [[Nissan Altima|Altima]] name was first used in the [[United States]] & [[Canada]] starting in the 1993 model year for its new [[compact car]], which has since become a [[mid-size]] in 2002.\n  \nBy January 1992 cumulative production achieved 2 million units.{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C34}}\n\n== Seventh generation (C34) (1993\u20131997) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan C34 Laurel.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C34\n| production   = 1993-1997\n| body_style   = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = \n| engine       = 2.0 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RFB engine does fat skids g|RB20E]]<br> 2.0 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]]<br> 2.5 L [[Turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DET]]<br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]]<br> 2.8 L Diesel [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual(Diesel)<br>4-speed automatic <br>5-speed automatic\n| length       = {{convert|4710|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1390|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1490|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = [[Nissan Skyline#R33|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Stagea]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S14|Nissan Silvia S14]]\n}}\nThe Laurel C34 was no longer available in hardtop sedan configuration; the single body style offered was the regular saloon with B-posts. Gone as well was the four-cylinder engine. Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six and a 2.8 L diesel six.\n\nSome of the later models featured more sophistication such as Nissan's proprietary 4-wheel steering ([[HICAS]]) and 4-wheel drive ([[Attesa|ATTESA]]) systems, which were based on the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] models. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] and the [[Honda Inspire]]. This was the first series that was no longer regarded as a compact sedan under Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|vehicle classification regulations]] due to the engine displacement exceeding 2000 &nbsp;cc, and vehicle length and width were no longer in compliance.

Introduced  in 1968 as a new model positioned above the 1968 [[Nissan Bluebird#510 series|Datsun Bluebird 510]], the Laurel offered the luxury of the [[Nissan Cedric#Second generation 130|Nissan Cedric 130]] in a smaller size. The [[Laurus nobilis|laurel]] is a noble tree in Greek mythology, and the [[laurel wreath]] a symbol of honorable status. In Japan, the Laurel was not marketed as a Datsun, being always labeled as a Nissan.\n\nThe first Laurel was developed by the Nissan [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]] R&D Division and assembled at the [[Musashimurayama]] Plant of the former [[Prince Motor Company]] in 2-door and 4-door variants. Released as a Nissan after Prince merged with Nissan, Laurels shared many components and architectures with the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] range. The Laurel was not marketed new in Japan at ''Nissan Prince Shop'' locations that sold the Skyline and Gloria, former Prince products. Instead the Laurel was sold at ''[[Nissan Motor Company#Japan|Nissan Motor Shop]]'' as the junior model to the larger V8-powered [[Nissan President]].\n\nSince 1968, eight generations of Laurel have been produced in [[Japan]]. Nissan intermittently listed the Laurel for sale in various [[Asia]]n and [[Europe]]an markets (it was also sold in [[Chile]] and [[Panama]], as the Datsun Laurel, starting in the late seventies), and then discontinued the [[export]] of this model from 1989.\n\nThe Laurel was cancelled subsequent to Nissan's  [[Renault\u2013Nissan\u2013Mitsubishi Alliance|alliance with Renault]].\n__TOC__\n{{anchor|C30}}\n\n== First generation (C30) (1968\u20131972) ==\n\n{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan Laurel C30.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C30\n| production   = 1968\u20131972\n| body_style   = {{ubl\n  | 2-door [[hardtop]] [[coup\u00e9]]\n  | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n  }}\n\n| layout       = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| platform     = \n|caption=Nissan Laurel\n| aka          = {{ubl\n\n  | Datsun Laurel\n\n  | Datsun 200L\n  | Datsun 1800 <ref>[http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html ''1968 Nissan Laurel C30'', www.earlydatsun.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208131718/http://www.earlydatsun.com/nissanc30.html |date=2015-02-08 }} Retrieved on 15 February 2015</ref>\n  }}\n\n| engine       = {{ubl\n\n  | 1.8 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-18|G-18]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]]\n\n  | 2.0 L ''[[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]]'' I4\n  }}\n\n| transmission = {{ubl\n\n  | 4-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]]\n\n  | 3-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]\n  }}\n\n| length       = {{convert|4305|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1605|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1405|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1005|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2620|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = {{ubl\n  | [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Nissan Skyline]]\n  }}\n\n}}\n\nIn April 1968 Nissan presented its new Laurel in four-door deLuxe and Super deLuxe versions, both equipped with a 1.8 L [[inline-four engine]] and independent rear suspension.

(On the other hand, the GC10 [[Nissan Skyline#C10|Skyline]] 2000GT was developed by the former Prince [[Ogikubo, Tokyo|Ogikubo]] vehicle development team, but was fitted with Nissan [[Nissan L engine#L20A|L20]] [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] SOHC engine.) This was of 1,815&nbsp;cc capacity. The suspension is the same four-wheel independent system that was fitted on the C10 Skyline.\n \nThe Laurel Hardtop model was equipped with the SOHC 1,990&nbsp;cc {{convert|110|or|120|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Prince G engine#G-20|G20]]-series four-cylinders. The four-door sedan was originally only available with the lesser G18. The [[SU Carburettor|SU twin-carburetted]] 2000GX received sporty equipment.\n \nAugust 1970 saw the release of a modified version of the four-door sedan version, now with the same roof angle as that of the hard top.

The saloon now was endowed with a rear beam axle and leaf springs, while the coup\u00e9 clung to independent rear suspension. In addition to the 1.8 and 2.0 L four-cylinder engines, a 2.0 L inline-six was now available, joined, from October, 1973, by a 2.6 L six; the latter was replaced by a 2.8 L six in late 1975. The [[Prince G engine#G-20|G-20]] 4-cylinder and L20 [[Straight-six engine|six-cylinder]] engines were equipped with [[SU carburetor|SU]] twin carburetors but were eliminated February 1976 due to emission regulations.\n\nThe styling of the coupe appears to be influenced by the 1970 [[Ford Torino#1970\u20131971: New Torino|Ford Torino]] and the 1971 [[Mercury Cougar#Second generation|Mercury Cougar]], reflecting a popular styling trend during the 1960s and 1970s called \"[[coke bottle styling|coke bottle]]\". Sales in Japan (very few were exported) ran to about 96,000 per year, with three-quarters sedans.<ref name=MMI9>[[#MMI7|Motor Magazine International (January 1974)]], pp. 9-10</ref> The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Mark II#Generation 2 (1972\u20131976) X10/X20 series|Mark II]] coup\u00e9 and sedan.\n\n[[File:Datsun 200L sedan (C130) in Norway B+W.jpg|thumb|left|Datsun 200L sedan (Europe)]]\nEngines available at the time were the four-cylinder 1815&nbsp;cc G18 and 1990&nbsp;cc G20, and the six-cylinder 1998&nbsp;cc L20. Both the G20 and L20 were available with twin SU carburettors as an option. However, only the G20 equipped cars outwardly announced this with a \"Twin Carburettor 2000GX\" badge.\n\nIn October 1973 the first Laurel with the 2565&nbsp;cc L26 six-cylinder engine was added and badged as \"2600SGL\". Since the engine was over two litres, it was not restrained by the [[Vehicle size class#Japan|size limits]] imposed by Japanese regulations, and therefore it was fitted with bigger bumpers than regular Laurels. The installation of the 2.6-litre engine in Japanese models helped identify this generation as a luxury car, as the larger engine obligated Japanese drivers to pay higher amounts of annual [[Road tax#Japan|road tax]].\n\nIn September 1975, in order to meet the new emissions regulations for that year, the L26 was replaced by the larger yet 2753&nbsp;cc L28 six-cylinder. By October the carburettors in the L20 were replaced with electronic fuel injection and the engine was now dubbed L20E. Because of the difficulty in meeting the emissions regulations, the twin-carburetted engines were all discontinued. The 1,770&nbsp;cc L18 replaced the G18 in the lineup.\n\nIn February 1976 carburetted 1.8-litre and 2.0-litre engines which met the 1976 emissions regulations were introduced, and were identified with the [[Nissan NAPS]] badge.\n\n[[File:1974 Nissan Laurel Hadtop 2000SGX rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel 2000SGX Hardtop (C130) with non-standard wheels]]\n\n==={{anchor|EV|C130-EV}} Laurel C130-EV===\nIn 1974 Nissan developed an electric passenger sedan based on the Nissan Laurel.

For the first time, the C230 was available in either saloon and hardtop coup\u00e9 form, but also as a hardtop saloon without B-posts. The hardtop was only available with six-cylinder engines. Buyers could choose between a 1.8-litre four, a 2.0-litre inline-six (carburetted or fuel-injected, a first for the Laurel), a 2.8-litre six, or a 2.0-litre [[Diesel engine|diesel]] four, sourced from [[Nissan Diesel]].

The highest trim level, \"Medalist\", received air conditioning in addition to its OHC four-cylinder two-litre diesel engine. The 1800&nbsp;cc cars switched to the newer Z18 crossflow engine and all Laurels now met the Showa 53 (1979) gasoline vehicle emission regulations.\n \nLater, in October 1979, a two-litre four-cylinder gasoline option (Z20-series) was added in several markets.

Engines for the C31 were 1.8-liter, 2.0-liter L20, 2.4-liter L24 gasoline, and 2.8-liter diesel. The coup\u00e9 was replaced by the new [[Nissan Leopard#First generation: F30 (1980-1986)|Nissan Leopard F30]]. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] hardtop and the [[Toyota Mark II|Mark II]] sedan. November 1982 saw the introduction of the Limited \"Givenchy Version\" with [[Hubert de Givenchy]] doing the TV commercials in Japan, borrowing a marketing concept for an American luxury coupe, the [[Lincoln Continental Mark IV#Continental Mark IV Designer Editions|Lincoln Continental Mark IV]]. In 1981, the [[Nissan Sunny#B11 (1981\u20131985)|Nissan Laurel Spirit]] was offered as a smaller alternative to the Laurel, while still offering the luxury content of the larger car.\n\n[[File:1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Datsun Laurel 2.4 Hardtop (C31, Chile)]]\nDevelopment Supervisor, Itirou Makoto Sakurai, was in charge of developing the Laurel together with the Skyline. The Laurel's redesign was carried out in a European style and tone. The coefficient of drag (Cd value) of the four-door hardtop is 0.38. The lowest-priced Z18 is a four-cylinder engine, as is the 2-litre Z20. The L20-series are inline-six cylinder models, also available in fuel injected L20E type, and as the turbocharged L20ET - the first turbocharged Laurel. On top of the lineup was the 2.8-litre L28E, and for some export markets the 2.4-litre L24 engine (usually carburetted) was also offered. Mostly for commercial use there was the four-cylinder LD20 diesel engine, while private users usually preferred the larger six-cylinder LD28 type which was also available with much better equipment.\n\nIn February 1981 the GX trim level was added. L20E sedan with independent rear suspension in the vehicle suspension formula (a six-link independent rear suspension was equipped as standard on the turbocharged cars). In November 1981 the car received some improvement and the Turbo Medalist model was new to the lineup.\n\nIn September 1982 there was a minor change. Up a sense of luxury and large-scale extrusion in the chrome bumpers and rear license plate holder. The tail lamp design was changed as well. Instead of the Z18 series engine, the new OHC four-cylinder 1809&nbsp;cc CA18S engine was fitted to the Laurel 1.8. The engine range was overhauled at the time and now included the CA18S, L20E, turbocharged L20ET, the four-cylinder SOHC Z20S, and the diesel LD20 and LD28-6 models. The carburetted L20, the L28E, and the column-shifted LD20 (six-seater) were discontinued. The six-cylinder gasoline-powered car with automatic transmission and Super Touring equipment received an overdrive gear at the same time.\n\nIn November 1982 the Givenchy limited version was released. In February 1983 the \"50 Special\" released. In March the Givenchy II version went on sale. In May another 50 Special II vehicles were launched. In July electrically retractable fender and door mirrors were introduced, a first. In October, taxi and driver instruction vehicles with an OHC LPG four-cylinder engine (Z18P, Standard or GL equipment) were added. SGL Grand Touring car (with a hubcap for Medalist colored bumper and large) and 50 Special Release III.\n\nJanuary 1984 saw the abolition of the 1.8-litre GL models, while the Givenchy III limited edition also went on sale.\n\n[[File:1982 Datsun Laurel 2400 (1).jpg|thumb|left|1982 Datsun Laurel 2.4 SGL Sedan (C31, The Netherlands)]]\nEuropean export models received the carburetted 2.0 (DX or SGL trim) and 2.4 inline-sixes (SGL), with {{convert|71|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|88|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}} respectively, or with the large 2.8 diesel with {{convert|60|kW|PS|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{citation | type = brochure | title = Nissan Gamma |trans-title=Nissan range | language = nl-be | publisher = N.V.

Some of the Laurel's new features included a 4-door sedan body, variations in the hardtop, an angular design (including a strong push), and the world's first electric retractable door mirrors.\n\nThe RB20E engine was equipped with six-cylinder series SOHC2.0L, VG20ET-SOHC2.0L [[V6]] turbo, CA18S-series four-cylinder (LPG and specifications), LD28-series 6-cylinder diesel SOHC2.8L. The car's system also integrated a C32 steering rack and adopted a rack-and-pinion type.\n \nIn May 1985, the Grand Extra Limited edition was released. Detail improvements were made in October 1985 and January 1986.\n\nIn October 1986 there were mechanical changes along with significant modifications to the exterior. There was a new turbocharged DOHC engine, the 2.0-liter RB20DET 24-valve six-cylinder, while the LD28 diesel engine was replaced by the new RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engine.\n\nIn May 1987 the \"Grande Extra White Special\" edition was release. In August of the same year, the Grande Touring Limited was added to lineup.\n \nIn February 1988 there was an improved and some 20 releases Super medalist anniversary special edition. In May 1988, the \"White Limited\" model was released. In September of the same year, the Super Series Selection was added to the lineup. In December private car and driving school versions were discontinued, leaving only taxis and other commercial models. In January 1989 Laurels with an automatic gearbox received a shift lock.\n \nThe taxi/commercial versions of the fifth generation were finally discontinued in July 1993, when they were replaced by the [[Nissan Crew]].\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel C32 rear.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view of fifth generation Laurel]]\n[[File:C32 Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist Rear 04711.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel HardTop Medalist]]{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C33}}\n\n== Sixth generation (C33) (1989\u20131993) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Nissan Laurel C33\n| image = LaurelC33.JPG\n| aka = \n| production = [[Japan]]: 1989\u20131993\n| assembly = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| platform = \n| related = [[Nissan Skyline#R32|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Cefiro#A31(1988-1994)|Nissan Cefiro]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S13|Nissan Silvia S13]]\n| layout = [[FR layout|front engine/rear drive]]\n| engine = 1.8 L [[Nissan CA engine|CA18i]] [[Inline-four engine|I4]] <br> 2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DET]] [[turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>  2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br>2.0 L [[Nissan RB engine|RB20E]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] <br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]]  [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]] <br> 2.8 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] diesel [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual <br> 4-speed automatic <br> 5-speed automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2670|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1365|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1330|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIn December 1988, the C33 Laurel was announced. A month later, in January 1989, the C33 went on sale, originally only available as a hardtop four-door. The base engine offering again was a 1.8-litre four, the available options consisted of a 2-litre six (SOHC, DOHC or DOHC Turbo) and a 2.8-litre diesel inline-six. Early in 1991 a DOHC 2.5-litre inline-six coupled to a five-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] became available.\n\n[[File:NISSAN Laurel rear.jpg|thumb|left|Nissan Laurel Medalist in Japan]]\nThe [[Nissan]] Laurel used a [[rear-wheel drive]] layout, making it a popular car to modify for drifting use. The C33 in particular is very popular as a drift car, because it has the same floor plan as the [[Nissan A31 Cefiro]] and the four-door [[Nissan Skyline R32]]. They also have many interchangeable parts which makes them ideal for modification. Suspension parts are identical to the Nissan Silvia S13 model.\n\nThe Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]], and there was also the new [[Honda Inspire]] in the same segment. The Laurel was repositioned slightly higher as a larger luxury sedan, as its exterior dimensions matched with the [[Nissan Cedric]] and [[Nissan Gloria]] which were exclusive to separate Japanese Nissan dealerships (''Nissan Bluebird'' for the Cedric, ''Nissan Prince'' for the Gloria). The Laurel still remained the junior sedan to the Nissan flagship [[Nissan President]] which was all new in 1989, and remained exclusive to Japanese dealership ''[[Nissan#Japan|Nissan Motor Store]]'' locations.\n\nTrim levels included the Medalist, Medalist Club S and Gran Limited. The Club S was the only C33 laurel with the RB25DE option and a front lip spoiler, with other models offering only the RB20, CA18 and RD28 engines.\n\nV6 engines were no longer available; instead, the RB20E type (SOHC), RB20DE type (DOHC), RB20DET type (single turbo DOHC) series 6-cylinder 2.0L, CA18i series four-cylinder SOHC1.8L and RD28-series six-cylinder diesel engines were offered. In addition to this, the improved HICAS-II suspension configuration was used. \nFour-cylinder model (CA18i) series and six-cylinder diesel engine (RD28) in the presence and instruction car specifications.\n \nOn January 1991, the Laurel was facelifted and a new RB20E/RB20DE-powered 5-speed AT model crept into the range. Also in November 1991, 3-series cars RB25DE Catalogue DOHC2.5L add a grade-six-cylinder engine. 2.5L existing and additional models equipped with previous generations high mount side lamp, side door airbags. Organizing models in the senior grades.\n\nIn the [[North America]]n market, this was only sold in parts of the [[Caribbean]], primarily the [[Bahamas]] under the '''Nissan Laurel Altima'''.  However, the [[Nissan Altima|Altima]] name was first used in the [[United States]] & [[Canada]] starting in the 1993 model year for its new [[compact car]], which has since become a [[mid-size]] in 2002.\n  \nBy January 1992 cumulative production achieved 2 million units.{{Clear}}\n{{anchor|C34}}\n\n== Seventh generation (C34) (1993\u20131997) ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}{{Infobox automobile\n| image        = Nissan C34 Laurel.jpg\n| name         = Nissan Laurel C34\n| production   = 1993-1997\n| body_style   = 4-door [[hardtop]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]], [[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| platform     = \n| engine       = 2.0 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB20E]]<br> 2.0 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB20DE]]<br> 2.5 L [[Turbo]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DET]]<br> 2.5 L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RB engine|RB25DE]]<br> 2.8 L Diesel [[Straight-six engine|I6]] [[Nissan RD engine|RD28]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual(Diesel)<br>4-speed automatic <br>5-speed automatic\n| length       = {{convert|4710|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1390|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|1490|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| assembly     = [[Musashimurayama]], [[Japan]]\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2720|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| related      = [[Nissan Skyline#R33|Nissan Skyline]]<br>[[Nissan Stagea]]<br>[[Nissan Silvia#S14|Nissan Silvia S14]]\n}}\nThe Laurel C34 was no longer available in hardtop sedan configuration; the single body style offered was the regular saloon with B-posts. Gone as well was the four-cylinder engine. Available engines included a 2.0 L six (SOHC or DOHC), a 2.5 L DOHC six and a 2.8 L diesel six.\n\nSome of the later models featured more sophistication such as Nissan's proprietary 4-wheel steering ([[HICAS]]) and 4-wheel drive ([[Attesa|ATTESA]]) systems, which were based on the [[Nissan Skyline|Skyline]] models. The Toyota competitor was the [[Toyota Cresta|Cresta]] and the [[Honda Inspire]]. This was the first series that was no longer regarded as a compact sedan under Japanese [[Vehicle size class#Japan|vehicle classification regulations]] due to the engine displacement exceeding 2000 &nbsp;cc, and vehicle length and width were no longer in compliance. Japanese owners were now liable for additional taxes paid yearly in addition to standard registration, road tax, and inspection costs.\n\nJanuary 1993 the C34-facelift released.
