It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death.<ref name=French2005rev /> Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\nSubjects' accounts often differed from their own \"religious and personal expectations regarding death\" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\nAlthough the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel.  Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\nAnother flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\n==== Dissociation model ====\nThe dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.<ref name=French2005rev />\n\n==== Birth model ====\nThe birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.<ref name=French2005rev />\n\nReports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess \"the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience\".<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\n=== Physiological explanations ({{definition span|organic theories|date=November 2019}}) ===\nA wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon [[cerebral hypoxia]], anoxia, and [[hypercapnia]]; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref name=French2005rev />\n\nNeurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry.<ref>Mayank and Mukesh, 2004; Jansen, 1995; Thomas, 2004; Fenwick and Fenwick 2008</ref> Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the [[Great Britain|British]] [[psychologist]] [[Susan Blackmore]] (1993), with her \"dying brain hypothesis\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bassham |first1=Gregory|title=Critical Thinking: A Student's Untroduction|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-287959-9 |page=485 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n====  Neuroanatomical models ====\nNeuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009),<ref>Leaving Body And Life Behind:[http://lnco.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lnco/files/shared/publications/lnco/2009_Dieguez_NC(chap)_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind-out%20of%20body%20and%20near%20death%20experience.pdf lnco.epfl.ch]</ref> from the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne]]'', [[Switzerland]], propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : \n* \"type 1 NDEs are due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly right hemispheric brain damage affecting the right temporal parietal junction and characterized by out of body experiences, altered sense of time, sensations of flying, lightness vection and flying\"<ref name=\"blanke2009\" />\n* \"type 2 NDEs are also due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly left hemispheric brain damage affecting the left temporal parietal junction and characterized by feeling of a presence, meeting and communication with spirits, seeing of glowing bodies, as well as voices, sounds, and music without vection\"<ref name=\"blanke2009\" />\nThey suggest that damage to the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and \"damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the [[hippocampus]] and amygdala\" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review.

(1978\u20131979) ''The subjective response to life-threatening danger''. ''Omega'' 9: 313\u2013321.</ref> According to this model, those who face their impending death become detached from the surroundings and their own bodies, no longer feel emotions, and experience time distortions.<ref name=Greyson2014/>\n\nThis model suffers from a number of limitations to explain NDEs for subjects who do not experience a sensation of being out of their bodies; unlike NDEs, experiences are dreamlike, unpleasant and characterized by \"anxiety, panic and emptiness\".<ref name=Greyson2014/> Also, during NDEs subjects remain very lucid of their identities, their sense of identity is not changed unlike those experiencing depersonalization.<ref name=Greyson2014/>\n\n==== Expectancy model ====\nAnother psychological theory is called the expectancy model. It has been suggested that although these experiences could appear very real, they had actually been constructed in the mind, either consciously or subconsciously, in response to the stress of an encounter with death (or perceived encounter with death), and did not correspond to a real event. In a way, they are similar to wish-fulfillment: because someone thought they were about to die, they experienced certain things in accordance with what they expected or wanted to occur. Imagining a heavenly place was in effect a way for them to soothe themselves through the stress of knowing that they were close to death.<ref name=French2005rev /> Subjects use their own personal and cultural expectations to imagine a scenario that would protect them against an imminent threat to their lives.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\nSubjects' accounts often differed from their own \"religious and personal expectations regarding death\" which contradicts the hypothesis they may have imagined a scenario based on their cultural and personal background.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\nAlthough the term NDE was first coined in 1975 and the experience first described then, recent descriptions of NDEs do not differ from those reported earlier than 1975. The only exception is the more frequent description of a tunnel.  Hence, the fact that information about these experiences could be more easily obtained after 1975, did not influence people's reports of the experiences.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\nAnother flaw of this model can be found in children's accounts of NDEs. These are similar to adults', and this despite children being less affected by religious or cultural influences about death.<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\n==== Dissociation model ====\nThe dissociation model proposes that NDE is a form of withdrawal to protect an individual from a stressful event. Under extreme circumstances some people may detach from certain unwanted feelings in order to avoid experiencing their emotional impact and suffering associated with them. The person also detaches from one's immediate surroundings.<ref name=French2005rev />\n\n==== Birth model ====\nThe birth model suggests that near death experiences could be a form of reliving the trauma of birth. Since a baby travels from the darkness of the womb to light and is greeted by the love and warmth of the nursing and medical staff, and so, it was proposed, the dying brain could be recreating the passage through a tunnel to light, warmth and affection.<ref name=French2005rev />\n\nReports of leaving the body through a tunnel are equally frequent among subjects who were born by cesarean section and natural birth. Also, newborns do not possess \"the visual acuity, spatial stability of their visual images, mental alertness, and cortical coding capacity to register memories of the birth experience\".<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" />\n\n=== Physiological explanations ({{definition span|organic theories|date=November 2019}}) ===\nA wide range of physiological theories of the NDE have been put forward including those based upon [[cerebral hypoxia]], anoxia, and [[hypercapnia]]; endorphins and other neurotransmitters; and abnormal activity in the [[temporal lobe]]s.<ref name=French2005rev />\n\nNeurobiological factors in the experience have been investigated by researchers in the field of medical science and psychiatry.<ref>Mayank and Mukesh, 2004; Jansen, 1995; Thomas, 2004; Fenwick and Fenwick 2008</ref> Among the researchers and commentators who tend to emphasize a naturalistic and neurological base for the experience are the [[Great Britain|British]] [[psychologist]] [[Susan Blackmore]] (1993), with her \"dying brain hypothesis\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bassham |first1=Gregory|title=Critical Thinking: A Student's Untroduction|date=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-07-287959-9 |page=485 |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n====  Neuroanatomical models ====\nNeuroscientists Olaf Blanke and Sebastian Dieguez (2009),<ref>Leaving Body And Life Behind:[http://lnco.epfl.ch/files/content/sites/lnco/files/shared/publications/lnco/2009_Dieguez_NC(chap)_leaving%20body%20and%20life%20behind-out%20of%20body%20and%20near%20death%20experience.pdf lnco.epfl.ch]</ref> from the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne]]'', [[Switzerland]], propose a brain based model with two types of NDEs : \n* \"type 1 NDEs are due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly right hemispheric brain damage affecting the right temporal parietal junction and characterized by out of body experiences, altered sense of time, sensations of flying, lightness vection and flying\"<ref name=\"blanke2009\" />\n* \"type 2 NDEs are also due to bilateral frontal and occipital, but predominantly left hemispheric brain damage affecting the left temporal parietal junction and characterized by feeling of a presence, meeting and communication with spirits, seeing of glowing bodies, as well as voices, sounds, and music without vection\"<ref name=\"blanke2009\" />\nThey suggest that damage to the bilateral [[Occipital lobe|occipital cortex]] may lead to visual features of NDEs such as seeing a tunnel or lights, and \"damage to unilateral or bilateral temporal lobe structures such as the [[hippocampus]] and amygdala\" may lead to emotional experiences, memory flashbacks or a life review. They concluded that future neuroscientific studies are likely to reveal the neuroanatomical basis of the NDE which will lead to the demystification of the subject without needing paranormal explanations.<ref name=\"blanke2009\" />\n\n[[File:Temporal lobe animation.gif|thumb|160px|left|Animation of the human left temporal lobe]]\n\nFrench has written that the \"temporal lobe is almost certain to be involved in NDEs, given that both damage to and direct cortical stimulation of this area are known to produce a number of experiences corresponding to those of the NDE, including OBEs, hallucinations, and memory flashbacks\".<ref name=French2005rev />\n\nVanhaudenhuyse ''et al''. 2009 reported that recent studies employing [[deep brain stimulation]] and [[neuroimaging]] have demonstrated that out-of-body experiences result from a deficient [[multisensory integration]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]] and that ongoing studies aim to further identify the functional neuroanatomy of near-death experiences by means of standardized EEG recordings.<ref>{{cite book|title=Intensive Care Medicine |date=2009|publisher=Springer New York | isbn=978-0-387-92277-5 |location=[S.l.] |pages=961\u2013968 |last1=Vincent |first1=Jean-Louis|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-92276-6_85|chapter=Towards a Neuro-scientific Explanation of Near-death Experiences?|citeseerx=10.1.1.368.4580}}</ref>\n \nAccording to Greyson<ref name=\"Greyson2014\" /> multiple neuroanatomical models have been proposed where NDEs have been hypothesized to originate from different anatomical areas of the brain, namely: the limbic system, the hippocampus, the left temporal lobe, Reissen's fiber in the central canal of the spinal cord, the prefrontal cortex, the right temporal lobe.\n\nBlanke et al.<ref name=\"blanke2009\" /> admit that their model remains speculative to the lack of data.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

When he was a student in the Institute of Fine Arts, the then principal of the institute Zainul Abedin bought Khan\u2019s paintings. An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]]. Khan organized his first solo sculpture exhibition at the gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in 1982, with works primarily based on the liberation war theme. The exhibition drew a large number of viewers and received appreciation from critics and connoisseurs.<ref name=NZ>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanata |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=96-105 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> He participated in 6th Triennial Art Exhibition in [[New Delhi]], organized by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] in 1986, as an official entrant from Bangladesh. He organized a solo sculpture exhibition at the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Dhaka]] in 1987.\n\nKhan received his first major international recognition when he was invited by the Olympic Committee in Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1988 to install an open-air sculpture at the [[Seoul Olympic Park]]. The sculpture was titled ''Steps'', made of welded copper with a height of 13 feet.<ref name=way>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6KG_The_Steps_5066851221_Olympic_Park__Seoul_Korea \"The Steps (\uc5ec\uc815) - Olympic Park  -  Seoul, Korea - Abstract Public Sculptures on Waymarking.com\"].</ref> It symbolized steps to freedom and progress. In 1990, he received a commission from [[Jahangirnagar University]] to install a sculpture in front of the Central Library of the university. The title of the sculpture was ''Shangshaptak''. Made of steel armature and brass steel, it depicted a freedom fighter, having an amputated leg and an amputated hand, charging ahead fearlessly. This remains one of Khan\u2019s best-known works. The figure has later been recast in modified form and in different media to be placed at different locations in Bangladesh. The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka. He was invited at the Puyo International Modern Sculpture Symposium in Korea in 1999. For this symposium, he created a 10-feet high sculpture in steel sheet which was exhibited at the Puyo Bodrek Park. He created a sculpture, titled ''Muktijoddha'' for the [[Mymensingh Cantonment]] in 1999. \n         \n===From 2000 to present===\nKhan became a Professor at the Department of Sculpture, [[University of Dhaka]] in 2000.

The work consists of three similar forms, depicting birds in abstraction. In addition to that, the World Bank office installed his relief work at the entrance, decorated the interior with 18 of his oil-paintings, terracotta, a metal-sculpture highlighting fish and a mural.  \n \n[[Dhaka City Corporation]] commissioned Khan in 2005 to create a sculpture to be placed at [[Farmgate]] intersection in Dhaka.

Khan\u2019s two sculptures in metal adorn the lawns of [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre]]. One is a nearly man height abstract arch in deep blue and the other is a hardedge semi-abstract seated bird in red. His sculpture, titled ''Shikha'', a geometric abstract in painted sheet metal was placed at the entrance of the [[National University, Bangladesh]]. It has a height of 32 feet and a width of 13 feet and symbolizes enlightenment through education. \n\nHe created a sculpture on the theme of birds at the request of students of the [[University of Dhaka]].

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

When he was a student in the Institute of Fine Arts, the then principal of the institute Zainul Abedin bought Khan\u2019s paintings. An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969.

Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]]. Khan organized his first solo sculpture exhibition at the gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in 1982, with works primarily based on the liberation war theme. The exhibition drew a large number of viewers and received appreciation from critics and connoisseurs.<ref name=NZ>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanata |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=96-105 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> He participated in 6th Triennial Art Exhibition in [[New Delhi]], organized by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] in 1986, as an official entrant from Bangladesh. He organized a solo sculpture exhibition at the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Dhaka]] in 1987.\n\nKhan received his first major international recognition when he was invited by the Olympic Committee in Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1988 to install an open-air sculpture at the [[Seoul Olympic Park]]. The sculpture was titled ''Steps'', made of welded copper with a height of 13 feet.<ref name=way>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6KG_The_Steps_5066851221_Olympic_Park__Seoul_Korea \"The Steps (\uc5ec\uc815) - Olympic Park  -  Seoul, Korea - Abstract Public Sculptures on Waymarking.com\"].</ref> It symbolized steps to freedom and progress. In 1990, he received a commission from [[Jahangirnagar University]] to install a sculpture in front of the Central Library of the university. The title of the sculpture was ''Shangshaptak''. Made of steel armature and brass steel, it depicted a freedom fighter, having an amputated leg and an amputated hand, charging ahead fearlessly. This remains one of Khan\u2019s best-known works. The figure has later been recast in modified form and in different media to be placed at different locations in Bangladesh. The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka. He was invited at the Puyo International Modern Sculpture Symposium in Korea in 1999. For this symposium, he created a 10-feet high sculpture in steel sheet which was exhibited at the Puyo Bodrek Park. He created a sculpture, titled ''Muktijoddha'' for the [[Mymensingh Cantonment]] in 1999. \n         \n===From 2000 to present===\nKhan became a Professor at the Department of Sculpture, [[University of Dhaka]] in 2000. In 2001, he created a sculpture, composed of a group of freedom fighters, titled ''Bijoy Keton'' which was installed in the [[Dhaka Cantonment]].  In 2004, he created a sculpture titled ''Birds'', which was a delineation of birds in abstract forms, and was placed at the entrance of United Bhaban in [[Gulshan]], Dhaka. In the same year, the World Bank Bangladesh Country Office installed Khan\u2019s sculpture in the atrium of its office in Dhaka. The work consists of three similar forms, depicting birds in abstraction. In addition to that, the World Bank office installed his relief work at the entrance, decorated the interior with 18 of his oil-paintings, terracotta, a metal-sculpture highlighting fish and a mural.  \n \n[[Dhaka City Corporation]] commissioned Khan in 2005 to create a sculpture to be placed at [[Farmgate]] intersection in Dhaka. The piece was titled ''Fish'', which depicts three fishes in spontaneous posture. The work remains as a popular artwork in public space in the busy neighborhood of Dhaka. Khan\u2019s two sculptures in metal adorn the lawns of [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre]]. One is a nearly man height abstract arch in deep blue and the other is a hardedge semi-abstract seated bird in red. His sculpture, titled ''Shikha'', a geometric abstract in painted sheet metal was placed at the entrance of the [[National University, Bangladesh]]. It has a height of 32 feet and a width of 13 feet and symbolizes enlightenment through education. \n\nHe created a sculpture on the theme of birds at the request of students of the [[University of Dhaka]]. It has been installed in front of the [[Teacher-Student Centre, University of Dhaka|Teacher-Student Centre]] in 2007, and depicts a group of birds in different postures in abstract form. In 2011, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Bank]] to install a sculpture at the bank premises in [[Motijheel]]. The work was titled ''Unity'', featuring two hands in abstract form holding together a globe. \n\nKhan retired from the University of Dhaka in 2012. He continues to teach sculpture at several universities in Dhaka.<ref name=DailySun/>  \n\n==Style==\nKhan\u2019s sculptural practice has engaged with ideas concerning Bangladesh War of Liberation, birds, human face, human figure and natural objects, binding together personal experiences and historical references. His composition is characterized by architectural and geometric shapes. His watercolor and acrylic paintings predominantly delineate landscape and natural elements, in particular wetlands, birds, rural panorama, greenery, cloudy sky, deep forest and hills.<ref name=Observer1>{{Cite news |date=2018-12-24 |title= Hamiduzzaman Khan\u2019s mastery over pure-abstraction |url=https://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=174659 |work=The Daily Observer |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Many of his paintings bear sculptural attributes.<ref name=NewAge1/> The war remembrance theme continued in Khan through 1985 till 1988, in different styles.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

When he was a student in the Institute of Fine Arts, the then principal of the institute Zainul Abedin bought Khan\u2019s paintings. An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969. All the paintings from the exhibition were sold to Chittagong Club and, the earning helped him for his treatment abroad.<ref name=DailySun>{{Cite news |date=2017-03-10 |title=In Conversation With Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://www.daily-sun.com/magazine/details/211036/In-Conversation-With-Hamiduzzaman-Khan/2017-03-10 |work=The Daily Sun |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1982, the [[World Bank]] bought three of his paintings for interior decoration of the World Bank Headquarters in Washington D.C.<ref name=NewAge1/>  \n\n===Beginnings as a sculptor=== \nKhan joined the Department of Sculpture, University of Dhaka as a lecturer in August, 1970. Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]]. Khan organized his first solo sculpture exhibition at the gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in 1982, with works primarily based on the liberation war theme. The exhibition drew a large number of viewers and received appreciation from critics and connoisseurs.<ref name=NZ>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanta |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=96-105 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> He participated in 6th Triennial Art Exhibition in [[New Delhi]], organized by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] in 1986, as an official entrant from Bangladesh. He organized a solo sculpture exhibition at the [[Alliance Fran\u00e7aise de Dhaka]] in 1987.\n\nKhan received his first major international recognition when he was invited by the Olympic Committee in Seoul, Republic of Korea in 1988 to install an open-air sculpture at the [[Seoul Olympic Park]]. The sculpture was titled ''Steps'', made of welded copper with a height of 13 feet.<ref name=way>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6KG_The_Steps_5066851221_Olympic_Park__Seoul_Korea \"The Steps (\uc5ec\uc815) - Olympic Park  -  Seoul, Korea - Abstract Public Sculptures on Waymarking.com\"].</ref> It symbolized steps to freedom and progress. In 1990, he received a commission from [[Jahangirnagar University]] to install a sculpture in front of the Central Library of the university. The title of the sculpture was ''Shangshaptak''. Made of steel armature and brass steel, it depicted a freedom fighter, having an amputated leg and an amputated hand, charging ahead fearlessly. This remains one of Khan\u2019s best-known works. The figure has later been recast in modified form and in different media to be placed at different locations in Bangladesh. The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka. He was invited at the Puyo International Modern Sculpture Symposium in Korea in 1999. For this symposium, he created a 10-feet high sculpture in steel sheet which was exhibited at the Puyo Bodrek Park. He created a sculpture, titled ''Muktijoddha'' for the [[Mymensingh Cantonment]] in 1999.\n\n===From 2000 to present===\nKhan became a Professor at the Department of Sculpture, [[University of Dhaka]] in 2000. In 2001, he created a sculpture, composed of a group of freedom fighters, titled ''Bijoy Keton'' which was installed in the [[Dhaka Cantonment]].  In 2004, he created a sculpture titled ''Birds'', which was a delineation of birds in abstract forms, and was placed at the entrance of United Bhaban in [[Gulshan]], Dhaka. In the same year, the World Bank Bangladesh Country Office installed Khan\u2019s sculpture in the atrium of its office in Dhaka. The work consists of three similar forms, depicting birds in abstraction. In addition to that, the World Bank office installed his relief work at the entrance, decorated the interior with 18 of his oil-paintings, terracotta, a metal-sculpture highlighting fish and a mural.  \n \n[[Dhaka City Corporation]] commissioned Khan in 2005 to create a sculpture to be placed at [[Farmgate]] intersection in Dhaka. The piece was titled ''Fish'', which depicts three fishes in spontaneous posture. The work remains as a popular artwork in public space in the busy neighborhood of Dhaka. Khan\u2019s two sculptures in metal adorn the lawns of [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre]]. One is a nearly man height abstract arch in deep blue and the other is a hardedge semi-abstract seated bird in red. His sculpture, titled ''Shikha'', a geometric abstract in painted sheet metal was placed at the entrance of the [[National University, Bangladesh]]. It has a height of 32 feet and a width of 13 feet and symbolizes enlightenment through education. \n\nHe created a sculpture on the theme of birds at the request of students of the [[University of Dhaka]]. It has been installed in front of the [[Teacher-Student Centre, University of Dhaka|Teacher-Student Centre]] in 2007, and depicts a group of birds in different postures in abstract form. In 2011, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Bank]] to install a sculpture at the bank premises in [[Motijheel]]. The work was titled ''Unity'', featuring two hands in abstract form holding together a globe. \n\nKhan retired from the University of Dhaka in 2012. He continues to teach sculpture at several universities in Dhaka.<ref name=DailySun/>  \n\n==Style==\nKhan\u2019s sculptural practice has engaged with ideas concerning Bangladesh War of Liberation, birds, human face, human figure and natural objects, binding together personal experiences and historical references. His composition is characterized by architectural and geometric shapes. His watercolor and acrylic paintings predominantly delineate landscape and natural elements, in particular wetlands, birds, rural panorama, greenery, cloudy sky, deep forest and hills.<ref name=Observer1>{{Cite news |date=2018-12-24 |title= Hamiduzzaman Khan\u2019s mastery over pure-abstraction |url=https://www.observerbd.com/details.php?id=174659 |work=The Daily Observer |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> Many of his paintings bear sculptural attributes.<ref name=NewAge1/> The war remembrance theme continued in Khan through 1985 till 1988, in different styles.

Khan used to visit his house as a young boy. His early education was in his native village schools and he completed [[matriculation]] in 1962. He then got admitted in the erstwhile East Pakistan College of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka]]). At the College of Arts and Crafts, he studied under the guidance of artists [[Zainul Abedin]], [[Safiuddin Ahmed]], [[Aminul Islam (artist)|Aminul Islam]], [[Mustafa Manwar]]. Zainul Abedin appreciated and encouraged Khan for his watercolor paintings. While he was a third-year student, Abedin presented one of Khan\u2019s paintings to the President of Burma, [[Ne Win]], during his visit to the art college.<ref name=DailySun/> He received [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] degree in 1967 from the Department of Painting and Drawing. Khan was one of the few early students of the college who took interest in sculpture, but there was no opportunity of taking sculpture as a formal subject as an undergraduate in the college. Meanwhile, the college had established the Department of Sculpture and Modeling with [[Abdur Razzaque]] as its founding head.\n\n===Accident and visit to Europe===\nWhen Khan was a student in the final year class, he experienced a road accident that fractured his skull, causing him to have a [[reconstructive surgery]] in the head. However, he could sit for the final examination in time. As there was no facility for the surgery in [[Dhaka]], he was advised to receive treatment from the [[Western General Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]]. After graduation, he set out for Scotland by ship. This was a turning point in Khan\u2019s career. On the way, Khan was impressed by seeing traditional African carvings and masks in [[Dakar]], and [[rocky shores]] in [[Cape Town]] at stopovers. Following the surgery, at the advice of the doctors, he stayed around in the United Kingdom for some time for total healing of the surgery. During this stay in Edinburgh, he visited the [[National Museum of Scotland]] and was impressed by [[Henry Moore| Henry Moore\u2019s]] sculptures in public places. Then he visited London, experienced artworks at the [[British Museum]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery]], [[Tate Galleries]] and was fascinated by landscape paintings by [[John Constable]].<ref name=MasterStroke>{{Cite news |date=2008-03-19 |title=Master Stroke |url=https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-28335 |work=The Daily Star|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Khan was particularly fascinated by modern abstract forms in sculpture, large scale application of sculpture in enhancing the aesthetic quality of urban landscape and its impact in civic life. In Italy, he experienced artworks at the [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], [[Piet\u00e0]] by [[Michelangelo]]. In Paris, he visited the [[Louvre]] and saw works by artists [[Henri Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sculptures installed in public spaces in [[Montmartre]], [[Montparnasse]] and a solo exhibition of [[Alberto Giacometti]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/><ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> On his return to Dhaka in 1969, Khan decided to specialize in sculpture and requested Abdur Razzaque to teach him sculpture.

An exhibition with his watercolor paintings, done in the period from 1963 to 1969, was held in [[Chittagong Club]] in 1969. All the paintings from the exhibition were sold to Chittagong Club and, the earning helped him for his treatment abroad.<ref name=DailySun>{{Cite news |date=2017-03-10 |title=In Conversation With Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://www.daily-sun.com/magazine/details/211036/In-Conversation-With-Hamiduzzaman-Khan/2017-03-10 |work=The Daily Sun |access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> In 1982, the [[World Bank]] bought three of his paintings for interior decoration of the World Bank Headquarters in Washington D.C.<ref name=NewAge1/>  \n\n===Beginnings as a sculptor=== \nKhan joined the Department of Sculpture, University of Dhaka as a lecturer in August, 1970. Soon began the War of Liberation of the country in March 1971. He had to face interrogation by the Pakistan Armed Forces but was left unharmed. Two days after the army crackdown in Dhaka on 25th March, he went to the New Market area and saw many dead bodies lying unattended. The ghastly scenes and atrocities during the war made permanent impressions in his mind, resulting in his series of works on the theme titled ''Remembrance \u201871''. The victims and the martyrs of the war remained a recurring theme in his imagery in the first two decades following the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. He worked with his teacher Abdur Razzaque, in the first-ever commissioned sculptural work on the liberation war theme 1972. The piece, titled ''Jagroto Chowrongi (The Vigilant Crossroads)'' is the figure of a lone freedom fighter, has become a symbol of the heroic War of Liberation in the country.<ref name=NZ/>  \n   \nHe presented sculptures, made with bronze, on the theme ''Remembrance \u201971'', in the first-ever national Sculpture Exhibition organized by the [[Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy]] in December 1976. He received the Best Sculptor\u2019s Award at the exhibition for his sculpture \u2018\u2019Dorja (door)\u2019\u2019.<ref name=NewAge1/> It portrayed the image of a house-door with a martyred figure lying in the door step. \n\nKhan\u2019s major recognition as a sculptor came in 1980 when he was commissioned by the [[Government of Bangladesh]] to make a sculpture to be installed at the entrance of the [[Bangabhaban]] (President\u2019s House). For this commission, he created a sculpture, titled ''The Bird Family'', composed of three standing birds and made of brass sheets, pipes and marble. Initially, the ministers did not like his sculpture and said that it would be displaced. Later, the French ambassador to Bangladesh, while visiting Bangabhaban, notified the then-president [[Ziaur Rahman]] that it was contemporary with the sculptures of France. Following the incident, the government officials invited Khan to Bangabhaban and praised his work.<ref name=DailySun/>   \n\nIn 1981, he was commissioned by [[Bangladesh Army]] to make a sculpture for the [[Jalalabad Cantonment]] in Sylhet. The sculpture he made was titled ''Hamla'', based on the theme freedom fighter. In 1985, he created another sculpture on the same theme for the [[Bangla Academy]]. Khan organized his first solo sculpture exhibition at the gallery of Faculty of Fine Arts in 1982, with works primarily based on the liberation war theme. The exhibition drew a large number of viewers and received appreciation from critics and connoisseurs.<ref name=NZ>{{cite book |last=Roy |first=Sumanata |authorlink= |date=2008 |title=\u09ad\u09be\u09b8\u09cd\u0995\u09b0 \u09b9\u09be\u09ae\u09bf\u09a6\u09c1\u099c\u09cd\u099c\u09be\u09ae\u09be\u09a8 \u0996\u09be\u09a8 \u2013 \u099c\u09c0\u09ac\u09a8 \u0993 \u0995\u09b0\u09cd\u09ae |page=96-105 |publisher=Delvistaa Foundation}}</ref> He participated in 6th Triennial Art Exhibition in [[New Delhi]], organized by [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] in 1986, as an official entrant from Bangladesh.

The sculpture was titled ''Steps'', made of welded copper with a height of 13 feet.<ref name=way>[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMD6KG_The_Steps_5066851221_Olympic_Park__Seoul_Korea \"The Steps (\uc5ec\uc815) - Olympic Park  -  Seoul, Korea - Abstract Public Sculptures on Waymarking.com\"].</ref> It symbolized steps to freedom and progress. In 1990, he received a commission from [[Jahangirnagar University]] to install a sculpture in front of the Central Library of the university. The title of the sculpture was ''Shangshaptak''. Made of steel armature and brass steel, it depicted a freedom fighter, having an amputated leg and an amputated hand, charging ahead fearlessly. This remains one of Khan\u2019s best-known works. The figure has later been recast in modified form and in different media to be placed at different locations in Bangladesh. The most prominent one of these is the sculpture titled ''Freedom Fighter'', made with stainless steel pipe which was installed in 2003 at the entrance of UTC Building located in [[Panthapath]], Dhaka.

The work consists of three similar forms, depicting birds in abstraction. In addition to that, the World Bank office installed his relief work at the entrance, decorated the interior with 18 of his oil-paintings, terracotta, a metal-sculpture highlighting fish and a mural.  \n \n[[Dhaka City Corporation]] commissioned Khan in 2005 to create a sculpture to be placed at [[Farmgate]] intersection in Dhaka. The piece was titled ''Fish'', which depicts three fishes in spontaneous posture. The work remains as a popular artwork in public space in the busy neighborhood of Dhaka. Khan\u2019s two sculptures in metal adorn the lawns of [[Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Novo Theatre]]. One is a nearly man height abstract arch in deep blue and the other is a hardedge semi-abstract seated bird in red. His sculpture, titled ''Shikha'', a geometric abstract in painted sheet metal was placed at the entrance of the [[National University, Bangladesh]]. It has a height of 32 feet and a width of 13 feet and symbolizes enlightenment through education. \n\nHe created a sculpture on the theme of birds at the request of students of the [[University of Dhaka]].

It was developed by [[Handley Page]] to the same specification as the contemporary twin-engine [[Avro Manchester]].\n\nThe Halifax has its origins in the twin-engine ''HP56'' proposal of the late 1930s, produced in response to the British [[Air Ministry]]'s [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification P.13/36]] for a capable [[medium bomber]] for \"world-wide use.\" The HP56 was ordered as a backup to the Avro 679, both aircraft being designed to use the underperforming [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engine. The Handley Page design was altered at the Ministry to a four-engine arrangement powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine; the rival Avro 679 was produced as the twin-engine [[Avro Manchester]] which, while regarded as unsuccessful mainly due to the Vulture engine, was a direct predecessor of the famed [[Avro Lancaster]]. Both the Lancaster and the Halifax would emerge as capable four-engined [[strategic bomber]]s, thousands of which would be built and operated by the RAF and several other services during the War.\n\nOn 25 October 1939, the Halifax performed its [[maiden flight]], and it entered service with the RAF on 13 November 1940. It quickly became a major component of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], performing routine strategic bombing missions against the [[Axis Powers]], many of them at [[Night bomber|night]]. [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], the [[Air officer commanding|Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] of Bomber Command, described the Halifax as inferior to the rival Lancaster, in part due to its inability to carry larger individual bombs such as the [[Blockbuster bomb#Operational use|4,000 pound \"Cookie\" blast bomb]]. Nevertheless, production of the Halifax continued until April 1945. During their service with Bomber Command, Halifaxes flew a total of 82,773 operations and dropped 224,207 tons of bombs, while 1,833 aircraft were lost. The Halifax was also flown in large numbers by other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, such as the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), [[Free French Air Force]] and [[Polish contribution to World War II#Air force|Polish forces]].\n\nVarious improved versions of the Halifax were introduced, incorporating more powerful engines, a revised [[Gun turret#Aircraft|defensive turret]] layout and increased payload. It remained in service with Bomber Command until the end of the war, performing a variety of duties in addition to bombing. Additionally, specialised versions of the Halifax were developed for troop transport and [[paratrooper|paradrop]] operations. Following the end of the Second World War, the RAF quickly phased the Halifax out of service, after the type was succeeded in the strategic bombing role by the [[Avro Lincoln]], an advanced derivative of the Lancaster. During the post-war years, the Halifax was operated by the [[Egyptian Air Force|Royal Egyptian Air Force]], the [[French Air Force]] and the [[Royal Pakistan Air Force]]. The type also entered commercial service for a number of years, used mainly as a [[cargo aircraft|freighter]]. A dedicated civil transport variant, the Handley Page Halton, was also developed and entered airline service. 41 civil Halifax freighters were used during the [[Berlin Blockade#Airlift begins|Berlin Airlift]]. In 1961, the last remaining Halifax bombers were retired from operational use.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7083.jpg|thumb|Personnel in the Handley Page drawing office working on the Halifax bomber]]\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7123.jpg|thumb|A row of Halifax bombers under assembly at the Handley Page factory at [[Cricklewood]], 1942]]\nIn the 1930s, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was primarily interested in twin-engine [[bombers]].<ref name = \"norris 3\"/> These designs put significant demands on engine production and maintenance, both of which were already stretched with the introduction of many new types of aircraft into service. Power limitations were so serious that the British invested heavily in the development of huge engines in the 2,000 [[horsepower]] (1,500&nbsp;kW) class in an effort to improve performance. However, during the late 1930s, none of these engines was ready for production. Meanwhile, both the United States and the Soviet Union were developing bombers powered by arrangements of four smaller engines with favorable results, including excellent range and fair lifting capacity. Accordingly, in 1936, the RAF decided to investigate the feasibility of a four-engined bomber.<ref name = \"norris 3\">Norris 1966, p. 3.</ref>\n\nDuring the mid 1930s, the British [[Air Ministry]] released [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification P.13/36]], seeking a twin-engine [[medium bomber|heavy-medium bomber]] suitable for \"world-wide use\".<ref name = \"moyes 3\">Moyes 1966, p. 3.</ref> Further requirements of the specification included the use of a mid-mounted [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] wing and all-metal construction, and encouraged use of the [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engine then in development.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> In response, [[Handley Page]] produced the twin-engine ''HP56'' design to meet Specification P.13/36.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bingham|1986|p=4.}}</ref> Handley Page aircraft designer [[George Volkert]] had responsibility for the design.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOther candidates were submitted for the same specification, including the [[Avro Manchester|Avro 679]], and designs from [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]], [[Boulton Paul Aircraft|Boulton Paul]] and [[Short Brothers|Shorts]]; all submissions were designed around two-engine configurations, using the Rolls-Royce Vulture, [[Napier Sabre]], [[Fairey P.24]] or [[Bristol Hercules]] engines. The majority of these engines were under development at this point; while four-engined bomber designs were considered for specification B.12/36 for a heavy bomber, wings mounting two pairs of engines were still in the experimental stage and required additional testing at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE). Adopting a stronger wing also required additional strengthening of the overall aircraft structure, resulting in an increase in overall weight.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 104.</ref>\n\nIn February 1937, following consideration of the designs, the Air Ministry selected Avro's submission, with Handley Page's bid chosen as \"second string\". Accordingly, during April 1937, the Air Ministry ordered two prototypes of each design.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 102.</ref><ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The introduction of the successful P.13/36 candidates was delayed by the necessity of ordering additional [[Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley]] and [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers first. In mid-1937, it was decided to order both the Avro 679 and HP56 designs \"off the drawing board\" in order to speed up delivery timetables.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nDuring July 1937, Handley Page was instructed to redesign the HP56 to use a four-engine arrangement, instead of the original twin-engine configuration; by this point, the Vulture had already been suffering from reliability and performance problems.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The rival Avro 679 proceeded into service as the [[Avro Manchester]] powered by a pair of Vulture engines, but was only built in limited quantities after suffering substantially from engine-related difficulties.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}} The four-engine redesign increased its wingspan from {{convert|88|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|99|ft|m|abbr=on}} and added {{convert|13000|lb|kg|-1}} of weight.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> In September 1937, the Ministry specified the use of four [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines; according to aviation author Phillip J. R. Moyes, this redesign to four Merlin engines had been done \"much against the company's wishes\".<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nTowards the end of the year, a full mock-up of the design was assessed; production of a pair of ''HP57'' prototypes commenced in March 1938.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 105.</ref> Further design modifications resulted in the definitive aircraft, now considerably enlarged and powered by four {{convert|1280|hp|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Rolls-Royce Merlin X]] engines. Such was the promise of the new model that, in January 1938, the RAF chose to place their first production order for the type, ordering 100 Mk.I Halifaxes \"off the drawing board\", at which point the serials which had already been assigned to HP56 were switched to HP57.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7080.jpg|thumb|Aerodynamic model of the Halifax undergoing [[wind tunnel]] testing, 1942]]\nThe first prototype was built at Handley Page's facility in [[Cricklewood]], [[London]], It was then dismantled and transported by road to [[Bicester Airfield|RAF Bicester]] (the nearest non-operational RAF airfield with suitable facilities) for reassembly. On 25 October 1939, the [[maiden flight]] of the first prototype Halifax, serial number ''L7244'', was performed by chief test pilot Jim Cordes with E A 'Ginger' Wright as flight test observer; during this flight, the undercarriage remained locked down as an extra safety precaution.<ref>Barnes, C H: Handley Page Aircraft since 1907, London 1976, pp. 387\u2013388.</ref><ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nOn 17 August 1940, the first flight of the second prototype, ''L7245'', now complete with full armament and operationally-representative equipment, was performed by Cordes from [[Radlett|Radlett Aerodrome]].<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The HP57 was given the service name ''Halifax'' upon its acceptance. This name followed the practice of naming heavy bombers after major towns&nbsp;\u2013 in this case, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in the [[West Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]]. In September 1941, a production Halifax Mk.I participated in an official naming ceremony of the type, officiated by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] and Lady Halifax.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7100.jpg|thumb|Spray painters at work in the paint shop of the Handley Page's Cricklewood factory, 1942]]\nSeries production of the Halifax began at Handley Page's factory at Cricklewood and at [[English Electric]]'s site in [[Samlesbury]], [[Lancashire]]. In order to speed up production, Handley Page implemented several new manufacturing techniques, including two pioneering approaches: photo-[[lofting]] and split construction. In the latter capacity, each Halifax was built from various sub-assemblies.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> Surface panels were flush-[[rivet]]ed, although the application of the matt black night bomber camouflage probably negated its benefit.<ref>Flight pp. 400\u2013401.</ref>\n\nHandley Page built the assemblies and components at Cricklewood and the aircraft were assembled and flown from [[Radlett Aerodrome]]; the first production aircraft flew from Radlett on 11 October 1940.\n\nThe sizeable production run envisioned required the involvement of several external parties in addition to Handley Page.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> The resulting ''Halifax Group'' was established to oversee the manufacturing programme, comprising English Electric (who had previously been a valued contributor in the production of the [[Handley Page Hampden]]), various firms within the [[British shadow factories#London Aircraft Production Group|London Aircraft Production Group]], [[Fairey Aviation]], and [[Rootes Motors]].<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> Because of this scheme and other initiatives, the Halifax was manufactured by a variety of aviation companies at sites across the British isles.\n\nThe Halifax was produced in large numbers during the war: of the 10,018 heavy bombers produced in Britain between 1940 and 1944, 4,046 were various models of the Halifax \u2013 in excess of 40%.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> In all, 6,178 Halifaxes were built, the last delivered in April 1945.<ref name = \"norris 12\"/><ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> At the peak, 41 separate factories and dispersed units were involved in production, along with 600 [[subcontractor]]s and 51,000 employees, with one Halifax completed every hour.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> The first English Electric-built aircraft was flown from Samlesbury on 15 August 1941.\n\nThe first production standard Halifax, the Mk.I, had a 22&nbsp;ft (6.7&nbsp;m) long bomb bay as well as six bomb cells in the wings, providing a bomb capacity of 13,000&nbsp;lb (5,900&nbsp;kg). Defensive armament consisted of two .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] in a [[Boulton Paul]] Type C [[Nose gunner|nose turret]], with an additional four in a Boulton Paul Type E [[Tail gunner|tail turret]]. Some aircraft included two additional .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[Vickers K machine gun]]s in beam (side, or \"waist\") positions. Subtle modifications distinguished the Mk I aircraft. Aircraft of the first batch of fifty Mk I Halifaxes were designated Mk I Series I.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\n=== Factories ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Manufacturer\n!Location\n!Number produced\n|-\n|Handley Page\n|[[Radlett]]\n|1589\n|-\n|English Electric\n|[[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]\n|2145\n|-\n|Fairey Aviation\n|[[Stockport]]\n|662\n|-\n|London Aircraft Production Group\n|[[Leavesden Aerodrome|Leavesden]]{{efn|The aircraft were assembled at Leavesden from components and assemblies manufactured around London}}\n|710\n|-\n|Rootes Securities\n|[[Speke]]\n|1070\n|}\n\n===Improvements===\nThe Halifax Mk.I was quickly followed by 25 of the Mk I Series II; these featured an increased gross weight (from 58,000&nbsp;lb/26,310&nbsp;kg to 60,000&nbsp;lb/27,220&nbsp;kg) but with maximum landing weight unchanged at {{convert|50000|lb|abbr=on}}. The Halifax Mk I Series III featured increased fuel capacity (1,882&nbsp;gal/8,556&nbsp;L), and larger oil coolers, the latter of which having been adopted in order to accommodate the Merlin XX engine.

The Mk II Series I (Special) achieved improved performance via the removal of the nose and dorsal turrets. The Halifax Mk II Series IA was fitted with a moulded [[Acrylic glass|Perspex]] nose (this nose became standard upon future Halifax variants), a four-gun [[Boulton Paul Defiant|Defiant]]-type dorsal turret, Merlin 22 engines and larger, trapezoidal-shaped vertical tail surfaces which solved control deficiencies from fin-[[Stall (flight)|stall]] produced by the roughly triangular-shape original surfaces, leading to rudder overbalance in the early marks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Most Secret Place : Boscombe Down 1939\u201345|last=Johnson|first=Brian|year=1982|pages=Chapter 1|quote=Recommendations 'The rudder overbalance, which is manifest when both port airscrews are feathered, would cause great fatigue to a pilot attempting to keep straight and level under such conditions, and modification action is necessary in order to overcome this defect.'}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title= Halifax aircraft: performance and handling trials: A.& A.E.E/760 13 pts 760a-e 55 pts |date= 1940\u20131946 |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/record?catid=5007611&catln=6}}</ref> Halifax IIs were built by both English Electric and Handley Page; 200 and 100 aircraft respectively.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nOwing to a shortage of Messier-built [[landing gear]] and [[hydraulics]], [[Dowty Group|Dowty]]-built landing gear were used on some aircraft instead. As it was incompatible with the Messier equipment, this led to these Halifax bombers being given new designations: a Mark II built with Dowty gear was the Mark V.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/> The use of [[casting]]s rather than [[forging]]s in the Dowty undercarriage had resulted in an increased production rate but had also led to a reduced landing weight of {{convert|40000|lb|abbr=on}}. The Halifax Mark V were manufactured by [[Rootes Group]] at [[Speke]] and [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] at [[Stockport]]; operationally, these were generally used by [[Coastal Command]] and for training purposes. Some 904 had been built when Mark V production ended at the start of 1944,<ref>Barnes 1987, {{page needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> compared to 1,966 Halifax Mk IIs.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nThe most numerous Halifax variant was the B Mk III of which 2,091 were built. First appearing in 1943, the Mk III featured the Perspex nose and modified tail of the Mk II Series IA but replaced the Merlin with the more powerful {{convert|1650|hp|abbr=on}} [[Bristol Hercules|Bristol Hercules XVI]] [[radial engine]]. Other changes included the adoption of [[de Havilland]] Hydromatic propellers and rounded wing tips.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/> The Halifax Mk IV was a non-production design using a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] Hercules powerplant.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nThe definitive version of the Halifax was the B Mk VI, powered by the {{convert|1800|hp|abbr=on}} Hercules 100. The final bomber version, the Mk VII, reverted to the less powerful Hercules XVI. However, these variants were produced in relatively small quantities.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nThe remaining variants were the Halifax C Mk VIII, an unarmed transport that was fitted with an 8,000&nbsp;lb/3,630&nbsp;kg cargo pannier instead of a bomb bay, which could accommodate a maximum of 11 passengers and the Mk A IX [[paratroop]] transport, which had space for up to 16 paratroopers and their equipment. A transport/cargo version of the Halifax was also produced, known as the ''Handley Page Halton''.<ref>Barnes, C H: Handley Page Aircraft since 1907, London 1976, pp. 417, 419, 423, 603.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n===Overview===\n[[File:HalifaxCutAway.jpg|thumb|Halifax cutaway model at the [[London Science Museum]].]]\nThe Handley Page Halifax was a mostly orthodox design, a mid-wing [[monoplane]] with a tail unit featuring twin [[fin]]s and [[rudder]]s. The Halifax featured all-metal construction with a smooth, stressed skin covering the majority of the exterior surfaces; the [[flight control surfaces]] were an exception, being fabric-covered instead.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The slab-sided fuselage contained a 22-foot [[bomb bay]], which contained the majority of the Halifax's payload, while the cockpit was flush with the upper fuselage.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nThe Halifax was powered by four engines, two spaced evenly on each wing.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> Early production Halifax bombers were powered by models of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine; later aircraft were commonly powered by the larger [[Bristol Hercules]] [[radial engine]]. To contain and attach the engines to the airframe, Handley Page developed their own design for the [[power egg]] instead of using the typical, slimmer Rolls-Royce counterpart; despite generating increased drag, this in-house design was readily adaptable to the alternative Hercules engine on later aircraft.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nEach engine drove a [[Rotol]]-built compressed wood [[constant-speed propeller]], enabling the Halifax B.I to attain a maximum speed of 265&nbsp;mph at 17,500&nbsp;feet.<ref name = \"moyes 3 4\">Moyes 1966, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> With a typical payload of 5,800&nbsp;lbs of bombs and 2,242&nbsp;imp.&nbsp;gal. of fuel, it had a range of 1,860&nbsp;miles. The defensive armaments included power-assisted gun turrets in various positions located across the aircraft.<ref name = \"moyes 4\">Moyes 1966, p. 4.</ref> Different models of the Halifax used different numbers and combinations of turrets, effectively trading speed for firepower and vice versa.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/>\n\n===Accommodation and armament===\n[[File:Halifax crew at positions AWM 012799.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Looking upward and rearward from the navigator's position : wireless operator at lower right; pilot at upper right; flight engineer in his usual inflight position at upper left behind the pilot</center>]]\n[[File:Halifax crew before take-off WWII IWM D 6028.jpg|thumb|right|Halifax B Mk II Series 1 : flight engineer on the fold-down seat next to the pilot, ready to assist with the throttles for takeoff; with front gunner and navigator seen below]]\nThe bomb aimer's position was in the extreme nose with the navigator's table located behind it, both roles fulfilled by the same crew member. Above the navigator's position was the forward gun turret. The wireless (radio) operator was behind the navigator's position, separated by a half-width partition.<ref name = \"flight 401\"/>\n\nThe pilot (left side) and co-pilot (right side) occupied the cockpit, above the wireless operator. (The flight engineer filled in as a co-pilot, seated on a folding seat, during crucial manoeuvres such as take-off.) Aft of the pilots and on the same level as the navigator and wireless operator was the [[flight engineer]]'s compartment. Another compartment aft of the flight engineer contained two bunks originally intended for resting crew members, but almost always used for treating and berthing injured crew. This area led to the two-gun dorsal turret. The tail gunner occupied a four-gun turret at the extreme aft end of the aircraft.<ref name = \"flight 401\">''Flight'' 1942, p. 401.</ref>\n\nStarting with the Halifax ''Mk II Series IA'' and from the ''Mk III'' onwards, the nose turret was deleted; instead the bomb-aimer occupied a streamlined perspex nose containing a single hand-held machine gun. On later-built aircraft, the two-gun dorsal turret was replaced by a four-gun [[Boulton Paul]] turret.\n\nThe maximum bomb load was {{convert|14500|lb|abbr=on}}, which was primarily carried in a bomb bay housed within the fuselage, divided into six separate bomb compartments, with three bomb compartments in the inboard sections of each wing; this division of the payload between multiple compartments limited the maximum size of the individual bombs which could be carried to {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Operational service==\n[[File:Halifaxes over Brest Dec 1941 IWM C 4109.jpg|thumb|Halifaxes of No. 35 Squadron bombing the German battleships [[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] and [[German battleship Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] in [[dry dock]] at [[Brest, France]], 18 December 1941]]\nIn November 1940, the Handley Page Halifax entered service with [[No. 35 Squadron RAF|No. 35 Squadron]] at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]. Its operational debut occurred on the night of 10\u201311 March 1941, when six Halifax bombers flew a bombing raid against [[Le Havre]], targeting the area around the docks and any shipping that might be present.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/><ref name=\"Falconer232\">Falconer 1998, p. 232</ref> The existence of the Halifax was not officially acknowledged until July 1941, after it was used in a daylight attack on [[La Pallice]], [[France]], against the [[German battleship Scharnhorst]].

Effective marking greatly increased the accuracy and destructive power of Bomber Command. As a Pathfinder and Main Force aircraft, the Halifax was a core part of the bombing offensive against Germany and its Axis allies.<ref name = \"norris 4 5\">Norris 1966, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1943, [[No. 4 Group RAF|No. 4 Group]] had been entirely equipped with the Halifax, and would continue to operate the aircraft until the end of the war.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> The [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No. 6 Group]] of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) also adopted the Halifax around the same time, and would go on to operate it in each of its 14 squadrons, although it was never solely equipped with the type.

Introduced into service in November 1943, the Mk III was first delivered to [[433 Tactical Fighter Squadron|No. 433 Squadron]] and [[No. 466 Squadron RAAF|No. 466 Squadron]].<ref name = \"norris 5 6\">Norris 1966, pp. 5\u20136.</ref> By January 1944, the Hercules-powered Halifax was available in quantity and quickly proved to have superior performance in the face of German fighter defences.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/>\n\nEarly on, Air Chief Marshal [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], head of Bomber Command, was scathing in his criticism of the Halifax's performance in comparison to the new [[Avro Lancaster]], primarily of its bomb-carrying capability: an average Halifax was calculated to drop 100 tons of bombs in its lifetime, compared to a Lancaster's 154. Harris continued to have a poor opinion of the Halifax, despite the fact that later Hercules-engined machines had lower loss rates and higher crew survival rates after abandoning the aircraft than Lancasters, and came very close to the Lancaster's speed and altitude performance.<ref>Lake, Jon.

But any new facilities were devoted to the Lancaster.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:AdRymarz.jpg|thumb|left|View of a Halifax crewmember]]\nHarris's view of the Halifax changed sometime after spring 1942. On 2 June 1942, in a response to a telegram sent by Frederick Handley Page, congratulating Harris on the success of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II#First 1.2C000 bomber raid|first 1000 bomber Cologne raid]], he stated: \"My Dear Handley Page.

It was developed by [[Handley Page]] to the same specification as the contemporary twin-engine [[Avro Manchester]].\n\nThe Halifax has its origins in the twin-engine ''HP56'' proposal of the late 1930s, produced in response to the British [[Air Ministry]]'s [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification P.13/36]] for a capable [[medium bomber]] for \"world-wide use.\" The HP56 was ordered as a backup to the Avro 679, both aircraft being designed to use the underperforming [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engine. The Handley Page design was altered at the Ministry to a four-engine arrangement powered by the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine; the rival Avro 679 was produced as the twin-engine [[Avro Manchester]] which, while regarded as unsuccessful mainly due to the Vulture engine, was a direct predecessor of the famed [[Avro Lancaster]]. Both the Lancaster and the Halifax would emerge as capable four-engined [[strategic bomber]]s, thousands of which would be built and operated by the RAF and several other services during the War.\n\nOn 25 October 1939, the Halifax performed its [[maiden flight]], and it entered service with the RAF on 13 November 1940. It quickly became a major component of [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]], performing routine strategic bombing missions against the [[Axis Powers]], many of them at [[Night bomber|night]]. [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], the [[Air officer commanding|Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief]] of Bomber Command, described the Halifax as inferior to the rival Lancaster, in part due to its inability to carry larger individual bombs such as the [[Blockbuster bomb#Operational use|4,000 pound \"Cookie\" blast bomb]]. Nevertheless, production of the Halifax continued until April 1945. During their service with Bomber Command, Halifaxes flew a total of 82,773 operations and dropped 224,207 tons of bombs, while 1,833 aircraft were lost. The Halifax was also flown in large numbers by other [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations, such as the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF), [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF), [[Free French Air Force]] and [[Polish contribution to World War II#Air force|Polish forces]].\n\nVarious improved versions of the Halifax were introduced, incorporating more powerful engines, a revised [[Gun turret#Aircraft|defensive turret]] layout and increased payload. It remained in service with Bomber Command until the end of the war, performing a variety of duties in addition to bombing. Additionally, specialised versions of the Halifax were developed for troop transport and [[paratrooper|paradrop]] operations. Following the end of the Second World War, the RAF quickly phased the Halifax out of service, after the type was succeeded in the strategic bombing role by the [[Avro Lincoln]], an advanced derivative of the Lancaster. During the post-war years, the Halifax was operated by the [[Egyptian Air Force|Royal Egyptian Air Force]], the [[French Air Force]] and the [[Royal Pakistan Air Force]]. The type also entered commercial service for a number of years, used mainly as a [[cargo aircraft|freighter]]. A dedicated civil transport variant, the Handley Page Halton, was also developed and entered airline service. 41 civil Halifax freighters were used during the [[Berlin Blockade#Airlift begins|Berlin Airlift]]. In 1961, the last remaining Halifax bombers were retired from operational use.\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7083.jpg|thumb|Personnel in the Handley Page drawing office working on the Halifax bomber]]\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7123.jpg|thumb|A row of Halifax bombers under assembly at the Handley Page factory at [[Cricklewood]], 1942]]\nIn the 1930s, the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) was primarily interested in twin-engine [[bombers]].<ref name = \"norris 3\"/> These designs put significant demands on engine production and maintenance, both of which were already stretched with the introduction of many new types of aircraft into service. Power limitations were so serious that the British invested heavily in the development of huge engines in the 2,000 [[horsepower]] (1,500&nbsp;kW) class in an effort to improve performance. However, during the late 1930s, none of these engines was ready for production. Meanwhile, both the United States and the Soviet Union were developing bombers powered by arrangements of four smaller engines with favorable results, including excellent range and fair lifting capacity. Accordingly, in 1936, the RAF decided to investigate the feasibility of a four-engined bomber.<ref name = \"norris 3\">Norris 1966, p. 3.</ref>\n\nDuring the mid 1930s, the British [[Air Ministry]] released [[List of Air Ministry specifications|Specification P.13/36]], seeking a twin-engine [[medium bomber|heavy-medium bomber]] suitable for \"world-wide use\".<ref name = \"moyes 3\">Moyes 1966, p. 3.</ref> Further requirements of the specification included the use of a mid-mounted [[cantilever]] [[monoplane]] wing and all-metal construction, and encouraged use of the [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engine then in development.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> In response, [[Handley Page]] produced the twin-engine ''HP56'' design to meet Specification P.13/36.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bingham|1986|p=4.}}</ref> Handley Page aircraft designer [[George Volkert]] had responsibility for the design.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nOther candidates were submitted for the same specification, including the [[Avro Manchester|Avro 679]], and designs from [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]], [[Boulton Paul Aircraft|Boulton Paul]] and [[Short Brothers|Shorts]]; all submissions were designed around two-engine configurations, using the Rolls-Royce Vulture, [[Napier Sabre]], [[Fairey P.24]] or [[Bristol Hercules]] engines. The majority of these engines were under development at this point; while four-engined bomber designs were considered for specification B.12/36 for a heavy bomber, wings mounting two pairs of engines were still in the experimental stage and required additional testing at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE). Adopting a stronger wing also required additional strengthening of the overall aircraft structure, resulting in an increase in overall weight.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 104.</ref>\n\nIn February 1937, following consideration of the designs, the Air Ministry selected Avro's submission, with Handley Page's bid chosen as \"second string\". Accordingly, during April 1937, the Air Ministry ordered two prototypes of each design.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 102.</ref><ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The introduction of the successful P.13/36 candidates was delayed by the necessity of ordering additional [[Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley]] and [[Vickers Wellington]] bombers first. In mid-1937, it was decided to order both the Avro 679 and HP56 designs \"off the drawing board\" in order to speed up delivery timetables.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nDuring July 1937, Handley Page was instructed to redesign the HP56 to use a four-engine arrangement, instead of the original twin-engine configuration; by this point, the Vulture had already been suffering from reliability and performance problems.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The rival Avro 679 proceeded into service as the [[Avro Manchester]] powered by a pair of Vulture engines, but was only built in limited quantities after suffering substantially from engine-related difficulties.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}} The four-engine redesign increased its wingspan from {{convert|88|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|99|ft|m|abbr=on}} and added {{convert|13000|lb|kg|-1}} of weight.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> In September 1937, the Ministry specified the use of four [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engines; according to aviation author Phillip J. R. Moyes, this redesign to four Merlin engines had been done \"much against the company's wishes\".<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nTowards the end of the year, a full mock-up of the design was assessed; production of a pair of ''HP57'' prototypes commenced in March 1938.<ref>Buttler 2004, p. 105.</ref> Further design modifications resulted in the definitive aircraft, now considerably enlarged and powered by four {{convert|1280|hp|abbr=on}} [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Rolls-Royce Merlin X]] engines. Such was the promise of the new model that, in January 1938, the RAF chose to place their first production order for the type, ordering 100 Mk.I Halifaxes \"off the drawing board\", at which point the serials which had already been assigned to HP56 were switched to HP57.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7080.jpg|thumb|Aerodynamic model of the Halifax undergoing [[wind tunnel]] testing, 1942]]\nThe first prototype was built at Handley Page's facility in [[Cricklewood]], [[London]], It was then dismantled and transported by road to [[Bicester Airfield|RAF Bicester]] (the nearest non-operational RAF airfield with suitable facilities) for reassembly. On 25 October 1939, the [[maiden flight]] of the first prototype Halifax, serial number ''L7244'', was performed by chief test pilot Jim Cordes with E A 'Ginger' Wright as flight test observer; during this flight, the undercarriage remained locked down as an extra safety precaution.<ref>Barnes, C H: Handley Page Aircraft since 1907, London 1976, pp. 387\u2013388.</ref><ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nOn 17 August 1940, the first flight of the second prototype, ''L7245'', now complete with full armament and operationally-representative equipment, was performed by Cordes from [[Radlett|Radlett Aerodrome]].<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The HP57 was given the service name ''Halifax'' upon its acceptance. This name followed the practice of naming heavy bombers after major towns&nbsp;\u2013 in this case, [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] in the [[West Riding]] of [[Yorkshire]]. In September 1941, a production Halifax Mk.I participated in an official naming ceremony of the type, officiated by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] and Lady Halifax.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Birth of a Bomber- Aircraft Production in Britain, 1942 D7100.jpg|thumb|Spray painters at work in the paint shop of the Handley Page's Cricklewood factory, 1942]]\nSeries production of the Halifax began at Handley Page's factory at Cricklewood and at [[English Electric]]'s site in [[Samlesbury]], [[Lancashire]]. In order to speed up production, Handley Page implemented several new manufacturing techniques, including two pioneering approaches: photo-[[lofting]] and split construction. In the latter capacity, each Halifax was built from various sub-assemblies.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> Surface panels were flush-[[rivet]]ed, although the application of the matt black night bomber camouflage probably negated its benefit.<ref>Flight pp. 400\u2013401.</ref>\n\nHandley Page built the assemblies and components at Cricklewood and the aircraft were assembled and flown from [[Radlett Aerodrome]]; the first production aircraft flew from Radlett on 11 October 1940.\n\nThe sizeable production run envisioned required the involvement of several external parties in addition to Handley Page.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> The resulting ''Halifax Group'' was established to oversee the manufacturing programme, comprising English Electric (who had previously been a valued contributor in the production of the [[Handley Page Hampden]]), various firms within the [[British shadow factories#London Aircraft Production Group|London Aircraft Production Group]], [[Fairey Aviation]], and [[Rootes Motors]].<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> Because of this scheme and other initiatives, the Halifax was manufactured by a variety of aviation companies at sites across the British isles.\n\nThe Halifax was produced in large numbers during the war: of the 10,018 heavy bombers produced in Britain between 1940 and 1944, 4,046 were various models of the Halifax \u2013 in excess of 40%.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> In all, 6,178 Halifaxes were built, the last delivered in April 1945.<ref name = \"norris 12\"/><ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> At the peak, 41 separate factories and dispersed units were involved in production, along with 600 [[subcontractor]]s and 51,000 employees, with one Halifax completed every hour.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> The first English Electric-built aircraft was flown from Samlesbury on 15 August 1941.\n\nThe first production standard Halifax, the Mk.I, had a 22&nbsp;ft (6.7&nbsp;m) long bomb bay as well as six bomb cells in the wings, providing a bomb capacity of 13,000&nbsp;lb (5,900&nbsp;kg). Defensive armament consisted of two .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] in a [[Boulton Paul]] Type C [[Nose gunner|nose turret]], with an additional four in a Boulton Paul Type E [[Tail gunner|tail turret]]. Some aircraft included two additional .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[Vickers K machine gun]]s in beam (side, or \"waist\") positions. Subtle modifications distinguished the Mk I aircraft. Aircraft of the first batch of fifty Mk I Halifaxes were designated Mk I Series I.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\n=== Factories ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Manufacturer\n!Location\n!Number produced\n|-\n|Handley Page\n|[[Radlett]]\n|1589\n|-\n|English Electric\n|[[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]]\n|2145\n|-\n|Fairey Aviation\n|[[Stockport]]\n|662\n|-\n|London Aircraft Production Group\n|[[Leavesden Aerodrome|Leavesden]]{{efn|The aircraft were assembled at Leavesden from components and assemblies manufactured around London}}\n|710\n|-\n|Rootes Securities\n|[[Speke]]\n|1070\n|}\n\n===Improvements===\nThe Halifax Mk.I was quickly followed by 25 of the Mk I Series II; these featured an increased gross weight (from 58,000&nbsp;lb/26,310&nbsp;kg to 60,000&nbsp;lb/27,220&nbsp;kg) but with maximum landing weight unchanged at {{convert|50000|lb|abbr=on}}. The Halifax Mk I Series III featured increased fuel capacity (1,882&nbsp;gal/8,556&nbsp;L), and larger oil coolers, the latter of which having been adopted in order to accommodate the Merlin XX engine. A dorsally-mounted two-gun Boulton Paul Type C turret replaced the beam guns.<ref name = \"norris 5\">Norris 1966, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:Halifax V9977.jpg|thumb|The test Halifax B Mk II Srs I, [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''V9977'', in-which the first [[H2S radar]] was installed; note the early triangular fins.

All on board were killed, including the well-known engineer [[Alan Blumlein]].]]\n\nIntroduction of {{convert|1390|hp|abbr=on}} Merlin XX engines and a twin .303&nbsp;in (7.7&nbsp;mm) dorsal turret instead of waist guns resulted in the Halifax B Mk II Series I. The Mk II Series I (Special) achieved improved performance via the removal of the nose and dorsal turrets. The Halifax Mk II Series IA was fitted with a moulded [[Acrylic glass|Perspex]] nose (this nose became standard upon future Halifax variants), a four-gun [[Boulton Paul Defiant|Defiant]]-type dorsal turret, Merlin 22 engines and larger, trapezoidal-shaped vertical tail surfaces which solved control deficiencies from fin-[[Stall (flight)|stall]] produced by the roughly triangular-shape original surfaces, leading to rudder overbalance in the early marks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Most Secret Place : Boscombe Down 1939\u201345|last=Johnson|first=Brian|year=1982|pages=Chapter 1|quote=Recommendations 'The rudder overbalance, which is manifest when both port airscrews are feathered, would cause great fatigue to a pilot attempting to keep straight and level under such conditions, and modification action is necessary in order to overcome this defect.'}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title= Halifax aircraft: performance and handling trials: A.& A.E.E/760 13 pts 760a-e 55 pts |date= 1940\u20131946 |url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/record?catid=5007611&catln=6}}</ref> Halifax IIs were built by both English Electric and Handley Page; 200 and 100 aircraft respectively.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nOwing to a shortage of Messier-built [[landing gear]] and [[hydraulics]], [[Dowty Group|Dowty]]-built landing gear were used on some aircraft instead. As it was incompatible with the Messier equipment, this led to these Halifax bombers being given new designations: a Mark II built with Dowty gear was the Mark V.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/> The use of [[casting]]s rather than [[forging]]s in the Dowty undercarriage had resulted in an increased production rate but had also led to a reduced landing weight of {{convert|40000|lb|abbr=on}}. The Halifax Mark V were manufactured by [[Rootes Group]] at [[Speke]] and [[Fairey Aviation Company|Fairey]] at [[Stockport]]; operationally, these were generally used by [[Coastal Command]] and for training purposes. Some 904 had been built when Mark V production ended at the start of 1944,<ref>Barnes 1987, {{page needed|date=March 2017}}</ref> compared to 1,966 Halifax Mk IIs.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nThe most numerous Halifax variant was the B Mk III of which 2,091 were built. First appearing in 1943, the Mk III featured the Perspex nose and modified tail of the Mk II Series IA but replaced the Merlin with the more powerful {{convert|1650|hp|abbr=on}} [[Bristol Hercules|Bristol Hercules XVI]] [[radial engine]]. Other changes included the adoption of [[de Havilland]] Hydromatic propellers and rounded wing tips.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/> The Halifax Mk IV was a non-production design using a [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] Hercules powerplant.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nThe definitive version of the Halifax was the B Mk VI, powered by the {{convert|1800|hp|abbr=on}} Hercules 100. The final bomber version, the Mk VII, reverted to the less powerful Hercules XVI. However, these variants were produced in relatively small quantities.{{citation needed|date = July 2013}}\n\nThe remaining variants were the Halifax C Mk VIII, an unarmed transport that was fitted with an 8,000&nbsp;lb/3,630&nbsp;kg cargo pannier instead of a bomb bay, which could accommodate a maximum of 11 passengers and the Mk A IX [[paratroop]] transport, which had space for up to 16 paratroopers and their equipment. A transport/cargo version of the Halifax was also produced, known as the ''Handley Page Halton''.<ref>Barnes, C H: Handley Page Aircraft since 1907, London 1976, pp. 417, 419, 423, 603.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n===Overview===\n[[File:HalifaxCutAway.jpg|thumb|Halifax cutaway model at the [[London Science Museum]].]]\nThe Handley Page Halifax was a mostly orthodox design, a mid-wing [[monoplane]] with a tail unit featuring twin [[fin]]s and [[rudder]]s. The Halifax featured all-metal construction with a smooth, stressed skin covering the majority of the exterior surfaces; the [[flight control surfaces]] were an exception, being fabric-covered instead.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> The slab-sided fuselage contained a 22-foot [[bomb bay]], which contained the majority of the Halifax's payload, while the cockpit was flush with the upper fuselage.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nThe Halifax was powered by four engines, two spaced evenly on each wing.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/> Early production Halifax bombers were powered by models of the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] engine; later aircraft were commonly powered by the larger [[Bristol Hercules]] [[radial engine]]. To contain and attach the engines to the airframe, Handley Page developed their own design for the [[power egg]] instead of using the typical, slimmer Rolls-Royce counterpart; despite generating increased drag, this in-house design was readily adaptable to the alternative Hercules engine on later aircraft.<ref name = \"moyes 3\"/>\n\nEach engine drove a [[Rotol]]-built compressed wood [[constant-speed propeller]], enabling the Halifax B.I to attain a maximum speed of 265&nbsp;mph at 17,500&nbsp;feet.<ref name = \"moyes 3 4\">Moyes 1966, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> With a typical payload of 5,800&nbsp;lbs of bombs and 2,242&nbsp;imp.&nbsp;gal. of fuel, it had a range of 1,860&nbsp;miles. The defensive armaments included power-assisted gun turrets in various positions located across the aircraft.<ref name = \"moyes 4\">Moyes 1966, p. 4.</ref> Different models of the Halifax used different numbers and combinations of turrets, effectively trading speed for firepower and vice versa.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/>\n\n===Accommodation and armament===\n[[File:Halifax crew at positions AWM 012799.jpg|thumb|left|<center>Looking upward and rearward from the navigator's position : wireless operator at lower right; pilot at upper right; flight engineer in his usual inflight position at upper left behind the pilot</center>]]\n[[File:Halifax crew before take-off WWII IWM D 6028.jpg|thumb|right|Halifax B Mk II Series 1 : flight engineer on the fold-down seat next to the pilot, ready to assist with the throttles for takeoff; with front gunner and navigator seen below]]\nThe bomb aimer's position was in the extreme nose with the navigator's table located behind it, both roles fulfilled by the same crew member. Above the navigator's position was the forward gun turret. The wireless (radio) operator was behind the navigator's position, separated by a half-width partition.<ref name = \"flight 401\"/>\n\nThe pilot (left side) and co-pilot (right side) occupied the cockpit, above the wireless operator. (The flight engineer filled in as a co-pilot, seated on a folding seat, during crucial manoeuvres such as take-off.) Aft of the pilots and on the same level as the navigator and wireless operator was the [[flight engineer]]'s compartment. Another compartment aft of the flight engineer contained two bunks originally intended for resting crew members, but almost always used for treating and berthing injured crew. This area led to the two-gun dorsal turret. The tail gunner occupied a four-gun turret at the extreme aft end of the aircraft.<ref name = \"flight 401\">''Flight'' 1942, p. 401.</ref>\n\nStarting with the Halifax ''Mk II Series IA'' and from the ''Mk III'' onwards, the nose turret was deleted; instead the bomb-aimer occupied a streamlined perspex nose containing a single hand-held machine gun. On later-built aircraft, the two-gun dorsal turret was replaced by a four-gun [[Boulton Paul]] turret.\n\nThe maximum bomb load was {{convert|14500|lb|abbr=on}}, which was primarily carried in a bomb bay housed within the fuselage, divided into six separate bomb compartments, with three bomb compartments in the inboard sections of each wing; this division of the payload between multiple compartments limited the maximum size of the individual bombs which could be carried to {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\n==Operational service==\n[[File:Halifaxes over Brest Dec 1941 IWM C 4109.jpg|thumb|Halifaxes of No. 35 Squadron bombing the German battleships [[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] and [[German battleship Gneisenau|Gneisenau]] in [[dry dock]] at [[Brest, France]], 18 December 1941]]\nIn November 1940, the Handley Page Halifax entered service with [[No. 35 Squadron RAF|No. 35 Squadron]] at [[RAF Linton-on-Ouse]]. Its operational debut occurred on the night of 10\u201311 March 1941, when six Halifax bombers flew a bombing raid against [[Le Havre]], targeting the area around the docks and any shipping that might be present.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/><ref name=\"Falconer232\">Falconer 1998, p. 232</ref> The existence of the Halifax was not officially acknowledged until July 1941, after it was used in a daylight attack on [[La Pallice]], [[France]], against the [[German battleship Scharnhorst]]. At the end of 1941, the Halifax was withdrawn from daylight bombing operations after intensifying fighter opposition had increased the casualty rates to unsustainable levels.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/>\n\nIn the second half of 1942, No. 35 Squadron and four other squadrons were selected to form the [[Pathfinder (RAF)|Pathfinder Force]], later expanded to become [[No. 8 Group RAF|No. 8 Group]].<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> Pathfinder crews flying the Halifax would mark routes and identify and mark targets for the Main Force. Effective marking greatly increased the accuracy and destructive power of Bomber Command. As a Pathfinder and Main Force aircraft, the Halifax was a core part of the bombing offensive against Germany and its Axis allies.<ref name = \"norris 4 5\">Norris 1966, pp. 4\u20135.</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1943, [[No. 4 Group RAF|No. 4 Group]] had been entirely equipped with the Halifax, and would continue to operate the aircraft until the end of the war.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/> The [[No. 6 Group RCAF|No. 6 Group]] of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) also adopted the Halifax around the same time, and would go on to operate it in each of its 14 squadrons, although it was never solely equipped with the type. At its peak strength, Bomber Command operated a total of 76 Halifax-equipped squadrons.<ref name = \"moyes 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Halifax 76 Squadron.jpg|thumb|Handley Page Halifax B Mk I, s/n L9530, MP-L of the No. 76 Squadron RAF, Summer 1941]]\nWhile the early-built models of the Halifax were heavily used by Bomber Command and made valuable contributions to operations, the aircraft's performance was considered unsatisfactory for the most part, mainly due to the underpowered Merlin engine, which meant that it could not fly at the higher altitudes needed to avoid enemy fighters, which were becoming increasingly effective throughout 1943.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/> This was answered by the Halifax Mk III, which was powered by [[Bristol Hercules]] [[radial engine]]s in place of the Merlins. Introduced into service in November 1943, the Mk III was first delivered to [[433 Tactical Fighter Squadron|No. 433 Squadron]] and [[No. 466 Squadron RAAF|No. 466 Squadron]].<ref name = \"norris 5 6\">Norris 1966, pp. 5\u20136.</ref> By January 1944, the Hercules-powered Halifax was available in quantity and quickly proved to have superior performance in the face of German fighter defences.<ref name = \"norris 5\"/>\n\nEarly on, Air Chief Marshal [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]], head of Bomber Command, was scathing in his criticism of the Halifax's performance in comparison to the new [[Avro Lancaster]], primarily of its bomb-carrying capability: an average Halifax was calculated to drop 100 tons of bombs in its lifetime, compared to a Lancaster's 154. Harris continued to have a poor opinion of the Halifax, despite the fact that later Hercules-engined machines had lower loss rates and higher crew survival rates after abandoning the aircraft than Lancasters, and came very close to the Lancaster's speed and altitude performance.<ref>Lake, Jon.

But any new facilities were devoted to the Lancaster.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[File:AdRymarz.jpg|thumb|left|View of a Halifax crewmember]]\nHarris's view of the Halifax changed sometime after spring 1942. On 2 June 1942, in a response to a telegram sent by Frederick Handley Page, congratulating Harris on the success of the [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II#First 1.2C000 bomber raid|first 1000 bomber Cologne raid]], he stated: \"My Dear Handley Page. We much appreciate your telegram of congratulation on Saturday night's work, the success of which was very largely due to your support in giving us such a powerful weapon to wield.

Bombing activity became increasingly brazen throughout late 1944 as the ''Luftwaffe'' became incapable of putting up effective opposition against them.<ref name = \"norris 6\"/> The Halifax also found itself being increasingly tasked with transport duties around this time; in one instance, around half a million gallons of petrol was delivered to [[Brussels]] in support of the advancing [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]], then engaged in heavy fighting at [[Arnhem]].<ref name = \"norris 6\"/>\n\nDuring the latter half of 1944, the bombing of German-held oil facilities became a major priority of the offensive.<ref name = \"norris 6\"/> On 27 August, a force of 216 Halifax bombers, alongside smaller numbers of [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s and Lancasters and a sizable escort of [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s, conducted the first major daylight operation by Bomber Command against a target inside Germany that year, attacking the oil refinery at [[Homberg (Duisburg)|Homberg]] on the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]]. In spite of heavy fire from [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft defenses]], no bombers were downed and the refinery was severely damaged in places.<ref name = \"norris 6 8\">Norris 1966, pp. 6, 8.</ref> Attacks upon oil production facilities throughout Germany would become commonplace within the remaining months of the war.<ref name = \"norris 8\"/>\n\n[[File:462 Squadron RAAF aircrew Sept 1942.jpg|thumb|Personnel of [[No. 462 Squadron RAAF|No. 462 Squadron]] operating in [[RAF Middle East Command]], September 1942]]\nThe only [[Victoria Cross]] to be awarded to any Halifax pilot went to Cyril J.

According to Moyes, within the final few months, bomber losses had fallen to all-time lows while raids were frequently regarded as having been highly successful.<ref name = \"norris 8\"/> During the final months of the war the improved Halifax Mk VI and Mk VII were introduced. In particular, these models had been 'tropicalised' with an eye towards their potential use in the [[Pacific War]] against the [[Empire of Japan]].<ref name = \"norris 8\"/> While some of these Mk VI and Mk VII machines were deployed to the theatre, they played little meaningful role as the [[End of World War II in Asia|war ended]] before larger numbers could be brought to bear against Japanese forces.<ref name = \"norris 8 10\">Norris 1966, pp. 8, 10.</ref>\n\nOn 25 April 1945, the Halifax performed its last major operation against the enemy during an attack upon coastal gun batteries on [[Wangerooge]] in the [[Frisian Islands]] of the [[North Sea]].<ref name = \"norris 9\">Norris 1966, p. 9.</ref> While the type continued to fly operations after this, these were primarily diversions to other operations and sporadic, uncoordinated attacks against [[target of opportunity|targets of opportunity]].

The plane was part of RCAF 426 Squadron, and had been shot down near [[Geraardsbergen]] during a raid on [[Leuven|Leuven, Belgium]] on 12 May 1944. During the excavation, the bodies of three crew members were recovered and later given proper burial.

On 24 March 1945 it towed a glider as part of [[Operation Varsity]] \u2013 the airborne operation in support of crossing the Rhine. Completed three supply drops in Norway and Denmark in March and April 1945. On the fourth sortie, 23 April 1945, piloted by Alexander Turnbull, NA337 was sent to drop 13 supply containers and two packages at Mikkelsberget, Norway. After a successful drop, it was hit by flak in the starboard wing at 0131 hours on 24 April. After both starboard engines caught fire, NA337 ditched in [[Mj\u00f8sa|Lake Mj\u00f8sa]] at 0145 hours. All but one crew member, Thomas Weightman, died of hypothermia. It was discovered in 1991 by Tore Marsoe and Rolf Liberg, and further raised in 1995 by Halifax 57 Rescue. Restoration was completed in November 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airforcemuseum.ca/en/special-exhibits/the-story-of-halifax-na337-2p-x-part-1-of-5|title=The Story of Halifax NA337 |publisher=National Air Force Museum of Canada|website=airforcemuseum.ca|language=en-Can|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref>\n|[[File:Halifax NA337 at NAFMC 2015 above.jpg|frameless|100x100px]]\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|HR792\n| [[Elvington, City of York|Elvington, North Yorkshire]]\n|[[Yorkshire Air Museum]]\n|Built by Handley Page. 58 Squadron.

Since its inception in 1994 the organization has recovered two aircraft, including Halifax NA337, one of only three complete examples in the world.\n\nThe organization was founded in 1994 by Karl Kjarsgaard, a Canadian former [[Air Canada]] pilot, and Ian Foster of [[Scotland]]. In 1995 they participated in their first recovery project, that of Halifax NA337 from 750 feet underwater in [[Mj\u00f8sa|Lake Mj\u00f8sa, Norway]]. The aircraft was moved to the [[National Air Force Museum of Canada]] in [[Trenton, Ontario]] where it was unveiled in 2005 after a full restoration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://airforcemuseum.ca/en/special-exhibits/the-story-of-halifax-na337-2p-x-part-1-of-5|title=The Story of Halifax NA337 \u00ab  National Air Force Museum of Canada|website=airforcemuseum.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref> Their second project was the 1997 recovery of Halifax LW682 from a bog near [[Geraardsbergen|Geraardsbergen, Belgium]]. During the recovery, the bodies of three crew members were removed and given a proper burial. Several parts of the aircraft were used in the restoration of NA337, and the airframe was melted down and later used to construct the [[RAF Bomber Command Memorial]] in [[London]], which was unveiled in 2012.<ref name=\"Bomber Command Memorial in London\"/>\n\nAt present, Halifax 57 Rescue is working to recover two aircraft. The first is HR871, located off the coast of [[Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/417498|title=Support the Recovery of a RCAF Halifax Bomber|website=FundRazr|language=en|access-date=2017-06-17}}</ref> Preparations are currently underway for underwater excavation. Once the aircraft has been raised, it will be moved to the [[Bomber Command Museum of Canada]] in [[Nanton, Alberta]] for restoration.

Roosevelt]] proclaimed [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] in Wyoming. He did this to accept a donation of lands acquired by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], for addition to [[Grand Teton National Park]] after Congress had declined to authorize this park expansion. Roosevelt's proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism about use of the Antiquities Act to circumvent Congress. A bill abolishing Jackson Hole National Monument passed Congress but was vetoed by Roosevelt, and Congressional and court challenges to the proclamation authority were mounted. In 1950, Congress finally incorporated most of the monument into Grand Teton National Park, but the act doing so barred further use of the proclamation authority in Wyoming except for areas of 5,000 acres or less.\n\nThe most substantial use of the proclamation authority came in 1978, when President [[Jimmy Carter]] proclaimed 15 new national monuments in Alaska after Congress had adjourned without passing a major Alaska lands bill strongly opposed in that state. Congress passed a revised version of the bill in 1980 incorporating most of these national monuments into national parks and preserves, but the act also curtailed further use of the proclamation authority in Alaska.\n\nThe proclamation authority was not used again anywhere until 1996, when President [[Bill Clinton]] proclaimed the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]] in [[Utah]].

In 1920, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] ruled unanimously that the Grand Canyon was indeed \"an object of historic or scientific interest\" and could be protected by proclamation, setting a precedent for the use of the Antiquities Act to preserve large areas.<ref name=Cameron>[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/252/450/case.html ''Cameron v.

Roosevelt]] proclaimed [[Jackson Hole National Monument]] in Wyoming. He did this to accept a donation of lands acquired by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], for addition to [[Grand Teton National Park]] after Congress had declined to authorize this park expansion. Roosevelt's proclamation unleashed a storm of criticism about use of the Antiquities Act to circumvent Congress. A bill abolishing Jackson Hole National Monument passed Congress but was vetoed by Roosevelt, and Congressional and court challenges to the proclamation authority were mounted. In 1950, Congress finally incorporated most of the monument into Grand Teton National Park, but the act doing so barred further use of the proclamation authority in Wyoming except for areas of 5,000 acres or less.\n\nThe most substantial use of the proclamation authority came in 1978, when President [[Jimmy Carter]] proclaimed 15 new national monuments in Alaska after Congress had adjourned without passing a major Alaska lands bill strongly opposed in that state. Congress passed a revised version of the bill in 1980 incorporating most of these national monuments into national parks and preserves, but the act also curtailed further use of the proclamation authority in Alaska.\n\nThe proclamation authority was not used again anywhere until 1996, when President [[Bill Clinton]] proclaimed the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]] in [[Utah]].
