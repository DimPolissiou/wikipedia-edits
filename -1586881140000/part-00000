The term stands for '''rep'''eated '''unit''' and was coined in 1966 by [[Albert H. Beiler]] in his book ''Recreations in the Theory of Numbers''.{{refn|group=note|Albert H. Beiler coined the term \u201crepunit number\u201d as follows:<blockquote>A number which consists of a repeated of a single digit is sometimes called a monodigit number, and for convenience the author has used the term \u201crepunit number\u201d (repeated unit) to represent monodigit numbers consisting solely of the digit 1.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beiler|2013|pp=83}}</ref></blockquote>}}<!--- Original publication was 1964; did he coin repunit in that edition? or was this added in 1966? --->\n\nA '''repunit prime''' is a repunit that is also a [[prime number]]. Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base-2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base-''b'' representation. The first two repunits base-''b'' for ''n''=1 and ''n''=2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-''10'') repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n\\equiv R_n^{(10)} = {10^n-1\\over{10-1}} = {10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for } n \\ge 1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''10'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base-10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits base-2 are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''2'')</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base-2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 \u00d7 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 \u00d7 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 \u00d7 5 = 5 \u00d7 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base-''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b'' \u2212 1. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2\u00b729\u00b71069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' \u2212 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' \u2212 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' \u2212 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base-''b''.\n* Any number ''x'' is a two-digit repunit in base x \u2212 1.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base-5, 11111 in base-2) and 8191 (111 in base-90, 1111111111111 in base-2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base-''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''\u22121 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1\u2264''i''<''j''\u2264''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' \u2212 ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''\u2212''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''\u2212''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit\u2013Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''\u22121</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base-''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base-''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime. The Euclidean Algorithm is based on ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''gcd''(''m'' \u2212 ''n'', ''n'') for ''m'' > ''n''. Similarly, using ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u2212 ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''m''\u2212''n''</sup> = ''R''<sub>''m''\u2212''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, it can be easily shown that ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''\u2212''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) for ''m'' > ''n''. Therefore if ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''d'', then ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''R<sub>d</sub>''<sup>(''b'')</sup>. \n\n== Factorization of decimal repunits ==\n\n(Prime factors colored {{color|red|red}} means \"new factors\", i. e. the prime factor divides ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> but does not divide ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> for all ''k'' < ''n'') {{OEIS|id=A102380}}<ref>For more information, see [http://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/ Factorization of repunit numbers].</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>1</sub> =||1\n|-\n|''R''<sub>2</sub> =||{{color|red|11}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>3</sub> =||{{color|red|3}} \u00b7 {{color|red|37}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>4</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|101}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>5</sub> =||{{color|red|41}} \u00b7 {{color|red|271}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>6</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|7}} \u00b7 11 \u00b7 {{color|red|13}} \u00b7 37\n|-\n|''R''<sub>7</sub> =||{{color|red|239}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4649}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>8</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|73}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|137}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>9</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|333667}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>10</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|9091}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>11</sub> =||{{color|red|21649}} \u00b7 {{color|red|513239}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>12</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|9901}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>13</sub> =||{{color|red|53}} \u00b7 {{color|red|79}} \u00b7 {{color|red|265371653}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>14</sub> =||11 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|909091}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>15</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|31}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2906161}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>16</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|17}} \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 {{color|red|5882353}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>17</sub> =||{{color|red|2071723}} \u00b7 {{color|red|5363222357}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>18</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 {{color|red|19}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|52579}} \u00b7 333667\n|-\n|''R''<sub>19</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|19|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>20</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|3541}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 {{color|red|27961}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>21</sub> =||3 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|43}} \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|1933}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|10838689}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>22</sub> =||11<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 {{color|red|23}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4093}} \u00b7 {{color|red|8779}} \u00b7 21649 \u00b7 513239\n|-\n|''R''<sub>23</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|23|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>24</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 9901 \u00b7 {{color|red|99990001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>25</sub> =||41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|21401}} \u00b7 {{color|red|25601}} \u00b7 {{color|red|182521213001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>26</sub> =||11 \u00b7 53 \u00b7 79 \u00b7 {{color|red|859}} \u00b7 265371653 \u00b7 {{color|red|1058313049}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>27</sub> =||3<sup>3</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|757}} \u00b7 333667 \u00b7 {{color|red|440334654777631}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>28</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|29}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|281}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 909091 \u00b7 {{color|red|121499449}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>29</sub> =||{{color|red|3191}} \u00b7 {{color|red|16763}} \u00b7 {{color|red|43037}} \u00b7 {{color|red|62003}} \u00b7 {{color|red|77843839397}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>30</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 {{color|red|211}} \u00b7 {{color|red|241}} \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2161}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 2906161\n|}\n|}\n\nSmallest prime factor of ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > 1 are\n:11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 239, 11, 3, 11, 21649, 3, 53, 11, 3, 11, 2071723, 3, 1111111111111111111, 11, 3, 11, 11111111111111111111111, 3, 41, 11, 3, 11, 3191, 3, 2791, 11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 2028119, 11, 3, 11, 83, 3, 173, 11, 3, 11, 35121409, 3, 239, 11, ... {{OEIS|id=A067063}}\n\n==Repunit primes==\nThe definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for [[integer factorization|prime factors]] of such numbers.\n\nIt is easy to show that if ''n'' is divisible by ''a'', then ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> is divisible by ''R''<sub>''a''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>:\n\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}=\\frac{1}{b-1}\\prod_{d|n}\\Phi_d(b),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi_d(x)</math> is the <math>d^\\mathrm{th}</math> [[cyclotomic polynomial]] and ''d'' ranges over the divisors of ''n''.

If ''n'' is a [[prime power]] (can be written as ''p''<sup>''r''</sup>, with ''p'' prime, ''r'' integer, ''p'', ''r'' >0), then all repunit in base-''b'' are not prime aside from ''R<sub>p</sub>'' and ''R<sub>2</sub>''. ''R<sub>p</sub>'' can be either prime or composite, the former examples, ''b'' = \u2212216, \u2212128, 4, 8, 16, 27, 36, 100, 128, 256, etc., the latter examples, ''b'' = \u2212243, \u2212125, \u221264, \u221232, \u221227, \u22128, 9, 25, 32, 49, 81, 121, 125, 144, 169, 196, 216, 225, 243, 289, etc., and ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can be prime (when ''p'' differs from 2) only if ''b'' is negative, a power of \u22122, for example, ''b'' = \u22128, \u221232, \u2212128, \u22128192, etc., in fact, the ''R<sub>2</sub>'' can also be composite, for example, ''b'' = \u2212512, \u22122048, \u221232768, etc. If ''n'' is not a prime power, then no base-''b'' repunit prime exists, for example, ''b'' = 64, 729 (with ''n'' = 6), ''b'' = 1024 (with ''n'' = 10), and ''b'' = \u22121 or 0 (with ''n'' any natural number). Another special situation is ''b'' = \u22124''k''<sup>4</sup>, with ''k'' positive integer, which has the [[aurifeuillean factorization]], for example, ''b'' = \u22124 (with ''k'' = 1, then ''R<sub>2</sub>'' and ''R<sub>3</sub>'' are primes), and ''b'' = \u221264, \u2212324, \u22121024, \u22122500, \u22125184, ...

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240\u2013246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\n[[D. R. Kaprekar]] has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaprekar|1938}}, {{Harvnb|Gunjikar and Kaprekar|1939}}</ref> \nThey are named after [[Demlo]] railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then [[G.I.P. Railway]], where Kaprekar started investigating them.\nHe calls ''Wonderful Demlo numbers'' those of the form 1, 121, 12321, 1234321, ..., 12345678987654321. The fact that these are the squares of the repunits has led some authors to call Demlo numbers the infinite sequence of these<ref>{{MathWorld |title= Demlo Number |urlname=DemloNumber}}</ref>, 1, 121, 12321, ..., 12345678987654321, 1234567900987654321, 123456790120987654321, ..., {{OEIS|id=A002477}}, although one can check these are not Demlo numbers for ''p'' = 10, 19, 28, ...\n==See also==\n* [[All one polynomial]] - Another generalization\n* [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]]\n* [[Repeating decimal]]\n* [[Repdigit]]\n* [[Wagstaff prime]] - can be thought of as repunit primes with [[negative base]] <math>b = -2</math>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n|last=Beiler\n|first=Albert H.\n|author-link=Albert Beiler\n|orig-year=1964\n|date=2013\n|title=Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains\n|publisher=Dover Publications\n|location=New York\n|edition=2nd Revised\n|series=Dover Recreational Math\n|url={{Google books|NbbbL9gMJ88C|Recreations in the theory of numbers|plainurl=yes}}\n|isbn=978-0-486-21096-4\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Dickson\n|first=Leonard Eugene\n|author-link=Leonard Eugene Dickson\n|last2=Cresse\n|first2=G.H.\n|author2-link=G.

The term stands for '''rep'''eated '''unit''' and was coined in 1966 by [[Albert H. Beiler]] in his book ''Recreations in the Theory of Numbers''.{{refn|group=note|Albert H. Beiler coined the term \u201crepunit number\u201d as follows:<blockquote>A number which consists of a repeated of a single digit is sometimes called a monodigit number, and for convenience the author has used the term \u201crepunit number\u201d (repeated unit) to represent monodigit numbers consisting solely of the digit 1.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beiler|2013|pp=83}}</ref></blockquote>}}<!--- Original publication was 1964; did he coin repunit in that edition? or was this added in 1966? --->\n\nA '''repunit prime''' is a repunit that is also a [[prime number]]. Primes that are repunits in [[Binary number|base 2]] are [[Mersenne prime]]s.\n\n== Definition ==\n\nThe base-''b'' repunits are defined as (this ''b'' can be either positive or negative)\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}\\equiv 1 + b + b^2 + \\cdots + b^{n-1} = {b^n-1\\over{b-1}}\\qquad\\mbox{for }|b|\\ge2, n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(b)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base b representation. The first two repunits base ''b'' for ''n''=1 and ''n''=2 are \n:<math>R_1^{(b)}={b-1\\over{b-1}}= 1 \\qquad \\text{and} \\qquad R_2^{(b)}={b^2-1\\over{b-1}}= b+1\\qquad\\text{for}\\ |b|\\ge2.</math>\n\nIn particular, the ''[[decimal]] (base-10) repunits'' that are often referred to as simply ''repunits'' are defined as\n:<math>R_n\\equiv R_n^{(10)}={10^n-1\\over{10-1}}={10^n-1\\over9}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(10)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 10 representation. The sequence of repunits base 10 starts with\n: [[1 (number)|1]], [[11 (number)|11]], [[111 (number)|111]], 1111, 11111, 111111, ... {{OEIS|A002275}}.\n\nSimilarly, the repunits [[base 2]] are defined as\n:<math>R_n^{(2)}={2^n-1\\over{2-1}}={2^n-1}\\qquad\\mbox{for }n\\ge1.</math>\nThus, the number ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>''(2)''</sup> consists of ''n'' copies of the digit 1 in base 2 representation. In fact, the base-2 repunits are the well-known [[Mersenne prime|Mersenne number]]s ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1, they start with\n:1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127, 255, 511, 1023, 2047, 4095, 8191, 16383, 32767, 65535, ... {{OEIS|id=A000225}}.\n\n== Properties ==\n* Any repunit in any base having a composite number of digits is necessarily composite.  Only repunits (in any base) having a prime number of digits might be prime. This is a necessary but not sufficient condition.  For example,\n*: ''R''<sub>35</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = {{loop|35|1}} = 11111 \u00d7 1000010000100001000010000100001 = 1111111 \u00d7 10000001000000100000010000001,\n:since 35 = 7 \u00d7 5 = 5 \u00d7 7.  This repunit factorization does not depend on the base ''b'' in which the repunit is expressed.\n* If ''p'' is an odd prime, then every prime ''q'' that divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> must be either 1 plus a multiple of 2''p,'' or a factor of ''b - 1''. For example, a prime factor of ''R''<sub>29</sub> is 62003 = 1 + 2\u00b729\u00b71069. The reason is that the prime ''p'' is the smallest exponent greater than 1 such that ''q'' divides ''b<sup>p</sup>'' &minus; 1, because ''p'' is prime. Therefore, unless ''q'' divides ''b'' - 1, [[Carmichael function#Order of elements modulo n|''p'' divides the Carmichael function]] of ''q'', which is even and equal to ''q'' &minus; 1. \n*Any positive multiple of the repunit ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> contains at least ''n'' nonzero digits in base ''b''.\n* Any number ''x'' is a two-digit repunit in base x - 1.\n* The only known numbers that are repunits with at least 3 digits in more than one base simultaneously are 31 (111 in base 5, 11111 in base 2) and 8191 (111 in base 90, 1111111111111 in base 2). The [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]] says there are only these two cases.\n* Using the [[pigeon-hole principle]] it can be easily shown that for each ''n'' and ''b'' such that ''n''  and ''b'' are [[Coprime integers|relatively prime]] there exists a repunit in base ''b'' that is a multiple of ''n''. To see this consider repunits ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>,...,''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>. Because there are ''n'' repunits but only ''n''-1 non-zero residues modulo ''n'' there exist two repunits ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> with 1\u2264''i''<''j''\u2264''n'' such that ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the same residue modulo ''n''. It follows that ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> has residue 0 modulo ''n'', i.e. is divisible by ''n''. ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> consists of ''j'' - ''i'' ones followed by ''i'' zeroes. Thus, ''R''<sub>''j''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>  x ''b''<sup>''i''</sup> . Since ''n'' divides the left-hand side it also divides the right-hand side and since ''n'' and ''b'' are relatively prime ''n'' must divide ''R''<sub>''j''-''i''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>.\n* The [[Feit\u2013Thompson conjecture]] is that ''R''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>(''p'')</sup> never divides ''R''<sub>''p''</sub><sup>(''q'')</sup> for two distinct primes ''p'' and ''q''.\n* Using the [[Euclidean Algorithm]] for repunits definition: ''R''<sub>1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = 1; ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> = ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> x ''b'' + 1, any consecutive repunits ''R''<sub>''n''-1</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime in any base ''b'' for any ''n''.\n* If ''m'' and ''n'' have a common divisor ''d'', ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> have the common divisor ''R''<sub>''d''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> in any base ''b'' for any ''m'' and ''n''. That is, the repunits of a fixed base form a [[Divisibility sequence|strong divisibility sequence]]. As a consequence, If ''m'' and ''n'' are relatively prime, ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> and ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> are relatively prime. The Euclidean Algorithm is based on ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''gcd''(''m'' - ''n'', ''n'') for ''m'' > ''n''. Similarly, using ''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> - ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> \u00d7 ''b''<sup>''m''-''n''</sup> = ''R''<sub>''m''-''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, it can be easily shown that ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''-''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) for ''m'' > ''n''. Therefore if ''gcd''(''m'', ''n'') = ''d'', then ''gcd''(''R''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>, ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>) = ''R<sub>d</sub>''<sup>(''b'')</sup>. \n\n== Factorization of decimal repunits ==\n\n(Prime factors colored {{color|red|red}} means \"new factors\", i. e. the prime factor divides ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> but does not divide ''R''<sub>''k''</sub> for all ''k'' < ''n'') {{OEIS|id=A102380}}<ref>For more information, see [http://stdkmd.net/nrr/repunit/ Factorization of repunit numbers].</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>1</sub> =||1\n|-\n|''R''<sub>2</sub> =||{{color|red|11}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>3</sub> =||{{color|red|3}} \u00b7 {{color|red|37}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>4</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|101}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>5</sub> =||{{color|red|41}} \u00b7 {{color|red|271}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>6</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|7}} \u00b7 11 \u00b7 {{color|red|13}} \u00b7 37\n|-\n|''R''<sub>7</sub> =||{{color|red|239}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4649}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>8</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|73}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|137}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>9</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|333667}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>10</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|9091}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>11</sub> =||{{color|red|21649}} \u00b7 {{color|red|513239}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>12</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 {{color|red|9901}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>13</sub> =||{{color|red|53}} \u00b7 {{color|red|79}} \u00b7 {{color|red|265371653}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>14</sub> =||11 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|909091}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>15</sub> =||3 \u00b7 {{color|red|31}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2906161}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>16</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|17}} \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 {{color|red|5882353}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>17</sub> =||{{color|red|2071723}} \u00b7 {{color|red|5363222357}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>18</sub> =||3<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 {{color|red|19}} \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|52579}} \u00b7 333667\n|-\n|''R''<sub>19</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|19|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>20</sub> =||11 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|3541}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 {{color|red|27961}}\n|}\n||\n{|\n|-\n|''R''<sub>21</sub> =||3 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|43}} \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|1933}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 {{color|red|10838689}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>22</sub> =||11<sup>2</sup> \u00b7 {{color|red|23}} \u00b7 {{color|red|4093}} \u00b7 {{color|red|8779}} \u00b7 21649 \u00b7 513239\n|-\n|''R''<sub>23</sub> =||{{color|red|{{loop|23|1}}}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>24</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 73 \u00b7 101 \u00b7 137 \u00b7 9901 \u00b7 {{color|red|99990001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>25</sub> =||41 \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|21401}} \u00b7 {{color|red|25601}} \u00b7 {{color|red|182521213001}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>26</sub> =||11 \u00b7 53 \u00b7 79 \u00b7 {{color|red|859}} \u00b7 265371653 \u00b7 {{color|red|1058313049}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>27</sub> =||3<sup>3</sup> \u00b7 37 \u00b7 {{color|red|757}} \u00b7 333667 \u00b7 {{color|red|440334654777631}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>28</sub> =||11 \u00b7 {{color|red|29}} \u00b7 101 \u00b7 239 \u00b7 {{color|red|281}} \u00b7 4649 \u00b7 909091 \u00b7 {{color|red|121499449}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>29</sub> =||{{color|red|3191}} \u00b7 {{color|red|16763}} \u00b7 {{color|red|43037}} \u00b7 {{color|red|62003}} \u00b7 {{color|red|77843839397}}\n|-\n|''R''<sub>30</sub> =||3 \u00b7 7 \u00b7 11 \u00b7 13 \u00b7 31 \u00b7 37 \u00b7 41 \u00b7 {{color|red|211}} \u00b7 {{color|red|241}} \u00b7 271 \u00b7 {{color|red|2161}} \u00b7 9091 \u00b7 2906161\n|}\n|}\n\nSmallest prime factor of ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> for ''n'' > 1 are\n:11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 239, 11, 3, 11, 21649, 3, 53, 11, 3, 11, 2071723, 3, 1111111111111111111, 11, 3, 11, 11111111111111111111111, 3, 41, 11, 3, 11, 3191, 3, 2791, 11, 3, 11, 41, 3, 2028119, 11, 3, 11, 83, 3, 173, 11, 3, 11, 35121409, 3, 239, 11, ... {{OEIS|id=A067063}}\n\n==Repunit primes==\nThe definition of repunits was motivated by recreational mathematicians looking for [[integer factorization|prime factors]] of such numbers.\n\nIt is easy to show that if ''n'' is divisible by ''a'', then ''R''<sub>''n''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup> is divisible by ''R''<sub>''a''</sub><sup>(''b'')</sup>:\n\n:<math>R_n^{(b)}=\\frac{1}{b-1}\\prod_{d|n}\\Phi_d(b),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Phi_d(x)</math> is the <math>d^\\mathrm{th}</math> [[cyclotomic polynomial]] and ''d'' ranges over the divisors of ''n''.

Tables of the period of reciprocal of primes up to 60,000 had been published by 1860 and permitted the [[integer factorization|factorization]] by such mathematicians as Reuschle of all repunits up to ''R<sub>16</sub>'' and many larger ones. By 1880, even ''R<sub>17</sub>'' to ''R<sub>36</sub>'' had been factored<ref name=\"Dickson1999\" /> and it is curious that, though [[\u00c9douard Lucas]] showed no prime below three million had period [[19 (number)|nineteen]], there was no attempt to test any repunit for primality until early in the twentieth century. The American mathematician Oscar Hoppe proved ''R<sub>19</sub>'' to be prime in 1916<ref>{{Harvnb|Francis|1988|pp=240\u2013246}}</ref> and Lehmer and Kraitchik independently found ''R<sub>23</sub>'' to be prime in 1929.\n\nFurther advances in the study of repunits did not occur until the 1960s, when computers allowed many new factors of repunits to be found and the gaps in earlier tables of prime periods corrected. ''R<sub>317</sub>'' was found to be a [[probable prime]] circa 1966 and was proved prime eleven years later, when ''R<sub>1031</sub>'' was shown to be the only further possible prime repunit with fewer than ten thousand digits. It was proven prime in 1986, but searches for further prime repunits in the following decade consistently failed. However, there was a major side-development in the field of generalized repunits, which produced a large number of new primes and probable primes.\n\nSince 1999, four further probably prime repunits have been found, but it is unlikely that any of them will be proven prime in the foreseeable future because of their huge size.\n\nThe [[Cunningham project]] endeavours to document the integer factorizations of (among other numbers) the repunits to base 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12.\n\n== Demlo numbers ==\n[[D. R. Kaprekar]] has defined Demlo numbers as concatenation of a left, middle and right part, where the left and right part must be of the same length (up to a possible leading zero to the left) and must add up to a repdigit number, and the middle part may contain any additional number of this repeated digit.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kaprekar|1938}}, {{Harvnb|Gunjikar and Kaprekar|1939}}</ref> \nThey are named after [[Demlo]] railway station 30 miles from Bombay on the then [[G.I.P. Railway]], where Kaprekar started investigating them.\nHe calls ''Wonderful Demlo numbers'' those of the form 1, 121, 12321, 1234321, ..., 12345678987654321. The fact that these are the squares of the repunits has led some authors to call Demlo numbers the infinite sequence of these<ref>{{MathWorld |title= Demlo Number |urlname=DemloNumber}}</ref>, 1, 121, 12321, ..., 12345678987654321, 1234567900987654321, 123456790120987654321, ..., {{OEIS|id=A002477}}, although one can check these are not Demlo numbers for ''p'' = 10, 19, 28, ...\n==See also==\n* [[All one polynomial]] - Another generalization\n* [[Goormaghtigh conjecture]]\n* [[Repeating decimal]]\n* [[Repdigit]]\n* [[Wagstaff prime]] - can be thought of as repunit primes with [[negative base]] <math>b=-2</math>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n=== Notes ===\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Citation\n|last=Beiler\n|first=Albert H.\n|author-link=Albert Beiler\n|orig-year=1964\n|date=2013\n|title=Recreations in the Theory of Numbers: The Queen of Mathematics Entertains\n|publisher=Dover Publications\n|location=New York\n|edition=2nd Revised\n|series=Dover Recreational Math\n|url={{Google books|NbbbL9gMJ88C|Recreations in the theory of numbers|plainurl=yes}}\n|isbn=978-0-486-21096-4\n}}\n*{{Citation\n|last=Dickson\n|first=Leonard Eugene\n|author-link=Leonard Eugene Dickson\n|last2=Cresse\n|first2=G.H.\n|author2-link=G.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

If proven to be a leech, it would be the oldest in the fossil record.]]\nPrior to the discovery of the Waukesha Biota, very little was known about the soft-bodied animals that were sure to have lived in the Silurian seas. Thanks to the famous [[Burgess Shale]] of the [[Canadian Rockies]], we knew that the seas were already teaming with soft-bodied and lightly skeletonized animals as far back as the [[Cambrian]], yet relatively few were known to be preserved in later [[Paleozoic]] rocks. This is because the fossil record is greatly skewed toward biomineralized skeletal remains. The announcement of the Waukesha Biota in 1985 thus marked a major turning point in our knowledge of Silurian life. In his popular book, ''Wonderful Life'', [[Stephen Jay Gould]] compared the \"anatomical disparity\" of the Burgess Shale with that of only five other occurrences in the world \u2013one of which was the Waukesha Biota, which he referred to as the \"Brandon Bridge fauna\"\u2013 and none of the others were Silurian.<ref name=Gould1989>{{cite book |last=Gould  |first=S.J. |title=Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History |date=1989 |publisher=W.W.

It is a true bantam, and has no full-sized counterpart; males weigh about 700 grams and hens about 600 g. The Barbu d'Anvers is one of the oldest bantam breeds, and is thought to have originated in the [[province of Antwerp]] ({{lang-fr|{{noitalic|Anvers}}}}) in northern [[Flanders]]. It is the only Belgian bantam breed not threatened with extinction. In the United States it may be called the '''Antwerp Belgian''' or '''Belgian Bearded d'Anvers'''.\n\n==History==\n\nThe Barbu d'Anvers is among the oldest bantam breeds, and derives from small bearded chickens of the [[Low Countries]] similar to those depicted in the paintings of [[Aelbert Cuyp]] in the seventeenth century.{{r|moula|page=56}} The first reliable written mention of it dates from 1858, and the first description is that of [[Victor La Perre De Roo]] in 1882. From about 1890 there was growing interest in the breed, and by 1910 the Club Avicole du Barbu Nain, the breeder's club, had nearly five hundred members.{{r|moula|page=56}}\n\nIt is the only Belgian bantam breed not threatened with extinction. A census in 2005 found 1500 birds.{{r|moula|page=56}}\n\nThe Barbu d'Anvers has a tail-less variant, the [[Barbu de Grubbe]], and is the predecessor of other Belgian bantam breeds such as the [[Barbu d'Uccle]] and the [[Barbu d'Everberg]].{{r|moula|page=56}} It was included the [[Standard of Perfection]] of the [[American Poultry Association]] in 1949.{{r|apa}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n\nThe Barbu d'Anvers is a diminutive bird with a large, round breast that juts forward, and an arching tail. As its name implies, it has a profuse beard of feathers that covers the earlobes. It has a small rose [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] and small or non-existent [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. In Belgium 29 colour varieties of plumage are recognised;{{r|moula|page=56}} in Germany there are six more.{{r|ee}}\n\n==Use==\n\nThe Barbu d'Anvers is a purely ornamental breed, kept either as a pet or by [[Animal fancy|poultry fanciers]] for [[Livestock show|showing]]. Hens lay small creamy white [[Egg (food)|eggs]] usually weighing less than {{nobreak|35 g;}} they are good mothers and good [[Broodiness|sitters]].{{r|moula|page=56}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=apa>[https://web.archive.org/web/20171104135004/http://www.amerpoultryassn.com/PDF%20Forms/APA%20Recognized%20Breeds%20and%20Varieties%20Sept2012.pdf APA Recognized Breeds and Varieties: As of January 1, 2012].

The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[cooperative gameplay|multiplayer]] game in which a group of players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperates]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nMost of Rare's employees worked on the title and the game was first conceptualized in 2014. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. Microsoft declared the game the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

Joe Neate, the game's executive director, described the game as an \"improv\" comedy, and added that the game is about going \"off-script\".<ref name=\"friendliest\"/> Rare shaped the world and the game's lore to reflect players' actions, including various [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s to celebrate their actions or achievements. The team believed that if a narrative campaign is included, incorporating players' actions into the game's lore would become difficult.<ref name=\"friendliest\"/><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/>\n\nThe company explored different settings for the game, such as [[vampire]]s and [[dinosaur]]s, though it eventually settled on the [[piracy|pirate]] theme because it matched the game's core concept which encourages cooperation. Rare also saw less competition in the market.{{efn|Duncan elaborated that the team was thankful that they did not chose dinosaur as the setting due to the release of ''[[Ark: Survival Evolved]]'' (2017)}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/19/rare-considered-vampire-dinosaur-themes-for-sea-of-thieves-a-ign-unfiltered|title=Rare Considered Vampire, Dinosaur Themes for Sea of Thieves \u2014 IGN Unfiltered|first=Alex|last=Osborn|work=[[IGN]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The pirate theme allows players to have the freedom to do what they want in the game's world and decide freely how they want to play and behave. The team looked at various sources for inspiration, including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[Black Sails (TV series)|Black Sails]]''. Designer Mike Chapman believed a lot of parallels can be drawn between ''Sea of Thieves'' and ''[[The Goonies]]'', in which a group of friends bond together while they search for treasure, creating a journey that all of them would fondly remember.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Neate added that the game's goal was to evoke \"[a] sense of travel and exploration and discovery\".<ref name=\"voice\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/17971710/sea-of-thieves-lore-forsaken-shores-cursed-sails-worldbuilding|title=Sea of Thieves\u2019 lore is surprisingly deep, silly and refreshing|first=Cass|last=Marshall|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=22 October 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The team implemented the \"infinite pirate generator\" instead of allowing players to customize their avatar as they feared that some players would create \"abominations\" that would not have fit the game's visual style.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/317084/How_Rare_designed_Sea_of_Thieves_infinite_pirate_generator.php|title=How Rare designed Sea of Thieves' infinite pirate generator|first=Jack|last=Yarwood|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=27 April 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> The game features a stylized visual style with hand-painted textures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1025015/Visual-Adventures-on-Sea-of|title=Visual Adventures on 'Sea of Thieves'|work=GDC Vault|first=Ryan|last=Stevenson|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Duncan added that the team chose this painted art style because they wanted it to be \"timeless\" and reflect the  \"joyful\" and \"delightful\" game world.<ref name=\"art\"/>\n\n===Gameplay design===\n\nRare noticed that in many multiplayer games, experienced players would focus on grinding for endgame content instead of playing with other players, while novice players would worry about their progression lagging significantly behind more experienced players. Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently.{{efn|Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ships every 15 minutes to half an hour.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]]. Players need to exercise their [[common sense]] in order to solve the challenges: for instance, players need to learn to read maps. To encourage players to develop these skills, the game does not feature a beginner's [[tutorial]] as the team wanted players to discover the game's mechanics by themselves.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> The team also intentionally avoided setting gameplay rules to encourage players to utilize their creativity.<ref name=\"solo play\">{{cite web|url=https://www.mcvuk.com/development-news/when-we-made-sea-of-thieves/|title=When We Made\u2026 Sea of Thieves|first=Marie|last=Dealessandri|work=[[MCVUK]]|date=20 June 2019|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Despite this, Rare also included [[emergent gameplay]] in a more systemic manner by introducing shipwrecks and fonts that players can discover. Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other.

The player assumes the role of a pirate who completes voyages from different trading companies to become the ultimate pirate legend. ''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person perspective|first-person]] [[cooperative gameplay|multiplayer]] game in which a group of players [[cooperative gameplay|cooperates]] with each other to explore an [[open world]] via a pirate ship. The game is described as a \"shared world adventure game\", which means groups of players will encounter each other regularly during their adventures.\n\nMost of Rare's employees worked on the title and the game was first conceptualized in 2014. The game was inspired by players of [[personal computer|PC]] games such as ''[[Eve Online]]'', ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' and ''[[Rust (video game)|Rust]]'', who used the tools provided by these games to create their own personal stories. The company explored different settings for the game, such as vampires and dinosaurs, though it eventually settled on the pirate theme, drawing inspirations from films including ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' and ''[[The Goonies]]''. The game features a progression system that only unlocks cosmetic items as the development team wanted to encourage both casual and experienced players to play together. Compared to Rare's other games, ''Sea of Thieves''{{'s}} development process was more transparent, with Rare inviting fans to test the game's early builds.\n\nMicrosoft released the game in March 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]; it was also one of the earliest [[first-party]] games released for [[Xbox Game Pass]] subscribers. The game received generally mixed reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's ship combat, multiplayer gameplay, visuals, and game physics. Criticisms were directed at the game's lack of content, progression, and shallow gameplay. Rare envisioned the title as a \"[[game as a service]]\" and released numerous content updates after the game's release. The game is a commercial success and has attracted more than 10 million players as of January 2020. Microsoft declared the game the most successful new [[intellectual property]] (IP) they have released in the [[Eighth generation of video game consoles|generation]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sea of Thieves gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In this gameplay screenshot, the player is firing cannonballs at a hostile pirate ship, which is controlled by another group of players.]]\n\n''Sea of Thieves'' is a [[first-person (video games)|first-person]] [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game.

Joe Neate, the game's executive director, described the game as an \"improv\" comedy, and added that the game is about going \"off-script\".<ref name=\"friendliest\"/> Rare shaped the world and the game's lore to reflect players' actions, including various [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]]s to celebrate their actions or achievements.

Therefore, the team introduced \"horizontal progression\", in which players would only earn cosmetic items as they achieve a higher rank; all items have the same attributes, so endgame content would not confer gameplay bonuses to experienced players. This progression system encourages more experienced players to assist novice players when they are completing voyages, and reduce the gap between the two experience levels.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamesradar.com/sea-of-thieves-has-fully-embraced-power-levelling-according-to-the-design-director-its-not-what-you-think/|title=Sea of Thieves 'fully embraces' power levelling, according to the design director (it's not what you think)|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=28 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> As a \"shared world\" adventure game, Rare opted to maintain the distance between each player group in a server rather than limiting the number of players a server can accommodate, so that players get to encounter other players regularly but not too frequently.{{efn|Chapman estimated that a player will see another player-controlled ships every 15 minutes to half an hour.}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/13/sea-of-thieves-doesnt-have-a-maximum-or-minimum-server-size|title=Sea of Thieves Has a Very Smart Approach to Server Size|first=Joe|last=Skrebels|work=[[IGN]]|date=13 February 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay was designed to test the player's [[soft skills]].

Chapman described these locations of interest as the \"catalyst for stories\" which draw different players together, fostering cooperation or competition. Being attacked by [[sea monster]]s also add a layer of unpredictability to the game as these encounters are random.<ref name=\"DigitalTrend making\"/> Due to the emergent gameplay, ''Sea of Thieves'' was also considered as a \"watachable and sharable game\", and the team hoped that this will lure players who watched the game on [[video game live streaming]] platforms such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] or [[Mixer (service)|Mixer]] to purchase it.<ref name=\"Watchable game\"/>\n\nWhile the game allows solo play, the game is designed to be a multiplayer game in which players cooperate with each other.

Jordan Devore from ''[[Destructoid]]'' noted that with a full crew, the game could get chaotic and situations could turn volatile very quickly. He added that cooperation with strangers could create unforgettable experiences for players which could be deeply satisfying.<ref name=\"DestructRev\"/> Peter Brown from ''[[GameSpot]]'' also enjoyed coordinating with other players and goofing around, though he remarked that some players were [[trolling]] others which caused the experience to be frustrating.<ref name=\"GSpotRev\"/> Jeff Grubb from ''[[VentureBeat]]'' also enjoyed the game, saying that playing with strangers often created numerous hilarious moments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/20/sea-of-thieves-is-mesmerizing-and-hilarious/|title=Sea of Thieves is mesmerizing and hilarious|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=20 March 2018|accessdate=25 March 2020}}</ref> Kyle Hilliard from ''[[Game Informer]]'' stated that each session \"results in a story\" due to the emergent gameplay, and praised Rare for successfully creating an excellent \"pirate simulator\" and \"manufacturing a digital playground that is fun to explore\".<ref name=\"GIRev\"/>  Sam Loveridge from ''[[GamesRadar]]'' likewise commented that the game is \"an anecdote generator at its very best\" due to its emergent storytelling.<ref name=\"GRadarRev\"/> Brandin Tyrrel from ''[[IGN]]'' stated that \"''Sea of Thieves'' works well when treated like a [[chat room]] or a [[party game]], where it serves as catalyst for having a good time with the people you\u2019re with\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Tyrell |first=Brandin |date=27 March 2018 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/28/sea-of-thieves-review |title=Sea of Thieves Review |website=[[IGN]] |accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay received generally negative reviews.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

Although Lincoln believed this was not within Congress's power, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature.

However, Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor [[Horace Greeley]] of the ''New York Tribune'' agreed.<ref name= McPherson1992/>{{rp|124}} Lincoln rejected this argument directly in his letter of August 22, 1862.

Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

He is best known for his 1971 novel ''[[Grendel (novel)|Grendel]]'', a retelling of the [[Beowulf]] myth from the monster's point of view.\n\n==Early life and education==\nGardner was born in [[Batavia, New York]]. His father was a lay preacher and dairy farmer, and his mother taught English at a local school. Both parents were fond of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and often recited literature together.  He was active in the Boy Scouts of America and achieved the Eagle Scout rank. As a child, Gardner attended public school and worked on his father's farm, where, in April 1945, his younger brother Gilbert was killed in an accident with a [[cultipacker]].  Gardner, who was driving the tractor during the fatal accident, carried guilt for his brother's death throughout his life, suffering nightmares and flashbacks.  The incident informed much of Gardner's fiction and criticism \u2014 most directly in the 1977 short story \"Redemption,\" which included a fictionalized recounting of the accident as an impetus for artistic inspiration.<ref>{{cite book | editor = Allan Chavkin | title = Conversations with John Gardner | publisher = University Press of Mississippi | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-87805-422-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/conversationswit0000gard }}</ref>\n\nGardner began his university education at [[DePauw University]], but received his undergraduate degree from [[Washington University in St. Louis]] in 1955.

He was famously obsessive with his work, and acquired a reputation for advanced craft, smooth rhythms, and careful attention to the continuity of the fictive dream.  His books nearly always touched on the redemptive power of art.\n\nIn 1978, Gardner's book of literary criticism, ''[[On Moral Fiction]]'', sparked a controversy that excited the mainstream media, vaulting Gardner into the spotlight with an interview on ''[[The Dick Cavett Show]]'' (May 16, 1978) and a cover story in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (July, 1979).<ref>[http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/john-gardner-pugilist-at-rest/ John Gardner, Pugilist at Rest]</ref>  His judgments of contemporary authors\u2014including such luminaries of American fiction as [[John Updike]] and [[John Barth]]\u2014which could be termed either direct, courageous, or unflattering, depending on one's perspective\u2014harmed his reputation among fellow writers and book reviewers. Gardner claimed that lingering animosity from critics of this book led to unflattering  reviews of what turned out to be his last finished novel, ''[[Mickelsson's Ghosts]]'', although literary critics later praised the book. What was seemingly lost in the furor over ''[[On Moral Fiction]]'' was Gardner's central thesis: that fiction should distinguish right from wrong.\n\n[[Gore Vidal]] found the book, as well as Gardner's novels, sanctimonious and pedantic, and called Gardner the \"late apostle to the lowbrows, a sort of Christian evangelical who saw Heaven as a paradigmatic American university.\"<ref>Vidal, Gore (1986) [http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/1000/vidal/essay.html \"Calvino's Death.\"] From ''The Essential Gore Vidal''.</ref>\n\nGardner inspired and, according to [[Raymond Carver]], sometimes intimidated his students. At [[Chico State College]] (where he taught from 1959 to 1962), when Carver mentioned to Gardner that he had not liked the assigned short story, [[Robert Penn Warren]]'s \"Blackberry Winter,\" Gardner said, \"You'd better read it again.\"  \"And he wasn't joking\", said Carver, who related this anecdote in his foreword to Gardner's book ''On Becoming a Novelist''.  In that foreword, he makes it clear how much he respected Gardner and also relates his kindness as a writing mentor.\n\nIn addition to Chico State, Gardner taught at [[Oberlin College]] (1958-1959), [[San Francisco State College]] (1962-1965), [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (1965-1974) and [[Binghamton University]] (1976-1982).<ref name=genesee/>\n\n==Scholarship==\nIn 1977, Gardner published ''The Life and Times of Chaucer''.  In a review in the October 1977 issue of ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Sumner J. Ferris pointed to several passages that were allegedly lifted either in whole or in part from work by other authors without proper citation.  Ferris charitably suggested that Gardner had published the book too hastily, but on April 10, 1978, reviewer [[Peter S. Prescott|Peter Prescott]], writing in ''[[Newsweek]]'', cited the ''Speculum'' article and accused Gardner of [[plagiarism]], a claim that Gardner met \"with a sigh.\"<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3394/the-art-of-fiction-no-73-john-gardner John Gardner, The Art of Fiction No. 73]</ref>\n\nHe is the author of the famous saying : \"There are only two plots in all literature : a person goes on a journey, a stranger comes to town\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/05/06/two-plots/|title=There Are Only Two Plots: (1) A Person Goes on a Journey (2) A Stranger Comes to Town {{!}} Quote Investigator|last=garson|access-date=2017-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Health problems==\nOn December 10, 1977, Gardner was hospitalized with [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].

Prescott|Peter Prescott]], writing in ''[[Newsweek]]'', cited the ''Speculum'' article and accused Gardner of [[plagiarism]], a claim that Gardner met \"with a sigh.\"<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/3394/the-art-of-fiction-no-73-john-gardner John Gardner, The Art of Fiction No. 73]</ref>\n\nHe is the author of the famous saying : \"There are only two plots in all literature : a person goes on a journey, a stranger comes to town\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/05/06/two-plots/|title=There Are Only Two Plots: (1) A Person Goes on a Journey (2) A Stranger Comes to Town {{!}} Quote Investigator|last=garson|access-date=2017-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Health problems==\nOn December 10, 1977, Gardner was hospitalized with [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]].
