They found that:\n* The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of {{convert|180|m/s|km/h mi/h|abbr=on}}, was capable of blowing micro-organisms from the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.\n* Use of a warm-air hand dryer spread micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.\n* Paper towels showed no significant spread of micro-organisms.\n\nIn 2005, in a study conducted by T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.<ref>T\u00dcV Produkt und Umwelt GmbH Report No. 425-452006 [http://www.europeantissue.com/pdfs/090410%20T%C3%9CV%20-%20Study%20of%20different%20methods%20used%20for%20drying%20hands%20Sept%202005.pdf A report concerning a study conducted with regard to the different methods used for drying hands; September 2005]</ref> The following changes in the bacterial count after drying the hands were observed:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The first was a human-to-human [[extraperitoneal]] [[kidney transplant]] procedure in 1951 and later a [[xenotransplantation|pig-to-human]] kidney transplant in 1966, both of which ended in abrupt rejection.

Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n''Ptah-Seker'' (who resulted from the identification of Creator god [[Ptah]] with [[Seker]]) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming '''Ptah-Seker-Osiris'''. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Ram god===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\nSince the ''ba'' was associated with power, and also happened to be a word for [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], Banebdjed was depicted as a ram, or as Ram-headed. A living, sacred ram was kept at Mendes and worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and upon death, the rams were mummified and buried in a ram-specific [[necropolis]]. Banebdjed was consequently said to be Horus' father, as Banebdjed was an aspect of Osiris.\n\nRegarding the association of Osiris with the ram, the god's traditional [[crook and flail]] are the instruments of the shepherd, which has suggested to some scholars also an origin for Osiris in herding tribes of the upper Nile. The crook and flail were originally symbols of the minor agricultural deity [[Andjety]], and passed to Osiris later. From Osiris, they eventually passed to Egyptian kings in general as symbols of divine authority.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

The annual festival involved the construction of \"Osiris Beds\" formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed.<ref>Teeter, Emily (2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt''.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb.

Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.

Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n''Ptah-Seker'' (who resulted from the identification of Creator god [[Ptah]] with [[Seker]]) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming '''Ptah-Seker-Osiris'''. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Ram god===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\nSince the ''ba'' was associated with power, and also happened to be a word for [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], Banebdjed was depicted as a ram, or as Ram-headed. A living, sacred ram was kept at Mendes and worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and upon death, the rams were mummified and buried in a ram-specific [[necropolis]]. Banebdjed was consequently said to be Horus' father, as Banebdjed was an aspect of Osiris.\n\nRegarding the association of Osiris with the ram, the god's traditional [[crook and flail]] are the instruments of the shepherd, which has suggested to some scholars also an origin for Osiris in herding tribes of the upper Nile. The crook and flail were originally symbols of the minor agricultural deity [[Andjety]], and passed to Osiris later. From Osiris, they eventually passed to Egyptian kings in general as symbols of divine authority.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]]. A statue of Osiris is brought to the temple.<ref name=\"passion play\"/>\n\n===Wheat and clay rituals===\n[[File:Terre cuite pleureuse Louvre E27247.jpg|thumb|left|A rare sample of Egyptian terra cotta sculpture which may depict [[Isis]] mourning Osiris. The sculpture portrays a woman raising her right arm over her head, a typical gesture of mourning. [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]], Paris.]]\n\nContrasting with the public \"theatrical\" ceremonies sourced from the I-Kher-Nefert stele (from the Middle Kingdom), more esoteric ceremonies were performed inside the temples by priests witnessed only by chosen initiates. Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.

Founded in May 1929, they played originally in the [[Phoenix Park]] but they moved to their current ground [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]] in 1930.\n\nSt Patrick's Athletic have won some trophies in [[League of Ireland|Irish Club Football]], including nine [[List of Irish football champions|League Titles]], the fifth most in [[League of Ireland|Irish Football]], as well as three [[FAI Cup]]s and three [[League of Ireland Cup|League Cups]]. The current manager is [[Stephen O'Donnell (Irish footballer)|Stephen O\u2019Donnell]], who took over from [[Harry Kenny]] in 2019.\n\nThe club graduated through the ranks of the [[Leinster Senior League (association football)|Leinster Senior League]] and duly took their place in the [[League of Ireland]] in 1951, and won the Championship at their first attempt. The club's glory years came in the 1950s and 1990s when they won 7 of their 9 league titles. The club also have the record for never having been [[relegated]] from the [[League of Ireland Premier Division|Premier Division]]. The club play in red and white colours, and their nicknames include ''The Saints'', ''Supersaints'' and ''Pats''.

During this period they won the league title on six occasions. This included four successive titles between 1947 and 1948 and 1950\u201351. In 1947\u201348 St Pats completed a treble after also winning both the [[FAI Intermediate Cup]] and [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]]. The 1948\u201349 season would see St Pats win a Leinster Senior League / FAI Intermediate Cup double. In 1950\u201351 a young [[Shay Gibbons]] helped St Pats win the Leinster Senior League title for a fourth time. After St Pats first team joined the League of Ireland in [[1951\u201352 League of Ireland|1951\u201352]], their [[reserve team]] won two further Leinster Senior League titles in 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357.\n\n===1950\u20131960===\n====Entering the League of Ireland====\nIn [[1951\u201352 League of Ireland|1951\u201352]] the club was admitted, along with Cork side [[Evergreen United]], to the [[League of Ireland]]. St Pats made an immediate impact, winning the league championship at their first attempt. Two more league championship successes followed in [[1954\u201355 League of Ireland|1954\u201355]] and [[1955\u201356 League of Ireland|1955\u201356]]. The club had to wait until 1959 before their first [[FAI Cup]] success, repeating the feat in 1961. Despite several appearances in the final since 1961, it took the Saints till 2014 to win their third\n\nMany of the Pats players of that golden era are still recalled fondly today\u2014Ginger O'Rourke, Harry Boland ('The Legend', 1926\u20132000), Jimmy 'Timber' Cummins (a cousin of one of the founders\u2014Bart Cummins) Jimmy 'Growler' Cummins (a brother of Bart Cummins) Irish international [[Shay Gibbons]], [[Ronnie Whelan (footballer, born 1936)|Ronnie Whelan Snr.]] and Willie Peyton are players who contributed greatly during this era.\n\n===1960\u20131980===\nSt Pats struggled throughout the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s with only the odd cup final or young star emerging to brighten things for long suffering Pats fans. Among those players to emerge was [[Noel Campbell (footballer)|Noel Campbell]]. Campbell spent a number of years with St Pats (gaining the first of his [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish caps]]) before moving to [[SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln]] where he would play 8 seasons. Perhaps the brightest star to play for St Pats was [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]]. McGrath was signed by Saints' manager Charlie Walker from junior side Dalkey United. Within a year he had won the [[PFAI]] Player of the Year award and earned himself a move to [[Manchester United]]. The World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks also played one match for St Pats, making him by far the brightest star to turn out for the club in 1977.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\nThe appointment of [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] as manager in 1986 was a major turning point in the fortunes of the club. Kerr worked on limited resources to create a team capable of challenging the best. The championship in the decade. At the end of the 1988\u201389 season St Pats left [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]] for what the board of directors called \"a short time\" while redevelopment work was done. 1989 saw a joint St Patrick's Athletic & [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] side play a friendly against the [[Libya national football team|Libya national team]] in [[Tripoli]], drawing 0\u20130 in what was a highly controversial [[Exhibition game|friendly]] during [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddaffi]]'s reign as leader of Libya.<ref>https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2019/1206/1097535-in-league-with-gaddafi/</ref><ref>https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/jaunt-to-gaddafis-libya-was-the-trip-of-a-lifetime-for-a-combined-st-patsbohs-side-38765551.html</ref><ref>https://www.balls.ie/football/most-interesting-league-ireland-friendlies-122025</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nPlaying in [[Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium|Harold's Cross]], Kerr's blend of young players ([[Paul Osam]], [[Curtis Fleming]], [[Pat Fenlon]], [[John McDonnell (footballer)|John McDonnell]]) and experienced campaigners disregarded by other clubs ([[Damian Byrne]], [[Dave Henderson (footballer)|Dave Henderson]]) won the club's first league championship in 34 years on Easter Monday 1990. Most Irish football commentators expected the young Saints to dominate Irish football for some time. A series of takeover attempts saw the club thrust into turmoil and Kerr was forced to break up the team. In the summer of 1992 the club were hours away from extinction before a group of local investors raised \u00a382,000 to save the club.\n\nHaving spent four years in Harold's Cross the club returned to a new look Richmond Park in 1993, their spiritual home in Dublin's Inchicore. Brian Kerr began the task of creating a winning setup once again. With the aid of a newly appointed Chief executive, and former player, [[Pat Dolan]] and by the club's new chairman, Tim O'Flaherty, the league trophy returned to Richmond Park in 1996.\n\nA new generation of footballing heroes emerged in Pats colours with greats such as [[Eddie Gormley]], [[Paul Osam]] and Ricky O'Flaherty together with exciting young stars such as [[Colin Hawkins]] and [[Trevor Molloy]] thousands flocked to Inchicore for Friday nights under the floodlights in Richmond Park. When Kerr resigned to take up the Director of Coaching job with the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]], the good work was continued by [[Pat Dolan]] and then [[Liam Buckley]] installed as manager. The glory continued as further league championships were secured in 1998 and 1999 which led to European qualification and a creditable 0\u20130 draw with the famous [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Celtic Park]], the club lost the return leg in Tolka Park, Dublin but the away draw was a major boost for Irish football against such a famous club in the world game. The club, however, suffered a humiliating setback in the same competition one year later when they lost 10\u20130 on aggregate to [[FC Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u]].\n\n===2000\u20132004===\nInto the new century, the success continued. St Pats won both the [[League of Ireland Cup]] and Leinster Senior Cup in 2000/01. Controversy dogged the club in the 2001/02 season due to player registration irregularities. The club had 9 points deducted due to fielding an ineligible player (Paul Marney) in their first 3 games of the season, but this decision was revoked upon arbitration, on 22 March 2002. They then had 15 points deducted for playing Charles Mbabazi Livingstone in the first 5 matches of the season in spite of not having registered him until 12 September 2001. An FAI arbitration panel rejected the Saints' appeal against the point deduction and Shelbourne finished the season as league champions. That season also saw St Patrick's come close to merging with fellow League of Ireland club [[St. Francis F.C.|St. Francis]]. This move was greeted with anger by club supporters and although St. Francis went out of business (and therefore the league) the merger never happened.\n\nNew club chairman Andrew O'Callaghan was appointed in the summer of 2002 and has worked to modernize the club and face the new challenges of [[UEFA]] licensing and ground development. St Pats made Irish footballing history in 2002 by becoming the first club to progress in the [[Intertoto Cup]] with a victory over Croatian team [[NK Rijeka]] over two legs\u2014the club were eventually knocked out of the competition only on away goals to [[K.A.A. Gent|KAA Gent]] of Belgium.\n\n===Johnny McDonnell Reign (2004\u20132009)===\nThe club marked its 75th anniversary in 2004, also in 2004 a change of management happened with former favourite Johnny McDonnell taking over the helm at the club. In 2005 the club were forced to investigate the idea of sharing a new stadium in [[Tallaght]] with [[Shamrock Rovers]] in order to comply with the FAI's wish for Dublin clubs to ground share. The move was met with furious protests by the club's supporters and a group calling themselves 'Pats for Richmond' was set up to organise demonstrations. In July 2006 St Pats signalled their intention to stay in Richmond Park by purchasing the Richmond House pub (also known as McDowell's) for use as an official clubhouse. The club lost yet another FAI Cup Final in December 2006 and their hunt for their third victory in the elusive competition continues. In early 2007 the club was purchased by wealthy property magnate [[Garrett Kelleher]]. After a number of months of negotiations, Kelleher finally announced himself as Chairman of St Patrick's Athletic on 19 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web | author=stpatsfc.com | year=2007 | title=Board Appointments at St Patrick's Athletic FC | url=http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=1657| work=stpatsfc.com | access-date=20 June 2007}}</ref> One of his first acts on taking over St Pats was to appoint ex-manager [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] as director of football. It was widely reported in Irish newspapers that Kelleher was preparing to spend \u20ac50&nbsp;million on upgrading St Pats' Richmond Park home. <br/>\nDuring the 2007 season Pats were neck and neck with [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] for the title, but Pats slipped away and [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] eventually finished up as champions.<br/>\nIt was the same again for the [[2008 League of Ireland Premier Division|2008 season]] with Pats battling up the top with [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for the title. Also this year Pats were in Europe because their second-place finish in 2007 allowed them qualify for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]]. During their European run St Pats progressed through two rounds of the UEFA Cup beating [[JFK Olimps Riga]] and [[Elfsborg]] but the run came to an end when they lost to [[Hertha BSC]] in the First Round proper. Pats also lost out to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for the league title.\n\n===Jeff Kenna season: European run and domestic struggle (2009)===\nFor the 2009 season Pats replaced [[John McDonnell (footballer)|Johnny McDonnell]] with [[Jeff Kenna]] in January 2009. He didn't have the best of starts with a 3\u20130 home defeat to former club [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]. He was immediately put under pressure when bad run of results put them into a relegation battle. Despite the poor league form, once again Pats had another European run in the Europa League again progressing through two rounds of the Europa League, thus becoming only the second League of Ireland club (after Cork City in 2004 and 2005) to achieve such progress in two consecutive European campaigns. Pats this time won games against [[Valletta FC]] and Russian Premier League side [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia Sovetov]] to reach the play-off round where they were defeated by [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Valletta 0\u20131 St Patrick's Athletic (Agg 1\u20132)|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/europa-league/2009/0723/252365-valletta_stpats/|work= rte.ie|publisher= rte |date=30 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Krylya Sovetov 3\u20132 St Patrick's Ath (Agg 3\u20133)|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/europa-league/2009/0806/252942-stpats/ |work= rte.ie|publisher= rte |date=6 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= St Patrick's Ath 1\u20132 Steaua Bucharest (Agg 1\u20135)|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/europa-league/2009/0827/253926-stpats/ |work= rte.ie|publisher= rte |date=27 August 2009 }}</ref>\nIn September 2009 with Pats struggling, Kenna resigned and was replaced for two games by Maurice O'Driscoll. [[Pete Mahon]] then took over until the end of the season and avoided relegation, winning two must win games on the final two weeks of the season, away to [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] and at home to [[Dublin]] rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].\n\n===Pete Mahon years (2009\u20132011)===\n[[Pete Mahon]] was appointed as manager for the 2010 season with John Gill as his assistant. The Super Saints reached their first [[Setanta Sports Cup]] final, where they met local rivals [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] after overcoming [[Sligo Rovers]] 6\u20132 over two legs. They lost the final at the [[Tallaght Stadium]] 1\u20130, however. The Saints were knocked out of the [[FAI Cup]] by archrivals [[Shamrock Rovers]] in a semi-final replay at [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]], after knocking [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]], Belgrove and [[Sporting Fingal F.C.|Sporting Fingal]] out. They were near the top of the table for the majority of the season; however, fell off somewhat near the end and finished in mid-table. The demise of [[Sporting Fingal F.C.|Sporting Fingal]] saw the Saints take their European place for the 2011 season. [[Pete Mahon|Mahon]] led a successful [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] campaign, knocking out [[\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja]] from [[Iceland]] and [[FC Shakhter Karagandy]] from [[Kazakhstan]] before eventually being knocked out in the third qualifying round by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] side [[FC Karpaty Lviv]]. The Saints won the [[2010-11 Leinster Senior Cup|2011 Leinster Senior Cup]] after beating [[Dublin]] rivals [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] 2\u20130 at [[Dalymount Park]]. The Saints' bid to end their 50-year drought of winning the [[FAI Cup]] came to an end, after knocking [[Crumlin United F.C.|Crumlin United]], [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] and [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] out, the Saints faced old rivals [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] in the semi-final. The Saints drew 1\u20131 at [[Tolka Park]], failing to make use of their one-man advantage for the whole second half. The game went to a replay at Richmond Park and things were going well when [[David McMillan (footballer)|David McMillan]] opened the scoring for the Saints, but goalkeeper [[Gary Rogers]] was extremely harshly sent off early on and Shels went on to win, 3\u20131. Similar to the 2010 season, the Saints were near the top of the table for the most part of the season in 2011, but their title challenge petered out towards the end of the season and the Saints finished fourth meaning they would participate in [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifiers in the 2012 season.\n\n===Return of Liam Buckley: Return of success (2012\u20132018)===\nThe Saints decided not to renew manager [[Pete Mahon]]'s contract for the [[2012 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2012 season]], appointing former player and manager [[Liam Buckley]] to the job, giving him a two-year contract with former player and assistant manager at the club, [[Trevor Croly]] as his assistant. Buckley refurbished the squad by bringing in fourteen and getting rid of sixteen. Among the new signings were six [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemian]] players, notably [[Chris Forrester]], [[Chris Fagan (Irish footballer)|Christy Fagan]], and [[Ger O'Brien]]. Meanwhile, six of those not retained by Pats went in the opposite direction, an indication of the change in circumstances at both clubs.\n\nBuckley immediately introduced a more attractive brand of football than was witnessed under Mahon, whose sides had generally punched above their weight but ultimately lacked the quality to seriously challenge for the title. Pats started the season off well with the team playing wonderful football and being unbeaten in its first six games, which included the game against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] which they demonstrated their wonderful football brilliantly in a 5\u20131 win over their fierce rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish-soccer-league/2012/0406/316400-pats-rovers/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | title=St Patrick's Athletic 5\u20131 Shamrock Rovers | date=6 April 2012}}</ref> Buckley took the reins of the club knowing of the European expectations at the club and he didn't disappoint, managing his side to a [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League|third qualifying-round]] place after knocking both [[\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja]] and [[NK \u0160iroki Brijeg]] out after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], to earn a tie with German powerhouse [[Hannover 96]], who knocked the Saints out in the third qualifying round. Buckley's side finished 3rd in [[2012 League of Ireland|the league]], 6 points off champions [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]]. He also guided his side to the [[2012 FAI Cup Final]], the club's first game at the [[Aviva Stadium]], but lost 3\u20132 in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] and extending the Saints' [[FAI Cup]]-winning drought to 52 years.\n\nThe Saints then endured a tumultuous pre-season, losing [[Sean O'Connor (Irish footballer)|Sean O'Connor]], [[James Chambers (Irish footballer)|James Chambers]], and [[Barry Murphy (footballer, born 1985)|Barry Murphy]], as well as Buckley's number two, [[Trevor Croly]], to rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. Crucially, though, Pats held on to a number of other players who had been strongly linked with Rovers, including [[Christopher Forrester|Chris Forrester]] and [[Ian Bermingham]], and added some quality to the first XI in the form of [[Killian Brennan]] (who would go on to win both the [[PFAI Players' Player of the Year]] and FAI National League Player of the Year awards), and [[Conan Byrne]] (who contributed an impressive 9 league goals during the season).\n\nSt Patrick's Athletic clinched the [[2013 League of Ireland Premier Division|2013 League of Ireland]] title on 13 October 2013 after a 2\u20130 win against holders [[Sligo Rovers]] with two games to spare.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/super-st-patricks-athletic-jumping-for-joy-with-league-title-29657442.html|title= Super St Patrick's Athletic jumping for joy with league title|date=14 October 2013|work=Irish Independent|access-date=14 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescore.ie/st-patricks-athletic-airtricity-league-champions-2013-1122749-Oct2013/|title=Month-by-month: How St Pat\u2019s won the Premier Division title|date=14 October 2013|work=The Score|access-date=14 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014120234/http://www.thescore.ie/st-patricks-athletic-airtricity-league-champions-2013-1122749-Oct2013/|archive-date=14 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They lifted the league trophy a week later at home to [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] on 18 October and two days later played the [[2013 Leinster Senior Cup Final]] against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]], losing, 1\u20130, at [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/20194/2/|title=Extratime.ie - Live Updates - 2013 Leinster Senior Cup Final - St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Shamrock Rovers|author=|date=|website=www.extratime.ie|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2014 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2014 season]] started off with silverware for the Saints as they beat [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] [[2014 President of Ireland's Cup|1\u20130]] in the inaugural [[President of Ireland's Cup]], with [[Keith Fahey]] scoring a brilliant volley into the top corner from 25 yards clinching the trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/superb-fahey-strikes-earns-silverware-for-st-pats-30055773.html|title= Superb Fahey strike earns silverware for St Pat's|date= 3 March 2014 |work=Irish Independent|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The club crashed out of the [[UEFA Champions League]] at the first hurdle in the second round, bowing out to [[Legia Warsaw]].

known as some of the most active and vocal throughout the country. Throughout the club's history, any period of turmoil was always met with protest by the loyal saints. In 2001, an ultras group called the Shed End Invincibles<ref>{{cite news |title= Shed End Invincibles&nbsp;\u2013 Official Website|url= http://shedendinvincibles.com/}}</ref> were set up, for four years they created huge tifo displays, choreographed chants and created Richmond Park into a fortress. After a period of exile, the ultras group were reignited under new leadership. Since then, their work has been applauded by other fans. Big banners, flares, and smoke screens are a common sight at St Pats matches. Overseas visitor are regularly found at Richmond Park on a match night, including a Norwegian Pats' supporters club. As well as this, the club's supporters share friendships with supporters of clubs such as [[Ravenna F.C.|Ravenna]] from Italy, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] of England, and [[Hannover 96]] of Germany. Fans of these clubs, along with Pats fans, regularly travel to one another's matches. Famous fans include former Irish manager [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] and American actor [[Wendell Pierce]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://balls.ie/football/wendell-pierce-st-patricks-athletic-bunk-the-wire/?fb_ref=AL2FB|title=Bunk From The Wire Is A Huge St Pats Fan|date=24 March 2013|work=balls.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nThe club motto is ''N\u00ed neart go cur le ch\u00e9ile'' ([[Irish Language|as Gaeilge]]).

The scheme allows Pats to offer young players the opportunity to play with the club's Youth sides whilst undergoing their third level studies on a sports scholarship. There is a big St Pats influence in the scheme with the Soccer Development Officer at Maynooth being former Pats defender [[Barry Prenderville]] as well as club captain [[Ger O'Brien]] managing the side to their first ever [[Collingwood Cup]] win in 2014, with teammate [[Brendan Clarke]] as his assistant. The scholarship scheme is a big asset to St Pats, as it helps attract the top young talent in the country to the club ahead of their rivals. The scheme has also been a huge success, with the Saints Under-19s side winning the [[Dr. Tony O'Neill Cup]] in 2015 to become the best side in the country, as well as a whole host of players graduating from the Youth Setup into the First Team squad. Among the top players to have come through the Programme are [[Jake Carroll]], [[Se\u00e1n Hoare (footballer)|Se\u00e1n Hoare]], [[Jamie McGrath (footballer)|Jamie McGrath]], [[Darragh Markey]], [[Ciaran Kelly (footballer, born 1998)|Ciaran Kelly]], [[Paul Rooney (footballer)|Paul Rooney]] and [[Fuad Sule]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=4020#.Vtczpq_fWrU|title=Club News : St Pat's Launch Scholarship Programme With Nui Manooth|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=7028#.Vtc1R6_fWrU|title=Club News : Maynooth University & St Pat's Scholarship|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Youth Club Affiliations===\nIn 2016, the club opted to disband their own youth teams that played in the Dublin & District Schoolboys Leagues, moving forward into a new model for the League of Ireland Under-19, Under-17 and up-and-coming Under-15s leagues.

football clubs in the Republic of Ireland|Irish association football club]] based in [[Inchicore]], [[Dublin]], that plays in the Irish [[League of Ireland Premier Division|Premier Division]]. Founded in May 1929, they played originally in the [[Phoenix Park]] but they moved to their current ground [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]] in 1930.\n\nSt Patrick's Athletic have won some trophies in [[League of Ireland|Irish Club Football]], including nine [[List of Irish football champions|League Titles]], the fifth most in [[League of Ireland|Irish Football]], as well as three [[FAI Cup]]s and three [[League of Ireland Cup|League Cups]]. The current manager is [[Stephen O'Donnell (Irish footballer)|Stephen O\u2019Donnell]], who took over from [[Harry Kenny]] in 2019.\n\nThe club graduated through the ranks of the [[Leinster Senior League (association football)|Leinster Senior League]] and duly took their place in the [[League of Ireland]] in 1951, and won the Championship at their first attempt. The club's glory years came in the 1950s and 1990s when they won 7 of their 9 league titles. The club also have the record for never having been [[relegated]] from the [[League of Ireland Premier Division|Premier Division]]. The club play in red and white colours, and their nicknames include ''The Saints'', ''Supersaints'' and ''Pats''. The Saints also have a lot of [[Derbies in the League of Ireland#Main Derbies|Dublin Derby]] games with the likes of [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] and [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]].\n\n==History==\n===Leinster Senior League years===\nDuring the late 1940s and 1950s St Pats played in the [[Leinster Senior League Senior Division|Leinster Senior League]]. During this period they won the league title on six occasions. This included four successive titles between 1947 and 1948 and 1950\u201351. In 1947\u201348 St Pats completed a treble after also winning both the [[FAI Intermediate Cup]] and [[Leinster Senior Cup (association football)|Leinster Senior Cup]]. The 1948\u201349 season would see St Pats win a Leinster Senior League / FAI Intermediate Cup double. In 1950\u201351 a young [[Shay Gibbons]] helped St Pats win the Leinster Senior League title for a fourth time. After St Pats first team joined the League of Ireland in [[1951\u201352 League of Ireland|1951\u201352]], their [[reserve team]] won two further Leinster Senior League titles in 1955\u201356 and 1956\u201357.\n\n===1950\u20131960===\n====Entering the League of Ireland====\nIn [[1951\u201352 League of Ireland|1951\u201352]] the club was admitted, along with Cork side [[Evergreen United]], to the [[League of Ireland]]. St Pats made an immediate impact, winning the league championship at their first attempt. Two more league championship successes followed in [[1954\u201355 League of Ireland|1954\u201355]] and [[1955\u201356 League of Ireland|1955\u201356]]. The club had to wait until 1959 before their first [[FAI Cup]] success, repeating the feat in 1961. Despite several appearances in the final since 1961, it took the Saints till 2014 to win their third\n\nMany of the Pats players of that golden era are still recalled fondly today\u2014Ginger O'Rourke, Harry Boland ('The Legend', 1926\u20132000), Jimmy 'Timber' Cummins (a cousin of one of the founders\u2014Bart Cummins) Jimmy 'Growler' Cummins (a brother of Bart Cummins) Irish international [[Shay Gibbons]], [[Ronnie Whelan (footballer, born 1936)|Ronnie Whelan Snr.]] and Willie Peyton are players who contributed greatly during this era.\n\n===1960\u20131980===\nSt Pats struggled throughout the late 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s with only the odd cup final or young star emerging to brighten things for long suffering Pats fans. Among those players to emerge was [[Noel Campbell (footballer)|Noel Campbell]]. Campbell spent a number of years with St Pats (gaining the first of his [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Irish caps]]) before moving to [[SC Fortuna K\u00f6ln]] where he would play 8 seasons. Perhaps the brightest star to play for St Pats was [[Paul McGrath (footballer)|Paul McGrath]]. McGrath was signed by Saints' manager Charlie Walker from junior side Dalkey United. Within a year he had won the [[PFAI]] Player of the Year award and earned himself a move to [[Manchester United]]. The World Cup-winning goalkeeper Gordon Banks also played one match for St Pats, making him by far the brightest star to turn out for the club in 1977.\n\n===1980\u20131990===\nThe appointment of [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] as manager in 1986 was a major turning point in the fortunes of the club. Kerr worked on limited resources to create a team capable of challenging the best. The championship in the decade. At the end of the 1988\u201389 season St Pats left [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]] for what the board of directors called \"a short time\" while redevelopment work was done. 1989 saw a joint St Patrick's Athletic & [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] side play a friendly against the [[Libya national football team|Libya national team]] in [[Tripoli]], drawing 0\u20130 in what was a highly controversial [[Exhibition game|friendly]] during [[Muammar Gaddafi|Colonel Gaddaffi]]'s reign as leader of Libya.<ref>https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2019/1206/1097535-in-league-with-gaddafi/</ref><ref>https://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/league-of-ireland/jaunt-to-gaddafis-libya-was-the-trip-of-a-lifetime-for-a-combined-st-patsbohs-side-38765551.html</ref><ref>https://www.balls.ie/football/most-interesting-league-ireland-friendlies-122025</ref>\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nPlaying in [[Harold's Cross Greyhound Stadium|Harold's Cross]], Kerr's blend of young players ([[Paul Osam]], [[Curtis Fleming]], [[Pat Fenlon]], [[John McDonnell (footballer)|John McDonnell]]) and experienced campaigners disregarded by other clubs ([[Damian Byrne]], [[Dave Henderson (footballer)|Dave Henderson]]) won the club's first league championship in 34 years on Easter Monday 1990. Most Irish football commentators expected the young Saints to dominate Irish football for some time. A series of takeover attempts saw the club thrust into turmoil and Kerr was forced to break up the team. In the summer of 1992 the club were hours away from extinction before a group of local investors raised \u00a382,000 to save the club.\n\nHaving spent four years in Harold's Cross the club returned to a new look Richmond Park in 1993, their spiritual home in Dublin's Inchicore. Brian Kerr began the task of creating a winning setup once again. With the aid of a newly appointed Chief executive, and former player, [[Pat Dolan]] and by the club's new chairman, Tim O'Flaherty, the league trophy returned to Richmond Park in 1996.\n\nA new generation of footballing heroes emerged in Pats colours with greats such as [[Eddie Gormley]], [[Paul Osam]] and Ricky O'Flaherty together with exciting young stars such as [[Colin Hawkins]] and [[Trevor Molloy]] thousands flocked to Inchicore for Friday nights under the floodlights in Richmond Park. When Kerr resigned to take up the Director of Coaching job with the [[Football Association of Ireland|FAI]], the good work was continued by [[Pat Dolan]] and then [[Liam Buckley]] installed as manager. The glory continued as further league championships were secured in 1998 and 1999 which led to European qualification and a creditable 0\u20130 draw with the famous [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] at [[Celtic Park]], the club lost the return leg in Tolka Park, Dublin but the away draw was a major boost for Irish football against such a famous club in the world game. The club, however, suffered a humiliating setback in the same competition one year later when they lost 10\u20130 on aggregate to [[FC Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u|Zimbru Chi\u015fin\u0103u]].\n\n===2000\u20132004===\nInto the new century, the success continued. St Pats won both the [[League of Ireland Cup]] and Leinster Senior Cup in 2000/01. Controversy dogged the club in the 2001/02 season due to player registration irregularities. The club had 9 points deducted due to fielding an ineligible player (Paul Marney) in their first 3 games of the season, but this decision was revoked upon arbitration, on 22 March 2002. They then had 15 points deducted for playing Charles Mbabazi Livingstone in the first 5 matches of the season in spite of not having registered him until 12 September 2001. An FAI arbitration panel rejected the Saints' appeal against the point deduction and Shelbourne finished the season as league champions. That season also saw St Patrick's come close to merging with fellow League of Ireland club [[St. Francis F.C.|St. Francis]]. This move was greeted with anger by club supporters and although St. Francis went out of business (and therefore the league) the merger never happened.\n\nNew club chairman Andrew O'Callaghan was appointed in the summer of 2002 and has worked to modernize the club and face the new challenges of [[UEFA]] licensing and ground development. St Pats made Irish footballing history in 2002 by becoming the first club to progress in the [[Intertoto Cup]] with a victory over Croatian team [[NK Rijeka]] over two legs\u2014the club were eventually knocked out of the competition only on away goals to [[K.A.A. Gent|KAA Gent]] of Belgium.\n\n===Johnny McDonnell Reign (2004\u20132009)===\nThe club marked its 75th anniversary in 2004, also in 2004 a change of management happened with former favourite Johnny McDonnell taking over the helm at the club. In 2005 the club were forced to investigate the idea of sharing a new stadium in [[Tallaght]] with [[Shamrock Rovers]] in order to comply with the FAI's wish for Dublin clubs to ground share. The move was met with furious protests by the club's supporters and a group calling themselves 'Pats for Richmond' was set up to organise demonstrations. In July 2006 St Pats signalled their intention to stay in Richmond Park by purchasing the Richmond House pub (also known as McDowell's) for use as an official clubhouse. The club lost yet another FAI Cup Final in December 2006 and their hunt for their third victory in the elusive competition continues. In early 2007 the club was purchased by wealthy property magnate [[Garrett Kelleher]]. After a number of months of negotiations, Kelleher finally announced himself as Chairman of St Patrick's Athletic on 19 July 2007.<ref>{{cite web | author=stpatsfc.com | year=2007 | title=Board Appointments at St Patrick's Athletic FC | url=http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=1657| work=stpatsfc.com | access-date=20 June 2007}}</ref> One of his first acts on taking over St Pats was to appoint ex-manager [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] as director of football. It was widely reported in Irish newspapers that Kelleher was preparing to spend \u20ac50&nbsp;million on upgrading St Pats' Richmond Park home. <br/>\nDuring the 2007 season Pats were neck and neck with [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] for the title, but Pats slipped away and [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] eventually finished up as champions.<br/>\nIt was the same again for the [[2008 League of Ireland Premier Division|2008 season]] with Pats battling up the top with [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for the title. Also this year Pats were in Europe because their second-place finish in 2007 allowed them qualify for the [[2008\u201309 UEFA Cup]]. During their European run St Pats progressed through two rounds of the UEFA Cup beating [[JFK Olimps Riga]] and [[Elfsborg]] but the run came to an end when they lost to [[Hertha BSC]] in the First Round proper. Pats also lost out to [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] for the league title.\n\n===Jeff Kenna season: European run and domestic struggle (2009)===\nFor the 2009 season Pats replaced [[John McDonnell (footballer)|Johnny McDonnell]] with [[Jeff Kenna]] in January 2009. He didn't have the best of starts with a 3\u20130 home defeat to former club [[Galway United F.C.|Galway United]]. He was immediately put under pressure when bad run of results put them into a relegation battle. Despite the poor league form, once again Pats had another European run in the Europa League again progressing through two rounds of the Europa League, thus becoming only the second League of Ireland club (after Cork City in 2004 and 2005) to achieve such progress in two consecutive European campaigns. Pats this time won games against [[Valletta FC]] and Russian Premier League side [[FC Krylia Sovetov Samara|Krylia Sovetov]] to reach the play-off round where they were defeated by [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Valletta 0\u20131 St Patrick's Athletic (Agg 1\u20132)|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/europa-league/2009/0723/252365-valletta_stpats/|work= rte.ie|publisher= rte |date=30 July 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Krylya Sovetov 3\u20132 St Patrick's Ath (Agg 3\u20133)|url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/europa-league/2009/0806/252942-stpats/ |work= rte.ie|publisher= rte |date=6 August 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= St Patrick's Ath 1\u20132 Steaua Bucharest (Agg 1\u20135)|url= http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/europa-league/2009/0827/253926-stpats/ |work= rte.ie|publisher= rte |date=27 August 2009 }}</ref>\nIn September 2009 with Pats struggling, Kenna resigned and was replaced for two games by Maurice O'Driscoll. [[Pete Mahon]] then took over until the end of the season and avoided relegation, winning two must win games on the final two weeks of the season, away to [[Drogheda United F.C.|Drogheda United]] and at home to [[Dublin]] rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]].\n\n===Pete Mahon years (2009\u20132011)===\n[[Pete Mahon]] was appointed as manager for the 2010 season with John Gill as his assistant. The Super Saints reached their first [[Setanta Sports Cup]] final, where they met local rivals [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] after overcoming [[Sligo Rovers]] 6\u20132 over two legs. They lost the final at the [[Tallaght Stadium]] 1\u20130, however. The Saints were knocked out of the [[FAI Cup]] by archrivals [[Shamrock Rovers]] in a semi-final replay at [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]], after knocking [[Dundalk F.C.|Dundalk]], Belgrove and [[Sporting Fingal F.C.|Sporting Fingal]] out. They were near the top of the table for the majority of the season; however, fell off somewhat near the end and finished in mid-table. The demise of [[Sporting Fingal F.C.|Sporting Fingal]] saw the Saints take their European place for the 2011 season. [[Pete Mahon|Mahon]] led a successful [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] campaign, knocking out [[\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja]] from [[Iceland]] and [[FC Shakhter Karagandy]] from [[Kazakhstan]] before eventually being knocked out in the third qualifying round by [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] side [[FC Karpaty Lviv]]. The Saints won the [[2010-11 Leinster Senior Cup|2011 Leinster Senior Cup]] after beating [[Dublin]] rivals [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemians]] 2\u20130 at [[Dalymount Park]]. The Saints' bid to end their 50-year drought of winning the [[FAI Cup]] came to an end, after knocking [[Crumlin United F.C.|Crumlin United]], [[Waterford United F.C.|Waterford United]] and [[Cork City F.C.|Cork City]] out, the Saints faced old rivals [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]] in the semi-final. The Saints drew 1\u20131 at [[Tolka Park]], failing to make use of their one-man advantage for the whole second half. The game went to a replay at Richmond Park and things were going well when [[David McMillan (footballer)|David McMillan]] opened the scoring for the Saints, but goalkeeper [[Gary Rogers]] was extremely harshly sent off early on and Shels went on to win, 3\u20131. Similar to the 2010 season, the Saints were near the top of the table for the most part of the season in 2011, but their title challenge petered out towards the end of the season and the Saints finished fourth meaning they would participate in [[UEFA Europa League]] qualifiers in the 2012 season.\n\n===Return of Liam Buckley: Return of success (2012\u20132018)===\nThe Saints decided not to renew manager [[Pete Mahon]]'s contract for the [[2012 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2012 season]], appointing former player and manager [[Liam Buckley]] to the job, giving him a two-year contract with former player and assistant manager at the club, [[Trevor Croly]] as his assistant. Buckley refurbished the squad by bringing in fourteen and getting rid of sixteen. Among the new signings were six [[Bohemian F.C.|Bohemian]] players, notably [[Chris Forrester]], [[Chris Fagan (Irish footballer)|Christy Fagan]], and [[Ger O'Brien]]. Meanwhile, six of those not retained by Pats went in the opposite direction, an indication of the change in circumstances at both clubs.\n\nBuckley immediately introduced a more attractive brand of football than was witnessed under Mahon, whose sides had generally punched above their weight but ultimately lacked the quality to seriously challenge for the title. Pats started the season off well with the team playing wonderful football and being unbeaten in its first six games, which included the game against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]] which they demonstrated their wonderful football brilliantly in a 5\u20131 win over their fierce rivals.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/irish-soccer-league/2012/0406/316400-pats-rovers/ | work=RT\u00c9 News | title=St Patrick's Athletic 5\u20131 Shamrock Rovers | date=6 April 2012}}</ref> Buckley took the reins of the club knowing of the European expectations at the club and he didn't disappoint, managing his side to a [[2012\u201313 UEFA Europa League|third qualifying-round]] place after knocking both [[\u00cd\u00fer\u00f3ttabandalag Vestmannaeyja]] and [[NK \u0160iroki Brijeg]] out after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], to earn a tie with German powerhouse [[Hannover 96]], who knocked the Saints out in the third qualifying round. Buckley's side finished 3rd in [[2012 League of Ireland|the league]], 6 points off champions [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]]. He also guided his side to the [[2012 FAI Cup Final]], the club's first game at the [[Aviva Stadium]], but lost 3\u20132 in [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] to [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] and extending the Saints' [[FAI Cup]]-winning drought to 52 years.\n\nThe Saints then endured a tumultuous pre-season, losing [[Sean O'Connor (Irish footballer)|Sean O'Connor]], [[James Chambers (Irish footballer)|James Chambers]], and [[Barry Murphy (footballer, born 1985)|Barry Murphy]], as well as Buckley's number two, [[Trevor Croly]], to rivals [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]]. Crucially, though, Pats held on to a number of other players who had been strongly linked with Rovers, including [[Christopher Forrester|Chris Forrester]] and [[Ian Bermingham]], and added some quality to the first XI in the form of [[Killian Brennan]] (who would go on to win both the [[PFAI Players' Player of the Year]] and FAI National League Player of the Year awards), and [[Conan Byrne]] (who contributed an impressive 9 league goals during the season).\n\nSt Patrick's Athletic clinched the [[2013 League of Ireland Premier Division|2013 League of Ireland]] title on 13 October 2013 after a 2\u20130 win against holders [[Sligo Rovers]] with two games to spare.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/super-st-patricks-athletic-jumping-for-joy-with-league-title-29657442.html|title= Super St Patrick's Athletic jumping for joy with league title|date=14 October 2013|work=Irish Independent|access-date=14 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thescore.ie/st-patricks-athletic-airtricity-league-champions-2013-1122749-Oct2013/|title=Month-by-month: How St Pat\u2019s won the Premier Division title|date=14 October 2013|work=The Score|access-date=14 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014120234/http://www.thescore.ie/st-patricks-athletic-airtricity-league-champions-2013-1122749-Oct2013/|archive-date=14 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> They lifted the league trophy a week later at home to [[Derry City F.C.|Derry City]] on 18 October and two days later played the [[2013 Leinster Senior Cup Final]] against [[Shamrock Rovers F.C.|Shamrock Rovers]], losing, 1\u20130, at [[Richmond Park (football ground)|Richmond Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extratime.ie/fixtures/detail/20194/2/|title=Extratime.ie - Live Updates - 2013 Leinster Senior Cup Final - St. Patrick's Athletic -v- Shamrock Rovers|author=|date=|website=www.extratime.ie|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2014 St Patrick's Athletic F.C. season|2014 season]] started off with silverware for the Saints as they beat [[Sligo Rovers F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] [[2014 President of Ireland's Cup|1\u20130]] in the inaugural [[President of Ireland's Cup]], with [[Keith Fahey]] scoring a brilliant volley into the top corner from 25 yards clinching the trophy.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/superb-fahey-strikes-earns-silverware-for-st-pats-30055773.html|title= Superb Fahey strike earns silverware for St Pat's|date= 3 March 2014 |work=Irish Independent|accessdate=8 July 2017}}</ref> The club crashed out of the [[UEFA Champions League]] at the first hurdle in the second round, bowing out to [[Legia Warsaw]].

known as some of the most active and vocal throughout the country. Throughout the club's history, any period of turmoil was always met with protest by the loyal saints. In 2001, an ultras group called the Shed End Invincibles<ref>{{cite news |title= Shed End Invincibles&nbsp;\u2013 Official Website|url= http://shedendinvincibles.com/}}</ref> were set up, for four years they created huge tifo displays, choreographed chants and created Richmond Park into a fortress. After a period of exile, the ultras group were reignited under new leadership. Since then, their work has been applauded by other fans. Big banners, flares, and smoke screens are a common sight at St Pats matches. Overseas visitor are regularly found at Richmond Park on a match night, including a Norwegian Pats' supporters club. As well as this, the club's supporters share friendships with supporters of clubs such as [[Ravenna F.C.|Ravenna]] from Italy, [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] of England, and [[Hannover 96]] of Germany. Fans of these clubs, along with Pats fans, regularly travel to one another's matches. Famous fans include former Irish manager [[Brian Kerr (Irish football manager)|Brian Kerr]] and American actor [[Wendell Pierce]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://balls.ie/football/wendell-pierce-st-patricks-athletic-bunk-the-wire/?fb_ref=AL2FB|title=Bunk From The Wire Is A Huge St Pats Fan|date=24 March 2013|work=balls.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nThe club motto is ''N\u00ed neart go cur le ch\u00e9ile'' ([[Irish Language|as Gaeilge]]).

The scheme allows Pats to offer young players the opportunity to play with the club's Youth sides whilst undergoing their third level studies on a sports scholarship. There is a big St Pats influence in the scheme with the Soccer Development Officer at Maynooth being former Pats defender [[Barry Prenderville]] as well as club captain [[Ger O'Brien]] managing the side to their first ever [[Collingwood Cup]] win in 2014, with teammate [[Brendan Clarke]] as his assistant. The scholarship scheme is a big asset to St Pats, as it helps attract the top young talent in the country to the club ahead of their rivals. The scheme has also been a huge success, with the Saints Under-19s side winning the [[Dr. Tony O'Neill Cup]] in 2015 to become the best side in the country, as well as a whole host of players graduating from the Youth Setup into the First Team squad. Among the top players to have come through the Programme are [[Jake Carroll]], [[Se\u00e1n Hoare (footballer)|Se\u00e1n Hoare]], [[Jamie McGrath (footballer)|Jamie McGrath]], [[Darragh Markey]], [[Ciaran Kelly (footballer, born 1998)|Ciaran Kelly]], [[Paul Rooney (footballer)|Paul Rooney]] and [[Fuad Sule]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=4020#.Vtczpq_fWrU|title=Club News : St Pat's Launch Scholarship Programme With Nui Manooth|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpatsfc.com/news.php?id=7028#.Vtc1R6_fWrU|title=Club News : Maynooth University & St Pat's Scholarship|publisher=|accessdate=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Youth Club Affiliations===\nIn 2016, the club opted to disband their own youth teams that played in the Dublin & District Schoolboys Leagues, moving forward into a new model for the League of Ireland Under-19, Under-17 and up-and-coming Under-15s leagues.

Considered the designated scholar of his siblings, his parents dreamed of him becoming a rabbi and sent him to the town's best religious school (or ''cheder''), where the wealthy families sent their children. There, he spent most of his childhood studying the Talmud, and would later study the Bible and the Haggadah on his own time. Asch grew up in a majority Jewish town, so he grew up believing Jews were the majority in the rest of the world as well. In Kutno, Jews and gentiles mostly got along, barring some tension around religious holidays. He had to sneak through a majority gentile area to get to a lake where he loved to swim, where he was once cornered by boys wielding sticks and dogs, who demanded he admit to killing \"Christ\"\u2013which Asch did not, at the time, know to be a name for Jesus\u2013or they would rip his coat. He admitted to killing Christ out of fear, but they beat him and tore his coat anyway. Asch never lost his fear of dogs from that incident<ref>{{Cite book|title=The controversial Sholem Asch : an introduction to his fiction|author=Siegel, Ben|date=1976|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=087972076X|oclc=2594407}}</ref>.\n\nIn his adolescence, after moving from the ''cheder'' to the House of Study, Sholem became aware of major social changes in popular Jewish thinking. New ideas and the Enlightenment were asserting themselves in the Jewish world. At his friend's house, Sholem would explore these new ideas by secretly reading many secular books, which led him to believe himself too worldly to become a rabbi. At age 17, his parents found out about this \"profane\" literature and sent him to live with relatives in a nearby village, where he became a Hebrew teacher.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The controversial Sholem Asch : an introduction to his fiction|author=Siegel, Ben|date=1976|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=087972076X|oclc=2594407}}</ref> After a few months there, he received a more [[liberal education]] at [[W\u0142oc\u0142awek]], where he supported himself as a letter writer for the illiterate townspeople.<ref name=\"Sherman\">[[Joseph Sherman|Sherman, Joseph]] (July&nbsp;13, 2010). \"[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Asch_Sholem Asch, Sholem]\".

Retrieved 2017-04-08.</ref> It is in Wloclawek where he became enamored with the work of prominent Yiddish writer [[Isaac Leib Peretz|I. L. Peretz]]. It is also where he began writing. He attempted to master the short story and wrote in Hebrew. What he wrote there would later be revised, translated into Yiddish, and ultimately, launch his career <ref>{{Cite book|title=The controversial Sholem Asch : an introduction to his fiction|author=Siegel, Ben|date=1976|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=087972076X|oclc=2594407}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1899, he moved to [[Warsaw]] where he met I.L. Peretz and other young writers under Peretz's mentorship such as David Pinski, Abraham Reisen, and Hersh David Nomberg. Influenced by the [[Haskalah]] (Jewish Enlightenment), Asch initially wrote in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but Peretz convinced him to switch to Yiddish. Asch's reputation was established in 1902 with his first book of stories, ''In a shlekhter tsayt'' (''In a Bad Time'')<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sholem Asch reconsidered|first=Nanette|last=Stahl|date=2004|publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|isbn=0845731521|oclc=54279902}}</ref>. In 1903, he married Mathilde Shapiro, the daughter of the Polish-Jewish teacher and poet Menahem Mendel Shapiro.<ref name=\"Sherman\" />\n\nIn 1904, Asch released one of his most well-known works, ''A shtetl'', an idyllic portrait of traditional Polish-Jewish life. In January 1905, he released the first play of his incredibly successful play-writing career, ''Tsurikgekumen'' (''Coming Back'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sholem Asch reconsidered|first=Nanette|last=Stahl|date=2004|publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|isbn=0845731521|oclc=54279902}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote the drama ''Got fun nekome'' (''God of Vengeance'') in the winter of 1906 in Cologne, Germany.<ref>Schalom Asch, \"R\u00fcckblick,\" ''Jahrbuch'' (Berlin: Paul Zsolnay Verlag, 1931), p. 67.</ref> It is about a Jewish brothel owner who attempts to become respectable by commissioning a Torah scroll and marrying off his daughter to a yeshiva student. Set in a brothel, the play includes Jewish prostitutes and a lesbian scene.<ref>As reimagined by Rebecca Taichman and Paula Vogel in ''Indecent,'' the play ends a moment before the hurling of a Torah across the stage; in a Yiddish text published in 1913 in Warsaw, available at https://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/yiddish-books/spb-nybc203692/asch-sholem-der-got-fun-nekome-a-drame-in-dray-akten , and in ''The God of Vengeance,'' trans.

Harry Weinberger et al., [New York] Supreme Court, Appellate Division, 136220, First Dept., vol. 5736, p. 351), a religious man is asked to take the scroll out of the house.</ref> I.L. Peretz famously said of the play after reading it: \"Burn it, Asch, burn it!\" Instead, Asch went to Berlin to pitch it to director Max Reinhardt and actor Rudolf Schildkraut, who produced it at the Deutsches Theater. ''God of Vengeance'' opened on March 19, 1907 and ran for six months, and soon was translated and performed in a dozen European languages. It was first brought to New York by [[David_Kessler_(actor)|David Kessler]] in 1907. The audience mostly came for Kessler, and they booed the rest of the cast. The New York production sparked a major press war between local Yiddish papers, led by the Orthodox ''Tageplatt'' and the radical [[The_Forward|''Forverts'']]. Orthodox papers referred to ''God of Vengeance'' as \"filthy,\" \"immoral,\" and \"indecent,\" while radical papers described it as \"moral,\" \"artistic,\" and \"beautiful\". Some of the more provocative scenes in the production were changed, but it wasn't enough for the Orthodox papers. Even Yiddish intellectuals and the play's supporters had problems with the play's inauthentic portrayal of Jewish tradition, especially Yankl's use of the Torah, which they said Asch seemed to be using mostly for cheap effects; they also expressed concern over how it might stigmatize Jewish people who already faced much anti-Semitism. The association with Jews and sex work was a popular stereotype at the time. Other intellectuals criticized the writing itself, claiming that the second act was beautifully written but the first and third acts failed to support it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''God of Vengeance'' was published in English translation in 1918,<ref>Sholom Ash, ''The God of Vengeance,'' trans.

In the pursuit of a safe haven from the violence in Europe, he and his family moved to the United States in 1914, moving around New York City for a while before settling in [[Staten Island]].  In New York, he began to write for [[The_Forward|''Forverts'']], the mass-circulation Yiddish daily that had also covered his plays, a job provided both income and an intellectual circle. \n\nAsch became increasingly active in public life and played a prominent role in the American Jewry's relief efforts in Europe for Jewish war victims. He was a founding member of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]. After a series of pogroms in Lithuania in 1919, Asch visited the country as representative of the Joint Committee,<ref>A marked-up typescript translation of a report from Asch is located in \"Letter from Acting Manager to Mr. Alert Lucas\" (Item ID 221283) in the online JDC Archives at http://search.archives.jdc.org/ .</ref> and he suffered a nervous breakdown due to the shock of the horrors he witnessed. <ref name=\":0\" /> His ''Kiddush ha-Shem'' (1919), chronicling the anti-Jewish and anti-Polish [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in mid-17th century [[Ukraine]] and Poland, is one of the earliest [[historical novel]]s in modern [[Yiddish literature]]. In 1920, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.\n\nAsch returned to Poland in 1923, visiting Germany frequently. The Yiddish literary circle hoped he would stay in Poland, because I.L. Peretz's death in 1915 had left them devoid of a head figure. Asch had no desire to take Peretz's place, moving to Bellevue, France after years and continuing to write regularly for Yiddish papers in the US and Poland. In Bellevue, he wrote his 1929\u201331 trilogy ''Farn Mabul.'' (''Before the Flood'', translated as ''Three Cities'') describes early 20th century Jewish life in [[Saint Petersburg]], Warsaw, and Moscow. Ever the traveller, Asch took many trips to the Soviet Union, Palestine and the United States. He always held painters in high regard and formed close friendships with the like of [[Isaac Lichtenstein]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Emil Orlik]], and [[Jules Pascin]]. He spoke to the hundreds of mourners at Pascin's funeral after the painter committed suicide.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Image:Szalom Asz.jpg|thumb|Sholem Asch]]\nAsch was a celebrated writer in his own lifetime. In 1920, in honor of his 40th birthday, a committee headed by [[Judah Leon Magnes|Judah L. Magnes]] published a 12-volume set of his collected works.<ref name=\"Sherman\"/> In 1932 he was awarded the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]]'s [[Polonia Restituta]] decoration and was elected honorary president of the Yiddish [[PEN Club]].\n\nIn 1930, when Asch was at the height of his fame and popularity, he moved to [[Nice]], then almost immediately moved back to Poland and spent months touring the countryside to do research for his next novel: ''Der tehilim-yid'' (''Salvation''). He then moved into a house outside of Nice and rebuilt it as the \"Villa Shalom,\" with luxuries such as a study facing the sea, a swimming pool, a bowling green, and an orchard. In 1935, he visited America at the Joint Committee's request to raise funds for Jewish relief in Europe. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAsch's next work, ''Bayrn Opgrunt'' (1937, translated as ''The Precipice''), is set in Germany during the [[hyperinflation]] of the 1920s. ''Dos Gezang fun Tol'' (''The Song of the Valley'') is about the ''halutzim'' (Jewish-Zionist pioneers in Palestine), and reflects his 1936 visit to that region. Asch visited Palestine again in 1936. Then, in 1939, he returned to Villa Shalom for the last time.  He delayed leaving Europe until the last possible moment, then reluctantly returned to the United States. \n\nOn his second sojourn in the US, Asch first lived in Stamford, Connecticut, then moved to Miami Beach, where he stayed until the early 1950s. He offended Jewish sensibilities with his 1939\u20131949 trilogy, ''The Nazarene,'' ''The Apostle,'' and ''Mary,'' which dealt with [[New Testament]] subjects. Despite accusations of conversion, Asch remained proudly Jewish; he had written the trilogy not as a promotion of Christianity but as an attempt to bridge the gap between Jews and Christians. Much of his readership and the Jewish literary community, however, did not see it that way. His long-standing employer, New York Yiddish newspaper ''[[Forverts]],'' not only dropped him as a writer but also openly attacked him for promoting [[Christianity]].  He subsequently started writing for a communist paper, ''Morgen frayhayt,'' leading to repeated questioning by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. In 1953, Chaim Lieberman published ''The Christianity of Sholem Asch,'' a scathing criticism of Asch and his Christological trilogy that disgusted even some of Asch's strongest critics. Lieberman's book, and the McCarthy Hearings, led Asch and his wife to leave the US in 1953, whereafter they split their time between London (where their daughter lived), continental Europe, and Israel.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nAsch spent most of his last two years in [[Bat Yam]] near [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], in a house that the mayor had invited him to build, but died in [[London]] at his desk writing. Had he died two or three decades earlier, his funeral would have drawn massive crowds, but, due to his controversies, it was instead a small funeral in London. His house in Bat Yam is now the Sholem Asch Museum and part of the MoBY-Museums of Bat Yam complex of three museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moby.org.il/en/visitor-information/|title=MoBY: Museums of Art - Visit|website=moby.org.il |date= |accessdate=2017-10-17}}</ref> The bulk of his library, containing rare Yiddish books and manuscripts, as well as the manuscripts of some of his own works, is held at [[Yale University]]. Although many of his works are no longer read today, his best works have proven to be standards of Jewish and Yiddish literature. His sons were Moszek Asz [[Moe Asch|Moses \"Moe\" Asch]] (2 December 1905, Warsaw \u2013 19 October 1986, United States), the founder and head of [[Folkways Records]], and Natan Asz/Nathan Asch (1902, Warsaw \u2013 1964, United States), also a writer. His great-grandson, David Mazower, is a writer and a BBC Journalist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mazower |first=David |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30214204 |title=A Jewish festival in a town without Jews - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/oral-histories/interviews/woh-fi-0000074/woh-fi-0000074 |title=David Mazower |publisher=Yiddish Book Center |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Inspirations and major themes ==\nMany of Asch's father figures are inspired by his own father. Sholem was believed to have adopted much of his own philosophies from his father, such as his love for humanity and his concern for Jewish-Christian reconciliation. He summed up his father's faith as \"love of God and love of neighbor\". <ref name=\":0\" /> Asch often wrote two kinds of characters: the pious Jew and the burly worker. This was inspired by his family, as his brothers dealt with peasants and butchers and fit in with the hardy outdoor Jews of Kutno, which Asch had much pride in. His older half-brothers, on the other hand, were pious Hasidim.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nOne of Asch's major goals in his writing was to articulate Jewish life, past and present. He placed the Jew at the center of his every work, along with an awareness of the Jewish relationship with the outside world. Some of his most frequent recurring themes were: man's faith, goodness, and generosity. He was repelled and intrigued by Christian violence, and inspired by Jewish martyrdom and survival.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAsch reflected on cosmopolitan interests and concern for the people and conditions he encountered. His fiction can mostly be put into three categories: tales, novels and plays of Eastern European Jewish life (Polish mostly); tales and novels of Jewish life in America; five biblical novels: two on Old testament figures, and three on New Testament figures. Smaller groupings included works on the Holocaust and modern Israel. His work was not easily categorized, and straddled the lines between romanticism and realism, naturalism and idealism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* ''A Shtetl'' (\"The Village\"), 1904 or earlier, story\n* ''Mitn Shtrom'' (''With the Stream''), 1904 novel and play\n* ''Got fun Nekomeh'' (''God of Vengeance''), 1907, play\n* ''Reb Shloyme Nogid'', 1913, novel\n* ''Motke Ganev'' (''Motke the Thief''), 1916, novel\n* ''Mary'', 1917, play\n* ''Der Veg tsu Zikh'' (''The Way to Oneself''), 1917, play\n* ''Motke Ganev'' (''Motke the Thief''), 1917, play\n* ''Onkl Mozes (Uncle Moses)'', 1918 (translated into English 1938), play\n* ''Kiddush ha-Shem'', 1919 (translated into English 1926), novel\n* ''Di Muter'' (''The Mother''), 1919 (translated into English 1930)\n* ''Di Kishufmakherin fun Kastilien'' (''The Witch of Castile''), 1921\n* ''Urteyl'' (''Death Sentence''), 1924\n* ''Khaym Lederers Tsurikkumen'' (''The Return of Khaym Lederer''), 1927\n* Schalom Asch, \"R\u00fcckblick,\" ''Jahrbuch'' (Berlin: Paul Zsolnay Verlag, 1931), pp. 35\u201377.\n* ''Farn Mabul'' trilogy (''Before the Flood'') 1929\u201331, translated as ''Three Cities'', 1933\n* ''Gots Gefangene'' (''God's Captives''), 1933\n* ''Der T'hilim Yid'', 1934, translated as: ''Salvation''\n{{col-break}}\n* ''The War Goes On'', 1935\n* ''Bayrn Opgrunt'', 1937, translated as: ''The Precipice''\n* ''The Mother'', 1937, novel\n* ''Three Novels'', 1938\n* ''Dos Gezang fun Tol'' (''The Song of the Valley''), 1938 (translated into English, 1939)\n* ''The Nazarene'', 1939, novel\n* ''What I Believe'' 1941, essay, 201 pages\n* ''Children of Abraham'', 1942, short stories\n* ''My Personal Faith'', 1942, Published: London, George Rutledge & Sons, Ltd\n* ''The Apostle'', 1943, novel\n* ''One Destiny: An Epistle to the Christians'', 1945<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kesherjournal.com/Issue-22/Sholem-Asch-One-Destiny-an-Epistle-to-the-Christians#_ftnref1 |title=Sholem Asch, One Destiny: an Epistle to the Christians &#124; Issue 22 |publisher=Kesher Journal |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petahtikvah.com/Articles/OneDestiny.htm |title=One Destiny Part 1 |publisher=Petahtikvah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petahtikvah.com/Articles/onedes.htm |title=One Destiny Part 2 |publisher=Petahtikvah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>\n* ''East River'', 1946,<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |id=9esptTJDATUC |plainurl=yes }} |title=East River: A Novel of New York |author=Sholem Asch |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> spent more than 6 months on the [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 1946|New York Times Best Seller List]] (1946\u20137) including one week at #1<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n* ''Tales of My People'', 1948, short stories\n* ''Mary'', 1949, novel, unrelated to his earlier work of the same name\n* ''Salvation'', 1951\n* ''Moses'', 1951, novel\n* ''A Passage in the Night'', 1953\n* ''The Prophet'', 1955\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Discography===\n* ''In the Beginning: Bible Stories for Children by Sholem Asch (Performed by Arna Bontemps)'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1955)\n* ''Joseph and His Brothers: From In the Beginning by Sholem Asch (Performed by Arna Bontemps)'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1955)\n* ''Jewish Classical Literature: Read by Chaim Ostrowsky'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1960)\n* ''Nativity: Sholem Asch's Story of the Birth of Jesus (Performed by [[Pete Seeger]])'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1963)\n* ''Readings from the Bible - Old Testament: Compiled by Sholem Asch (Performed by Harry Fleetwood)'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1972)\n* ''Sholem Asch: A Statement and Lecture at Columbia University, N.Y.

Considered the designated scholar of his siblings, his parents dreamed of him becoming a rabbi and sent him to the town's best religious school (or ''cheder''), where the wealthy families sent their children. There, he spent most of his childhood studying the Talmud, and would later study the Bible and the Haggadah on his own time. Asch grew up in a majority Jewish town, so he grew up believing Jews were the majority in the rest of the world as well. In Kutno, Jews and gentiles mostly got along, barring some tension around religious holidays. He had to sneak through a majority gentile area to get to a lake where he loved to swim, where he was once cornered by boys wielding sticks and dogs, who demanded he admit to killing \"Christ\"\u2013which Asch did not, at the time, know to be a name for Jesus\u2013or they would rip his coat. He admitted to killing Christ out of fear, but they beat him and tore his coat anyway. Asch never lost his fear of dogs from that incident<ref>{{Cite book|title=The controversial Sholem Asch : an introduction to his fiction|author=Siegel, Ben|date=1976|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=087972076X|oclc=2594407}}</ref>.\n\nIn his adolescence, after moving from the ''cheder'' to the House of Study, Sholem became aware of major social changes in popular Jewish thinking. New ideas and the Enlightenment were asserting themselves in the Jewish world. At his friend's house, Sholem would explore these new ideas by secretly reading many secular books, which led him to believe himself too worldly to become a rabbi. At age 17, his parents found out about this \"profane\" literature and sent him to live with relatives in a nearby village, where he became a Hebrew teacher.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The controversial Sholem Asch : an introduction to his fiction|author=Siegel, Ben|date=1976|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=087972076X|oclc=2594407}}</ref> After a few months there, he received a more [[liberal education]] at [[W\u0142oc\u0142awek]], where he supported himself as a letter writer for the illiterate townspeople.<ref name=\"Sherman\">[[Joseph Sherman|Sherman, Joseph]] (July&nbsp;13, 2010). \"[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Asch_Sholem Asch, Sholem]\".

Retrieved 2017-04-08.</ref> It is in Wloclawek where he became enamored with the work of prominent Yiddish writer [[Isaac Leib Peretz|I. L. Peretz]]. It is also where he began writing. He attempted to master the short story and wrote in Hebrew. What he wrote there would later be revised, translated into Yiddish, and ultimately, launch his career <ref>{{Cite book|title=The controversial Sholem Asch : an introduction to his fiction|author=Siegel, Ben|date=1976|publisher=Bowling Green University Popular Press|isbn=087972076X|oclc=2594407}}</ref>.\n\nIn 1899, he moved to [[Warsaw]] where he met I.L. Peretz and other young writers under Peretz's mentorship such as David Pinski, Abraham Reisen, and Hersh David Nomberg. Influenced by the [[Haskalah]] (Jewish Enlightenment), Asch initially wrote in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], but Peretz convinced him to switch to Yiddish. Asch's reputation was established in 1902 with his first book of stories, ''In a shlekhter tsayt'' (''In a Bad Time'')<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sholem Asch reconsidered|first=Nanette|last=Stahl|date=2004|publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|isbn=0845731521|oclc=54279902}}</ref>. In 1903, he married Mathilde Shapiro, the daughter of the Polish-Jewish teacher and poet Menahem Mendel Shapiro.<ref name=\"Sherman\" />\n\nIn 1904, Asch released one of his most well-known works, ''A shtetl'', an idyllic portrait of traditional Polish-Jewish life. In January 1905, he released the first play of his incredibly successful play-writing career, ''Tsurikgekumen'' (''Coming Back'').<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sholem Asch reconsidered|first=Nanette|last=Stahl|date=2004|publisher=Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|isbn=0845731521|oclc=54279902}}</ref>\n\nHe wrote the drama ''Got fun nekome'' (''God of Vengeance'') in the winter of 1906 in Cologne, Germany.<ref>Schalom Asch, \"R\u00fcckblick,\" ''Jahrbuch'' (Berlin: Paul Zsolnay Verlag, 1931), p. 67.</ref> It is about a Jewish brothel owner who attempts to become respectable by commissioning a Torah scroll and marrying off his daughter to a yeshiva student.

Peretz famously said of the play after reading it: \"Burn it, Asch, burn it!\" Instead, Asch went to Berlin to pitch it to director Max Reinhardt and actor Rudolf Schildkraut, who produced it at the Deutsches Theater. ''God of Vengeance'' opened on March 19, 1907 and ran for six months, and soon was translated and performed in a dozen European languages. It was first brought to New York by [[David_Kessler_(actor)|David Kessler]] in 1907. The audience mostly came for Kessler, and they booed the rest of the cast. The New York production sparked a major press war between local Yiddish papers, led by the Orthodox ''Tageplatt'' and the radical [[The_Forward|''Forverts'']]. Orthodox papers referred to ''God of Vengeance'' as \"filthy,\" \"immoral,\" and \"indecent,\" while radical papers described it as \"moral,\" \"artistic,\" and \"beautiful\". Some of the more provocative scenes in the production were changed, but it wasn't enough for the Orthodox papers. Even Yiddish intellectuals and the play's supporters had problems with the play's inauthentic portrayal of Jewish tradition, especially Yankl's use of the Torah, which they said Asch seemed to be using mostly for cheap effects; they also expressed concern over how it might stigmatize Jewish people who already faced much anti-Semitism. The association with Jews and sex work was a popular stereotype at the time. Other intellectuals criticized the writing itself, claiming that the second act was beautifully written but the first and third acts failed to support it.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n''God of Vengeance'' was published in English translation in 1918,<ref>Sholom Ash, ''The God of Vengeance,'' trans.

In the pursuit of a safe haven from the violence in Europe, he and his family moved to the United States in 1914, moving around New York City for a while before settling in [[Staten Island]].  In New York, he began to write for [[The_Forward|''Forverts'']], the mass-circulation Yiddish daily that had also covered his plays, a job provided both income and an intellectual circle. \n\nAsch became increasingly active in public life and played a prominent role in the American Jewry's relief efforts in Europe for Jewish war victims. He was a founding member of the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]]. After a series of pogroms in Lithuania in 1919, Asch visited the country as representative of the Joint Committee,<ref>A marked-up typescript translation of a report from Asch is located in \"Letter from Acting Manager to Mr. Alert Lucas\" (Item ID 221283) in the online JDC Archives at http://search.archives.jdc.org/ .</ref> and he suffered a nervous breakdown due to the shock of the horrors he witnessed. <ref name=\":0\" /> His ''Kiddush ha-Shem'' (1919), chronicling the anti-Jewish and anti-Polish [[Chmielnicki Uprising]] in mid-17th century [[Ukraine]] and Poland, is one of the earliest [[historical novel]]s in modern [[Yiddish literature]]. In 1920, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.\n\nAsch returned to Poland in 1923, visiting Germany frequently. The Yiddish literary circle hoped he would stay in Poland, because I.L. Peretz's death in 1915 had left them devoid of a head figure. Asch had no desire to take Peretz's place, moving to Bellevue, France after years and continuing to write regularly for Yiddish papers in the US and Poland. In Bellevue, he wrote his 1929\u201331 trilogy ''Farn Mabul.'' (''Before the Flood'', translated as ''Three Cities'') describes early 20th century Jewish life in [[Saint Petersburg]], Warsaw, and Moscow. Ever the traveller, Asch took many trips to the Soviet Union, Palestine and the United States. He always held painters in high regard and formed close friendships with the like of [[Isaac Lichtenstein]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Emil Orlik]], and [[Jules Pascin]]. He spoke to the hundreds of mourners at Pascin's funeral after the painter committed suicide.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n[[Image:Szalom Asz.jpg|thumb|Sholem Asch]]\nAsch was a celebrated writer in his own lifetime. In 1920, in honor of his 40th birthday, a committee headed by [[Judah Leon Magnes|Judah L. Magnes]] published a 12-volume set of his collected works.<ref name=\"Sherman\"/> In 1932 he was awarded the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish Republic]]'s [[Polonia Restituta]] decoration and was elected honorary president of the Yiddish [[PEN Club]].\n\nIn 1930, when Asch was at the height of his fame and popularity, he moved to [[Nice]], then almost immediately moved back to Poland and spent months touring the countryside to do research for his next novel: ''Der tehilim-yid'' (''Salvation''). He then moved into a house outside of Nice and rebuilt it as the \"Villa Shalom,\" with luxuries such as a study facing the sea, a swimming pool, a bowling green, and an orchard. In 1935, he visited America at the Joint Committee's request to raise funds for Jewish relief in Europe. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAsch's next work, ''Bayrn Opgrunt'' (1937, translated as ''The Precipice''), is set in Germany during the [[hyperinflation]] of the 1920s. ''Dos Gezang fun Tol'' (''The Song of the Valley'') is about the ''halutzim'' (Jewish-Zionist pioneers in Palestine), and reflects his 1936 visit to that region. Asch visited Palestine again in 1936. Then, in 1939, he returned to Villa Shalom for the last time.  He delayed leaving Europe until the last possible moment, then reluctantly returned to the United States. \n\nOn his second sojourn in the US, Asch first lived in Stamford, Connecticut, then moved to Miami Beach, where he stayed until the early 1950s. He offended Jewish sensibilities with his 1939\u20131949 trilogy, ''The Nazarene,'' ''The Apostle,'' and ''Mary,'' which dealt with [[New Testament]] subjects. Despite accusations of conversion, Asch remained proudly Jewish; he had written the trilogy not as a promotion of Christianity but as an attempt to bridge the gap between Jews and Christians. Much of his readership and the Jewish literary community, however, did not see it that way. His long-standing employer, New York Yiddish newspaper ''[[Forverts]],'' not only dropped him as a writer but also openly attacked him for promoting [[Christianity]].  He subsequently started writing for a communist paper, ''Morgen frayhayt,'' leading to repeated questioning by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]]. In 1953, Chaim Lieberman published ''The Christianity of Sholem Asch,'' a scathing criticism of Asch and his Christological trilogy that disgusted even some of Asch's strongest critics. Lieberman's book, and the McCarthy Hearings, led Asch and his wife to leave the US in 1953, whereafter they split their time between London (where their daughter lived), continental Europe, and Israel.\n\n==Death and legacy==\nAsch spent most of his last two years in [[Bat Yam]] near [[Tel Aviv]], [[Israel]], in a house that the mayor had invited him to build, but died in [[London]] at his desk writing. Had he died two or three decades earlier, his funeral would have drawn massive crowds, but, due to his controversies, it was instead a small funeral in London. His house in Bat Yam is now the Sholem Asch Museum and part of the MoBY-Museums of Bat Yam complex of three museums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moby.org.il/en/visitor-information/|title=MoBY: Museums of Art - Visit|website=moby.org.il |date= |accessdate=2017-10-17}}</ref> The bulk of his library, containing rare Yiddish books and manuscripts, as well as the manuscripts of some of his own works, is held at [[Yale University]]. Although many of his works are no longer read today, his best works have proven to be standards of Jewish and Yiddish literature. His sons were Moszek Asz [[Moe Asch|Moses \"Moe\" Asch]] (2 December 1905, Warsaw \u2013 19 October 1986, United States), the founder and head of [[Folkways Records]], and Natan Asz/Nathan Asch (1902, Warsaw \u2013 1964, United States), also a writer. His great-grandson, David Mazower, is a writer and a BBC Journalist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mazower |first=David |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30214204 |title=A Jewish festival in a town without Jews - BBC News |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yiddishbookcenter.org/collections/oral-histories/interviews/woh-fi-0000074/woh-fi-0000074 |title=David Mazower |publisher=Yiddish Book Center |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\n== Inspirations and major themes ==\nMany of Asch's father figures are inspired by his own father. Sholem was believed to have adopted much of his own philosophies from his father, such as his love for humanity and his concern for Jewish-Christian reconciliation. He summed up his father's faith as \"love of God and love of neighbor\". <ref name=\":0\" /> Asch often wrote two kinds of characters: the pious Jew and the burly worker. This was inspired by his family, as his brothers dealt with peasants and butchers and fit in with the hardy outdoor Jews of Kutno, which Asch had much pride in. His older half-brothers, on the other hand, were pious Hasidim.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nOne of Asch's major goals in his writing was to articulate Jewish life, past and present. He placed the Jew at the center of his every work, along with an awareness of the Jewish relationship with the outside world. Some of his most frequent recurring themes were: man's faith, goodness, and generosity. He was repelled and intrigued by Christian violence, and inspired by Jewish martyrdom and survival.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAsch reflected on cosmopolitan interests and concern for the people and conditions he encountered. His fiction can mostly be put into three categories: tales, novels and plays of Eastern European Jewish life (Polish mostly); tales and novels of Jewish life in America; five biblical novels: two on Old testament figures, and three on New Testament figures. Smaller groupings included works on the Holocaust and modern Israel. His work was not easily categorized, and straddled the lines between romanticism and realism, naturalism and idealism.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n* ''A Shtetl'' (\"The Village\"), 1904 or earlier, story\n* ''Mitn Shtrom'' (''With the Stream''), 1904 novel and play\n* ''Got fun Nekomeh'' (''God of Vengeance''), 1907, play\n* ''Reb Shloyme Nogid'', 1913, novel\n* ''Motke Ganev'' (''Motke the Thief''), 1916, novel\n* ''Mary'', 1917, play\n* ''Der Veg tsu Zikh'' (''The Way to Oneself''), 1917, play\n* ''Motke Ganev'' (''Motke the Thief''), 1917, play\n* ''Onkl Mozes (Uncle Moses)'', 1918 (translated into English 1938), play\n* ''Kiddush ha-Shem'', 1919 (translated into English 1926), novel\n* ''Di Muter'' (''The Mother''), 1919 (translated into English 1930)\n* ''Di Kishufmakherin fun Kastilien'' (''The Witch of Castile''), 1921\n* ''Urteyl'' (''Death Sentence''), 1924\n* ''Khaym Lederers Tsurikkumen'' (''The Return of Khaym Lederer''), 1927\n* Schalom Asch, \"R\u00fcckblick,\" ''Jahrbuch'' (Berlin: Paul Zsolnay Verlag, 1931), pp. 35\u201377.\n* ''Farn Mabul'' trilogy (''Before the Flood'') 1929\u201331, translated as ''Three Cities'', 1933\n* ''Gots Gefangene'' (''God's Captives''), 1933\n* ''Der T'hilim Yid'', 1934, translated as: ''Salvation''\n{{col-break}}\n* ''The War Goes On'', 1935\n* ''Bayrn Opgrunt'', 1937, translated as: ''The Precipice''\n* ''The Mother'', 1937, novel\n* ''Three Novels'', 1938\n* ''Dos Gezang fun Tol'' (''The Song of the Valley''), 1938 (translated into English, 1939)\n* ''The Nazarene'', 1939, novel\n* ''What I Believe'' 1941, essay, 201 pages\n* ''Children of Abraham'', 1942, short stories\n* ''My Personal Faith'', 1942, Published: London, George Rutledge & Sons, Ltd\n* ''The Apostle'', 1943, novel\n* ''One Destiny: An Epistle to the Christians'', 1945<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kesherjournal.com/Issue-22/Sholem-Asch-One-Destiny-an-Epistle-to-the-Christians#_ftnref1 |title=Sholem Asch, One Destiny: an Epistle to the Christians &#124; Issue 22 |publisher=Kesher Journal |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petahtikvah.com/Articles/OneDestiny.htm |title=One Destiny Part 1 |publisher=Petahtikvah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.petahtikvah.com/Articles/onedes.htm |title=One Destiny Part 2 |publisher=Petahtikvah.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref>\n* ''East River'', 1946,<ref>{{cite book |url={{Google books |id=9esptTJDATUC |plainurl=yes }} |title=East River: A Novel of New York |author=Sholem Asch |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-03-15}}</ref> spent more than 6 months on the [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 1946|New York Times Best Seller List]] (1946\u20137) including one week at #1<ref>[[John Bear]], ''The #1 New York Times Best Seller: intriguing facts about the 484 books that have been #1 New York Times bestsellers since the first list, 50 years ago'', Berkeley: Ten Speed Press, 1992. pp. 21\u201327</ref>\n* ''Tales of My People'', 1948, short stories\n* ''Mary'', 1949, novel, unrelated to his earlier work of the same name\n* ''Salvation'', 1951\n* ''Moses'', 1951, novel\n* ''A Passage in the Night'', 1953\n* ''The Prophet'', 1955\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Discography===\n* ''In the Beginning: Bible Stories for Children by Sholem Asch (Performed by Arna Bontemps)'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1955)\n* ''Joseph and His Brothers: From In the Beginning by Sholem Asch (Performed by Arna Bontemps)'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1955)\n* ''Jewish Classical Literature: Read by Chaim Ostrowsky'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1960)\n* ''Nativity: Sholem Asch's Story of the Birth of Jesus (Performed by [[Pete Seeger]])'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1963)\n* ''Readings from the Bible - Old Testament: Compiled by Sholem Asch (Performed by Harry Fleetwood)'' ([[Folkways Records]], 1972)\n* ''Sholem Asch: A Statement and Lecture at Columbia University, N.Y.

In the process the bell tower was moved from the left side of the entrance to the right.\n\nOne of the stained glass windows was part of a church in [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], which was bombed during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe church bell was originally on a [[Shay locomotive]] owned by the [[Commonwealth Oil Corporation]] that ran on the former [[Newnes railway line|Wolgan Valley Railway]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], before being dismantled in 1925. The bell was presented to the church by the [[Australian Railway Historical Society]] in 1958.\n\nA stone on the church was set by the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], to mark the blessing of the church on 1 June 1958.\n\nThe church contains a rare 1857 Bishop and Starr [[pipe organ]], installed in 1989\u201390 after being transferred from Wealdstone Baptist Church in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], England.\n\nAll Saints maintains a traditional choir, with a weekly sung Solemn Eucharist and a monthly Evensong from April to September.\n\nAt the east end of the church is a garden and [[columbarium]]. The church has several stained glass windows, and gargoyle sculptures on the outside of the building. On the inside stonework are two carved angels. It has two side chapels located on opposite sides of the chancel, one dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the other after [[Gethsemane]].\n\n== Heritage list ==\nThe church was added to the [[Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register]] on 14 September 2000.<ref name=\"All Saints\">{{cite web|url=http://client14.matrix01.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/148267/44.pdf |title=20065.

In the process the bell tower was moved from the left side of the entrance to the right.\n\nOne of the stained glass windows was part of a church in [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], which was bombed during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe church bell was originally on a [[Shay locomotive]] owned by the [[Commonwealth Oil Corporation]] that ran on the former [[Newnes railway line|Wolgan Valley Railway]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], before being dismantled in 1925. The bell was presented to the church by the [[Australian Railway Historical Society]] in 1958.\n\nA stone on the church was set by the High Commissioner for the United Kingdom, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]], to mark the blessing of the church on 1 June 1958.\n\nThe church contains a rare 1857 Bishop and Starr [[pipe organ]], installed in 1989\u201390 after being transferred from Wealdstone Baptist Church in [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]], England.\n\nAll Saints maintains a traditional choir, with a weekly sung Solemn Eucharist and a monthly Evensong from April to September.\n\nAt the east end of the church is a garden and [[columbarium]]. The church has several stained glass windows, and gargoyle sculptures on the outside of the building. On the inside stonework are two carved angels. It has two side chapels located on opposite sides of the chancel, one dedicated to the Virgin Mary and the other after [[Gethsemane]].\n\n== Heritage list ==\nThe church was added to the [[Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register]] on 14 September 2000.<ref name=\"All Saints\">{{cite web|url=http://client14.matrix01.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/148267/44.pdf |title=20065.
