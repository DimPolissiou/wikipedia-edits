We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify the strength and duration of global warming, ocean heating and oxygen depletion.

Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further oxygen depletion, also in the deep ocean.\n</blockquote>\n\nOther research by the Leibniz Institute for Marine Sciences predicts that minimum oxygen zones, particularly in the pacific are expanding, with an estimated total reduction of ocean oxygen levels from 1% to 7% by the end of the century.<ref>[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163855 Ocean Deoxygenation in a Warming World] Ralph F.

We find that climate feedbacks within the Earth system amplify the strength and duration of global warming, ocean heating and oxygen depletion. Decreased oxygen solubility from surface-layer warming accounts for most of the enhanced oxygen depletion in the upper 500 m of the ocean. Possible weakening of ocean overturning and convection lead to further oxygen depletion, also in the deep ocean.\n</blockquote>\n\nOther research by the Leibniz Institute for Marine Sciences predicts that minimum oxygen zones, particularly in the pacific are expanding, with an estimated total reduction of ocean oxygen levels from 1% to 7% by the end of the century.<ref>[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.marine.010908.163855 Ocean Deoxygenation in a Warming World] Ralph F.

The book received both positive reviews, crediting Crews with having assembled a coherent case against Freud's theories and therapeutic techniques, and more mixed evaluations, which criticized Crews for lacking objectivity.\n\n==Summary==\n''Unauthorized Freud'' is a collection of critical articles about [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. In addition to Crews, the contributors include the critic [[Stanley Fish]], the historians [[David Stannard]] and [[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]], the philologist [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]], the philosophers [[Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen]], [[Frank Cioffi]], Barbara Von Eckardt, [[Ernest Gellner]], and [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]], the psychiatrist [[Joseph Wolpe]], the psychoanalyst Rosemarie Sand, and the psychologists Malcolm Macmillan, [[Stanley Rachman]], and [[Frank Sulloway]]. The remaining contributors are Allen Esterson, Fran\u00e7ois Roustang, John Farrell, and Lavinia Edmunds. In his preface, Crews states that the book's purpose is to reevaluate Freud and examine psychoanalysis as a science and that it was composed primarily for \"the general reader\". Though writing that it shows psychoanalysis \"to have been a mistake that grew into an imposture\", he observes that it represents a range of different views, some more critical of Freud and psychoanalysis than others. Crews also writes that all of the features of [[recovered-memory therapy]] were pioneered by Freud, and that it is an example of the harmful influence of psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Crews|1999|pages=ix\u2013277}}\n\nThe contribution from Sulloway is an extract from ''[[Freud, Biologist of the Mind]]'' (1979), while that from Gr\u00fcnbaum is an extract from ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984), and that of Macmillan is an extract from ''[[Freud Evaluated]]'' (1991).{{sfn|Crews|1999|pages=54, 76, 129}}\n\n==Publication history==\n''Unauthorized Freud'' was first published in 1998 by [[Viking Press|Viking Penguin]]. In 1999, it was published by [[Penguin Books]].{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=vi}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Unauthorized Freud'' received positive reviews from Thomas T. Lewis in ''Magill Book Reviews'' and Edward T. Oakes in ''[[First Things]]'',{{sfn|Lewis|1999}}{{sfn|Oakes|1999|pages=38\u201342}} as well as from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''.{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|1998|page=76}} The book received mixed reviews from Adam Bresnick in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'',{{sfn|Bresnick|1998|pages=11\u201312}} Edward V. Stein in ''Pastoral Psychology'',{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=317\u2013318}} and Kurt Jacobsen in ''Psychoanalytic Studies''.{{sfn|Jacobsen|2000|pages=403\u2013404}} The book was also reviewed by Mary Carroll in ''[[Booklist]]'',{{sfn|Carroll|1998|page=1833}} [[Mark Bauerlein]] in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'',{{sfn|Bauerlein|1999|pages=51\u201352}} the critic [[Carol Iannone]] in ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'',{{sfn|Iannone|1999|pages=164\u2013168}} and the psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] in ''[[The BMJ]]''.{{sfn|Healy|1999|page=949}}\n\nLewis described the selections included in the book as \"impressive\". He considered the most interesting contributions to be the \"critical evaluations of Freud's case studies\". He concluded that while some contributions were \"unnecessarily polemical\", they \"add up to a devastating indictment of Freud's theories and therapeutic methods.\"{{sfn|Lewis|1999}} Oakes credited Crews with presenting a detailed case against Freud, writing that it \"would convince all but the most doctrinaire Freudian\", and with showing the links between psychoanalysis and the recovered memory movement. He believed that the contributions it contained made effective criticisms of Freud's use of \"evidence gained in hypnosis and free association\", his \"rewriting of the history of the psychoanalytic movement\", and \"his lazy neurological assumption that infants have brains developed enough to sustain the emotional trauma he attributes to them\". He described the work as \"engrossing\" and \"absorbing and consistently well-argued\".{{sfn|Oakes|1999|pages=38\u201342}}\n\n''Publishers Weekly'' wrote that the essays included in the book presented a \"formidable critique\" of both Freudian theory and practice and Freud's major cases, and credited its contributors with presenting \"compelling evidence that Freud habitually and greatly exaggerated his therapeutic successes\" and with casting serious doubt on \"confidence in free association as a curative tool to decipher the meaning of dreams or to reconstruct events from a patient's distant past.\" While it wrote that the book overstated the case against Freud, it praised the work Crews did in editing it, concluding that he had shaped the selections into a \"cohesive whole\" and \"put psychoanalysis squarely on the defensive.\"{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|1998|page=76}}\n\nBresnick was unconvinced by the book's case against Freud, but nevertheless believed it had redeeming value. He praised the contribution by Swales.{{sfn|Bresnick|1998|pages=11\u201312}} Stein described the book as a \"devastatingly critical assault\" on Freud and psychoanalysis and predicted that it would have a lasting impact.

The book received both positive reviews, crediting Crews with having assembled a coherent case against Freud's theories and therapeutic techniques, and more mixed evaluations, which criticized Crews for lacking objectivity.\n\n==Summary==\n''Unauthorized Freud'' is a collection of critical articles about [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[psychoanalysis]]. In addition to Crews, the contributors include the critic [[Stanley Fish]], the historians [[David Stannard]] and [[Peter Swales (historian)|Peter Swales]], the philologist [[Sebastiano Timpanaro]], the philosophers [[Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen]], [[Frank Cioffi]], Barbara Von Eckardt, [[Ernest Gellner]], and [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]], the psychiatrist [[Joseph Wolpe]], the psychoanalyst Rosemarie Sand, and the psychologists Malcolm Macmillan, [[Stanley Rachman]], and [[Frank Sulloway]]. The remaining contributors are Allen Esterson, Fran\u00e7ois Roustang, John Farrell, and Lavinia Edmunds. In his preface, Crews states that the book's purpose is to reevaluate Freud and examine psychoanalysis as a science and that it was composed primarily for \"the general reader\". Though writing that it shows psychoanalysis \"to have been a mistake that grew into an imposture\", he observes that it represents a range of different views, some more critical of Freud and psychoanalysis than others. Crews also writes that all of the features of [[recovered-memory therapy]] were pioneered by Freud, and that it is an example of the harmful influence of psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Crews|1999|pages=ix\u2013277}}\n\nThe contribution from Sulloway is an extract from ''[[Freud, Biologist of the Mind]]'' (1979), while that from Gr\u00fcnbaum is an extract from ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984), and that of Macmillan is an extract from ''[[Freud Evaluated]]'' (1991).{{sfn|Crews|1999|pages=54, 76, 129}}\n\n==Publication history==\n''Unauthorized Freud'' was first published in 1998 by [[Viking Press|Viking Penguin]]. In 1999, it was published by [[Penguin Books]].{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=vi}}\n\n==Reception==\n''Unauthorized Freud'' received positive reviews from Thomas T. Lewis in ''Magill Book Reviews'' and Edward T. Oakes in ''[[First Things]]'',{{sfn|Lewis|1999}}{{sfn|Oakes|1999|pages=38\u201342}} as well as from ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'',{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|1998|page=76}}. The book received mixed reviews from Adam Bresnick in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'',{{sfn|Bresnick|1998|pages=11\u201312}} Edward V. Stein in ''Pastoral Psychology'',{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=317\u2013318}} and Kurt Jacobsen in ''Psychoanalytic Studies''.{{sfn|Jacobsen|2000|pages=403\u2013404}} The book was also reviewed by Mary Carroll in ''[[Booklist]]'',{{sfn|Carroll|1998|page=1833}} [[Mark Bauerlein]] in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'',{{sfn|Bauerlein|1999|pages=51\u201352}} the critic [[Carol Iannone]] in ''[[Telos (journal)|Telos]]'',{{sfn|Iannone|1999|pages=164\u2013168}} and the psychiatrist [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] in ''[[The BMJ]]''.{{sfn|Healy|1999|page=949}}\n\nLewis described the selections included in the book as \"impressive\". He considered the most interesting contributions to be the \"critical evaluations of Freud's case studies\". He concluded that while some contributions were \"unnecessarily polemical\", they \"add up to a devastating indictment of Freud's theories and therapeutic methods.\"{{sfn|Lewis|1999}} Oakes credited Crews with presenting a detailed case against Freud, writing that it \"would convince all but the most doctrinaire Freudian\", and with showing the links between psychoanalysis and the recovered memory movement. He believed that the contributions it contained made effective criticisms of Freud's use of \"evidence gained in hypnosis and free association\", his \"rewriting of the history of the psychoanalytic movement\", and \"his lazy neurological assumption that infants have brains developed enough to sustain the emotional trauma he attributes to them\". He described the work as \"engrossing\" and \"absorbing and consistently well-argued\".{{sfn|Oakes|1999|pages=38\u201342}}\n\n''Publishers Weekly'' wrote that the essays included in the book presented a \"formidable critique\" of both Freudian theory and practice and Freud's major cases, and credited its contributors with presenting \"compelling evidence that Freud habitually and greatly exaggerated his therapeutic successes\" and with casting serious doubt on \"confidence in free association as a curative tool to decipher the meaning of dreams or to reconstruct events from a patient's distant past.\" While it wrote that the book overstated the case against Freud, it praised the work Crews did in editing it, concluding that he had shaped the selections into a \"cohesive whole\" and \"put psychoanalysis squarely on the defensive.\"{{sfn|''Publishers Weekly''|1998|page=76}}\n\nBresnick was unconvinced by the book's case against Freud, but nevertheless believed it had redeeming value. He praised the contribution by Swales.{{sfn|Bresnick|1998|pages=11\u201312}} Stein described the book as a \"devastatingly critical assault\" on Freud and psychoanalysis and predicted that it would have a lasting impact. He credited its contributors with showing \"the fragility of the classical case studies, the circularity of much of Freud's logic and the degree of Freud's identification with favorable outcomes.\" However, he wrote that it was also malicious, lacking in objectivity, uneven in quality, and showed a lack of appreciation for the opposition Freud had to face and insensitivity toward Freud's inner conflicts. He also observed that only a minority of the contributors had a professional background in psychology of therapy.{{sfn|Stein|1999|pages=317\u2013318}} Jacobsen believed that some of the essays made legitimate criticisms of psychoanalysis.
