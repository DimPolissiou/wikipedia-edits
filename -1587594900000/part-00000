Four of the original trustees\u2019 daughters offered to raise the money needed to open the school, but only if the school agreed to admit qualified women to the university. After several discussions the trustees agreed to their terms and accepted the financial help of these four women, with only one of the doctors, [[William Henry Welch]] resisting. Eventually even Welch changed his views on coeducation, \"The necessity for coeducation in some form,\" he wrote later, \"becomes more evident the higher the character of the education.

His other achievements included the introduction of the surgical glove and advances in thyroid, biliary tree, hernia, intestinal and arterial aneurysm surgeries. Halsted also established the first formal surgical residency training program in the United States.\n\nKelly is credited with establishing gynecology as a true specialty.

After several discussions the trustees agreed to their terms and accepted the financial help of these four women, with only one of the doctors, [[William Henry Welch]] resisting. Eventually even Welch changed his views on coeducation, \"The necessity for coeducation in some form,\" he wrote later, \"becomes more evident the higher the character of the education.

Clinical excellence became measured by a diverse and flexible clinical portfolio to represent the different medical specialties.<ref name=\"Wright 1833\u20131839\"/>\n\nThe Academy's inaugural class became focused on the Department of Medicine, and invited eight physicians to join, with the stipulation that 20 hours of service annual was required to maintain membership. The clinical portfolios of these physicians were reviewed by a body of medical officials comprised across different prestigious medical institutions.<ref name=\"Wright 1833\u20131839\"/>\n\nOn May 8, 2009, the Miller-Coulson Academy officially launched at the inaugural \"Hopkins Symposium for Excellence in Patient Care.\" Since the inception of the program, the Academy remains committed to upholding its ideology in recognizing and promoting excellence in patient care. Each year, the Academy hosts three Department of Medicine Grand Rounds, and a panel of three physicians respond to challenging cases by sharing with the audience their different methods in approaching a specified case indicative of their medical knowledge. The Academy is also refining curriculum aimed at helping clinical faculty achieve clinical excellence.<ref name=\"Wright 1833\u20131839\"/>\n\n== Awards and Recognition ==\n\n* A grade rating for Patient Safety from Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades (November 2018)<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/about/awards_recognitions.html|title=Johns Hopkins Health System \u2013 Awards and Recognitions|last=juliettegoodwin|website=www.hopkinsmedicine.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>\n* Most Wired Designation from [[College of Healthcare Information Management Executives|CHIME]] (November 2018)<ref name=\":4\" />\n* B grade rating for Patient Safety from Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grades (April 2018)<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Excellence Award for Quality Improvements in Hospitals from Delmarva Foundation for Medical Care (2014)<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Center of Excellence for Joint Replacements from National Centers of Excellence Network (October 2013)<ref name=\":4\" />\n* LGBT Healthcare Equity Leader (March 2016)<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== McCarthy Award ===\nThe highest award from the Bayview's Board of Trustees, the McCarthy award is named after William McCarthy, a founding trustee of Johns Hopkins Bayview.

As the threat of polio decreased, hospital leaders planned for a future that included a wider variety of services. Construction began on the new facility in 1965 on land acquired from the City of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe new hospital opened its doors in 1967 with the new name All Children's Hospital. The name was based on the quote by Carl Sandburg, which states \"There is only one child in all the world, and that child's name is all children.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/About-Us/Our-History|title=History - Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital|website=www.hopkinsallchildrens.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, All Children's broke ground on construction of a 240-bed hospital and adjoining outpatient facility.

In 2011, All Children's Hospital joined the Johns Hopkins Health System as a fully integrated member of Johns Hopkins Medicine.

As the threat of polio decreased, hospital leaders planned for a future that included a wider variety of services. Construction began on the new facility in 1965 on land acquired from the City of St. Petersburg.\n\nThe new hospital opened its doors in 1967 with the new name All Children's Hospital. The name was based on the quote by Carl Sandburg, which states \"There is only one child in all the world, and that child's name is all children.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/About-Us/Our-History|title=History - Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital|website=www.hopkinsallchildrens.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, All Children's broke ground on construction of a 240-bed hospital and adjoining outpatient facility. This facility opened in 2010. It consisted of a 10-floor hospital and a seven-floor outpatient care center. In 2011, All Children's Hospital joined the Johns Hopkins Health System as a fully integrated member of Johns Hopkins Medicine. In 2016, the organization changed its name to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital and celebrated its 90th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|title = All Children\u2019s Hospital Celebrates 90 Years and Changes Name to Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital|url = https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/ach-news/press-release/all-children%E2%80%99s-hospital-celebrates-90-years-and-ch|website = www.hopkinsallchildrens.org|accessdate = 2018-01-22}}</ref> Also in 2016, it broke ground on a $95-million Research and Education Building, which will become home to the institutes, house a new pediatric biorepository, provide lab and simulation training space, and encourage collaboration among clinicians, researchers, faculty and trainees. It will open in the fall of 2018.\n\nIn addition to the outpatient care center in St. Petersburg, the hospital has outpatient locations along Florida's west coast in Brandon, East Lake, Fort Myers, Lakeland, North Port, Pasco, Sarasota, South Tampa and Tampa.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Locations - Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital|url = https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/locations|website = www.hopkinsallchildrens.org|accessdate = 2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\n== Affiliations ==\nJohns Hopkins All Children's has 11 outpatient care centers in six counties on Florida's west coast and affiliations and collaborations with community and regional hospitals where Johns Hopkins All Children's physicians and protocols have direct impact on patient care.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/locations|title=Locations - Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital|website=www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/|accessdate=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nAn exclusive affiliation with AdventHealth Tampa that started in 2016 allows doctors from All Children's Specialty Physicians to provide pediatric care in cardiology, critical care, endocrinology, hematology/oncology, hospital medicine, general surgery, neonatology and pulmonology at that hospital.

In the room, they were told that they were all nominated for eviction, however they were given a dilemma - should one of three elect to press the red button, the trio would be freed from the room and save the other two from being nominated.

In the room, they were told that they were all nominated for eviction, however they were given a dilemma - should one of three elect to press the red button, the trio would be freed from the room and save the other two from being nominated.
