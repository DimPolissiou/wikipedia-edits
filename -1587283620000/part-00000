(Riley credits [[Barry Michael Cooper]] for giving it its name.)<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Hogan, Paul. \"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p118768/biography|pure_url=yes}} Teddy Riley biography]\" [[Allmusic]] Retrieved on September 19, 2009</ref> \n\nHe fused hip hop and R&B in his production work with artists including [[Michael Jackson]], [[Bobby Brown]], [[Keith Sweat]], [[Samantha Mumba]], [[Doug E. Fresh]], [[Today (band)|Today]], [[Heavy D|Heavy D & the Boyz]], [[Hi-Five]], [[Men of Vizion]] and [[Profyle]], as well as his spearheaded groups [[Guy (band)|Guy]] and [[Blackstreet]]. Riley's consistency and drum ideas had some influence on modern-day R&B, which since him contained more samples and rapping segments as well as singing, a practice which in part was reminiscent of the [[Jackson family]]. Along with [[Neo Soul]] style of singers such as [[Marvin Gaye]], he has had a seminal influence on [[Gospel music|gospel]] and [[R&B]] music, which became more open to using rap and sound effects in their recordings.\n\n==Early life==\nTeddy Riley was raised in [[St. Nicholas Houses]] in [[Harlem]]. A [[child prodigy]] from the age of five, he began playing instruments in church. His uncle, who owned the famed Harlem club The Rooftop, built a studio in the club in which Riley would spend most of his time while growing up.

Non-shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences that differ between twins in the same family) explain most of the variance in key components of the condition such as the fear of illness and disease conviction. In contrast, the contribution of shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences shared by twins in the same family) to hypochondriasis is approximately zero.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough little is known about exactly which non-shared environmental factors typically contribute to causing hypochondriasis, certain factors such as exposure to illness-related information are widely believed to lead to short-term increases in health anxiety and to have contributed to hypochondriasis in individual cases. Overly protective caregivers and an excessive focus on minor health concerns have also been implicated as potential causes of hypochondriasis.<ref>\"Hypochondriasis.\" CareNotes. Thomson Healthcare, Inc., 2011. Health Reference Center Academic. Retrieved April 5, 2012.{{vs|date=March 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the media and on the Internet, articles, TV shows and advertisements regarding serious illnesses such as [[cancer]] and [[multiple sclerosis]] often portray these diseases as being random, obscure and somewhat inevitable. In the short term, inaccurate portrayal of risk and the identification of [[non-specific symptom]]s as signs of serious illness may contribute to exacerbating a fear of illness. Major disease outbreaks or predicted [[pandemics]] can have similar effects.\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that it is common for serious illnesses or deaths of family members or friends to trigger hypochondria in certain individuals. Similarly, when approaching the age of a parent's premature death from disease, many otherwise healthy, happy individuals fall prey to hypochondria. These individuals believe they are suffering from the same disease that caused their parent's death, sometimes causing panic attacks with corresponding symptoms.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe [[ICD-10]] defines hypochondriasis as follows:\n:A. Either one of the following:\n::* A persistent belief, of at least six months' duration, of the presence of a minimum of two serious physical diseases (of which at least one must be specifically named by the patient).\n::* A persistent preoccupation with a presumed deformity or disfigurement ([[body dysmorphic disorder]]).\n\n:B. Preoccupation with the belief and the symptoms causes persistent distress or interference with personal functioning in daily living, and leads the patient to seek medical treatment or investigations (or equivalent help from local healers).\n\n:C. Persistent refusal to accept medical advice that there is no adequate physical cause for the symptoms or physical abnormality, except for short periods of up to a few weeks at a time immediately after or during medical investigations.\n\n:D. Most commonly used exclusion criteria: not occurring only during any of the [[schizophrenia]] and related disorders (F20\u2013F29, particularly F22) or any of the [[mood disorders]] (F30\u2013F39).\n\nThe [[DSM-IV]] defines hypochondriasis according to the following criteria:<ref name=\"American Psychiatric Association\" />\n<blockquote>\nA. Preoccupation with fears of having, or the idea that one has, a serious disease based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. <br />\nB. The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance. <br />\nC. The belief in Criterion A is not of delusional intensity (as in [[Delusional Disorder]], Somatic Type) and is not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance (as in [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]]). <br />\nD. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. <br />\nE. The duration of the disturbance is at least 6 months. <br />\nF. The preoccupation is not better accounted for by [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]], [[Panic Disorder]], a [[Major Depressive Episode]], [[Separation anxiety disorder|Separation Anxiety]], or another Somatoform Disorder.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the fifth version of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]), most who met criteria for [[DSM-IV]] hypochondriasis instead meet criteria for a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) or illness anxiety disorder (IAD).<ref name=\"mayoclinic.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Saddam Hussein in 1996.png|thumb|[[Saddam Hussein]] was a severe hypochondriac. He would have doctors check him every two or three days and was known react to a small cut or bruise as if he were going to die.]]\n\n===Classification===\nThe classification of hypochondriasis in relation to other psychiatric disorders has long been a topic of scholarly debate, and has differed widely between different diagnostic systems and influential publications.\n\nIn the case of the DSM, the first and second versions listed hypochondriasis as a neurosis, whereas the third and fourth versions listed hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The current version of the DSM (DSM-5) lists somatic symptom disorder (SSD) under the heading of \"somatic symptom and related disorders\", and illness anxiety disorder (IAD) under both this heading and as an anxiety disorder.\n\nThe ICD-10, like the third and fourth versions of the DSM, lists hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The ICD-11, however, lists hypochondriasis under the heading of \"obsessive-compulsive or related disorders\".\n\nThere are also numerous influential scientific publications which have argued for other classifications of hypochondriasis. Notably, since the early 1990s, it has become increasingly common to regard hypochondriasis as an anxiety disorder, and to refer to the condition as \"health anxiety\" or \"severe health anxiety\".\n\n==Treatment==\nMost research indicates that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is an effective treatment for hypochondriasis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olatunji BO, Kauffman BY, Meltzer S, Davis ML, Smits JA, Powers MB | title = Cognitive-behavioral therapy for hypochondriasis/health anxiety: a meta-analysis of treatment outcome and moderators | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 58 | issue =  | pages = 65\u201374 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24954212 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2014.05.002 }}</ref><ref name=\"bouman\" /> Much of this research is limited by methodological issues.<ref name=\"bouman\">{{cite journal |last1=Bouman |first1=Theo K. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Narrative Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=58\u201369 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119010612}}</ref> A small amount of evidence suggests that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] can also reduce symptoms, but further research is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Louw |first1=Kerry-Ann |last2=Hoare |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=70\u20134 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119004750}}</ref> In some cases, hypochondriasis responds well to [[antipsychotic]]s, particularly the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]] medications.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor S, Thordarson DS, Jang KL, Asmundson GJ|year=2006|title=Genetic and environmental origins of health anxiety: a twin study|url=|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47\u201350|doi=|pmid=16757996|pmc=1472263}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Harth |first2=Uwe |last2=Gieler |first3=Daniel |last3=Kusnir |first4=Francisco A. |last4=Tausk | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |chapter=Hypochondriacal Delusions |chapterurl={{google books|NHnEMdgKJbIC|page=36|plainurl=yes}} |page=36 |title=Clinical Management in Psychodermatology |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-34718-7 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAmong the [[abdomen#Regions|regions of the abdomen]], the [[hypochondrium]] is the uppermost part.

Non-shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences that differ between twins in the same family) explain most of the variance in key components of the condition such as the fear of illness and disease conviction. In contrast, the contribution of shared environmental factors (i.e., experiences shared by twins in the same family) to hypochondriasis is approximately zero.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAlthough little is known about exactly which non-shared environmental factors typically contribute to causing hypochondriasis, certain factors such as exposure to illness-related information are widely believed to lead to short-term increases in health anxiety and to have contributed to hypochondriasis in individual cases. Overly protective caregivers and an excessive focus on minor health concerns have also been implicated as potential causes of hypochondriasis.<ref>\"Hypochondriasis.\" CareNotes.

In the short term, inaccurate portrayal of risk and the identification of [[non-specific symptom]]s as signs of serious illness may contribute to exacerbating a fear of illness. Major disease outbreaks or predicted [[pandemics]] can have similar effects.\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence that it is common for serious illnesses or deaths of family members or friends to trigger hypochondria in certain individuals. Similarly, when approaching the age of a parent's premature death from disease, many otherwise healthy, happy individuals fall prey to hypochondria. These individuals believe they are suffering from the same disease that caused their parent's death, sometimes causing panic attacks with corresponding symptoms.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe [[ICD-10]] defines hypochondriasis as follows:\n:A. Either one of the following:\n::* A persistent belief, of at least six months' duration, of the presence of a minimum of two serious physical diseases (of which at least one must be specifically named by the patient).\n::* A persistent preoccupation with a presumed deformity or disfigurement ([[body dysmorphic disorder]]).\n\n:B. Preoccupation with the belief and the symptoms causes persistent distress or interference with personal functioning in daily living, and leads the patient to seek medical treatment or investigations (or equivalent help from local healers).\n\n:C. Persistent refusal to accept medical advice that there is no adequate physical cause for the symptoms or physical abnormality, except for short periods of up to a few weeks at a time immediately after or during medical investigations.\n\n:D. Most commonly used exclusion criteria: not occurring only during any of the [[schizophrenia]] and related disorders (F20\u2013F29, particularly F22) or any of the [[mood disorders]] (F30\u2013F39).\n\nThe [[DSM-IV]] defines hypochondriasis according to the following criteria:<ref name=\"American Psychiatric Association\" />\n<blockquote>\nA. Preoccupation with fears of having, or the idea that one has, a serious disease based on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. <br />\nB. The preoccupation persists despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance. <br />\nC. The belief in Criterion A is not of delusional intensity (as in [[Delusional Disorder]], Somatic Type) and is not restricted to a circumscribed concern about appearance (as in [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]]). <br />\nD. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in\nsocial, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. <br />\nE. The duration of the disturbance is at least 6 months. <br />\nF. The preoccupation is not better accounted for by [[Generalized Anxiety Disorder]], [[Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder]], [[Panic Disorder]], a [[Major Depressive Episode]], [[Separation anxiety disorder|Separation Anxiety]], or another Somatoform Disorder.\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the fifth version of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]), most who met criteria for [[DSM-IV]] hypochondriasis instead meet criteria for a diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (SSD) or illness anxiety disorder (IAD).<ref name=\"mayoclinic.org\"/>\n\n[[File:Saddam Hussein in 1996.png|thumb|[[Saddam Hussein]] was a severe hypochondriac. He would have doctors check him every two or three days and was known react to a small cut or bruise as if he were going to die.]]\n\n===Classification===\nThe classification of hypochondriasis in relation to other psychiatric disorders has long been a topic of scholarly debate, and has differed widely between different diagnostic systems and influential publications.\n\nIn the case of the DSM, the first and second versions listed hypochondriasis as a neurosis, whereas the third and fourth versions listed hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The current version of the DSM (DSM-5) lists somatic symptom disorder (SSD) under the heading of \"somatic symptom and related disorders\", and illness anxiety disorder (IAD) under both this heading and as an anxiety disorder.\n\nThe ICD-10, like the third and fourth versions of the DSM, lists hypochondriasis as a somatoform disorder. The ICD-11, however, lists hypochondriasis under the heading of \"obsessive-compulsive or related disorders\".\n\nThere are also numerous influential scientific publications which have argued for other classifications of hypochondriasis. Notably, since the early 1990s, it has become increasingly common to regard hypochondriasis as an anxiety disorder, and to refer to the condition as \"health anxiety\" or \"severe health anxiety\".\n\n==Treatment==\nMost research indicates that [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) is an effective treatment for hypochondriasis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olatunji BO, Kauffman BY, Meltzer S, Davis ML, Smits JA, Powers MB | title = Cognitive-behavioral therapy for hypochondriasis/health anxiety: a meta-analysis of treatment outcome and moderators | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 58 | issue =  | pages = 65\u201374 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 24954212 | doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2014.05.002 }}</ref><ref name=\"bouman\" /> Much of this research is limited by methodological issues.<ref name=\"bouman\">{{cite journal |last1=Bouman |first1=Theo K. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Psychological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Narrative Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=58\u201369 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119010612}}</ref> A small amount of evidence suggests that [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] can also reduce symptoms, but further research is needed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Louw |first1=Kerry-Ann |last2=Hoare |first2=Jacqueline |last3=Stein |first3=Dan J | name-list-format = vanc |title=Pharmacological Treatments for Hypochondriasis: A Review |journal=Current Psychiatry Reviews |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2014 |pages=70\u20134 |doi=10.2174/1573400509666131119004750}}</ref> In some cases, hypochondriasis responds well to [[antipsychotic]]s, particularly the newer [[atypical antipsychotic]] medications.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Taylor S, Thordarson DS, Jang KL, Asmundson GJ|year=2006|title=Genetic and environmental origins of health anxiety: a twin study|url=|journal=World Psychiatry|volume=5|issue=1|pages=47\u201350|doi=|pmid=16757996|pmc=1472263}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Harth |first2=Uwe |last2=Gieler |first3=Daniel |last3=Kusnir |first4=Francisco A. |last4=Tausk | name-list-format = vanc |year=2008 |chapter=Hypochondriacal Delusions |chapterurl={{google books|NHnEMdgKJbIC|page=36|plainurl=yes}} |page=36 |title=Clinical Management in Psychodermatology |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-34718-7 }}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nAmong the [[abdomen#Regions|regions of the abdomen]], the [[hypochondrium]] is the uppermost part.

We stand for the creation of a society organised both to meet the needs of the entire population, and to ensure the fullest possible development of every individual.\"<ref name=\"What We Stand For\">[[#RCG|Revolutionary Communist Group]].</ref> Emphasising a campaign against [[capitalism]] and the oppression of the working class, the group is also highly critical of British foreign policy, which they consider to be [[imperialism|imperialistic]] in nature. In particular, they criticise British control of [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], the involvement of British troops in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the British government's support for [[Israel]].<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nBelieving that the British electoral system under capitalism cannot bring about any real change in society, and as it does not consider itself a party (believing that a communist party, led by a vanguard of the proletariat, has not yet developed in Britain), the RCG has not taken part in elections since 1979. The group also publish their own newspaper, which now appears every two months, entitled '''''Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!''''', which has been running since November\u2013December 1979.\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\n===Marxist position===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The RCG believes that the way for human society to progress \u2013 or even to survive \u2013 is for [[capitalism]] to be destroyed. The British ruling class will never allow the system which maintains its domination to be wished or voted away \u2013 it will take a [[revolution]] led by the working class. The only alternative to capitalism is [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]: a conscious and organised process of constructing society in which people cooperate in order to meet their needs rather than serve the dictates of private profits; a society enabling the full development of every individual rather than privilege for a few.\"\n|source=Statement by the RCG.<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n| align = right\n| width = 246px\n| bgcolor = #C0C0C0\n}}\nThe Revolutionary Communist Group is a [[communism|communist]] organisation. It believes that the United Kingdom is a [[Bourgeoisie|dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]] (i.e., a state where the ruling [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]] control the economic and political powers to the detriment of the working class, in this case through a [[representative democracy]]), and believe that the only real way to enact social change is for the working class to take power in a [[revolution]], thereby establishing a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (i.e., a state ruled through [[participatory democracy]] by the working class for the benefit of the masses).<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nWriting in 2007, the British Trotskyist group Permanent Revolution characterised the RCG's position as being \"distinctive on the British left by their open espousal of left [[Stalinism]], which essentially consists of an uncritical support for the leadership of anti-imperialist struggles, an uncritical support for the Cuban regime, a completely undemocratic internal structure, an active participation in anti-racist struggles and complete rejection of any united front work within the British labour movement, trade unions or Labour Party.\"<ref>[[#Per07|Permanent Revolution 2007]].</ref> Group members see this as a caricature of the RCG, and instead claim that the RCG is a democratic-centralist organisation in the Leninist tradition.\n\n=== Criticism of British imperialism ===\nThe RCG believes that the United Kingdom has been an imperialist power since the end of the nineteenth century, stating that \"Britain is the oldest imperialist country in the world. It was the first to develop into finance monopoly capitalism \u2013 imperialism, and is still a major imperialist power, second only to the United States. Britain's imperialist character has been decisive in determining British economic, social and political developments.\" In this way they believe that the British state has interfered in foreign affairs, historically through the [[British Empire]] and continuing through foreign wars and corporate dominance, to the detriment to the working class masses living in these countries.<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nThe group supports revolutionary national democratic governments in various [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]] countries such as the [[Bolivarianism|Bolivarian]] government of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela, and the government of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia. It supports socialist Cuba and the socialist government of Cuba. The RCG believes that such movements in alliance with Cuba have the ability to radically help the working class masses living in these nations, and fight against the imperialism of the United Kingdom, United States and other [[First World]] states who use them for cheap labour. As they make clear on their website, \"The resistance movements in the oppressed nations are weakening imperialism; an anti-imperialist movement in this country in unity with these struggles can deal a decisive blow against British imperialism and the British ruling class. For this reason the RCG has always given complete and unconditional support to liberation movements fighting imperialism and we support their right to carry out their struggles by any means necessary.\"<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nThe RCG argues that socialists should not give their support to the centre/centre-left [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which is one of the major political parties in the United Kingdom. On this subject, David Yaffe stated the RCG's position that \"no anti-imperialist or socialist movement can be built unless the British left makes a fundamental and irrevocable break with the British Labour Party.\" He went on to characterise the party's policies in government as being \"openly racist, imperialist and warmongering\".<ref name=\"Yaffe 2004-2005\">[[#Yaf04-05|Yaffe 2004-2005]].</ref> At the same time it has remained critical of other socialist organisations in Britain such as the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]], the [[International Marxist Group]] and the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] for what it sees as being \"major obstacle[s]\" to the building of an anti-imperialist movement in Britain. This is because many of these groups denounced the governments of socialist states such as the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, and instead encouraged their members to vote for the Labour Party.<ref name=\"Yaffe 2004-2005\"/>\n\n=== Criticism of racism, immigration controls and discrimination ===\n\nThe RCG has been firmly critical of [[racism]] and particularly the racism of the British government and state. It has supported groups of [[black nationalism|black nationalists]] in the United States in their attempt to defend themselves from racist attacks. It also opposes any constraints on [[immigration]], believing that any constraints on immigration are inherently racist in an imperialist country. It also criticises all other forms of discrimination in society, stating that \"We oppose all discrimination against anyone on grounds of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability.\"<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years: 1970-1976===\nDeveloping in the early 1970s, the RCG grew out of the \"Revolutionary Opposition\" faction of the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (IS), (forerunners of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]), being strongly influenced by the politics of Roy Tearse. When the leading figures of the \"Revolutionary Opposition\", the name itself only first appearing in print in their appeal document, were expelled from the IS its members met to decide on their course of action, and disagreements between Tearse's allies and the majority of the faction around David Yaffe rapidly surfaced. The result was that Tearse's supporters formed the Discussion Group which led a quiet life for a number of years inside the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] before dissolving. Meanwhile, Yaffe and his comrades proceeded to found the Revolutionary Communist Group in 1974.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Revolutionary Communist No 1 October 1974 p14</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the RCG began publishing a theoretical journal called ''Revolutionary Communist'' in which it in part espoused a view of [[crisis theory]], a theme they had already addressed in the IS when challenging the work of the theoreticians of that group.<ref>[http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/marxism.html ''Revolutionary Communist'']</ref> They developed [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s analysis of the [[labour aristocracy]], and showed its relevance for politics in the period after the Second World War.  Their conclusions led them to call for no vote for the Labour Party.\n\nThe early years of the RCG saw the group lose a large part of its initial membership. For example, in September 1975 the Birmingham branch decamped in order to join the [[Workers' Socialist League]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[File:Frank Furedi by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|Hungarian sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] was an early member of the RCG before being ejected in 1976, following which he founding the Revolutionary Communist Tendency. In later life he rejected socialism and became a [[libertarianism|libertarian]].]]\nA few years after the RCG's foundation, disagreements emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as [[Stalinism]] and the South African government. One group, dominated by [[Frank Furedi]] (1947-), a sociologist at the [[University of Kent]] who used the pseudonym of \"Frank Richards\", began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been \"organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru\".<ref name=\"Beckett\">[[#Bec99|Beckett 1999]].</ref> In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which they went on to form their own rival organisation, the [[Revolutionary Communist Tendency]] (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members.<ref name=\"Leversha 26\">[[#Lev78|Leversha 1978]]. p. 26.</ref> Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (Furedi)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] in 1981, and would publish the magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]'' from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from [[Leninism]] to [[Libertarian Marxism]].<ref name=\"Beckett\"/>\n\nThe RCG recognised the progressive role played by some of the traditional communist parties such as the [[South African Communist Party]] and from that position developed into a more orthodox communist grouping supporting the [[socialist]] revolution in [[Cuba]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nWhilst many self-proclaimed [[socialist]] organisations, especially those regarding themselves as Trotskyist, in the UK welcomed the demise of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and then of the [[Soviet Union]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Reed|first=David|title=Uphold the banner of communism|newspaper=Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!|date=October\u2013November 1991|author2=Eddie Abrahams}}</ref>  the RCG argued that these events were [[counterrevolutionary]] and constituted a setback in the [[class struggle]] internationally because many [[national liberation]] movements and socialist states in the [[Third World]] were supported by the Soviet Union and the [[Comecon]]. The RCG believed that while the Soviet Union was a [[socialist state]], as a result of both internal developments in the Soviet Union itself and the reactionary role of working class parties (social democratic and communist) in the imperialist countries, the revolution degenerated and the communist party became an elite party separate from the working class. These developments laid the foundation for the counterrevolution between 1989-91.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Solidarity with Ireland and South Africa: 1977-1989===\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the RCG became heavily involved in support for the [[Ireland|Irish]] national liberation struggle, working with the Prisoners Aid Committee, [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Troops Out Movement]] (TOM), and focusing particularly on support for [[Irish republican]] prisoners held in British prisons. The analysis which the RCG developed through this work, on the role of national liberation movements in opposing [[imperialism]], laid the foundations for much of its later positions, and its relationship to the rest of the British [[Left-wing politics|left]]. Unlike many other left organisations, the RCG consistently argued that British troops had no progressive role to play in Ireland, and called for total support for the Republican movement in the struggle against British imperialism. Their involvement with the prisoner support groups established a tradition of outspoken support for prison struggles which has continued to the present, with a page of every issue of their newspaper dealing with prison conditions and struggles. In 1990, when prisoners at [[Strangeways]] (see [[1990 Strangeways Prison riot]]) took over the prison in protest at conditions, the RCG was active together with other groups supporting them on the outside, and later published a book, 'Strangeways: A Serious Disturbance', largely written by prisoners and former prisoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Nicki|title=Strangeways 1990: a serious disturbance|year=1995|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0 905400 18 6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, the RCG's most notable activity was its participation in the non-stop picket of the [[South Africa]]n embassy in [[London]] calling for the release of [[Nelson Mandela]].  This was organized by the [[City of London Anti-Apartheid Group]], within which the RCG played a leading role alongside elements of the [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]], the [[Humanist Party (UK)|Humanist Party]] and members of the Kitson family. City AA, as it became known, had been founded by [[Norma Kitson]], the wife of the South African Communist activist David Kitson who served 19 years and 5 months in prison in a South African prison for his work in the National High Command of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), the military wing of the [[African National Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Gavin|title=The ANC, the Kitsons and the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group|url=http://nonstopagainstapartheid.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/the-anc-the-kitsons-and-the-city-of-london-anti-apartheid-group-anc100years/|work=Non-Stop Against Apartheid|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nCity AA was eventually expelled by the national leadership of the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], over differences centering on City Group's insistence on making the link between British support for apartheid in South Africa, and racism within Britain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brickley|first=Carol|title=South Africa - Britain out of Apartheid; Apartheid out of Britain|year=1985|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0-905400-07-0|url=http://revolutionarycommunist.org/images/pdf/rcg_south_africa_pamphlet_lq.pdf|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant campaign during the 1980s was the [[Viraj Mendis]] Defence Campaign, against the deportation of one of the group's members to [[Sri Lanka]]. This developed into a high-profile national campaign involving people from left-wing groups such as the RCG, local residents of [[Manchester]], and extending to church leaders and Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign|title=Viraj Mendis Will Stay!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mxTPnEdEsg|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Solidarity with Cuba and Palestine: 1990-present ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RCG Cuba badge.JPG|150px|thumb|Badge produced by the RCG to express solidarity with the socialist governments of Cuba and Venezuela.]] -->\n\nIn 1995 the RCG set up [[Rock Around the Blockade]] (RATB), a solidarity organisation with the Cuban Revolution. As well as campaigning on issues such as the [[United States|US]] economic [[blockade]] and the [[Cuban Five]], and sending political solidarity brigades to Cuba, RATB raised funds to take sound systems out to Cuba. These were used with young people in cultural and political work, and the RATB has donated five sound systems over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rock Around the Blockade|title=The streets are ours: Revolutionary Cuba|year=2001|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0-905400-19-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 three members were asked to leave or resign because of what were described as their reactionary [[ultra-left]] views. One example of the division was over the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th attacks in 2001]], which the three people who left viewed as a victory against imperialism. They had previously alleged that the leadership was bureaucratic and failing to train the membership in [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The three left to form Communist Forum, often known by the name of their newsletter, ''Fightback''. They have ceased to be active.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nFollowing the start of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|second intifada]] in September 2000, in October the RCG joined a group which had begun to picket [[Marks and Spencer]] in Manchester over their support for [[Israel]], and helped to spread this to other cities. Over the next six years pickets of Marks and Spencer were held in places including [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Rochdale]], [[Nottingham]], [[Leicester]], across London, Stratford and [[Brighton]]. Throughout this period the flagship store on [[Oxford Street]] in London was picketed weekly, and in many other places pickets were sustained on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donovan|first=Fiona|title=10 years of boycotting M&S|url=http://revolutionarycommunist.org/index.php/palestine/1926-10-years-of-boycotting-mas-frfi-217-octnov-2010|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Fight Racism!

There would be cuts in state benefits, central government departments and a 26% reduction in central government funding for local government. In its newspaper, the RCG said the ruling class \"has declared class war.\".<ref>FRFI 218, December 2010/January 2011</ref> The RCG adopted a slogan \"No cuts \u2013 full stop!\" It condemned Labour-run councils implementing the cuts. It described Labour councillors voting for such cuts as \"class enemies\", opposing any alliance with them against the coalition government. It criticised those on the left who sought unity at any price with such politicians.<ref>FRFI 219, February/March 2011</ref>\n\nAs a part of the government cuts, the coalition announced plans to simultaneously cut much university funding and dramatically increase the tuition fees charged to students. This move led to [[2010 UK student protests|widespread student protests taking place in November and December 2010]], during which demonstrators occupied the central [[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham Room]] in [[University College London]] (UCL) for several weeks. The protesting UCL students (some of whom were RCG members or supporters) organised a panel discussion to be held during which representatives from several leftist organisations (including the RCG's David Yaffe as well as figures from the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], [[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)|Socialist Appeal]] and [[Workers Power (UK)|Workers Power]]) discussed the reforms then being made by the government and university authorities to higher education in Britain.<ref>[[#RCG10|Revolutionary Communist Group 2010]].</ref>\n\n===Allegation of sexual harassment (2017)===\n\nIn October 2017 the RCG posted on their website \"The Revolutionary Communist Group is aware of a historic allegation of sexual harassment by a member of the organisation. The RCG views such allegations with utmost seriousness. The comrade involved has been suspended from membership and will remain suspended until an internal enquiry completes an investigation into the matter and reports with recommendations on further action\".<ref>http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/9-uncategorised/5056-our-311217</ref> At the end of that year in December, the RCG updated on their website \"Following an investigation and a period of suspension, the comrade has been reinstated as of 1 January 2018. The comrade understands that his actions were unacceptable for a communist and a member of the RCG. Through the process we have undertaken, his consciousness and behaviour has changed, and continues to change to the extent that we have decided he can now be readmitted as a full member. The RCG takes seriously the sexism, discrimination and exploitation women face and is committed to building an organisation that opposes all such oppression.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Revolutionary Communist Group|title=Update on RCG statement regarding sexual harassment (31st Decembers)|url=http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/9-uncategorised/5056-our-311217|accessdate=4 January 2018|website=revolutionarycommunist.org|date=31 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n Despite it's claims of taking such issues seriously the suspended comrade was reinstated shortly afterwards despite breaching the terms of suspension and despite the fact that another allegation came to light regarding the same comrade. The RCG leadership stood by the comrade despite a mass exodus of members who did not agree with the RCG's position or its actions on this matter. The RCG has since been in decline as it has become more and more culty and unable and unwilling to engage in debate either internally or externally. It introduced totalitarian, sexist and ableist measures in response to the exodus. It has not updated it's core position on women and LGBTQ rights for decades.\n\n== Fight Racism!

We stand for the creation of a society organised both to meet the needs of the entire population, and to ensure the fullest possible development of every individual.\"<ref name=\"What We Stand For\">[[#RCG|Revolutionary Communist Group]].</ref> Emphasising a campaign against [[capitalism]] and the oppression of the working class, the group is also highly critical of British foreign policy, which they consider to be [[imperialism|imperialistic]] in nature. In particular, they criticise British control of [[Northern Ireland]] and the [[Falkland Islands]], the involvement of British troops in [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the British government's support for [[Israel]].<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nBelieving that the British electoral system under capitalism cannot bring about any real change in society, and as it does not consider itself a party (believing that a communist party, led by a vanguard of the proletariat, has not yet developed in Britain), the RCG has not taken part in elections since 1979. The group also publish their own newspaper, which now appears every two months, entitled '''''Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!''''', which has been running since November\u2013December 1979.\n\n== Political ideology ==\n\n===Marxist position===\n{{Quote box\n| quote = \"The RCG believes that the way for human society to progress \u2013 or even to survive \u2013 is for [[capitalism]] to be destroyed. The British ruling class will never allow the system which maintains its domination to be wished or voted away \u2013 it will take a [[revolution]] led by the working class. The only alternative to capitalism is [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]]: a conscious and organised process of constructing society in which people cooperate in order to meet their needs rather than serve the dictates of private profits; a society enabling the full development of every individual rather than privilege for a few.\"\n|source=Statement by the RCG.<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n| align = right\n| width = 246px\n| bgcolor = #C0C0C0\n}}\nThe Revolutionary Communist Group is a [[communism|communist]] organisation. It believes that the United Kingdom is a [[Bourgeoisie|dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]] (i.e., a state where the ruling [[Bourgeoisie|capitalist class]] control the economic and political powers to the detriment of the working class, in this case through a [[representative democracy]]), and believe that the only real way to enact social change is for the working class to take power in a [[revolution]], thereby establishing a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (i.e., a state ruled through [[participatory democracy]] by the working class for the benefit of the masses).<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nWriting in 2007, the British Trotskyist group Permanent Revolution characterised the RCG's position as being \"distinctive on the British left by their open espousal of left [[Stalinism]], which essentially consists of an uncritical support for the leadership of anti-imperialist struggles, an uncritical support for the Cuban regime, a completely undemocratic internal structure, an active participation in anti-racist struggles and complete rejection of any united front work within the British labour movement, trade unions or Labour Party.\"<ref>[[#Per07|Permanent Revolution 2007]].</ref> Group members see this as a caricature of the RCG, and instead claim that the RCG is a democratic-centralist organisation in the Leninist tradition.\n\n=== Criticism of British imperialism ===\nThe RCG believes that the United Kingdom has been an imperialist power since the end of the nineteenth century, stating that \"Britain is the oldest imperialist country in the world. It was the first to develop into finance monopoly capitalism \u2013 imperialism, and is still a major imperialist power, second only to the United States. Britain's imperialist character has been decisive in determining British economic, social and political developments.\" In this way they believe that the British state has interfered in foreign affairs, historically through the [[British Empire]] and continuing through foreign wars and corporate dominance, to the detriment to the working class masses living in these countries.<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nThe group supports revolutionary national democratic governments in various [[Third World|Third]] and [[Second World]] countries such as the [[Bolivarianism|Bolivarian]] government of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela, and the government of [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia. It supports socialist Cuba and the socialist government of Cuba. The RCG believes that such movements in alliance with Cuba have the ability to radically help the working class masses living in these nations, and fight against the imperialism of the United Kingdom, United States and other [[First World]] states who use them for cheap labour. As they make clear on their website, \"The resistance movements in the oppressed nations are weakening imperialism; an anti-imperialist movement in this country in unity with these struggles can deal a decisive blow against British imperialism and the British ruling class. For this reason the RCG has always given complete and unconditional support to liberation movements fighting imperialism and we support their right to carry out their struggles by any means necessary.\"<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\nThe RCG argues that socialists should not give their support to the centre/centre-left [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which is one of the major political parties in the United Kingdom. On this subject, David Yaffe stated the RCG's position that \"no anti-imperialist or socialist movement can be built unless the British left makes a fundamental and irrevocable break with the British Labour Party.\" He went on to characterise the party's policies in government as being \"openly racist, imperialist and warmongering\".<ref name=\"Yaffe 2004-2005\">[[#Yaf04-05|Yaffe 2004-2005]].</ref> At the same time it has remained critical of other socialist organisations in Britain such as the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]], [[Militant (Trotskyist group)|Militant]], the [[International Marxist Group]] and the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] for what it sees as being \"major obstacle[s]\" to the building of an anti-imperialist movement in Britain. This is because many of these groups denounced the governments of socialist states such as the Soviet Union, China and Cuba, and instead encouraged their members to vote for the Labour Party.<ref name=\"Yaffe 2004-2005\"/>\n\n=== Criticism of racism, immigration controls and discrimination ===\n\nThe RCG has been firmly critical of [[racism]] and particularly the racism of the British government and state. It has supported groups of [[black nationalism|black nationalists]] in the United States in their attempt to defend themselves from racist attacks. It also opposes any constraints on [[immigration]], believing that any constraints on immigration are inherently racist in an imperialist country. It also criticises all other forms of discrimination in society, stating that \"We oppose all discrimination against anyone on grounds of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation and disability.\"<ref name=\"What We Stand For\"/>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years: 1970-1976===\nDeveloping in the early 1970s, the RCG grew out of the \"Revolutionary Opposition\" faction of the [[International Socialists (UK)|International Socialists]] (IS), (forerunners of the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]]), being strongly influenced by the politics of Roy Tearse. When the leading figures of the \"Revolutionary Opposition\", the name itself only first appearing in print in their appeal document, were expelled from the IS its members met to decide on their course of action, and disagreements between Tearse's allies and the majority of the faction around David Yaffe rapidly surfaced. The result was that Tearse's supporters formed the Discussion Group which led a quiet life for a number of years inside the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] before dissolving. Meanwhile, Yaffe and his comrades proceeded to found the Revolutionary Communist Group in 1974.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Revolutionary Communist No 1 October 1974 p14</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the RCG began publishing a theoretical journal called ''Revolutionary Communist'' in which it in part espoused a view of [[crisis theory]], a theme they had already addressed in the IS when challenging the work of the theoreticians of that group.<ref>[http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/marxism.html ''Revolutionary Communist'']</ref> They developed [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]] and [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s analysis of the [[labour aristocracy]], and showed its relevance for politics in the period after the Second World War.  Their conclusions led them to call for no vote for the Labour Party.\n\nThe early years of the RCG saw the group lose a large part of its initial membership. For example, in September 1975 the Birmingham branch decamped in order to join the [[Workers' Socialist League]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[File:Frank Furedi by David Shankbone.jpg|right|thumb|Hungarian sociologist [[Frank Furedi]] was an early member of the RCG before being ejected in 1976, following which he founding the Revolutionary Communist Tendency. In later life he rejected socialism and became a [[libertarianism|libertarian]].]]\nA few years after the RCG's foundation, disagreements emerged amongst its members regarding such topics as [[Stalinism]] and the South African government. One group, dominated by [[Frank Furedi]] (1947-), a sociologist at the [[University of Kent]] who used the pseudonym of \"Frank Richards\", began to argue against the views put forward by David Yaffe and his supporters. Yaffe himself later remarked that Furedi had been \"organising among a clique of middle-class members, and became their self-styled guru\".<ref name=\"Beckett\">[[#Bec99|Beckett 1999]].</ref> In November 1976, Furedi and his followers were expelled from the RCG, following which they went on to form their own rival organisation, the [[Revolutionary Communist Tendency]] (RCT). Soon, the RCT itself splintered, with a group calling itself the Committee for a Communist Programme (CPP) being founded by several dissenting members.<ref name=\"Leversha 26\">[[#Lev78|Leversha 1978]]. p. 26.</ref> Following this, the RCT went on to change its name to the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (Furedi)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] in 1981, and would publish the magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]'' from 1988 to 2000, in which their political position moved from [[Leninism]] to [[Libertarian Marxism]].<ref name=\"Beckett\"/>\n\nThe RCG recognised the progressive role played by some of the traditional communist parties such as the [[South African Communist Party]] and from that position developed into a more orthodox communist grouping supporting the [[socialist]] revolution in [[Cuba]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nWhilst many self-proclaimed [[socialist]] organisations, especially those regarding themselves as Trotskyist, in the UK welcomed the demise of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and then of the [[Soviet Union]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Reed|first=David|title=Uphold the banner of communism|newspaper=Fight Racism! Fight Imperialism!|date=October\u2013November 1991|author2=Eddie Abrahams}}</ref>  the RCG argued that these events were [[counterrevolutionary]] and constituted a setback in the [[class struggle]] internationally because many [[national liberation]] movements and socialist states in the [[Third World]] were supported by the Soviet Union and the [[Comecon]]. The RCG believed that while the Soviet Union was a [[socialist state]], as a result of both internal developments in the Soviet Union itself and the reactionary role of working class parties (social democratic and communist) in the imperialist countries, the revolution degenerated and the communist party became an elite party separate from the working class. These developments laid the foundation for the counterrevolution between 1989-91.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\n===Solidarity with Ireland and South Africa: 1977-1989===\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the RCG became heavily involved in support for the [[Ireland|Irish]] national liberation struggle, working with the Prisoners Aid Committee, [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] and the [[Troops Out Movement]] (TOM), and focusing particularly on support for [[Irish republican]] prisoners held in British prisons. The analysis which the RCG developed through this work, on the role of national liberation movements in opposing [[imperialism]], laid the foundations for much of its later positions, and its relationship to the rest of the British [[Left-wing politics|left]]. Unlike many other left organisations, the RCG consistently argued that British troops had no progressive role to play in Ireland, and called for total support for the Republican movement in the struggle against British imperialism. Their involvement with the prisoner support groups established a tradition of outspoken support for prison struggles which has continued to the present, with a page of every issue of their newspaper dealing with prison conditions and struggles. In 1990, when prisoners at [[Strangeways]] (see [[1990 Strangeways Prison riot]]) took over the prison in protest at conditions, the RCG was active together with other groups supporting them on the outside, and later published a book, 'Strangeways: A Serious Disturbance', largely written by prisoners and former prisoners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jameson|first=Nicki|title=Strangeways 1990: a serious disturbance|year=1995|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0 905400 18 6}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1980s, the RCG's most notable activity was its participation in the non-stop picket of the [[South Africa]]n embassy in [[London]] calling for the release of [[Nelson Mandela]].  This was organized by the [[City of London Anti-Apartheid Group]], within which the RCG played a leading role alongside elements of the [[Workers' Revolutionary Party (UK)|Workers' Revolutionary Party]], the [[Humanist Party (UK)|Humanist Party]] and members of the Kitson family. City AA, as it became known, had been founded by [[Norma Kitson]], the wife of the South African Communist activist David Kitson who served 19 years and 5 months in prison in a South African prison for his work in the National High Command of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (MK), the military wing of the [[African National Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Gavin|title=The ANC, the Kitsons and the City of London Anti-Apartheid Group|url=http://nonstopagainstapartheid.wordpress.com/2012/01/08/the-anc-the-kitsons-and-the-city-of-london-anti-apartheid-group-anc100years/|work=Non-Stop Against Apartheid|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nCity AA was eventually expelled by the national leadership of the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], over differences centering on City Group's insistence on making the link between British support for apartheid in South Africa, and racism within Britain.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brickley|first=Carol|title=South Africa - Britain out of Apartheid; Apartheid out of Britain|year=1985|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0-905400-07-0|url=http://revolutionarycommunist.org/images/pdf/rcg_south_africa_pamphlet_lq.pdf|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nAnother significant campaign during the 1980s was the [[Viraj Mendis]] Defence Campaign, against the deportation of one of the group's members to [[Sri Lanka]]. This developed into a high-profile national campaign involving people from left-wing groups such as the RCG, local residents of [[Manchester]], and extending to church leaders and Labour Party [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Viraj Mendis Defence Campaign|title=Viraj Mendis Will Stay!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mxTPnEdEsg|accessdate=17 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Solidarity with Cuba and Palestine: 1990-present ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RCG Cuba badge.JPG|150px|thumb|Badge produced by the RCG to express solidarity with the socialist governments of Cuba and Venezuela.]] -->\n\nIn 1995 the RCG set up [[Rock Around the Blockade]] (RATB), a solidarity organisation with the Cuban Revolution. As well as campaigning on issues such as the [[United States|US]] economic [[blockade]] and the [[Cuban Five]], and sending political solidarity brigades to Cuba, RATB raised funds to take sound systems out to Cuba. These were used with young people in cultural and political work, and the RATB has donated five sound systems over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rock Around the Blockade|title=The streets are ours: Revolutionary Cuba|year=2001|publisher=Larkin Publications|location=London|isbn=0-905400-19-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001 three members were asked to leave or resign because of what were described as their reactionary [[ultra-left]] views. One example of the division was over the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th attacks in 2001]], which the three people who left viewed as a victory against imperialism. They had previously alleged that the leadership was bureaucratic and failing to train the membership in [[Marxism-Leninism]]. The three left to form Communist Forum, often known by the name of their newsletter, ''Fightback''. They have ceased to be active.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nFollowing the start of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Al-Aqsa Intifada|second intifada]] in September 2000, in October the RCG joined a group which had begun to picket [[Marks and Spencer]] in Manchester over their support for [[Israel]], and helped to spread this to other cities. Over the next six years pickets of Marks and Spencer were held in places including [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Dundee]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Rochdale]], [[Nottingham]], [[Leicester]], across London, Stratford and [[Brighton]]. Throughout this period the flagship store on [[Oxford Street]] in London was picketed weekly, and in many other places pickets were sustained on a regular basis.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donovan|first=Fiona|title=10 years of boycotting M&S|url=http://revolutionarycommunist.org/index.php/palestine/1926-10-years-of-boycotting-mas-frfi-217-octnov-2010|accessdate=17 April 2014|newspaper=Fight Racism!

There would be cuts in state benefits, central government departments and a 26% reduction in central government funding for local government. In its newspaper, the RCG said the ruling class \"has declared class war.\".<ref>FRFI 218, December 2010/January 2011</ref> The RCG adopted a slogan \"No cuts \u2013 full stop!\" It condemned Labour-run councils implementing the cuts. It described Labour councillors voting for such cuts as \"class enemies\", opposing any alliance with them against the coalition government. It criticised those on the left who sought unity at any price with such politicians.<ref>FRFI 219, February/March 2011</ref>\n\nAs a part of the government cuts, the coalition announced plans to simultaneously cut much university funding and dramatically increase the tuition fees charged to students. This move led to [[2010 UK student protests|widespread student protests taking place in November and December 2010]], during which demonstrators occupied the central [[Jeremy Bentham|Jeremy Bentham Room]] in [[University College London]] (UCL) for several weeks. The protesting UCL students (some of whom were RCG members or supporters) organised a panel discussion to be held during which representatives from several leftist organisations (including the RCG's David Yaffe as well as figures from the [[Green Party of England and Wales]], [[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)|Socialist Appeal]] and [[Workers Power (UK)|Workers Power]]) discussed the reforms then being made by the government and university authorities to higher education in Britain.<ref>[[#RCG10|Revolutionary Communist Group 2010]].</ref>\n\n===Allegation of sexual harassment (2017)===\n\nIn October 2017 the RCG posted on their website \"The Revolutionary Communist Group is aware of a historic allegation of sexual harassment by a member of the organisation. The RCG views such allegations with utmost seriousness. The comrade involved has been suspended from membership and will remain suspended until an internal enquiry completes an investigation into the matter and reports with recommendations on further action\".<ref>http://www.revolutionarycommunist.org/9-uncategorised/5056-our-311217</ref> At the end of that year in December, the RCG updated on their website \"Following an investigation and a period of suspension, the comrade has been reinstated as of 1 January 2018. The comrade understands that his actions were unacceptable for a communist and a member of the RCG. Through the process we have undertaken, his consciousness and behaviour has changed, and continues to change to the extent that we have decided he can now be readmitted as a full member.

On 5 May 2019, the [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]] aircraft operating the flight was [[climbout|climbing out]] when it was struck by lightning. The aircraft suffered an electrical failure and returned to Sheremetyevo for an [[emergency landing]]. It [[bounced landing|bounced]] on landing and touched down hard, causing the landing gear to collapse, fuel to spill out of the wings and a fire to erupt. The fire engulfed the rear of the aircraft, and 41 of the 78 occupants were unable to evacuate and lost their lives. The cause was probably Pilot Error but most likely caused by a lighting strike\n\n==Aircraft==\nThe aircraft was a Russian-built [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], MSN (manufacturer's serial number) 95135, and was [[aircraft registration|registered]] as RA-89098.<ref name=\"ASN\">{{Cite web |url= https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=20190505-0 |title= Aircraft accident Sukhoi Superjet 100-95B RA-89098 Moskva-Sheremetyevo Airport (SVO) |date= 8 May 2019 |work= [[Aviation Safety Network]]}}</ref> It was delivered new to Aeroflot on 27 September 2017 and had accumulated 2,710 flight hours and 1,658 cycles (a flight cycle consists of a take-off and a landing) before the accident.<ref name=\"fg-18may\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.planespotters.net/airframe/Sukhoi/Superjet-100/RA-89098-Aeroflot-Russian-Airlines/A3Pnfnn|title=RA-89098 Aeroflot - Russian Airlines Sukhoi Superjet 100|website=www.planespotters.net|language=en|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> Aeroflot Superjets are configured with 87 passenger seats, 12 in business and 75 in economy.<ref name=fg20190519 />\n\n==Accident==\nFlight 1492 took off from runway 24C at [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]], bound for [[Murmansk Airport]], on 5 May 2019 at 18:03 [[UTC+3|local time]] (15:03 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). Towering [[cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) clouds]] were observed in the vicinity of the airport with a base of {{cvt|6000|ft|m}} and peaking at about {{convert|29000|ft|m}}. The clouds were moving in a north-easterly direction at a speed of {{convert|40|-|45|kph|kn}}. When the plane was approaching the thunderstorm zone, a 327-degree heading was selected manually at 18:07 local time (15:07 UTC), initiating a right turn earlier than it is prescribed by the \u041aN 24\u0415 [[standard instrument departure]], but the crew did not request active thunderstorm area avoidance clearance. At 15:08 UTC, the aircraft was climbing through [[flight level]] 89 when it was struck by lightning. The primary radio and [[autopilot]] became inoperative and the [[flight control modes|flight control mode]] changed to DIRECT \u2013 a degraded, more challenging mode of operation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bjorn |first1=Fehrm |title=Aeroflot SSJ100 crash at Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport |url=https://leehamnews.com/2019/05/10/bjorns-corner-aeroflot-ssj100-crash-at-moscow-sheremetyevo-airport/ |website=Leeham News and Analysis |accessdate=17 May 2019}}</ref> The captain assumed manual control of the aircraft. The [[transponder code]] was changed to 7600 (to indicate radio failure) at 15:09 UTC and subsequently to 7700 (emergency) at 15:26 UTC while on [[final approach (aeronautics)|final approach]]. The secondary radio (VHF2) remained operative and the crew were able to restore communication with air traffic control (ATC) and made a [[pan-pan]] call on the emergency frequency.<ref name=AH/>\n\nThe aircraft stopped its climb at flight level 106 and was guided towards Sheremetyevo by ATC. It performed a right orbit before lining up for approach to runway 24L; the crew tuned into the [[instrument landing system]] and the captain flew the approach manually. Upon capturing the [[glideslope]], the aircraft's weight was {{convert|43.5|t|lb}}, {{convert|1.6|t|lb}} over the [[maximum landing weight]]. At 15:18:53 UTC, the captain attempted to contact the controller to request a holding area, but his message was not recorded by the controller's recorder. The flaps were lowered to 25 degrees, which is the recommended setting for an overweight landing in DIRECT mode. The wind was blowing from 190 degrees at {{convert|30|kn|m/s}} \u2013 a 50-degree [[crosswind]] \u2013 and the speed stabilised at {{convert|155|kn|kph}}. Between {{convert|1100|ft|m}} and {{convert|900|ft|m}} [[above ground level|AGL]], the predictive [[windshear]] warning sounded repeatedly: \"GO-AROUND, WINDSHEAR AHEAD\". The crew did not acknowledge this warning on tape. Descending through {{convert|260|ft|m}}, the aircraft began to deviate below the glideslope and the \"GLIDESLOPE\" aural alert sounded. The captain called \"advisory\" and increased engine thrust, and the speed rose through {{convert|164|kn|kph}} at {{convert|40|ft|m}} to {{convert|170|kn|kph}} at {{convert|16|ft|m}} AGL \u2013 {{convert|15|kn|kph}} above the required approach speed, although the airline's own Flight Operations Manual provides pilots with a margin of &minus;5 to +20&nbsp;kt as a criterion for stabilised approach. As he reduced the thrust to idle for the [[landing flare|flare]], the captain made several large, alternating sidestick inputs, causing the pitch to vary between +6 and &minus;2 degrees.<ref name=AH /><ref name=\"ASN\" /><ref name=\"fg-18may\">{{cite web |last1=Kaminski-Morrow |first1=David |title=Crashed Superjet's pitch fluctuated before fatal touchdown |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/crashed-superjets-pitch-fluctuated-before-fatal-tou-458282/ |website=Flightglobal.com |date=18 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe aircraft made simultaneous ground contact with all three [[landing gear]] legs {{convert|900|m|ft}} beyond the runway threshold at a speed of {{convert|158|kn|kph}}, resulting in a vertical acceleration of 2.55&nbsp;g. Concurrently with the touchdown, in the span of 0.4&nbsp;seconds, the sidestick was moved from full aft to full forward. Though the [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] were armed, automatic spoiler deployment is inhibited in DIRECT mode and they were not extended manually. The aircraft bounced to a height of {{convert|6|ft|m}}. The captain attempted to apply maximum [[reverse thrust]] while he continued to hold the sidestick in the fully forward position. Reverse thrust and reverser door deployment is inhibited in the absence of weight on the aircraft's wheels (i.e. in flight) and the reverser doors only began to open upon the second touchdown. The aircraft lifted off the ground before the reverse door cycle was completed and reverse thrust did not activate. The second touchdown occurred two seconds after the first, nose-first, at a speed of {{convert|155|kn|kph}} and with a vertical load of 5.85&nbsp;g. The main landing gear weak links sheared \u2013 the weak links are designed to shear under heavy load to minimise damage to the wing \u2013 allowing the gear legs to \"move up and backwards\" and the wing remained intact. The aircraft bounced to a height of {{convert|15|-|18|ft|m}}. The thrust levers were advanced to take-off power \u2013 the reverser doors began to close \u2013 and the sidestick was pulled full aft in a possible attempt to [[go around]]. Thrust was not allowed to increase until the reverser doors were closed and a third impact was recorded at a speed of {{convert|140|kn|kph}} and with a vertical load in excess of 5&nbsp;g. The landing gear collapsed, penetrating the wing, and fuel spilled out of the wing tanks. A fire erupted, engulfing the wings, rear fuselage and [[empennage]]. Fire alarms sounded in the cockpit for the aft cargo hold and the [[auxiliary power unit]]. The aircraft slid down the runway, veered to the left and came to a standstill on the grass between two runway-adjoining taxiways with the nose facing upwind at 15:30 UTC. Power to the engines was cut at 15:31 UTC. Flight recorder data suggest that control over the engines had been lost after the final impact.<ref name=AH /><ref name=\"ASN\" /><ref>{{cite news |title=41 Confirmed Dead After Russian Aeroflot Plane Lands With Fire On Board |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/05/05/41-confirmed-dead-after-russian-aeroflot-plane-lands-with-fire-on-board-a65490 |accessdate=16 May 2019 |work=[[The Moscow Times]] |date=5 May 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"interim-report-1\" />\n\nAn evacuation was carried out from the front passenger doors and their [[emergency slide|slides]] were deployed.

Upon capturing the [[glideslope]], the aircraft's weight was {{convert|43.5|t|lb}}, {{convert|1.6|t|lb}} over the [[maximum landing weight]]. At 15:18:53 UTC, the captain attempted to contact the controller to request a holding area, but his message was not recorded by the controller's recorder.
