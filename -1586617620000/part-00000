The family was French-speaking despite its Flemish roots; his mother's maiden name was De Ridder. He studied art at the [[Brussels Academy]] in 1924 under [[James Ensor]], but halted his studies in 1925 for lack of funding, first working in a stained glass studio, then designing wallpaper \u2013 both of which experiences are actively reflected in many of his works. He also worked as a freelance cartoonist, but painted all the while. In 1933 he studied briefly under [[Henri Matisse]] in France (see [[#Anecdotes|Anecdotes]]), having met him by chance in an artist's supply shop in [[Cagnes]], France. Thereafter he continued to paint and study full-time thanks to the sponsorship of his elder brother, Joseph Charles, and a group of friends.\n\nHis break came in July 1939 when he won a scholarship in a competition organised by the Belgian Government, who commissioned him to undertake a painting expedition to the [[Belgian Congo]]. His travels and experiences there influenced him profoundly, and the visions and emotions of that period echoed through his work for the rest of his life. In 1940 his wife Lucette (n\u00e9e Josz, 1908\u20131997) and son Ludovic (1935 \u2013 ) fled German occupation of [[Belgium]] and joined him in the Congo. Lucette could not cope with tropical conditions and they moved to the relatively milder climate of the South African Cape rather than return to war-torn Europe.\n\nEarly days in South Africa were difficult, and on occasion van Essche traded paintings and drawings for food and other essentials. But he soon became a prominent member of the South African art community, exhibiting locally and later in Europe as well. As an active member of [http://www.sahistory.org.za/media-and-journalism/new-group The New Group] he contributed strongly to contemporary art in South Africa. He had a solid knowledge of both modern art trends and the history of European painting which he imparted in his role as teacher, a profession he regarded as equally important as creating. He taught at the<ref>Witwatersrand</ref> Technical Art School from 1943 to 1945. In 1948 he founded the Continental School of Art in [[Cape Town]], leaving in 1951 to become a lecturer at the [[Michaelis School of Fine Art]] at the [[University of Cape Town]].  He was appointed Professor of Fine Art in 1962 (see [[#Anecdotes|Anecdotes]]) and his success as a teacher is attested to by the number of his former pupils who have become prominent artists themselves.\n\nVan Essche retired from academia in 1971, but continued to paint prolifically, despite poor health, including several heart attacks. He travelled in Europe and eventually settled near [[Thonon]], France, at his wife's behest. His health continued to deteriorate, and he could not travel to attend his own retrospective exhibition in [[Cape Town]] in 1974. He missed Africa terribly, painting African scenes while searching in vain for local inspiration. His new themes included hippies and musicians, but he destroyed much of this work. His European landscapes from this period are dark and depressed, in stark contrast to the vibrant African scenes that flowed nonetheless. His oils continued to sell well in South Africa, and his reputation grew. He succumbed to a heart attack in June 1977 following a fall, and poor medical care.\n\n==Chronological summary==\n\n* 1906 Born in Antwerp, Belgium\n* 1911 Family moved to Brussels; educated there\n* 1925 Interrupted his studies to earn a living working in stained glass studio\n* 1930 Became a member of the group 'La Jeune Peinture Belge'; won silver medal at the International Exhibition, Antwerp\n* 1933 Married Lucie Josz; studied under Matisse in South of France; group and one-man exhibitions in Paris and Belgian centres\n* 1939 Government sponsored painting expedition to Belgian Congo\n* 1940 Moved to South Africa; stayed temporarily in Cape Town; began exhibiting in South Africa\n* 1943 to 1945 Lectured at Wits Tech Art School, member of New Group\n* 1946 Founded Continental School of Art, Cape Town\n* 1948\u201365 Regularly represented South Africa at international art exhibitions\n* 1948 Foundation member of International Art Club; exhibited with fellow members in Turin, later elected chairman\n* 1951 Awarded the title of Chevalier de Leopold II by King Baudouin of Belgium\n* 1952 Appointed lecturer in Fine Art, Michaelis School, Cape Town; reputation in South Africa grown considerably; continued to exhibit at intervals in Europe\n* 1962 Appointed Professor of Fine Art, Michaelis School, University of Cape Town\n* 1966 Awarded Medal of Honour for Painting by South African Akademie\n* 1967 Subject of monograph 'Van Essche', by Carl Buchner\n* 1970 Retired from Michaelis School.\n* 1971 Departed for Europe; settled in Thonon-les-Bains, France.\n* 1972 Awarded the title Officer of Order of Leopold II by King Baudouin of Belgium.\n* 1974 Unable to attend Prestige Retrospective Exhibition of his work, South African National Art Gallery and Pretoria Art Museum\n* 1977 Deceased 12 June, Thonon, France.\n\n==Art==\n\nVan Essche's work exhibits contrasting influences, both artistic and environmental.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H.

They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

[[Lawrence Kohlberg|Lawerence Kohlberg]] sought to expand Piaget's work. His cognitive developmental theory of moral reasoning dominated the field for decades. He focused on moral development as one's progression in the capacity to reason about justice. Kohlberg's interview method included hypothetical moral dilemmas or conflicts of interest (most notably, the [[Heinz dilemma]]). He proposed six stages and three levels of development (claiming that \"anyone who interviewed children about dilemmas and who followed them longitudinally in time would come to our six stages and no others).<ref>{{cite book|title=The Psychology of Moral Development: The Nature and Validity of Moral Stages|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|publisher=Harper & Row|year=1984|isbn=978-0-06-064761-2|series=Essays on Moral Developent|volume=2|location=|pages=195}}</ref> At the Preconventional level, the first two stages included the punishment-and-obedience orientation and the instrumental-relativist orientation.

The justice perspective draws attention to inequality and oppression, while striving for reciprocal rights and equal respect for all. The care perspective draws attention to the ideas of detachment and abandonment, while striving for attention and response to people who need it. Care Orientation is relationally based.

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory. Modern moral psychology concedes that \"morality is about protecting individuals\" and focuses primarily on issues of justice (harm/care and fairness/reciprocity).<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Their research found that \"justice and related virtues\u2026make up half of the moral world for liberals, while justice-related concerns make up only one fifth of the moral world for conservatives\".<ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2007\" />{{rp|page=99}} Liberals value harm/care and fairness/reciprocity significantly more than the other moralities, while conservatives value all five equally.\n\n===Moral emotions===\n{{Main|Moral emotions}}\n{{See also|Social emotions}}\nMoral emotions are a variety of social emotion that are involved in forming and communicating moral judgments and decisions, and in motivating behavioral responses to one's own and others' moral behavior.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\">{{cite book |last1=Pizarro |first1=David A. |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy F |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen D |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=9781412956253 |pages=588\u2013589 |chapter=Moral Emotions|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n350 }}</ref><ref name=\"Haidt, J. 2003 p. 855\">{{cite book|title=Handbook of Affective Sciences|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-19-512601-3|editor-last=Davidson|editor-first=Richard|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855 855]|chapter=The Moral Emotions|ref=harv|editor-last2=Scherer|editor-first2=Klaus|editor-last3=Goldsmith|editor-first3=H.|chapter-url=http://www.gruberpeplab.com/teaching/psych3131_spring2015/documents/4.1_Haidt2003_Moralemotions.pdf|url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofaffect0000unse/page/855}}</ref><ref name=\"Tangney2007\">{{cite journal |last1=Tangney |first1=June Price |last2=Stuewig |first2=Jeff |last3=Mashek |first3=Debra J. |title=Moral Emotions and Moral Behavior |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |date=January 2007 |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=345\u2013372 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.56.091103.070145 |pmid=16953797 |pmc=3083636 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/Tangney.pdf}}</ref>\nWhile moral reasoning has been the focus of most study of morality dating all the way back to Plato and Aristotle, the emotive side of morality has been looked upon with disdain.<ref name=\"Pizarro2007b\" /> However, in the last 30\u201340 years, there has been a rise in a new front of research: moral emotions as the basis for moral behavior.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G.

J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

With the research they reviewed and their own extension of Ajzen and Fishbein's [[theory of reasoned action]], they conclude that value-attitude-behavior depends on the individual and their moral reasoning. They also pointed out that there are such things as good values and bad values. Good values are those that guide our attitudes and behaviors and allow us to express and define ourselves. It also involves the ability to know when values are appropriate in response to the situation or person that you are dealing with. Bad values on the other hand are those that are relied on so much that it makes you unresponsive to the needs and perspectives of others.\n\nAnother issue that Kristiansen and Hotte discovered through their research was that individuals tended to \"create\" values to justify their reactions to certain situations, which they called the \"value justification hypothesis\".<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d /> The authors use an example from feminist [[Susan Faludi]]'s journal entry of how during the period when women were fighting for their right to vote, a New Rights group appealed to society's ideals of \"traditional family values\" as an argument against the new law in order to mask their own \"anger at women's rising independence.\" Their theory is comparable to Jonathan Haidt's [[Social intuitionism|social intuition theory]], where individuals justify their intuitive emotions and actions through reasoning in a post-hoc fashion.\n\nKristiansen and Hotte also found that independent selves had actions and behaviors that are influenced by their own thoughts and feelings, but [[Interdependent]] selves have actions, behaviors and self-concepts that were based on the thoughts and feelings of others. Westerners have two dimensions of emotions, activation and pleasantness. The Japanese have one more, the range of their interdependent relationships. Markus and Kitayama found that these two different types of values had different motives. Westerners, in their explanations, show self-bettering biases. Easterners, on the other hand, tend to focus on \"other-oriented\" biases.<ref name=\u201cKristiansen&Hotte1996\u201d />\n\nPsychologist [[Shalom H. Schwartz|S. H. Schwartz]] defines individual values as \"conceptions of the desirable that guide the way social actors (e.g.organisational leaders, policymakers, individual persons) select actions, evaluate people an events, and explain their actions and evaluations.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schwartz|first1=S.

While individual values vary case by case (a result of unique life experience), the average of these values point to widely held cultural beliefs (a result of shared cultural values).\n\n===Moral virtues===\nPiaget and Kohlberg both developed stages of development to understand the timing and meaning of moral decisions. They were interested in placing people into moral categories or stages of development instead of identifying how each individual's views and behaviors are affected by their background and personality. In 2004, D. Lapsley and D. Narvaez outlined how [[social cognition]] explains aspects of moral functioning.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Development, Self, and Identity|last1=Lapsley|first1=Daniel K.|last2=Narvaez|first2=Darcia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-135-63233-5|location=|pages=189\u2013212|chapter=A social-cognitive approach to the moral personality|ref=harv|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=q054AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189}}</ref> The social cognitive approach to personality has six critical resources of moral personality: cognition, self-processes, affective elements of personality, changing social context, lawful situational variability, and the integration of other literature. Lapsley and Narvaez suggest that moral values and actions stem from more than our virtues and are controlled by a set of self-created [[Schema (psychology)|schemas]] (cognitive structures that organize related concepts and integrate past events). They claim that schemas are \"fundamental to our very ability to notice dilemmas as we appraise the moral landscape\" and that over time, people develop greater \"moral expertise\".{{Sfn|Lapsley|Narvaez|2004|p=197}}\n\n==== Triune ethics theory ====\n{{Main|Triune ethics Meta-theory}}\nThe triune ethics meta-theory (TEM) has been proposed by Darcia Narvaez as a [[metatheory]] that highlights the relative contributions to moral development of [[biological inheritance]] (including human evolutionary [[adaptations]]), environmental influences on neurobiology, and the role of culture.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite journal|last=Narvaez|first=Darcia|date=March 1, 2008|title=Triune ethics: The neurobiological roots of our multiple moralities|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~dnarvaez/TriuneEthicsWord.htm|journal=New Ideas in Psychology|volume=26|issue=1|pages=95\u2013119|doi=10.1016/j.newideapsych.2007.07.008|issn=0732-118X|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.152.4926}}</ref> TET proposes three basic mindsets that shape ethical behavior: self-protectionism (a variety of types), engagement, and imagination (a variety of types that are fueld by protectionism or engagement).

According to this approach, through early interactions with the caregiver, the child acquires an internal representation of a system of rules that determine how right/wrong judgments are to be construed, used, and understood.

The \"cooler\" levels of values, reasoning, and willpower, while still important, are proposed to be secondary to the more affect-intensive processes.\n\nMoral behavior is also studied under the umbrella of [[personality psychology]] where it is described in terms of traits such as [[agreeableness]], [[cooperativeness]] and [[Honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO model of personality|honesty/humility]].<ref name=\"Thielmann2020\">{{cite journal |last1=Thielmann |first1=Isabel |last2=Spadaro |first2=Giuliana |last3=Balliet |first3=Daniel |title=Personality and prosocial behavior: A theoretical framework and meta-analysis. |journal=Psychological Bulletin |date=January 2020 |volume=146 |issue=1 |pages=30\u201390 |doi=10.1037/bul0000217}}</ref>\n\n====Value-behavior consistency====\n{{Also|Moral disengagement}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn looking at the relations between moral values, attitudes, and behaviors, previous research asserts that there is no dependable correlation between these three aspects, differing from what we would assume. In fact, it seems to be more common for people to label their behaviors with a justifying value rather than having a value beforehand and then acting on it. There are some people that are more likely to act on their personal values: those low in self-monitoring and high in self-consciousness, due to the fact that they are more aware of themselves and less aware of how others may perceive them. Self-consciousness here means being literally more conscious of yourself, not fearing judgement or feeling anxiety from others. Social situations and the different categories of norms can be telling of when people may act in accordance with their values, but this still isn't concrete either. People will typically act in accordance with social, contextual and personal norms, and there is a likelihood that these norms can also follow one's moral values. Though there are certain assumptions and situations that would suggest a major value-attitude-behavior relation, there is not enough research to confirm this phenomenon.\n\n====Moral willpower====\n{{Main|Ego depletion|Self-control}}\n{{See also|Delayed gratification|Social cognitive theory of morality}}\nBuilding on earlier work by Metcalfe and [[Walter Mischel#Self-control|Mischel]] on delayed gratification,<ref name=\":3\">{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Mischel|first2=W.|year=1999|title=A hot/cool-system analysis of delay of gratification: Dynamics of willpower|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13101564|journal=Psychological Review|volume=106|issue=1|pages=3\u201319|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.106.1.3|pmid=10197361|via=}}</ref> Baumeister, Miller, and Delaney explored the notion of willpower by first defining the self as being made up of three parts: reflexive consciousness, or the person's awareness of their environment and of himself as an individual; interpersonal being, which seeks to mold the self into one that will be accepted by others; and executive function.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite book|title=Judeo-Christian Perspectives on Psychology: Human Nature, Motivation, and Change|last=Baumeister|publisher=American Psychological Association|year=2005|isbn=978-1-59147-161-5|editor-last=Miller|editor-first=William|location=Washington, DC|pages=57\u201372|chapter=Self and volition|ref=harv|editor-last2=Delaney|editor-first2=Harold}}</ref> They stated, \"[T]he self can free its actions from being determined by particular influences, especially those of which it is aware\".{{Sfn|Baumeister|2005|p=68}} The three prevalent theories of willpower describe it as a limited supply of energy, as a cognitive process, and as a skill that is developed over time.

Moral intuitions happen immediately, automatically, and [[Unconscious mind|unconsciously]], with reasoning largely serving to generate post-hoc rationalizations to justify one's instinctual reactions.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\">{{cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|date=October 2001|title=The Emotional Dog and Its Rational Tail|url=http://fitelson.org/confirmation/reasoning_adler_rips.pdf#page=1036|journal=Psychological Review|volume=108|issue=4|pages=814\u2013834|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.4.814|pmid=11699120|ref=harv|via=|citeseerx=10.1.1.620.5536}}</ref> He provides four arguments to doubt causal importance of reason. Firstly, Haidt argues that since there is a [[Dual process theory|dual process system]] in the brain when making automatic evaluations or assessments, this same process must be applicable to moral judgement as well. The second argument, based on research on [[motivated reasoning]], claims that people behave like \"intuitive lawyers\", searching primarily for evidence that will serve motives for social relatedness and attitudinal coherence. Thirdly, Haidt found that people have post hoc reasoning when faced with a moral situation, this a posteriori (after the fact) explanation gives the illusion of objective moral judgement but in reality is subjective to one's gut feeling. Lastly, research has shown that moral emotion has a stronger link to moral action than moral reasoning, citing Damasio's research on the [[somatic marker hypothesis]] and Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis.<ref name=\"Haidt 814\u2013834\" />\n\nIn 2008, Joshua Greene published a compilation which, in contrast to Haidt's model, suggested that fair moral reasoning does take place. A \"[[Deontological ethics|deontologist]]\" is someone who has rule-based morality that is mainly focused on duties and rights; in contrast, a \"[[Consequentialism|consequentialist]]\" is someone who believes that only the best overall consequences ultimately matter.<ref>{{cite book|title=Moral Psychology|last=Greene|first=Joshua|publisher=MIT Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-262-69355-4|editor-last=Sinnott-Armstrong|editor-first=Walter|volume=3|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=35\u201380|chapter=The secret joke of Kant\u2019s Soul|oclc=750463100}}</ref> Generally speaking, individuals who answer to moral dilemmas in a consequential manner take longer to respond and show [[Frontal lobe|frontal-lobe]] activity (associated with cognitive processing).

These Five Foundations of Morality and their importance vary throughout each culture and construct virtues based on their emphasized foundation. \nThey challenged individuals to question the legitimacy of their moral world and introduced the five psychological foundations of morality:\n* Harm/care, which starts with the sensitivity to signs of suffering in offspring and develops into a general dislike of seeing suffering in others and the potential to feel compassion in response.\n* Fairness/reciprocity, which is developed when someone observes or engages in reciprocal interactions. This foundation is concerned with virtues related to fairness and justice. \n* Ingroup/loyalty, which constitutes recognizing, trusting, and cooperating with members of one's ingroup as well as being wary of members of other groups.\n* Authority/respect, which is how someone navigates in a [[Hierarchical equations of motion|hierarchal]] ingroups and communities.\n* Purity/sanctity, which stems from the emotion of disgust that guards the body by responding to elicitors that are biologically or culturally linked to disease transmission.\nThe five foundations theory are both a [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] and cultural-psychological theory.

Namely, moral mandates derive their motivational force from their perceived universality, perceived objectivity, and strong ties to emotion.<ref>{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Peace Psychology|last=Morgan|first=G. S.|last2=Skitka|first2=L. J.|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4051-9644-4|editor=Christie|editor-first=Daniel J.|location=|pages=|chapter=Moral conviction}}</ref> Perceived universality refers to the notion that individuals experience moral mandates as transcending persons and cultures; additionally, they are regarded as matters of fact. Regarding association with emotion, ITMC is consistent with Jonathan Haidt's social intuitionist model in stating that moral judgments are accompanied by discrete moral emotions (i.e., disgust, shame, guilt). Importantly, Skitka maintains that moral mandates are not the same thing as moral values. Whether an issue will be associated with moral conviction varies across persons.\n\nOne of the main lines of IMTC research addresses the behavioral implications of moral mandates. Individuals prefer greater social and physical distance from attitudinally dissimilar others when moral conviction was high. This effect of moral conviction could not be explained by traditional measures of attitude strength, extremity, or centrality. Skitka, Bauman, and Sargis placed participants in either attitudinally heterogeneous or homogenous groups to discuss procedures regarding two morally mandated issues, [[abortion]] and [[capital punishment]]. Those in attitudinally heterogeneous groups demonstrated the least amount of goodwill towards other group members, the least amount of cooperation, and the most tension/defensiveness. Furthermore, individuals discussing a morally mandated issue were less likely to reach a consensus compared to those discussing non-moral issues.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Skitka|first=L.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures. His recurring theme was of a youthful boy engaged in various lighthearted activities.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

His artwork appeared on nine different magazine covers from 1923 to 1932. Martin designed the then-world's largest ever electrical display in 1917. He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929. He played in [[tennis]] tournaments around the [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York area]] from 1909 to 1931.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based. Like theistic evolution, [[Christian psychology]] is an attempt to harmonize two inherently contradictory systems of thought. Modern psychology and the Bible cannot be blended without serious compromise to or utter abandonment of the principle of Scripture's sufficiency.\"<ref>{{Citation|author=John F MacArthur|title=THE PSYCHOLOGY EPIDEMIC AND ITS CURE|journal=The Master's Seminary Journal|volume=2:1|year=1991|pages=3\u201320}}</ref>\n\nHis stance has caused several controversies, the most notable of which was the first time an employee of an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical church]] had ever been sued for malpractice.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

MacArthur stated, \"''I'm not into all that is traditionally known as dispensationalism, seven dispensations, two kingdoms, two New Covenants, two ways of salvation, discontinuity between the Old Testament and the New.''\"<ref name=\"MacArthur, John\"/>\n\n=== [[Soteriology]] ===\nMacArthur was a key person in the [[Lordship salvation controversy]] in the 1980s, arguing against [[free grace theology]]. He states, \"You must receive Jesus Christ for who He is, both Lord and Savior, to be truly saved (II Peter 2:20).\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gospel According to Jesus |author=MacArthur, John |isbn=0-310-39491-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/gospelaccordingt00maca_0 }}</ref> Regarding [[eternal security]], he states, \"It should never be presented merely as a matter of being once saved, always saved\u2014with no regard for what you believe or do. The writer of Hebrews 12:14 states frankly that only those who continue living holy lives will enter the Lord's presence.\" MacArthur's views raised controversy within U.S. evangelicalism and were challenged in print by non-lordship dispensationalist theologians [[Charles Ryrie]] and [[Zane C. Hodges]], who argued that MacArthur was teaching a form of works-based salvation. MacArthur has denied the charge, as attested on two tapes recorded in 1989 when he was asked to reason together with the IFCA man.<ref>https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-37/ifca-meeting-62689-part-2 https://www.gty.org/library/sermons-library/90-36/ifca-meeting-62689-part-1</ref>\n\nIn December 1989, the [[Bible Broadcasting Network]] terminated MacArthur's ''Grace to You'' program. In explaining that step, BBN president Lowell Davey referred to MacArthur's teachings on the blood of Christ and \"Lordship salvation.\" Davey called these teachings \"confusing\". In a letter dated January 15, 1990, Davey cited a \"drift by Dr. MacArthur to a theological position that we could not adhere to\" and said that MacArthur's sermon series on the theology of election \"convinced us that the direction of 'Grace to You' was toward Hyper-Calvinism.\" MacArthur preaches salvation by election of God's sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chosen from Eternity: Chosen by God--Part 1 |author=MacArthur, John |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Sermons/60-2}}</ref> However, the term \"Hyper-Calvinism\" is used by some to denote 5-point Calvinism or even any strong defense of Calvinism, rather than the historical \"Hyper-Calvinism\" position denies the doctrine of duty faith. This position does not seem to accurately reflect MacArthur's position in his sermons. The controversy concerning the efficacy of Christ's blood stems from MacArthur's statement that it is not the literal liquid blood of Christ that saves, but his sacrificial death on [[The Cross (band)|the Cross]], a view that he espoused in an article titled \"Not His Bleeding, but His Dying,\" published in the May 1976 issue of the ''Grace to You'' family paper distributed to his church. MacArthur himself, though, later clarified what was stated of him in the article, noting his position concerning Christ's blood and death in atonement, mentioning that the efficacy of Christ's blood is not some particular physical property of the blood itself, but the fact that He shed blood in dying, and his affirmation that Christ's blood in death was necessary to satisfy God's holy requirement for atonement.<ref>{{cite web |title=What's All the Controversy About John MacArthur and the Blood of Christ? |url=http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205235106/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/articles/blood.htm |archivedate=December 5, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Christology ===\nIn 1983, MacArthur first published his belief in the doctrine of \"[[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnational sonship]].\" In 1989, after some criticism, he defended his views in a plenary session of the annual convention of the [[Independent Fundamental Churches of America]]. In an article on MacArthur's web site ''Grace to You'' entitled \"Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ,\" he retraces his views from 1983 onward, concluding, \"I want to state publicly that I have abandoned the doctrine of 'incarnational sonship.' Careful study and reflection have brought me to understand that Scripture does indeed present the relationship between God the Father and Christ the Son as an eternal Father-Son relationship. I no longer regard Christ's sonship as a role He assumed in His incarnation.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reexamining the Eternal Sonship of Christ |author=MacArthur, John |publisher=Grace to You |url=http://www.gty.org/Resources/Articles/593}}</ref>{{original research inline |date=March 2011}}\n\n=== Cessationism ===\n[[Image:Charismatic Chaos.jpg|thumb|widthpx|''Charismatic Chaos'' - one of the books where MacArthur argues for cessationism.]]\nMacArthur is a [[cessationism|cessationist]] and is one of the most prominent voices in the church against the [[continuationism|continuationist]] beliefs of [[Pentecostalism]] and the [[Charismatic Movement]]. He has written three books in support of his position: ''The Charismatics'' (1978), ''Charismatic Chaos'' (1993), and ''Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship'' (2013). In October 2013, he hosted a conference called \"Strange Fire\" at his church to mark the launch of his book of the same name. The event featured a number of speakers who argued for a cessationist theology and strongly critiqued the Charismatic Movement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Menzie|first1=Nicola|title='Strange Fire' Conference: John MacArthur Calls Out Charismatic Movement as 'Unfaithful'|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/strange-fire-conference-john-macarthur-calls-out-charismatic-movement-as-unfaithful-106849/|website=The Christian Post|publisher=The Christian Post|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref> In his opening remarks, MacArthur stated, \"Watching the behavior of some Hindus who belong to the Kundalini cult. Their body movements are almost identical to that of people in the charismatic movement, the extreme behavior of pagans. This is the work of Satan, it is the work of darkness, and not to be attributed to the Holy Spirit\". And that, \"The Charismatic movement as such has made no contribution to biblical clarity, interpretation, or sound doctrine ... It detracts and confuses.\" \"It has only produced distortion, confusion, and error.\" \"Have people truly been saved in Charismatic churches? Yes. But nothing coming from that movement has been the reason they were saved.\" \"Evangelicalism has thrown its arms open and has welcomed the Trojan horse of the charismatic movement into the city of God.

However, he saw its interdenominational presence as being \"a testimony to the absence of any theology,\" and charged that \"its theology is both heterodox and heretical...everything is defined by experience..and therefore has a weak view of Scripture, that's the charismatic movement.\" He further criticized the modern Charismatic movement, stating that \"In 1967 a bunch of Jesus freak people in the beach areas of Southern California go to [[Calvary Chapel]]..and for the first time, the church, that I know of in history, the church lets the very defined subculture dictate what it will be. Out go the ties, out go the hymns, out go all the normal and formal things...and the hippie culture, you know, kids coming out of drugs, communal living, free sex, and all that kind of casual thing, and that's a charismatic church, that's a four-square church...That's where the movement becomes what we know as Calvary Chapel.\" \"The first Calvary Chapel was essentially the church saying we'll let the culture tell us what we need to be...The charismatic movement has developed...its comfortable in Roman Catholicism, its comfortable in dead denominationalism...I think its a false form of Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYulTGso804/JohnMacArthur|title=John MacArthur \"What has happened after the 'Strange Fire' Conference\"|publisher=YouTube |date=August 28, 2013 |accessdate=December 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 however, MacArthur commended [[Chuck Smith (pastor)|Chuck Smith]], founder of the Calvary Chapel movement, for writing \"a straight forward critique of charismatic extremism,\" and stated that \"there are many like him who have taken their stand and I thank God for their courage and their desire to be Biblical.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=MacArthur|first=John|title=Does God Promise Health and Wealth?

Addressing the \"Strange Fire\" conference, continuationist [[Calvinist Baptist]] [[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]] concurs that there are many abuses in the charismatic church, however he adds that \"we really need to keep in mind that every charismatic abuse has its mirror image in non-charismatic abuses...In some of these cases, the non-charismatic church is more guilty than the charismatic,\" such as, \"the absence of emotion, which is probably more deadly than the excesses.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Piper|first1=John|title=Piper Addresses Strange Fire and Charismatic Chaos|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/articles/piper-addresses-strange-fire-and-charismatic-chaos|publisher=Desiring God|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Complementarianism ===\nMacArthur opposes \"male [[Chauvinism|chauvinist]] and [[Feminism|feminist]] views\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gty.org/library/blog/B100902|title=The Loving Husband: A Portrait of Christ|website=www.gty.org|access-date=April 10, 2017}}</ref> with a [[complementarian]] view on [[gender role]]s and considers that the Bible does not allow women to preach to men or exercise authority in churches.

MacArthur does not reject all forms of psychological theories and techniques, though he considers some psychology and [[psychiatry]] as contrary to the Bible.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ganz and MacArthur|title=PsychoBabble: The Failure of Modern Psychology--and the Biblical Alternative|publisher=Crossway|year=1993}}</ref>\n\nHe has argued that \"True psychology (i.e. \"the study of the soul\") can be done only by Christians, since only Christians have the resources for understanding and transforming the soul. The secular discipline of psychology is based on godless assumptions and evolutionary foundations and is capable of dealing with people only superficially and only on the temporal level... Psychology is no more a science than the atheistic evolutionary theory upon which it is based.

Does he  still go to heaven? replying MacArthur to this question in a positive way, and creating this an argument and disagreement by another attendant, the dominican, reformed Calvinist (TULIP) lead-pastor of Grace Bible Church in Santo Domingo Oriental, Willy Bayonet, who replied in the same time, and after this answer by MacArthur, that a supposed christian believer who takes his life is not a true christian. In 2018, and After five years trying to convince pastor John MacArthur and his followers and associates, pastor Willy Bayonet was ready to publish his book in Spanish 'La Nobleza de Dios: Vivir o Morir' ('The Nobility of God: Living or Dying' for the English title of the book which is still being translated into English) against MacArthur's teaching about Suicidals going to heaven or 'In Suicide, Against MacArthurion,' as the author Willy Bayonet, nicknamed it. Pastor Bayonet's book is centered on the classic reformed book by William Gurnall, 'The Christian in complete Armour,' the Confession of faith of London of 1689, several reformed authors from past centuries as pastor Spurgeon, Martyn Lloyd Jones, among others, and a few contemporary reformed authors, who he says never preached or taught about suicide. Pastor MacArthur also holds his position in his ministry 'Grace to You, and with written notes online, about those who he states \"Commit Suicide and still go to Heaven.\" When pastor Willy Bayonet is asked about what he expects from pastor John MacArthur, his answer is that pastor MacArthur should stay silent about suicidals' status, as it' has been done before.\n\nIn 2019, at the Truth Matters Conference, where, during a word association questionnaire, the name, \"Beth Moore\" was given. Reiterating his stance on 1 Timothy 2:12, MacArthur responded by stating that [[Beth Moore]] should, \"Go home\" and that, \"There is no case that can be made Biblically for a woman preacher. Period. Paragraph. End of Discussion.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=MacArthur |first1=John |title=Go Home Beth Moore |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeNKHqpBcgc&t=88s |website=YouTubw |accessdate=24 November 2019}}</ref> Beth Moore responded to this stance by stating on her Twitter account, \"I did not surrender to a calling of man when I was 18 years old. I surrendered to a calling of God. It never occurs to me for a second to not fulfill it. I will follow Jesus - and Jesus alone - all the way home. And I will see His beautiful face and proclaim, Worthy is the Lamb!\" Her response caused a lengthy discussion on social media and elsewhere on the inerrancy of Scripture and whether the Bible has changed in meaning since it was first written.\n\n==Selected publications==\n{{Main|John MacArthur bibliography}}\n\n*''Twelve Extraordinary Women: God Shaped Women of the Bible, and What He Wants to Do with You by John F.

It is located north-eastern Poland, in the historical region of [[Podlachia]].\n\n==Geography==\nBielsk Podlaski is located in the geographical region of Europe known as the ''Wysoczyzny Podlasko \u2013 Bialoruskie'' (English: Podlaskie and Belarus Plateau) and the mezoregion known as the ''R\u00f3wnin\u0119 Bielsk\u0105'' (English: [[Bielsk Plain]]).\n\nThe town covers an area of {{convert|32.43|km2|sqmi|1}}.\n\n===Location===\nIt is located approximately:\n* {{Convert|195|km|mi|1}} northeast of [[Warsaw]], the capital of Poland\n* {{Convert|50|km|mi|1}} southwest of Bia\u0142ystok, the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dom drewniany,BielskPodlaski,ul.Ko\u015bcielna4.JPG|thumb|left|A historical house from 1909. Preserved wooden architecture can still be found in some parts of the town]]\nBielsk Podlaski has a long and rich history, dating back to the 12th century, when this area of Poland belonged to [[Kievan Rus']]. The [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]] of Bielsk was probably founded by Ruthenian dukes, and its existence was first mentioned in 1253, in the so-called [[Hypatian Codex]]. In 1273, Bielsk was captured by Lithuanian duke [[Traidenis]], and in the early 14th century, whole province of [[Podlasie]] became annexed by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The region was subject to [[Teutonic Knights]] raids, which took place in 1346 and 1379.\n\nIn 1382, [[Mazovia]]n Duke [[Janusz I of Warsaw]] captured Bielsk, [[Drohiczyn]], [[Suraz]] and [[Mielnik]], taking advantage of the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381\u201384)]]. Next year, [[Jogaila]] pushed the Mazovians out of Bielsko, handing the gord over to [[Vytautas]] (Witold). In 1390, [[Jogaila]], who had become King of Poland, handed Bielsk, Suraz, Drohiczyn and Mielnik over to Janusz I.\n\nDue to its convenient location along a merchant route from [[Krak\u00f3w]] to [[Vilnius]], Bielsk became an important center of trade and administration. In late November 1412, it was visited by King Jogaila, and 1413, the [[ziemia|Land]] of Drohiczyn, together with Bielsk, became part of [[Trakai Voivodeship]]. In 1430, Duke Vytautas named first [[vogt]] of Bielsko, a man named Andrzej. A number of Poles from Mazovia begin to settle in Podlasie.\n\n[[File:Podlaskie - Bielsk Podlaski - Bielsk Podlaski - Mickiewicza 61 - Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 MB Matki Bo\u017cej z G\u00f3ry Karmel 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Roman Catholic]] Church on [[Adam Mickiewicz]] Street]]\n\nBielsk received its [[Magdeburg rights]] town charter on 18 November 1495, from King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]]. In September 1501, a meeting of Lithuanian [[szlachta|nobility]] took place here. Several Polish rulers visited Bielsk, such as Jogaila, Alexander I (1505), [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506, 1509), and [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1564). In 1513, Bielsk was named capital of the newly created [[Podlaskie Voivodeship (1513\u20131795)|Podlaskie Voivodeship]]; by 1563, the town had 830 houses, and was also main center of the [[ziemia|Land of Bielsko]].\n\nIn early summer of 1564, when king Sigismund II Augustus stayed here with Primate [[Jakub Ucha\u0144ski]], to discuss the new Polish \u2013 Lithuanian union (see [[Union of Lublin]]), the wooden castle of Bielsk burned to the ground, with the king watching the incident from the stables. New castle for the local [[starosta]] was built in Holowiesko, while land court was moved to [[Bra\u0144sk]].\n\n[[File:Karczma \"S\u0142uszna\" w Bielsku Podlaskim 04.jpg|thumb|left|A wooden [[inn]] called ''S\u0142uszna'' near the marketplace and town hall]]\n\nFollowing the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569), Bielsko was transferred from Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. The town prospered, with churches, hospital, mills, shops and 265 artisans (as for 1576). Bielsko burned in 1591, and [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]] brought almost complete destruction (1655).\n\nFollowing the [[Partitions of Poland]], Bielsk briefly belonged to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1795\u20131807): after the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], it was transferred to the [[Russian Empire]]. From 1843, it belonged to the [[Grodno Governorate]]. Residents of the area actively participated in both [[November uprising]] and [[January Uprising|January uprising]]. In 1873, Bielsk received rail connection with [[Brest Litovsk]], and in 1915, German troops burned the rail station. Germans retreated from the town in February 1919, and were replaced by Polish Army units. In late July 1920, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]], Bielsk was briefly occupied by the [[Red Army]].\n\nIn the [[Second Polish Republic]], Bielsk belonged to [[Bialystok Voivodeship (1919\u201339)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]]. During the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]], the town was captured by the [[Wehrmacht]], which on 23 September handed it over to the Soviets, who remained here until 23 June 1941, forcibly sending thousands to [[Siberia]]. In 1941 \u2013 1944, the town was occupied by the [[Third Reich]]. Germans murdered its Jewish minority, and in a nearby forest killed approximately 800 Poles. Bielsk was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 30 July 1944.\n\nThe [[Carmelites]] Church in Bielsk and monastery was founded in 1641 by magnate [[Adam Kazanowski]] ([[starost]] of Bielsk from 1638) and dedicated to the Mother of God of [[Mount Carmel]]. The project was also financed by his wife El\u017cbieta (''Halszka'') S\u0142uszczanka (around 1619\u20131671).\n\nBielsk Podlaski has a rich Jewish history which was wiped out in the Holocaust.<ref>Andrew Blumberg, [http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/Bielsk_Podlaski/BBUV.htm ''Bielsker Bruderlicher Unterstitzungs Verein''] 2002</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nDetailed data as of 31 December 2007:<ref name=\"2007PolandPop\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/45_655_PLK_HTML.htm |title=Central Statistical Office (GUS) ''Population: Size and Structure by Administrative Division'' |date=31 December 2007 |language=Polish |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505094648/http://www.stat.gov.pl/gus/45_655_PLK_HTML.htm |archivedate=5 May 2008 }}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!&nbsp; ||colspan=2| Total ||colspan=2| Women ||colspan=2| Men\n|-\n|Unit || Number || % || Number || % || Number || %\n|-\n|Population || '''26,577''' || 100 || 13,775 || 51.8 || 12,802 || 48.2\n|-\n|Population Density<br>(persons/km\u00b2) ||colspan=2| 988.0 ||colspan=2| 512.1 ||colspan=2| 475.9\n|}\n\n===1897 census===\nThe most spoken languages in Bielsk Podlaski according to the [[Russian Empire Census|The Russian Imperial Census of 1897]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97_uezd.php?reg=360|title=\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0430\u044f \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043f\u0438\u0441\u044c \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0418\u043c\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0438 1897 \u0433. \u0420\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043f\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443 \u0438 \u0443\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043c 50 \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0415\u0432\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438|publisher=\u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043f Weekly}} {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is located north-eastern Poland, in the historical region of [[Podlachia]].\n\n==Geography==\nBielsk Podlaski is located in the geographical region of Europe known as the ''Wysoczyzny Podlasko \u2013 Bialoruskie'' (English: Podlaskie and Belarus Plateau) and the mezoregion known as the ''R\u00f3wnin\u0119 Bielsk\u0105'' (English: [[Bielsk Plain]]).\n\nThe town covers an area of {{convert|32.43|km2|sqmi|1}}.\n\n===Location===\nIt is located approximately:\n* {{Convert|195|km|mi|1}} northeast of [[Warsaw]], the capital of Poland\n* {{Convert|50|km|mi|1}} southwest of Bia\u0142ystok, the capital of the Podlaskie Voivodeship\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dom drewniany,BielskPodlaski,ul.Ko\u015bcielna4.JPG|thumb|left|A historical house from 1909. Preserved wooden architecture can still be found in some parts of the town]]\nBielsk Podlaski has a long and rich history, dating back to the 12th century, when this area of Poland belonged to [[Kievan Rus']]. The [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]] of Bielsk was probably founded by Ruthenian dukes, and its existence was first mentioned in 1253, in the so-called [[Hypatian Codex]]. In 1273, Bielsk was captured by Lithuanian duke [[Traidenis]], and in the early 14th century, whole province of [[Podlasie]] became annexed by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. The region was subject to [[Teutonic Knights]] raids, which took place in 1346 and 1379.\n\nIn 1382, [[Mazovia]]n Duke [[Janusz I of Warsaw]] captured Bielsk, [[Drohiczyn]], [[Suraz]] and [[Mielnik]], taking advantage of the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1381\u201384)]]. Next year, [[Jogaila]] pushed the Mazovians out of Bielsko, handing the gord over to [[Vytautas]] (Witold). In 1390, [[Jogaila]], who had become King of Poland, handed Bielsk, Suraz, Drohiczyn and Mielnik over to Janusz I.\n\nDue to its convenient location along a merchant route from [[Krak\u00f3w]] to [[Vilnius]], Bielsk became an important center of trade and administration. In late November 1412, it was visited by King Jogaila, and 1413, the [[ziemia|Land]] of Drohiczyn, together with Bielsk, became part of [[Trakai Voivodeship]]. In 1430, Duke Vytautas named first [[vogt]] of Bielsko, a man named Andrzej. A number of Poles from Mazovia begin to settle in Podlasie.\n\n[[File:Podlaskie - Bielsk Podlaski - Bielsk Podlaski - Mickiewicza 61 - Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 MB Matki Bo\u017cej z G\u00f3ry Karmel 01.JPG|thumb|right|[[Roman Catholic]] Church on [[Adam Mickiewicz]] Street]]\n\nBielsk received its [[Magdeburg rights]] town charter on 18 November 1495, from King [[Alexander I Jagiellon]]. In September 1501, a meeting of Lithuanian [[szlachta|nobility]] took place here. Several Polish rulers visited Bielsk, such as Jogaila, Alexander I (1505), [[Sigismund I the Old]] (1506, 1509), and [[Sigismund II Augustus]] (1564). In 1513, Bielsk was named capital of the newly created [[Podlaskie Voivodeship (1513\u20131795)|Podlaskie Voivodeship]]; by 1563, the town had 830 houses, and was also main center of the [[ziemia|Land of Bielsko]].\n\nIn early summer of 1564, when king Sigismund II Augustus stayed here with Primate [[Jakub Ucha\u0144ski]], to discuss the new Polish \u2013 Lithuanian union (see [[Union of Lublin]]), the wooden castle of Bielsk burned to the ground, with the king watching the incident from the stables. New castle for the local [[starosta]] was built in Holowiesko, while land court was moved to [[Bra\u0144sk]].\n\n[[File:Karczma \"S\u0142uszna\" w Bielsku Podlaskim 04.jpg|thumb|left|A wooden [[inn]] called ''S\u0142uszna'' near the marketplace and town hall]]\n\nFollowing the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569), Bielsko was transferred from Grand Duchy of Lithuania into the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. The town prospered, with churches, hospital, mills, shops and 265 artisans (as for 1576). Bielsko burned in 1591, and [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]] brought almost complete destruction (1655).\n\nFollowing the [[Partitions of Poland]], Bielsk briefly belonged to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (1795\u20131807): after the [[Treaties of Tilsit]], it was transferred to the [[Russian Empire]]. From 1843, it belonged to the [[Grodno Governorate]]. Residents of the area actively participated in both [[November uprising]] and [[January uprising]]. In 1873, Bielsk received rail connection with [[Brest Litovsk]], and in 1915, German troops burned the rail station. Germans retreated from the town in February 1919, and were replaced by Polish Army units. In late July 1920, during the [[Polish-Soviet War]], Bielsk was briefly occupied by the [[Red Army]].\n\nIn the [[Second Polish Republic]], Bielsk belonged to [[Bialystok Voivodeship (1919\u201339)|Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship]]. During the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland]], the town was captured by the [[Wehrmacht]], which on 23 September handed it over to the Soviets, who remained here until 23 June 1941, forcibly sending thousands to [[Siberia]]. In 1941 \u2013 1944, the town was occupied by the [[Third Reich]]. Germans murdered its Jewish minority, and in a nearby forest killed approximately 800 Poles. Bielsk was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 30 July 1944.\n\nThe [[Carmelites]] Church in Bielsk and monastery was founded in 1641 by magnate [[Adam Kazanowski]] ([[starost]] of Bielsk from 1638) and dedicated to the Mother of God of [[Mount Carmel]].
