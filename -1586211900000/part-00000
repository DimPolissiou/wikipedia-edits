In June 2019, Iran [[2019 Iranian shoot-down of American drone|shot down]] an American [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk|RQ-4A]] surveillance drone flying over the [[Strait of Hormuz]], sharply increasing tensions and nearly resulting in an armed confrontation.

It is a development of the [[Type 054 frigate]], using the same hull but with improved sensors and weapons.\n\nThe Type 054A was first revealed while under construction at the [[Guangzhou]]-based Huangpu Shipyard in 2005.\n\n==Improvements over Type 054==\nThe Type 054A carries [[HQ-16]] medium-range air defence missiles and anti-submarine missiles in a [[vertical launching system]] (VLS) system. The HQ-16 has a range of up to 50&nbsp;km, with superior range and engagement angles to the Type 054's [[HQ-7]]. The Type 054A's VLS uses a hot launch method; a shared common exhaust system is sited between the two rows of rectangular launching tubes.<ref>\u8230\u8f7d\u6b66\u5668SHIPBORNE WEAPONS 2013 AUGUST ISSUE</ref>\n\nThe four [[AK-630]] [[close-in weapon system]]s (CIWS) of the Type 054 were replaced with two [[Type 730 CIWS]] on the Type 054A.

the first of which entered service with the [[People's Liberation Army Navy Surface Force]] in 2007. It is a development of the [[Type 054 frigate]], using the same hull but with improved sensors and weapons.\n\nThe Type 054A was first revealed while under construction at the [[Guangzhou]]-based Huangpu Shipyard in 2005.\n\n==Improvements over Type 054==\nThe Type 054A carries [[HQ-16]] medium-range air defence missiles and anti-submarine missiles in a [[vertical launching system]] (VLS) system.

Middle East.\u201d The map, entitled \u201cHow 5 Could Become 14,\u201d shows a hypothetical future division of Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia into 14 potential new countries along with two additional city-states. I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia. This sparked anger among Yemenis, and a group of Yemeni activists founded the \"Asir Movement\" in order to reclaim the provinces of Asir, Najran, and Jizan, which Yemen conceded in the 2000 [[Treaty of Jeddah (2000)|Treaty of Jeddah]]. A \"[[Human rights|rights]] organization which has worked to denounce Saudi Arabia\u2019s abuses in northern Yemen\",<ref name=PressTV>{{cite news|title=Yemen's Houthis standing ground against Saudi Arabia |url= http://www.presstv.com/detail/2014/02/07/349604/houthis-stand-ground-against-s-arabia |work=Press TV| date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> the Asir Movement described itself as a \u201ccivil popular\u201d movement that seeks to raise \"internal Yemeni awareness\" about the situation and to explore legal remedies against Saudi Arabia \"for their involvement and assistance in abdicating Yemen\u2019s historical right to its territories\", all while emphasizing Yemeni unity.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]]. Many supporters of Taiwan independence believe that Taiwan, under the formal name of the \"Republic of China\", is already an independent country from China, under the formal name of the \"People's Republic of China\".\n***Political parties: [[Pan-Green Coalition]] ([[Democratic Progressive Party]], [[Taiwan Solidarity Union]], [[Taiwan Independence Party]]), [[New Power Party]], [[Taiwan Statebuilding Party]]\n***Advocacy groups: Keep Taiwan Free (Taiwanese organisation), [[World United Formosans for Independence]]\n***Claimed territories: Taiwan (Kaohsiung, New Taipei, Taichung, Tainan, Taipei, Taiwan-Penghu, Taoyuan)\n***Area of claimed territories: Roughly 36,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of claimed territories: Roughly 24,000,000 people\n{{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}} '''[[Kinmen|Kinmen County, Republic of China (Taiwan)]] (Kinmen)''' \u2014 Independence movement{{See also|Kinmen|Taiwan independence movement#The issue of Kinmen (Quemoy) and Matsu (Lienchiang)}}\n\n* Ethnic group: Kinmenese people, [[Taiwanese people]]\n**Proposed unification with a proposed state: {{flagdeco|Kinmen}}{{flagdeco|TWN}}[[File:Flag of World Taiwanese Congress.svg|22px|border]] Kinmen County, Republic of Taiwan\n***Movement: Kinmen-Taiwan unification movement, [[Taiwan independence movement]], [[Taiwanese nationalism]]\n****Note: [[Kinmen]] is currently ruled by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]], so it and Taiwan are ''de facto'' already united. However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

Kinmen is viewed by the Chinese (PRC) government as a place where Chinese (re)unification experiments can be conducted, in preparation for the ultimate goal of annexing the [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]]. The Kinmen County government has frequently clashed with the [[Mainland Affairs Council|Taiwan Mainland Affairs Council]] (which oversees relations with the PRC) over its willingness to allow the Chinese (PRC) government to infiltrate its society, economy, politics, cultural institutions, religious institutions, educational institutions, and local communities. It is unknown what percentage of Kinmenese society supports this movement but it is known that the Kinmen County government supports this movement and that it has been actively pushing for Kinmen's annexation into China (PRC).\n*** Area of Kinmen: Roughly 150&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>\n***Population of Kinmen: Roughly 130,000 people\n\n'''Chinese (re)unification under the ROC'''\n\n{{See also|Three Principles of the People|Project National Glory|Communist bandit}}\n\nThis is a variant of the Chinese (re)unification movement that advocates for the ROC to become the ruling regime of China again, replacing the PRC.

It advocates for the (re)unification of China (PRC) and Taiwan (ROC) under a hypothetical \"New China\". Proponents of this movement believe that both the PRC and the ROC have expired and that the only logical solution that is fair to both parties is to overthrow both regimes and replace them with a single \"New China\" regime that possesses characteristics of both the PRC and the ROC, as well as its own unique traits. Visions for such a \"New China\" range from a \"[[dictatorship]]\" to a \"[[democracy]]\".

I was immediately reminded of Ralph Peters\u2019 troublesome remapping of the same region. As explained in a previous GeoCurrents post, Peters\u2019 intriguing mental exercise in redrawing national boundaries was widely misinterpreted across the Muslim world as indicating a nefarious plot to enhance US power. As a result, the region\u2019s pronounced anti-Americanism was further inflamed.<ref>http://www.geocurrents.info/geopolitics/myth-nation-state/robin-wrights-audacious-remapping-middle-east</ref><ref>https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2015/03/26/from-one-yemen-to-a-dissolution-of-saudi-arabia/</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Robin-Wrights-Remapped-Middle-East.png</ref><ref>http://geocurrents.info/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Saudi-Arabia-Remapped-by-Robin-Wright.png</ref>\n\nFurthermore, in June 2012 the Yemeni newspaper ''Al-Shareh'' revealed the names of high-ranking Yemeni state officials and tribal sheikhs who had been receiving monthly bribes from Saudi Arabia.

Although the DPP has been the nominal ruling party of the Republic of China throughout these four ruling terms, the DPP has been pushing a pro-Taiwan independence agenda, whether tacitly or overtly. Some representatives of the DPP, such as [[William Lai]], argue that Taiwan independence should not even be considered an \"independence movement\" but is rather the recognition of the reality of the current situation of the [[Republic of China on Taiwan]].

However, Kinmen's history is highly distinct from Taiwan's, and they've only really had a shared history since 1949, when the [[Republic of China retreat to Taiwan|Republic of China retreated to Taiwan]]. Furthermore, Kinmen's recent history has been largely shaped by military conflict between the ROC and the PRC and by the fact that [[Martial law in Taiwan|martial law]] was abolished in Kinmen in 1992, five years after it was abolished in Taiwan (in 1987). If the \"[[Taiwan independence movement|Republic of Taiwan]]\" were to be established, many people are uncertain of whether Kinmen should be included in this new country.

{"title_page": "Strengthening mechanisms of materials", "text_new": "{{cleanup|date=October 2010}}\n\nMethods have been devised to modify the [[yield strength]], [[ductility]], and [[toughness]] of both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit a variety of different applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] incorporation of [[carbon]] into the [[iron]] lattice. [[Brass]], a binary [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[zinc]], has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening.  Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce [[dislocations]] into materials, increasing their [[yield strength]]s.\n\n==Basic description==\n[[Plastic deformation in solids|Plastic deformation]] occurs when large numbers of [[dislocation]]s move and multiply so as to result in macroscopic deformation.  In other words, it is the movement of dislocations in the material which allows for deformation. If we want to enhance a material's mechanical properties (i.e. increase the yield and [[tensile strength]]), we simply need to introduce a mechanism which prohibits the mobility of these dislocations. Whatever the mechanism may be, (work hardening, grain size reduction, etc.) they all hinder dislocation motion and render the material stronger than previously.<ref>Davidge, R.W., Mechanical Behavior of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, (1979)</ref><ref>Lawn, B.R., Fracture of Brittle Solids, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, 2nd Edn. (1993)</ref><ref>Green, D., An Introduction to the Mechanical Properties of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, Eds. Clarke, D.R., Suresh, S., Ward, I.M. (1998)</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Callister, William Jr, Materials Science and Engineering, An Introduction. John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1985)</ref> \n\nThe stress required to cause dislocation motion is orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical stress required to shift an entire plane of atoms, so this mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on the ease with which dislocations move. [[Pinning points]], or locations in the crystal that oppose the motion of dislocations,<ref>Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf, D., \"Theory of Plastic Deformation,\" Materials Science and Engineering A, vol 113, pp 1-42, July 1989</ref> can be introduced into the lattice to reduce dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may be pinned due to [[stress field]] interactions with other dislocations and solute particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming along grain boundaries. There are five main strengthening mechanisms for metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required to start irreversible [[plastic deformation in solids|(plastic) deformation]] is greater than it was for the original material.  \n\nIn [[amorphous]] materials such as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms such as brittle fracture, [[crazing]], and [[shear band]] formation. In these systems, strengthening mechanisms do not involve dislocations, but rather consist of modifications to the chemical structure and processing of the constituent material.\n\nThe strength of materials cannot infinitely increase. Each of the mechanisms explained below involves some trade-off by which other material properties are compromised in the process of strengthening.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in metals==\n\n=== Work hardening  ===\n{{main|Work hardening}}\n\nThe primary species responsible for [[work hardening]] are dislocations. Dislocations interact with each other by generating stress fields in the material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if two dislocations cross, dislocation line entanglement occurs, causing the formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is a correlation between dislocation density and yield strength,\n\n<math> \\Delta\\sigma_{y} = {Gb\\sqrt{\\rho_\\perp}} </math>\n\nwhere <math> G </math> is the [[shear modulus]], <math> b </math> is the [[Burgers vector]], and <math> \\rho_\\perp </math> is the dislocation density.\n\nIncreasing the dislocation density increases the yield strength which results in a higher shear stress required to move the dislocations. This process is easily observed while working a material (by a process of cold working in metals). Theoretically, the strength of a material with no dislocations will be extremely high (\u03c4=G/2) because plastic deformation would require the breaking of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate dislocation density values of around 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup>, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the whole rug. At dislocation densities of 10<sup>14</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, the strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline structure.<sup>Citation needed</sup>\n\n[[Image:Interstitial solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of interstitial solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atoms cause. The interstitial solute could be carbon in iron for example. The carbon atoms in the interstitial sites of the lattice creates a stress field that impedes dislocation movement.]]\n\n[[Image:Substitutional solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of substitutional  solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atom causes.]]\n\n=== Solid solution strengthening and alloying ===\n{{main|Solid solution strengthening}}\nFor this strengthening mechanism, solute atoms of one element are added to another, resulting in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in the [[crystal]] (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that impede dislocation motion, increasing the [[yield stress]] of the material. Solute atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile stresses to the lattice, depending on solute '''size''', which interfere with nearby dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers.\n\nThe shear stress required to move dislocations in a material is:\n\n<math> \\Delta\\tau = Gb\\sqrt{c} \\epsilon^{3/2} </math>\n\nwhere <math> c </math> is the solute concentration and <math> \\epsilon </math> is the strain on the material caused by the solute.\n\nIncreasing the concentration of the solute atoms will increase the yield strength of a material, but there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be added, and one should look at the phase diagram for the material and the alloy to make sure that a second phase is not created.\n\nIn general, the solid solution strengthening depends on the concentration of the solute atoms, shear modulus of the solute atoms, size of solute atoms, valency of solute atoms (for ionic materials), and the symmetry of the solute stress field. The magnitude of strengthening is higher for non-symmetric stress fields because these solutes can interact with both edge and screw dislocations, whereas symmetric stress fields, which cause only volume change and not shape change, can only interact with edge dislocations.\n[[Image:Particle strengthening.svg|thumb|250px|'''Figure 2:''' A schematic illustrating how the dislocations can interact with a particle. It can either cut through the particle or bow around the particle and create a dislocation loop as it moves over the particle.]]\n\n=== Precipitation hardening ===\n{{main|Precipitation strengthening}}\nIn most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase diagram will cause the formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be created by mechanical or thermal treatments. The particles that compose the second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to solutes, though the particles are not necessarily single atoms.\n\nThe dislocations in a material can interact with the precipitate atoms in one of two ways (see Figure 2). If the precipitate atoms are small, the dislocations would cut through them. As a result, new surfaces (b in Figure 2) of the particle would get exposed to the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial energy would increase. For larger precipitate particles, looping or bowing of the dislocations would occur and result in dislocations getting longer. Hence, at a critical radius of about 5&nbsp;nm, dislocations will preferably cut across the obstacle, while for a radius of 30&nbsp;nm, the dislocations will readily bow or loop to overcome the obstacle. \n\nThe mathematical descriptions are as follows: \n\nFor particle bowing-  \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {Gb\\over L-2r} </math>\n\nFor particle cutting- \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {\\gamma \\pi r \\over b L} </math>\n\n[[Image:Dislocation pileup.svg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3:'''  A schematic roughly illustrating the concept of dislocation pile up and how it effects the strength of the material. A material with larger grain size is able to have more dislocation to pile up leading to a bigger driving force for dislocations to move from one grain to another. Thus, less force need be applied to move a dislocation from a larger, than from a smaller grain, leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.]]\n\n=== Grain boundary strengthening ===\n{{main|Grain boundary strengthening}}\nIn a polycrystalline metal, grain size has a tremendous influence on the mechanical properties. Because grains usually have varying crystallographic orientations, grain boundaries arise. While undergoing deformation, slip motion will take place. Grain boundaries act as an impediment to dislocation motion for the following two reasons: \n\n1. Dislocation must change its direction of motion due to the differing orientation of grains.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br>\n2. Discontinuity of slip planes from grain one to grain two.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe stress required to move a dislocation from one grain to another in order to plastically deform a material depends on the grain size. The average number of dislocations per grain decreases with average grain size (see Figure 3). A lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation 'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This makes it more difficult for dislocations to move into adjacent grains. This relationship is the [[Grain boundary strengthening#Hall\u2013Petch relationship|Hall-Petch relationship]] and can be mathematically described as follows:\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y} = \\sigma_{y,0} + {k \\over {d^x}} </math>,\n\nwhere <math>k</math> is a constant, <math>d</math> is the average grain diameter and <math>\\sigma_{y,0}</math> is the original yield stress.\n\nThe fact that the yield strength increases with decreasing grain size is accompanied by the caveat that the grain size cannot be decreased infinitely. As the grain size decreases, more free volume is generated resulting in lattice mismatch. Below approximately 10&nbsp;nm, the grain boundaries will tend to slide instead; a phenomenon known as [[grain-boundary sliding]]. If the grain size gets too small, it becomes more difficult to fit the dislocations in the grain and the stress required to move them is less.  It was not possible to produce materials with grain sizes below 10&nbsp;nm until recently, so the discovery that strength decreases below a critical grain size is still finding new applications.\n\n=== Transformation hardening ===\nThis method of hardening is used for steels.\n\nHigh-strength steels generally fall into three basic categories, classified by the strengthening mechanism employed.\n1- [[Solid solution strengthening|solid-solution-strengthened steels (rephos steels)]]\n2- [[Solid solution strengthening|grain-refined steels]] or [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high strength low alloy steels (HSLA)]]\n3- transformation-hardened steels\n\nTransformation-hardened steels are the third type of high-strength steels.These steels use predominantly higher levels of C and Mn along with heat treatment to increase strength.  The finished product will have a duplex micro-structure of ferrite with varying levels of degenerate \nmartensite.  This allows for varying levels of strength.  There are three basic types of transformation-hardened steels.  These are dual-phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and martensitic steels. \n\nThe annealing process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region for a set period of time.  During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity.  The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed \ninto martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition.  By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, as well as the degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled.  Depending on \nprocessing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. \n \nTRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of austenite and bainite in a ferrite matrix.  Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region for a period of time sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse \ninto austenite.  The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there.  This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product.  While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite.  This, in turn, lowers the \nmartensite start temperature to below room temperature.  Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite).  This combination of micro-structures has the added \nbenefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming.  This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger.  Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa.\n  \nMartensitic steels are also high in C and Mn.  These are fully quenched to martensite during processing.  The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel.  Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in amorphous materials==\n\n===Polymer===\n\n[[Polymers]] [[fracture]] via breaking of inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure of these materials plays a huge role in increasing strength. For [[polymers]] consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical and physical cross linking can be used to increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers ([[thermosetting plastic]]), disulfide bridges and other [[covalent]] cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers.<ref name=Meyers>Meyers, Chawla. ''Mechanical Behavior of Materials.'' Cambridge University Press. pg 420-425. 1999</ref> In [[thermoplastic elastomer]], phase separation of dissimilar [[monomer]] components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\nAdding [[Filler (materials)|filler materials]] such as fibers, platelets, and particles is a commonly employed technique for strengthening polymer materials. Fillers such as clay, silica, and carbon network materials have been extensively researched and used in polymer composites in part due to their effect on mechanical properties. Stiffness-confinement effects near rigid interfaces, such as those between a polymer matrix and stiffer filler materials, enhance the stiffness of composites by restricting polymer chain motion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.108303|pmid=23521308|title=Effect of Nanoconfinement on Polymer Dynamics: Surface Layers and Interphases|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=110|issue=10|pages=108303|year=2013|last1=Krutyeva|first1=M.|last2=Wischnewski|first2=A.|last3=Monkenbusch|first3=M.|last4=Willner|first4=L.|last5=Maiz|first5=J.|last6=Mijangos|first6=C.|last7=Arbe|first7=A.|last8=Colmenero|first8=J.|last9=Radulescu|first9=A.|last10=Holderer|first10=O.|last11=Ohl|first11=M.|last12=Richter|first12=D.|hdl=10261/102483}}</ref> This is especially present where fillers are chemically treated to strongly interact with polymer chains, increasing the anchoring of polymer chains to the filler interfaces and thus further restricting the motion of chains away from the interface.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5PY01631B|title=Toughening of photo-curable polymer networks: A review|journal=Polymer Chemistry|volume=7|issue=2|pages=257\u2013286|year=2016|last1=Ligon-Auer|first1=Samuel Clark|last2=Schwentenwein|first2=Martin|last3=Gorsche|first3=Christian|last4=Stampfl|first4=J\u00fcrgen|last5=Liska|first5=Robert}}</ref> Stiffness-confinement effects have been characterized in model nanocomposites, and shows that composites with length scales on the order of nanometers increase the effect of the fillers on polymer stiffness dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00917|title=Stiffness Gradients in Glassy Polymer Model Nanocomposites: Comparisons of Quantitative Characterization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=Macromolecules|volume=50|issue=14|pages=5447\u20135458|year=2017|last1=Zhang|first1=Min|last2=Askar|first2=Shadid|last3=Torkelson|first3=John M.|last4=Brinson|first4=L. Catherine}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing the bulkiness of the [[monomer]] unit via incorporation of aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The [[anisotropy]] of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are heavily dependent on the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along the direction of the chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this [[anisotropy]]. For example, the high strength of [[Kevlar]] arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented [[polyethylene]], are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.<ref name=Meyers/> \n\nMixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic [[polystyrene]] (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\n[[Interpenetrating polymer network|Interpenetrating polymer networks]] (IPNs), consisting of interlacing crosslinked polymer networks that are not covalently bonded to one another, can lead to enhanced strength in polymer materials. The use of an IPN approach imposes compatibility (and thus macroscale homogeneity) on otherwise immiscible blends, allowing for a blending of mechanical properties. For example, silicone-polyurethane IPNs show increased tear and flexural strength over base silicone networks, while preserving the high elastic recovery of the silicone network at high strains.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1990-0224.ch010|chapter=Polysiloxane\u2014Thermoplastic Interpenetrating Polymer Networks|title=Silicon-Based Polymer Science|volume=224|pages=181\u2013199|series=Advances in Chemistry|year=1989|last1=Arkles|first1=Barry|last2=Crosby|first2=Jane|isbn=0-8412-1546-4}}</ref> Increased stiffness can also be achieved by pre-straining polymer networks and then sequentially forming a secondary network within the strained material.

By introducing compression stress into the structure, the tensile strength of the material can be increased. This is typically done via two mechanisms: thermal treatment (tempering) or chemical bath (via ion exchange). \n\nIn tempered glasses, air jets are used to rapidly cool the top and bottom surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt.  The core of the slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding.\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y=modified}  = \\sigma_{y,0} + \\sigma_{compressive} </math>\n\nAlternately, in chemical treatment, a glass slab treated containing network formers and modifiers is submerged into a molten salt bath containing ions larger than those present in the modifier. Due to a concentration gradient of the ions, mass transport must take place. As the larger cation diffuses from the molten salt into the surface, it replaces the smaller ion from the modifier. The larger ion squeezing into surface introduces compressive stress in the glass's surface. A common example is treatment of sodium oxide modified silicate glass in molten [[potassium chloride]].\n\n== Composite strengthening  ==\n\nMany of the basic strengthening mechanisms can be classified based on their dimensionality. At 0-D there is precipitate and solid solution strengthening with particulates strengthening structure, at 1-D there is work/forest hardening with line dislocations as the hardening mechanism, and at 2-D there is grain boundary strengthening with surface energy of granular interfaces providing strength improvement. The two primary types of composite strengthening, fiber reinforcement and laminar reinforcement, fall in the 1-D and 2-D classes, respectively. The anisotropy of fiber and laminar composite strength reflects these dimensionalities. The primary idea behind composite strengthening is to combine materials with opposite strengths and weaknesses to create a material which transfers load onto the stiffer material but benefits from the ductility and toughness of the softer material. <ref name=\"courtney\">{{cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=Thomas H |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |date=1990 |publisher=Waveland Press Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n=== Fiber reinforcement ===\n{{main|Fiber-reinforced composite}}\nFiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) consist of a matrix of one material containing parallel embedded fibers. There are two variants of fiber-reinforced composites, one with stiff fibers and a ductile matrix and one with ductile fibers and a stiff matrix. The former variant is exemplified by fiberglass which contains very strong but delicate glass fibers embedded in a softer plastic matrix resilient to fracture. The latter variant is found in almost all buildings as reinforced concrete with ductile, high tensile-strength steel rods embedded in brittle, high compressive-strength concrete. In both cases, the matrix and fibers have complimentary mechanical properties and the resulting composite material is therefore more practical for applications in the real world.\n\nFor a composite containing aligned, stiff fibers which span the length of the material and a soft, ductile matrix, the following descriptions provide a rough model.\n\n==== Four stages of deformation ====\nThe condition of a fiber-reinforced composite under applied tensile stress along the direction of the fibers can be decomposed into four stages from small strain to large strain. Since the stress is parallel to the fibers, the deformation is described by the isostrain condition, i.e., the fiber and matrix experience the same strain. At each stage, the composite stress (<math> \\sigma_{c} </math>) is given in terms of the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix (<math> V_{f}, V_{m}  </math>), the Young's moduli of the fiber and matrix (<math> E_{f}, E_{m}  </math>), the strain of the composite (<math> \\epsilon_{c}  </math>), and the stress of the fiber and matrix as read from a stress-strain curve (<math> \\sigma_{f}(\\epsilon_{c}), \\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c})  </math>).\n\n# Both fiber and composite remain in the elastic strain regime. In this stage, we also note that the composite Young's modulus is a simple weighted sum of the two component moduli.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\epsilon_{c}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n#:<math> E_{c} = V_{f}E_{f} +  V_{m}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# The fiber remains in the elastic regime but the matrix yields and plastically deforms.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# Both fiber and composite yield and plastically deform.

Given the assumptions outlined above, the first tensile strength would correspond to failure of the fibers, with some support from the matrix plastic deformation strength, and the second with failure of the matrix.\n\n:<math>TS_1 = V_fTS_f + V_m\\sigma_m(\\epsilon_c) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n:<math>TS_2 = V_mTS_m </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n==== Anisotropy (Orientation effects) ====\nAs a result of the aforementioned dimensionality (1-D) of fiber reinforcement, significant anisotropy is observed in its mechanical properties. The following equations model the tensile strength of a FRC as a function of the misalignment angle (<math>\\theta</math>) between the fibers and the applied force, the stresses in the parallel and perpendicular, or <math>\\theta=0</math> and <math>90</math>{{sup|o}}, cases (<math>\\ \\sigma_{||}, \\sigma_{\\perp}</math>), and the shear strength of the matrix (<math> \\tau_{my} </math>).\n\n;:Small Misalignment Angle (longitudinal fracture)\n: The angle is small enough to maintain load transfer onto the fibers and prevent delamination of fibers ''and'' the misaligned stress samples a slightly larger cross-sectional area of the fiber so the strength of the fiber is not just maintained but actually increases compared to the parallel case.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{||}}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}</math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Significant Misalignment Angle (shear failure)\n: The angle is large enough that the load is not effectively transferred to the fibers and the matrix experiences enough strain to fracture.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\tau_{my}}{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Near Perpendicular Misaligment Angle (transverse fracture)\n: The angle is close to 90{{sup|o}} so most of the load remains in the matrix and thus tensile transverse matrix fracture is the dominant failure condition.

A primary application of strengthened materials is for construction. In order to have stronger buildings and bridges, one must have a strong frame that can support high tensile or compressive load and resist plastic deformation. The steel frame used to make the building should be as strong as possible so that it does not bend under the entire weight of the building. Polymeric roofing materials would also need to be strong so that the roof does not cave in when there is build-up of snow on the rooftop.\n\nResearch is also currently being done to increase the strength of metallic materials through the addition of polymer materials such as bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer to (CFRP)[https://archive.today/20130202115814/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V2G-4GX6HXM-8&_user=501045&_coverDate=03/31/2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000022659&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=501045&md5=f938f165c8666c9fa0174d293e45297b%23bib4].\n\n===Molecular dynamics simulations===\nThe use of computation simulations to model work hardening in materials allows for the direct observation of critical elements that rule the process of strengthening materials.  The basic reasoning derives from the fact that, when examining plasticity and the movement of dislocations in materials, a focus on the atomistic level is many times not accounted for and the focus rests on the contiuum description of materials.  Since the practice of tracking these atomistic effects in experiments and theorizing about them in textbooks cannot provide a full understanding of these interactions, many turn to molecular dynamics simulations to develop this understanding.<ref name=Buehler>Buehler, Markus J. ''the dynamical complexity of work - hardening:  a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation.'' Acta Mech Sinica. pg 103-111. 2005</ref>\n\nThe simulations work by utilizing the known atomic interactions between any two atoms and the relationship F = ma, so that the dislocations moving through the material are ruled by simple mechanical actions and reactions of the atoms.  The [[interatomic potential]] usually utilized to estimate these interactions is the Lennard \u2013 Jones 12:6 potential.  Lennard \u2013 Jones is widely accepted because its experimental shortcomings are well-known.<ref name=Buehler/><ref name=Abraham>Abraham, F.  \"Simulating materials failure by using up to one billion atoms and the world's fastest computer: Work-hardening.\"  Proc Natl Acad Sci.  pg 5783\u20135787. 2002</ref>  These interactions are simply scaled up to millions or billions of atoms in some cases to simulate materials more accurately.  \n\nMolecular dynamic simulations display the interactions based upon the governing equations provided above for the strengthening mechanisms.  They provide an effective way to see these mechanisms in action outside the painstaking realm of direct observation during experiments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grain boundary strengthening]]\n*[[Precipitation strengthening]]\n*[[Solid solution strengthening]]\n*[[Strength of materials]]\n*[[Tempering (metallurgy)]]\n*[[Work hardening]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5758/212 Grain boundary strengthening in alumina by rare earth impurities]\n*[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00801481 Mechanism of grain boundary strengthening of steels]\n*[http://zambaldi.de/software/stabix/ An open source Matlab toolbox for analysis of slip transfer through grain boundaries]\n\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Strengthening mechanisms of materials|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{cleanup|date=October 2010}}\n\nMethods have been devised to modify the [[yield strength]], [[ductility]], and [[toughness]] of both [[crystalline]] and [[amorphous]] materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit a variety of different applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] incorporation of [[carbon]] into the [[iron]] lattice. [[Brass]], a binary [[alloy]] of [[copper]] and [[zinc]], has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening.  Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce [[dislocations]] into materials, increasing their [[yield strength]]s.\n\n==Basic description==\n[[Plastic deformation in solids|Plastic deformation]] occurs when large numbers of [[dislocation]]s move and multiply so as to result in macroscopic deformation.  In other words, it is the movement of dislocations in the material which allows for deformation. If we want to enhance a material's mechanical properties (i.e. increase the yield and [[tensile strength]]), we simply need to introduce a mechanism which prohibits the mobility of these dislocations. Whatever the mechanism may be, (work hardening, grain size reduction, etc.) they all hinder dislocation motion and render the material stronger than previously.<ref>Davidge, R.W., Mechanical Behavior of Ceramics, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, (1979)</ref><ref>Lawn, B.R., Fracture of Brittle Solids, Cambridge Solid State Science Series, 2nd Edn.

John Wiley & Sons, NY, NY (1985)</ref> \n\nThe stress required to cause dislocation motion is orders of magnitude lower than the theoretical stress required to shift an entire plane of atoms, so this mode of stress relief is energetically favorable. Hence, the hardness and strength (both yield and tensile) critically depend on the ease with which dislocations move. [[Pinning points]], or locations in the crystal that oppose the motion of dislocations,<ref>Kuhlmann-Wilsdorf, D., \"Theory of Plastic Deformation,\" Materials Science and Engineering A, vol 113, pp 1-42, July 1989</ref> can be introduced into the lattice to reduce dislocation mobility, thereby increasing mechanical strength. Dislocations may be pinned due to [[stress field]] interactions with other dislocations and solute particles, creating physical barriers from second phase precipitates forming along grain boundaries. There are five main strengthening mechanisms for metals, each is a method to prevent dislocation motion and propagation, or make it energetically unfavorable for the dislocation to move. For a material that has been strengthened, by some processing method, the amount of force required to start irreversible [[plastic deformation in solids|(plastic) deformation]] is greater than it was for the original material.  \n\nIn [[amorphous]] materials such as polymers, amorphous ceramics (glass), and amorphous metals, the lack of long range order leads to yielding via mechanisms such as brittle fracture, [[crazing]], and [[shear band]] formation. In these systems, strengthening mechanisms do not involve dislocations, but rather consist of modifications to the chemical structure and processing of the constituent material.\n\nThe strength of materials cannot infinitely increase. Each of the mechanisms explained below involves some trade-off by which other material properties are compromised in the process of strengthening.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in metals==\n\n=== Work hardening  ===\n{{main|Work hardening}}\n\nThe primary species responsible for [[work hardening]] are dislocations. Dislocations interact with each other by generating stress fields in the material. The interaction between the stress fields of dislocations can impede dislocation motion by repulsive or attractive interactions. Additionally, if two dislocations cross, dislocation line entanglement occurs, causing the formation of a jog which opposes dislocation motion. These entanglements and jogs act as pinning points, which oppose dislocation motion. As both of these processes are more likely to occur when more dislocations are present, there is a correlation between dislocation density and yield strength,\n\n<math> \\Delta\\sigma_{y} = {Gb\\sqrt{\\rho_\\perp}} </math>\n\nwhere <math> G </math> is the [[shear modulus]], <math> b </math> is the [[Burgers vector]], and <math> \\rho_\\perp </math> is the dislocation density.\n\nIncreasing the dislocation density increases the yield strength which results in a higher shear stress required to move the dislocations. This process is easily observed while working a material (by a process of cold working in metals). Theoretically, the strength of a material with no dislocations will be extremely high (\u03c4=G/2) because plastic deformation would require the breaking of many bonds simultaneously. However, at moderate dislocation density values of around 10<sup>7</sup>-10<sup>9</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup>, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength. Analogously, it is easier to move a rubber rug across a surface by propagating a small ripple through it than by dragging the whole rug. At dislocation densities of 10<sup>14</sup> dislocations/m<sup>2</sup> or higher, the strength of the material becomes high once again. Also, the dislocation density cannot be infinitely high, because then the material would lose its crystalline structure.<sup>Citation needed</sup>\n\n[[Image:Interstitial solute.svg|thumb|250px| This is a schematic illustrating how the lattice is strained by the addition of interstitial solute. Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atoms cause. The interstitial solute could be carbon in iron for example.

Notice the strain in the lattice that the solute atom causes.]]\n\n=== Solid solution strengthening and alloying ===\n{{main|Solid solution strengthening}}\nFor this strengthening mechanism, solute atoms of one element are added to another, resulting in either substitutional or interstitial point defects in the [[crystal]] (see Figure 1). The solute atoms cause lattice distortions that impede dislocation motion, increasing the [[yield stress]] of the material. Solute atoms have stress fields around them which can interact with those of dislocations. The presence of solute atoms impart compressive or tensile stresses to the lattice, depending on solute '''size''', which interfere with nearby dislocations, causing the solute atoms to act as potential barriers.\n\nThe shear stress required to move dislocations in a material is:\n\n<math> \\Delta\\tau = Gb\\sqrt{c} \\epsilon^{3/2} </math>\n\nwhere <math> c </math> is the solute concentration and <math> \\epsilon </math> is the strain on the material caused by the solute.\n\nIncreasing the concentration of the solute atoms will increase the yield strength of a material, but there is a limit to the amount of solute that can be added, and one should look at the phase diagram for the material and the alloy to make sure that a second phase is not created.\n\nIn general, the solid solution strengthening depends on the concentration of the solute atoms, shear modulus of the solute atoms, size of solute atoms, valency of solute atoms (for ionic materials), and the symmetry of the solute stress field. The magnitude of strengthening is higher for non-symmetric stress fields because these solutes can interact with both edge and screw dislocations, whereas symmetric stress fields, which cause only volume change and not shape change, can only interact with edge dislocations.\n[[Image:Particle strengthening.svg|thumb|250px|'''Figure 2:''' A schematic illustrating how the dislocations can interact with a particle. It can either cut through the particle or bow around the particle and create a dislocation loop as it moves over the particle.]]\n\n=== Precipitation hardening ===\n{{main|Precipitation strengthening}}\nIn most binary systems, alloying above a concentration given by the phase diagram will cause the formation of a second phase. A second phase can also be created by mechanical or thermal treatments. The particles that compose the second phase precipitates act as pinning points in a similar manner to solutes, though the particles are not necessarily single atoms.\n\nThe dislocations in a material can interact with the precipitate atoms in one of two ways (see Figure 2). If the precipitate atoms are small, the dislocations would cut through them. As a result, new surfaces (b in Figure 2) of the particle would get exposed to the matrix and the particle-matrix interfacial energy would increase. For larger precipitate particles, looping or bowing of the dislocations would occur and result in dislocations getting longer. Hence, at a critical radius of about 5&nbsp;nm, dislocations will preferably cut across the obstacle, while for a radius of 30&nbsp;nm, the dislocations will readily bow or loop to overcome the obstacle. \n\nThe mathematical descriptions are as follows: \n\nFor particle bowing-  \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {Gb\\over L-2r} </math>\n\nFor particle cutting- \n<math> \\Delta \\tau = {\\gamma \\pi r \\over b L} </math>\n\n[[Image:Dislocation pileup.svg|thumb|200px|'''Figure 3:'''  A schematic roughly illustrating the concept of dislocation pile up and how it effects the strength of the material. A material with larger grain size is able to have more dislocation to pile up leading to a bigger driving force for dislocations to move from one grain to another. Thus, less force need be applied to move a dislocation from a larger, than from a smaller grain, leading materials with smaller grains to exhibit higher yield stress.]]\n\n=== Grain boundary strengthening ===\n{{main|Grain boundary strengthening}}\nIn a polycrystalline metal, grain size has a tremendous influence on the mechanical properties. Because grains usually have varying crystallographic orientations, grain boundaries arise. While undergoing deformation, slip motion will take place. Grain boundaries act as an impediment to dislocation motion for the following two reasons: \n\n1. Dislocation must change its direction of motion due to the differing orientation of grains.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><br>\n2. Discontinuity of slip planes from grain one to grain two.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe stress required to move a dislocation from one grain to another in order to plastically deform a material depends on the grain size. The average number of dislocations per grain decreases with average grain size (see Figure 3). A lower number of dislocations per grain results in a lower dislocation 'pressure' building up at grain boundaries. This makes it more difficult for dislocations to move into adjacent grains. This relationship is the [[Grain boundary strengthening#Hall\u2013Petch relationship|Hall-Petch relationship]] and can be mathematically described as follows:\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y} = \\sigma_{y,0} + {k \\over {d^x}} </math>,\n\nwhere <math>k</math> is a constant, <math>d</math> is the average grain diameter and <math>\\sigma_{y,0}</math> is the original yield stress.\n\nThe fact that the yield strength increases with decreasing grain size is accompanied by the caveat that the grain size cannot be decreased infinitely. As the grain size decreases, more free volume is generated resulting in lattice mismatch. Below approximately 10&nbsp;nm, the grain boundaries will tend to slide instead; a phenomenon known as [[grain-boundary sliding]]. If the grain size gets too small, it becomes more difficult to fit the dislocations in the grain and the stress required to move them is less.  It was not possible to produce materials with grain sizes below 10&nbsp;nm until recently, so the discovery that strength decreases below a critical grain size is still finding new applications.\n\n=== Transformation hardening ===\nThis method of hardening is used for steels.\n\nHigh-strength steels generally fall into three basic categories, classified by the strengthening mechanism employed.\n1- [[Solid solution strengthening|solid-solution-strengthened steels (rephos steels)]]\n2- [[Solid solution strengthening|grain-refined steels]] or [[High-strength low-alloy steel|high strength low alloy steels (HSLA)]]\n3- transformation-hardened steels\n\nTransformation-hardened steels are the third type of high-strength steels.These steels use predominantly higher levels of C and Mn along with heat treatment to increase strength.  The finished product will have a duplex micro-structure of ferrite with varying levels of degenerate \nmartensite.  This allows for varying levels of strength.  There are three basic types of transformation-hardened steels.  These are dual-phase (DP), transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP), and martensitic steels. \n\nThe annealing process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region for a set period of time.  During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity.  The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed \ninto martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition.  By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, as well as the degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled.  Depending on \nprocessing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. \n \nTRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of Austen and bainite in a ferrite matrix.  Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region for a period of time sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse \ninto austenite.  The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite start temperature and held there.  This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product.  While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite.  This, in turn, lowers the \nmartensite start temperature to below room temperature.  Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite).  This combination of micro-structures has the added \nbenefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming.  This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger.  Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa.\n  \nMartensitic steels are also high in C and Mn.  These are fully quenched to martensite during processing.  The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel.  Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.\n\n==Strengthening mechanisms in amorphous materials==\n\n===Polymer===\n\n[[Polymers]] [[fracture]] via breaking of inter- and intra molecular bonds; hence, the chemical structure of these materials plays a huge role in increasing strength. For [[polymers]] consisting of chains which easily slide past each other, chemical and physical cross linking can be used to increase rigidity and yield strength. In thermoset polymers ([[thermosetting plastic]]), disulfide bridges and other [[covalent]] cross links give rise to a hard structure which can withstand very high temperatures. These cross-links are particularly helpful in improving tensile strength of materials which contain lots of free volume prone to crazing, typically glassy brittle polymers.<ref name=Meyers>Meyers, Chawla. ''Mechanical Behavior of Materials.'' Cambridge University Press. pg 420-425. 1999</ref> In [[thermoplastic elastomer]], phase separation of dissimilar [[monomer]] components leads to association of hard domains within a sea of soft phase, yielding a physical structure with increased strength and rigidity. If yielding occurs by chains sliding past each other (shear bands), the strength can also be increased by introducing kinks into the polymer chains via unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\nAdding [[Filler (materials)|filler materials]] such as fibers, platelets, and particles is a commonly employed technique for strengthening polymer materials. Fillers such as clay, silica, and carbon network materials have been extensively researched and used in polymer composites in part due to their effect on mechanical properties. Stiffness-confinement effects near rigid interfaces, such as those between a polymer matrix and stiffer filler materials, enhance the stiffness of composites by restricting polymer chain motion.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.108303|pmid=23521308|title=Effect of Nanoconfinement on Polymer Dynamics: Surface Layers and Interphases|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=110|issue=10|pages=108303|year=2013|last1=Krutyeva|first1=M.|last2=Wischnewski|first2=A.|last3=Monkenbusch|first3=M.|last4=Willner|first4=L.|last5=Maiz|first5=J.|last6=Mijangos|first6=C.|last7=Arbe|first7=A.|last8=Colmenero|first8=J.|last9=Radulescu|first9=A.|last10=Holderer|first10=O.|last11=Ohl|first11=M.|last12=Richter|first12=D.|hdl=10261/102483}}</ref> This is especially present where fillers are chemically treated to strongly interact with polymer chains, increasing the anchoring of polymer chains to the filler interfaces and thus further restricting the motion of chains away from the interface.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/C5PY01631B|title=Toughening of photo-curable polymer networks: A review|journal=Polymer Chemistry|volume=7|issue=2|pages=257\u2013286|year=2016|last1=Ligon-Auer|first1=Samuel Clark|last2=Schwentenwein|first2=Martin|last3=Gorsche|first3=Christian|last4=Stampfl|first4=J\u00fcrgen|last5=Liska|first5=Robert}}</ref> Stiffness-confinement effects have been characterized in model nanocomposites, and shows that composites with length scales on the order of nanometers increase the effect of the fillers on polymer stiffness dramatically.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.macromol.7b00917|title=Stiffness Gradients in Glassy Polymer Model Nanocomposites: Comparisons of Quantitative Characterization by Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy|journal=Macromolecules|volume=50|issue=14|pages=5447\u20135458|year=2017|last1=Zhang|first1=Min|last2=Askar|first2=Shadid|last3=Torkelson|first3=John M.|last4=Brinson|first4=L. Catherine}}</ref>\n\nIncreasing the bulkiness of the [[monomer]] unit via incorporation of aryl rings is another strengthening mechanism. The [[anisotropy]] of the molecular structure means that these mechanisms are heavily dependent on the direction of applied stress. While aryl rings drastically increase rigidity along the direction of the chain, these materials may still be brittle in perpendicular directions. Macroscopic structure can be adjusted to compensate for this [[anisotropy]]. For example, the high strength of [[Kevlar]] arises from a stacked multilayer macrostructure where aromatic polymer layers are rotated with respect to their neighbors. When loaded oblique to the chain direction, ductile polymers with flexible linkages, such as oriented [[polyethylene]], are highly prone to shear band formation, so macroscopic structures which place the load parallel to the draw direction would increase strength.<ref name=Meyers/> \n\nMixing polymers is another method of increasing strength, particularly with materials that show crazing preceding brittle fracture such as atactic [[polystyrene]] (APS). For example, by forming a 50/50 mixture of APS with polyphenylene oxide (PPO), this embrittling tendency can be almost completely suppressed, substantially increasing the fracture strength.<ref name=Meyers/>\n\n[[Interpenetrating polymer network|Interpenetrating polymer networks]] (IPNs), consisting of interlacing crosslinked polymer networks that are not covalently bonded to one another, can lead to enhanced strength in polymer materials. The use of an IPN approach imposes compatibility (and thus macroscale homogeneity) on otherwise immiscible blends, allowing for a blending of mechanical properties. For example, silicone-polyurethane IPNs show increased tear and flexural strength over base silicone networks, while preserving the high elastic recovery of the silicone network at high strains.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1021/ba-1990-0224.ch010|chapter=Polysiloxane\u2014Thermoplastic Interpenetrating Polymer Networks|title=Silicon-Based Polymer Science|volume=224|pages=181\u2013199|series=Advances in Chemistry|year=1989|last1=Arkles|first1=Barry|last2=Crosby|first2=Jane|isbn=0-8412-1546-4}}</ref> Increased stiffness can also be achieved by pre-straining polymer networks and then sequentially forming a secondary network within the strained material. This takes advantage of the anisotropic strain hardening of the original network (chain alignment from stretching of the polymer chains) and provides a mechanism whereby the two networks transfer stress to one another due to the imposed strain on the pre-strained network.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/polb.21943|title=Mechanical and thermo-mechanical studies of double networks based on thermoplastic elastomers|journal=Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics|volume=48|issue=7|pages=778\u2013789|year=2010|last1=Singh|first1=Naveen K.|last2=Lesser|first2=Alan J.}}</ref>\n\n===Glass===\n\nMany silicate glasses are strong in compression but weak in tension. By introducing compression stress into the structure, the tensile strength of the material can be increased. This is typically done via two mechanisms: thermal treatment (tempering) or chemical bath (via ion exchange). \n\nIn tempered glasses, air jets are used to rapidly cool the top and bottom surfaces of a softened (hot) slab of glass. Since the surface cools quicker, there is more free volume at the surface than in the bulk melt.  The core of the slab then pulls the surface inward, resulting in an internal compressive stress at the surface. This substantially increases the tensile strength of the material as tensile stresses exerted on the glass must now resolve the compressive stresses before yielding.\n\n<math> \\sigma_{y=modified}  = \\sigma_{y,0} + \\sigma_{compressive} </math>\n\nAlternately, in chemical treatment, a glass slab treated containing network formers and modifiers is submerged into a molten salt bath containing ions larger than those present in the modifier. Due to a concentration gradient of the ions, mass transport must take place. As the larger cation diffuses from the molten salt into the surface, it replaces the smaller ion from the modifier. The larger ion squeezing into surface introduces compressive stress in the glass's surface. A common example is treatment of sodium oxide modified silicate glass in molten [[potassium chloride]].\n\n== Composite strengthening  ==\n\nMany of the basic strengthening mechanisms can be classified based on their dimensionality. At 0-D there is precipitate and solid solution strengthening with particulates strengthening structure, at 1-D there is work/forest hardening with line dislocations as the hardening mechanism, and at 2-D there is grain boundary strengthening with surface energy of granular interfaces providing strength improvement. The two primary types of composite strengthening, fiber reinforcement and laminar reinforcement, fall in the 1-D and 2-D classes, respectively. The anisotropy of fiber and laminar composite strength reflects these dimensionalities. The primary idea behind composite strengthening is to combine materials with opposite strengths and weaknesses to create a material which transfers load onto the stiffer material but benefits from the ductility and toughness of the softer material. <ref name=\"courtney\">{{cite book |last1=Courtney |first1=Thomas H |title=Mechanical Behavior of Materials |date=1990 |publisher=Waveland Press Inc. |location=Long Grove, IL |edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\n=== Fiber reinforcement ===\n{{main|Fiber-reinforced composite}}\nFiber-reinforced composites (FRCs) consist of a matrix of one material containing parallel embedded fibers. There are two variants of fiber-reinforced composites, one with stiff fibers and a ductile matrix and one with ductile fibers and a stiff matrix. The former variant is exemplified by fiberglass which contains very strong but delicate glass fibers embedded in a softer plastic matrix resilient to fracture. The latter variant is found in almost all buildings as reinforced concrete with ductile, high tensile-strength steel rods embedded in brittle, high compressive-strength concrete. In both cases, the matrix and fibers have complimentary mechanical properties and the resulting composite material is therefore more practical for applications in the real world.\n\nFor a composite containing aligned, stiff fibers which span the length of the material and a soft, ductile matrix, the following descriptions provide a rough model.\n\n==== Four stages of deformation ====\nThe condition of a fiber-reinforced composite under applied tensile stress along the direction of the fibers can be decomposed into four stages from small strain to large strain. Since the stress is parallel to the fibers, the deformation is described by the isostrain condition, i.e., the fiber and matrix experience the same strain. At each stage, the composite stress (<math> \\sigma_{c} </math>) is given in terms of the volume fractions of the fiber and matrix (<math> V_{f}, V_{m}  </math>), the Young's moduli of the fiber and matrix (<math> E_{f}, E_{m}  </math>), the strain of the composite (<math> \\epsilon_{c}  </math>), and the stress of the fiber and matrix as read from a stress-strain curve (<math> \\sigma_{f}(\\epsilon_{c}), \\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c})  </math>).\n\n# Both fiber and composite remain in the elastic strain regime. In this stage, we also note that the composite Young's modulus is a simple weighted sum of the two component moduli.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\epsilon_{c}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n#:<math> E_{c} = V_{f}E_{f} +  V_{m}E_{m} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# The fiber remains in the elastic regime but the matrix yields and plastically deforms.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\epsilon_{c}E_{f} +  V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# Both fiber and composite yield and plastically deform. This stage often features significant Poisson strain which is not captured by model below.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} = V_{f}\\sigma_{f}(\\epsilon_{c}) +  V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n# The fiber fractures while the matrix continues to plastically deform. While in reality the fractured pieces of fiber still contribute some strength, it is left out of this simple model.\n#:<math> \\sigma_{c} \\approx V_{m}\\sigma_{m}(\\epsilon_{c}) </math><ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n==== Tensile strength ====\nDue to the heterogeneous nature of FRCs, they also feature multiple tensile strengths (TS), one corresponding to each component. Given the assumptions outlined above, the first tensile strength would correspond to failure of the fibers, with some support from the matrix plastic deformation strength, and the second with failure of the matrix.\n\n:<math>TS_1 = V_fTS_f + V_m\\sigma_m(\\epsilon_c) </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n:<math>TS_2 = V_mTS_m </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n==== Anisotropy (Orientation effects) ====\nAs a result of the aforementioned dimensionality (1-D) of fiber reinforcement, significant anisotropy is observed in its mechanical properties. The following equations model the tensile strength of a FRC as a function of the misalignment angle (<math>\\theta</math>) between the fibers and the applied force, the stresses in the parallel and perpendicular, or <math>\\theta=0</math> and <math>90</math>{{sup|o}}, cases (<math>\\ \\sigma_{||}, \\sigma_{\\perp}</math>), and the shear strength of the matrix (<math> \\tau_{my} </math>).\n\n;:Small Misalignment Angle (longitudinal fracture)\n: The angle is small enough to maintain load transfer onto the fibers and prevent delamination of fibers ''and'' the misaligned stress samples a slightly larger cross-sectional area of the fiber so the strength of the fiber is not just maintained but actually increases compared to the parallel case.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{||}}{\\cos^2(\\theta)}</math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Significant Misalignment Angle (shear failure)\n: The angle is large enough that the load is not effectively transferred to the fibers and the matrix experiences enough strain to fracture.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\tau_{my}}{\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)} </math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n;:Near Perpendicular Misaligment Angle (transverse fracture)\n: The angle is close to 90{{sup|o}} so most of the load remains in the matrix and thus tensile transverse matrix fracture is the dominant failure condition. This can be seen as complementary to the small angle case, with similar form but with an angle <math>90-\\theta</math>.\n: <math>TS(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\perp}}{\\sin^2(\\theta)}</math> <ref name=\"courtney\"/>\n\n=== Laminar reinforcement ===\n{{Missing information|laminar reinforcement|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Applications and current research==\n\nStrengthening of materials is useful in many applications. A primary application of strengthened materials is for construction. In order to have stronger buildings and bridges, one must have a strong frame that can support high tensile or compressive load and resist plastic deformation. The steel frame used to make the building should be as strong as possible so that it does not bend under the entire weight of the building. Polymeric roofing materials would also need to be strong so that the roof does not cave in when there is build-up of snow on the rooftop.\n\nResearch is also currently being done to increase the strength of metallic materials through the addition of polymer materials such as bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymer to (CFRP)[https://archive.today/20130202115814/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V2G-4GX6HXM-8&_user=501045&_coverDate=03/31/2006&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000022659&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=501045&md5=f938f165c8666c9fa0174d293e45297b%23bib4].\n\n===Molecular dynamics simulations===\nThe use of computation simulations to model work hardening in materials allows for the direct observation of critical elements that rule the process of strengthening materials.  The basic reasoning derives from the fact that, when examining plasticity and the movement of dislocations in materials, a focus on the atomistic level is many times not accounted for and the focus rests on the contiuum description of materials.  Since the practice of tracking these atomistic effects in experiments and theorizing about them in textbooks cannot provide a full understanding of these interactions, many turn to molecular dynamics simulations to develop this understanding.<ref name=Buehler>Buehler, Markus J. ''the dynamical complexity of work - hardening:  a large-scale molecular dynamics simulation.'' Acta Mech Sinica. pg 103-111. 2005</ref>\n\nThe simulations work by utilizing the known atomic interactions between any two atoms and the relationship F = ma, so that the dislocations moving through the material are ruled by simple mechanical actions and reactions of the atoms.  The [[interatomic potential]] usually utilized to estimate these interactions is the Lennard \u2013 Jones 12:6 potential.  Lennard \u2013 Jones is widely accepted because its experimental shortcomings are well-known.<ref name=Buehler/><ref name=Abraham>Abraham, F.  \"Simulating materials failure by using up to one billion atoms and the world's fastest computer: Work-hardening.\"  Proc Natl Acad Sci.  pg 5783\u20135787. 2002</ref>  These interactions are simply scaled up to millions or billions of atoms in some cases to simulate materials more accurately.  \n\nMolecular dynamic simulations display the interactions based upon the governing equations provided above for the strengthening mechanisms.  They provide an effective way to see these mechanisms in action outside the painstaking realm of direct observation during experiments.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Grain boundary strengthening]]\n*[[Precipitation strengthening]]\n*[[Solid solution strengthening]]\n*[[Strength of materials]]\n*[[Tempering (metallurgy)]]\n*[[Work hardening]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5758/212 Grain boundary strengthening in alumina by rare earth impurities]\n*[https://doi.org/10.1007%2FBF00801481 Mechanism of grain boundary strengthening of steels]\n*[http://zambaldi.de/software/stabix/ An open source Matlab toolbox for analysis of slip transfer through grain boundaries]\n\n[[Category:Materials science]]\n[[Category:Strengthening mechanisms of materials|*]]\n", "name_user": "Salbayeng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTransformation hardening:changed one instance of \"Austen\"  to \"austenite\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_mechanisms_of_materials"}

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s.

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v.

At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions.

In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]].

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

Similar to other former slave states, Alabamian legislators employed [[Jim Crow laws]] to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against [[African Americans]] from the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]] up until at least the 1970s. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, [[White American|white]] rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s. During this time, urban interests and African Americans were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state's economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.<ref name=\"alaindustrial\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |title=Alabama Occupational Projections 2008\u20132018 |website=Alabama Department of Industrial Relations |publisher=State of Alabama |accessdate=September 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117053325/http://www2.dir.alabama.gov/projections/Occupational/Proj2018/Statewide/alabama2008_2018.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe European-American naming of the [[Alabama River]] and state was derived from the [[Alabama people]], a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking tribe]] whose members lived just below the confluence of the [[Coosa River|Coosa]] and [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] rivers on the upper reaches of the river.<ref name=\"Read\">{{Cite book |last=Read |first=William A. |title=Indian Place Names in Alabama |year=1984 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |isbn=978-0-8173-0231-3 |oclc=10724679}}</ref> In the [[Alabama language]], the word for a person of Alabama lineage is ''Albaamo'' (or variously ''Albaama'' or ''Alb\u00e0amo'' in different dialects; the plural form is ''Albaamaha'').<ref>{{Cite book |authors=Sylestine, Cora; Hardy; Heather; and [[Timothy Montler|Montler, Timothy]] |title=Dictionary of the Alabama Language |publisher=University of Texas Press |location=Austin |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-292-73077-9 |url=http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |oclc=26590560 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024054330/http://www.ling.unt.edu/~montler/Alabama/ |archivedate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> The suggestion that \"Alabama\" was borrowed from the [[Choctaw language]] is unlikely.<ref>[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248152?redirectedFrom=alabama& \"Alabama, n. and adj.\"].

In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, ''[[Dillard v. Crenshaw County]]'', challenged the [[at-large]] voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.<ref name=\"vra\" />\n\nAs part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cities and counties, including [[Chilton County, Alabama|Chilton County]], adopted a system of [[proportional representation|cumulative voting]] for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in [[Conecuh County, Alabama|Conecuh County]]. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.<ref name=\"cum\">[http://archive.fairvote.org/?page=516 \"Cumulative Elections in Alabama (2004)\"/\"Proportional Voting in Alabama\"], FairVote Archives, accessed January 11, 2015</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{main|Geography of Alabama}}\n{{See also|List of Alabama counties|Geology of Alabama}}\n[[File:Map of Alabama terrain NA.jpg|thumb|right| ]]\n\nAlabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with {{convert|52419|sqmi|km2|abbr=out|sp=us}} of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=n&_lang=en&mt_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_GCTPH1R_US9S&format=US-9S&_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1-R&ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&geo_id=01000US |title= GCT-PH1-R.

Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.\n[[File:Ala Supreme Court Building Feb 2012 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]] in Montgomery. It houses the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]], [[Alabama Court of Civil Appeals]], and [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]].]]\n\nAlabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The [[legislative branch]] is the [[Alabama Legislature]], a [[bicameral]] assembly composed of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], with 105 members, and the [[Alabama Senate]], with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] currently holds a majority in both houses of the [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]]. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).\n\nUntil 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of \"[[one man, one vote]]\", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.\n\nAt that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.\n[[File:Portrait-Governor-Kay-Ivey.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor [[Kay Ivey]] is the current and second female [[governor of Alabama]].

Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the [[Alabama Constitution]], which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited [[home rule]]. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning.\n\nThe state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing [[home rule]] for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission.<ref name=\"home\"/> Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in ''[[Baker v. Carr]]'' (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of \"one man, one vote\". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.\n\n\"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance.\"<ref name=\"home\">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1153#sthash.CMEMRNbK.dpuf Albert P.

In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the [[Redeemers]] took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the black vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.\n\nAfter 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to [[racial segregation|segregate]] and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised blacks resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than Blacks had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the black community, as almost all its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.\n\nFrom 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.\n\nAlabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the [[civil rights movement]], when whites bureaucratically, and at times violently, resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor [[George Wallace]], the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]<ref name=\"cra64\"/> and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by [[at-large]] electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish [[single-member districts]] that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Alabama Legislature]] passed, and Republican governor [[Bob Riley]] signed a resolution expressing \"profound regret\" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the [[Alabama State Capitol]], which housed Congress of the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref>{{Cite news |first=Phillip |last=Rawls |title=Alabama offers an apology for slavery |work=The Virginian Pilot |publisher=Landmark Communications |date=June 1, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/gop_takes_alabama_legislature.html |title=GOP takes control of Alabama Legislature after 136 years |last=White |first=David|date=November 2, 2010|work=[[The Birmingham News]] |accessdate=July 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2017|December|}}, there are a total of 3,326,812 registered voters, with 2,979,576 active, and the others inactive in the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sos.alabama.gov/alabama-votes/voter/election-data |title=Elections Data Downloads |publisher=Alabama Secretary of State |accessdate=December 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Elections===\n\n{{main|Elections in Alabama}}\n[[File:Doug Jones Biden Event.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Doug Jones (politician)|Doug Jones]] was elected in a [[2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama|special election in 2017]].]]\n\n====State elections====\n\nWith the [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchisement of Blacks]] in 1901, the state became part of the \"[[Solid South]]\", a system in which the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly a hundred years local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party [[primary election|primary]], with generally only token [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid- to late 20th century, however, white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.\n\nMembers of the nine seats on the [[Supreme Court of Alabama]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2009/05/sue_bell_cobb_considering_runn.html |title=Sue Bell Cobb considering running for governor |website=The Birmingham News |date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=August 7, 2009}}</ref> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent chief justice, [[Ernest C. Hornsby]], refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican [[Perry O. Hooper, Sr.]]. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.\n\nIn the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the [[Political party strength in Alabama|statewide elected executive]] branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the [[Alabama State Board of Education]]. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |title=Commissioners |publisher=Psc.state.al.us |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718210525/http://www.psc.state.al.us/commissioners.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Special |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |title=Lucy Baxley wins Alabama Public Service Commission presidency, but recount possible |publisher=Birmingham News via al.com |date=November 5, 2008 |accessdate=August 7, 2009 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090802212747/http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/11/lucy_baxley_wins_alabama_publi.html |archivedate=August 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeff Amy |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |title=Public Service Commission: Twinkle Cavanaugh, Terry Dunn join GOP sweep |publisher=al.com |accessdate=June 1, 2011 |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120306232802/http://blog.al.com/live/2010/11/public_service_commission.html |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOnly three Republican lieutenant governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated [[Freedman|freedmen]] who had gained the franchise.

{"title_page": "Peter Greig-Smith", "text_new": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988. Past Presidents gathered for a team photograph: Back row, left to right: A.D. Bradshaw, R.J. Berry, '''Peter Greig-Smith''', A. Macfadyen, C.H. Gimingham, G. Dunnet, L.R.Taylor. Front row from left: C.H. Evans; P.R. Richards, J. Harley, R. Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'', the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]] and [[Robert Whittaker|Robert H. Whittaker]] in the United States, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David W. Goodall]] and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with [[J. Roger Bray]], developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note.

''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b. ''Potamolejeunea Holtii'' (spruce) nov.comb. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 1(2): 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948c.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019. ''Looking back: A life of statistical ecology''. 3<sup>rd</sup> ed. Scada Publishing, Canada.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

''Transactions of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 36(2): 132\u2013136.</ref>, dealt with the formation of tussocks in ''Ammophila arenaria'' and included detailed observations on the clumped distribution of tillers, which form tussock-like clumps in older, fixed dunes but are regularly distributed in the younger, moving dunes. After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1953. A note on the behaviour of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L.) Link, in relation to sand-dune formation.

One of Greig-Smith\u2019s students, Andrew Morton, continued Greig-Smith\u2019s pattern analysis studies in the dunes at Newborough Warren in Anglesey, Wales, near Bangor.\n\n====Pattern in Tropical Ecosystems====\nBelow only the study of coastal dunes, Greig-Smith\u2019s interests were strongly focused on tropical ecosystems. After his visit to Trinidad as a young researcher, he developed an interest for African savannas, on the possibility of using his methodology for pattern analysis to understand the importance of intraspecific competition in tropical, strongly rainfall-seasonal ecosystems<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, and Michael J. Chadwick. 1965. Data on pattern within plant communities: III. ''Acacia-Capparis'' semi-desert scrub in the Sudan. ''Journal of Ecology'' 53(2): 465\u2013474.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1991.

The use of random and contiguous quadrats in the study of the structure of plant communities. ''Annals of Botany'' 16(2): 293\u2013316.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1961.

The analysis of pattern in vegetation: A comment on a paper by D. W. Goodall. ''Journal of Ecology'' 51(1): 223\u2013229.</ref>, he showed the importance of scaling in the measurement of plant spatial pattern. He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref name=\":0\">Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. [[Timothy F. H. Allen|Tim Allen]], a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F.

Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201c''There may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views''.\"<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>Dove, Michael R., and Daniel M. Kammen. 2015.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011.

Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "'''Peter Greig-Smith''' (b. 1922\u2013d. 2003) was a British plant ecologist, founder of the discipline of quantitative ecology in the United Kingdom. He had a deep influence across the world on vegetation studies and plant ecology, mostly from his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', first published in 1957 and a must-read for multiple generations of young ecologists.[[File:Peter Greig-Smith -1988.tif|thumb|Jubilee Symposium for the 75th anniversary of the British Ecological Society at University College, London held on April 12-13 1988.

Southwood.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith was hired by the University College of North Wales at Bangor, Wales (now Bangor University), where he spent the rest of his academic career. His book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' spread the ideas of rigorous, quantitative ecological methods among the world\u2019s research community, and made his lab at Bangor a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in mathematical and statistical methods. A stout supporter of Bangor\u2019s graduate program in Ecology, he recruited and advised many students and research collaborators from all continents.\n\nA prominent member of the British Ecological Society, he was first elected to Council in 1957, and in 1961 he became Honorary Secretary. He held this post until 1964, when he resigned to become editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'', the society\u2019s scientific publication. He remained as editor until 1968. In 1977 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and served as President in 1978 and 1979.\n\n== Mathematics in Ecology ==\nThe postwar period, and especially the 1950s, saw a rising quest for a truly quantitative approach to community ecology. Community description to that point had been predominantly qualitative and had been based mostly on attempts to extend the principles of Linnaean taxonomy into the classification of plant communities. Four innovative ecologists directed their efforts to bring the principles of statistics and mathematics to vegetation analysis: [[John Thomas Curtis|John T. Curtis]] and [[Robert Whittaker|Robert H. Whittaker]] in the United States, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David W. Goodall]] and Peter Greig-Smith in the United Kingdom. J. T. Curtis, in collaboration with [[J. Roger Bray]], developed the first method of community ordination and also developed the idea of ecological dissimilarity or \u201cecological distance measure\u201d that later opened the way to the concept of niche overlap. Robert H. Whittaker was the proponent of gradient analysis to address fundamental questions of how plants use space and resources. He provided foundational elements for a quantitative theory of biodiversity and was most active in the areas of plant community analysis, succession, and productivity. David Goodall worked as a professor of agricultural botany at the University of Reading, where he developed a series of studies on plant sampling, distribution, and multivariate analysis. In 1956, however, Goodall immigrated to Australia, where he led a sixty-year-long and extremely fruitful career, becoming one of the world\u2019s most renowned ecologists. Greig-Smith, eight years younger than Goodall, became the champion of the quantitative approach in plant ecology in Britain.\n\n== Early Work ==\n[[File:AS Watt.tif|thumb|Alexander S. Watt, Greig-Smith's mentor and one of the most influential British ecologists of the 20th Century.]]\nGreig-Smith went to school in Birmingham, United Kingdom, before going to Downing College, Cambridge, where he was inspired by the teachings of [[Alexander Watt|Alexander S. Watt]], the first British botanist to seriously study the phenomenon of pattern and scaling in plant communities from a quantitative perspective. Watt\u2019s influence can be seen in Greig-Smith\u2019s obituaries of him<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. A. S. Watt, F.R.S.: A biographical note. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 9\u201310. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1.

''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' 35):404\u2013423.</ref>. The ''Biographical Memoirs'' of the Royal Society show that Watt, in turn, had studied at Cambridge under the mentorship of the ecologist Sir [[Arthur Tansley|Arthur G. Tansley]] (1871\u20131955), a direct academic descendant of [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]] (Tansley had studied with Francis W. Oliver [1864\u20131951] at the University College, London, who in turn had been mentored by Sir E. Ray Lankester [1847\u20131929] at Cambridge, a student of George Rolleston [1829\u20131881] at Oxford, who had been in turn mentored by Thomas Henry Huxley \u2014\"Darwin's bulldog\"\u2014 in London). In 1944, after graduating from Cambridge, Greig-Smith went to the Imperial College\u2019s Field Station at Slough, where he studied the effect of herbicides on oilseed crops under the direction of the Geoffrey E. Blackman, founder of the science of selective herbicides in Britain. The Slough herbicide tests, part of Britain\u2019s war effort, involved the planting of large-scale experiments with random block and nested designs, an experience that played a central role in nurturing Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in statistical methods and experimental plot designs. In 1945 he moved to the University of Manchester as lecturer in botany. At Manchester, he cultivated a wide array of research interests, ranging from the taxonomy of liverworts and stinging nettles, the causes of spatial pattern in dune plants, the quantitative morphology and tussock formation of ''Ammophila arenaria'' (a dune grass), and the biogeographic distribution of liverworts to understand the fate of vegetation in the British Isles during the last glaciation.\n\n===Dune Ecology===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s first published paper dealt with the varying growth forms of the dune grass ''Ammophila arenaria'' in calcareous sand dunes on the Isle of Harris, Outer Hebrides<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Alan R. Gemmell, and Charles H. Gimingham. 1947. Tussock formation in ''Ammophila arenaria'' (L) Link. ''New Phytologist'' 46(2): 262\u2013268.</ref>. This paper was followed two years later by a detailed description of the dune\u2019s plants<ref>Gimingham, Charles H., Alan R. Gemmell, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1949. The vegetation of a sand-dune system in the Outer Hebrides. ''Transactions and Proceedings of the Botanical Society of Edinburgh'' 35(1): 82\u201396.</ref>, using quantitative methods to describe the plant community. These early papers already mark his interest for quantification of natural phenomena. In this morphometric analysis of ''Ammophila arenaria'', for example, Greig-Smith measured in detail the internode length of the plant\u2019s rhizomes and noted the species\u2019 tendency to form tussock-like clumps in older dunes and longer, exploratory rhizomes in unstable, younger dunes.\n\n===Taxonomy and Biogeography===\nSome of Greig-Smith\u2019s early work was devoted to taxonomy and biogeography, trying to bring a quantitative approach to these branches of the biological sciences. Much of his taxonomic work was devoted to the evolutionary taxonomy and ecology of pounceworts (Lejeunaceae, a family of liverworts)<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948b.

In 1950 he published a synthesis paper on the taxonomy and biogeography of liverworts<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1954. Notes on Lejeuneaceae: II. A quantitative assessment of criteria used in distinguishing some British species of ''Lejeunea''. ''Transactions of the British Bryological Society'' 2(3): 458\u2013469.</ref>, as an early attempt to shed some light on the question of the effects of Quaternary glaciations on the history of the British flora<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1950. Evidence from hepatics on the history of the British flora. ''Journal of Ecology'' 38(2): 320\u2013344.</ref>. He tried to evaluate how many of the extant British liverworts had survived Pleistocene glaciations ''in situ'' and how many, in contrast, were postglacial migrants from southern latitudes. Almost two decades before the theory of Pleistocene refugia was proposed by [[J\u00fcrgen Haffer]] for the Amazon<ref>Haffer, J\u00fcrgen. 1969. Speciation in Amazonian forest birds. ''Science'' 165(3889): 131\u2013137.</ref>, Greig-Smith was using plant distributions to understand the vegetation changes induced by Pleistocene glaciations, and setting a new direction for Quaternary Paleobotany that few could value in its full significance at that time. As part of the Flora of the British Isles series published in the ''Journal of Ecology'', Greig-Smith drafted a synthesis paper of the natural history of the nettles of the United Kingdom, and a detailed analysis of the communities where they prosper<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1948a. Biological flora of the British Isles: ''Urtica'' L. ''Journal of Ecology'' 36(2): 339\u2013355.</ref>.\n\n===Tropical Ecology===\nIn 1940, Paul Richards, Sir Arthur Tansley, and Alexander Watt published a seminal paper<ref>Richards, Paul W., Arthur G. Tansley and Alexander S. Watt. 1940. The recording of structure, life form and flora of tropical forest communities as a basis for their classification. ''Journal of Ecology'' 28(1): 224\u2013239.</ref> on the classification of tropical rainforests revealing a fascination with the complexity of tropical vegetation that was halted by the war, but that Watt passed down later to Greig-Smith, his student at Cambridge. In July 1948 Greig-Smith received a research grant from the Colonial Office to visit the island of Trinidad to study tropical rainforests. Encouraged by E. Ashby, an early pioneer of quantitative methods who was then professor of botany at Manchester, he left the university for six months to study secondary succession in Trinidad, in collaboration with colleagues of the Imperial College of Tropical Agriculture on the island.\n\nLike Darwin in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest, he was gripped by the complexity of tropical forests. In order to try to unravel and explain this complexity, he developed novel statistical methods to test hypotheses on the association between species and the spatial pattern of saplings and adult trees in the field. An avid naturalist, he also developed in Trinidad a passion for orchids, which led him later to start cultivating his own orchid collection in the United Kingdom. After his visit to Trinidad in 1948, Greig-Smith drafted two detailed papers on secondary tropical forests<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952a. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 1. General features of the vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 283\u2013330.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1952b. Ecological observations on degraded and secondary forest in Trinidad, British West Indies: 2. Structure of the communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 40(2): 316\u2013330.</ref>. The first study included a number of techniques that at that time were novel in vegetation analysis, such as the species-area plots developed by Ronald A. Fisher and Henry Gleason, size-specific survivorship, and quantitative floristic tables. In the second Trinidad paper, he also used nested analyses of variance (ANOVAs), comparisons with the Poisson distribution, and variance-to-mean ratios to test and understand spatial patterns in the trees of the secondary forest. He concluded his paper questioning Frederic Clement\u2019s concept of plant communities as complex supra-organisms, and in support of Gleason\u2019s individualistic model of plant communities.\n\n== Bangor ==\n[[File:Bangor greenhouses.jpg|thumb|Greenhouses of the School of Plant Biology at Bangor in the mid-1970s. Photo courtesy of Bangor University.]]\nIn 1952, Greig-Smith moved to the [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales at Bangor]], where he spent the rest of his career. After the publication of his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' in 1957, which rapidly spread among the research community and became a success, Bangor became a magnet for plant biologists with an interest in quantitative methods. Greig-Smith was keenly interested in the MSc program in Ecology that Professor Paul W. Richards had developed at Bangor, and advised many Masters' students from where he recruited many doctoral students and research collaborators. Most of the students, postdocs, and research visitors in his lab later became outstanding ecologists in their own right, such as Georg Grabherr (University of Vienna), Kenneth A. Kershaw (who moved to McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario), Michael P. Austin (a postdoc at Bangor, studying tropical forests, who later moved to CSIRO at Canberra, Australia), Robert P. McIntosh (University of Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana), L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci (also a postdoc, later moved to the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada), Timothy F. H. Allen (University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison), Mark O. Hill (Natural Environment Research Council, Swindon, UK), Michael J. Liddle (Monks Wood Experimental Station, Cambridgeshire, UK; later at Griffith University, Queensland, Australia), Michael D. Swaine (University of Aberdeen, Scotland), M. A. Pemadasa (University of Sri Lanka), David J. Gibson (Southern Illinois University, Carbondale), and Tewolde B. G. Egziabher (Environmental Protection Authority, Ethiopia), among many others. The place was a haven for academic exchange: Laszlo Orl\u00f3ci recalls in his biographical memories<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 2019.

Also available at: <nowiki>https://www.researchgate.net/publication/334432585</nowiki>)</ref> that during 1964 alone, Greig-Smith\u2019s lab at Bangor received the visit of [[Robert R. Sokal|Robert Sokal]] and [[Peter Sneath]], founders of the discipline of numerical taxonomy, and [[David Goodall (botanist)|David Goodall]], William T. Williams, and Mike Dale, who were creating initial content for a solid school of statistical ecology in Australia.\n\n=== Pattern and Scaling in Ecological Sciences ===\n[[File:Scaling design.tif|thumb|In the early 1950s, Greig-Smith started using graphs in which he plotted the variance in plant density versus the size of the sample plot, to find peaks that could identify clump size in aggregated distributions. In doing so, he realized that ecosystem properties are scale-dependent: a species can have a regular distribution at a given scale, but be highly clumped at another.]]\nGreig-Smith was fascinated by the phenomenon of plant spatial pattern, defined by the question: why are some plants regularly spaced while others are densely clumped? He realized that plants could be clumped at a certain scale, but that those clumps, in turn, could be randomly, or even regularly distributed at larger scales. Patterns and processes in ecology, he concluded, can have different behaviors at different scale. Strongly influenced by his early experience in agricultural experiments using random blocks and nested designs, he sought to answer this question by using, as his core tool, a series of quadrats nested within each other at different scales. Much of Greig-Smith\u2019s published work was devoted to advancing the theory and methods of plant pattern, using his nested-quadrat approach as a basic tool. His fundamental idea that the perceived properties of ecological phenomena are scale-dependent set the foundations for the development of a theory of scaling in ecology, a central concept in modern climate change and global sustainability studies.\n\n==== Dunes as Model Ecosystems ====\nOne of Greig-Smith\u2019s early research papers, Gemmell, et al.

After this initial study, the spatial pattern of dunes and grasslands became a lifelong interest in his ecological research, published in a number of papers with collaborators and students<ref>Gemmell, Alan R., Peter Greig-Smith, and Charles H.

He understood that researchers sampling the same vegetation with quadrats of different size could reach diametrically opposed conclusions: a researcher using small quadrats would find that his quadrats harbor either clumps or no plants at all, and would conclude that the species pattern in space follows a clumped distribution. Similarly, a researcher using large quadrats would find a similar number of clumps in each quadrat and would conclude that the species distribution is markedly regular. In reality, both would be right because a species can have a strongly clumped distribution at a certain scale and a regular distribution at another. As president of the British Ecological Society, he wrote an address in 1979<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1979. Pattern in vegetation. ''Journal of Ecology'' 67(3): 755\u2013779.</ref>, in which he summarized his ideas on the importance of scaling in ecological spatial pattern. Some of his students took his ideas and pursued them further: Mark Hill developed a rigorous mathematical theory for the analysis of pattern at a community level<ref>Hill, M. O. 1973. The intensity of spatial pattern in plant communities. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(1): 225\u2013235.</ref>, while Kenneth Kershaw, after publishing in co-authorship with Greig-Smith, continued exploring for years the drivers of pattern at different scales.\n\n====Scaling in Modern Ecology====\nThe fundamental concept that ecological phenomena could have different behaviors when measured at different scales became really important for understanding large-scale phenomena in the biosphere. The Theory of Scaling became a mainstream concept in ecological research in the late 1980s and 1990s, with the publication of two now-classic papers: Wiens 1989<ref>Wiens, John A. 1989. Spatial scaling in ecology. ''Functional Ecology'' 3(4): 385\u2013397.</ref> and [[Simon A. Levin|Simon Levin]] 1992<ref>Levin, Simon A. 1992. The problem of pattern and scale in ecology: The Robert H. McArthur Award Lecture. ''Ecology'' 73(6): 1943\u20131967.</ref>. Greig-Smith, however, had figured out the main concepts four decades before, and both Wiens and Levin recognized him as a scientific pioneer.\n\n=== Multivariate Methods: Classification and Ordination in Ecology ===\nGreig-Smith was among the first ecologists to understand that multivariate methods were destined to become important tools in quantitative plant ecology. His inclusion of multivariate [[Cluster analysis|classification]] and [[Principal component analysis|ordination]] in his book opened the door for the explosion of analytical approaches and methodological discussions that surged in the 1970s and 1980s. As with pattern analysis, Greig-Smith was ahead of his time: although the potential of multivariate methods\u2014based on matrix algebra\u2014was already recognized in the 1950s, mostly as a result of a growing need for more-rigorous methods in ecology, performing an analysis of a modestly sized floristic matrix of, say, fifty sites and one hundred species was a complicated and enormously time-consuming task. The generalized access to electronic computers, which began in the 1960s, opened the doors for the widespread use of these methods; Bangor\u2019s first computer became available in 1964. Greig-Smith saw in multivariate methods an opportunity to analyze and understand the complex floristic composition of tropical forests, which had fascinated him since his visit to Trinidad in 1948. In 1963 he applied for a grant to investigate the use of quantitative methods to establish whether the highly diverse tropical rainforests showed any organized pattern, particularly in relation to environment, an open question at the time. With these funds, in 1964 he appointed Michael Austin as a postdoctoral research assistant to the project. Three seminal papers were published as a result of their collaboration, highlighting the potential of multivariate methods to analyze floristic patterns in complex, multispecies communities<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter, Michael P. Austin, and Timothy C. Whitmore. 1967. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: I. Association-analysis and principal component ordination of rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 55(2): 483\u2013503.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1968. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: II. Some methodological problems of data from rain forest. ''Journal of Ecology'' 56(3): 827\u2013844.</ref><ref>Austin, Michael P., Peter S. Ashton, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1972. The application of quantitative methods to vegetation survey: III. A re-examination of rain forest data from Brunei. ''Journal of Ecology'' 60(2): 305\u2013324.</ref>. The power of his approach, merging multivariate descriptive methods with experimental hypothesis testing, is especially noticeable in the work of some of his students like Mike Austin (cited previously), Exequiel Ezcurra<ref>Ezcurra, E. 1987. A comparison of Reciprocal Averaging and Non-Centred Principal Component Analysis. ''Vegetatio'' 71(1): 41\u201348.</ref>, and F.B. Goldsmith<ref>Goldsmith, F. B. 1973a.

The vegetation of exposed sea cliffs at South Stack, Anglesey: II. Experimental studies. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61(3): 819\u2013829.</ref>, among others. Mike Austin later moved to Australia and became one of the country\u2019s leading ecologists.\n\n==== Multivariate Methods as Hypothesis-Generating Procedures ====\nHaving laid the foundations of the discipline of multivariate methods, as a committed naturalist and field biologist Greig-Smith never took much interest in abstruse theoretical discussions, always expressing his concern about the risk of becoming too engaged with theoretical refinements of methodology and repeatedly stating his belief that numerical methods are worth developing only if they are to be used on real data in attempts to answer real questions with relevance in the field. The ultimate evidence, for him, was not in the computer output but in the field. In a synthesis paper published in 1980, he insisted that multivariate methods are simply hypothesis-generating procedures, and counseled students to do experimental tests addressing the insights from the classification and ordination analyses rather than taking the results of their analyses as an unchallengeable truth<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1980. The development of numerical classification and ordination. ''Vegetatio'' 42(1\u20133): 1\u20139.</ref>.\n\n==== Novel Approaches to Multivariate Analysis ====\nGreig-Smith\u2019s later papers on multivariate methods, with Mike Swaine<ref>Swaine, Michael D., and Peter Greig-Smith. 1980. An application of principal components analysis to vegetation change in permanent plots. ''Journal of Ecology'' 68(1): 33\u201341.</ref> and Carlos Monta\u00f1a<ref>Monta\u00f1a, Carlos, and Peter Greig-Smith. 1990. Correspondence analysis of species by environmental variable matrices. ''Journal of Vegetation Science'' 1(4): 453\u2013460.</ref>, were devoted to exploring new and innovative applications for multivariate analysis, including the analysis of time-series data and the exploration of the niche preference of species within a community. In the first two decades of the 21st Century, with the advent of powerful computers and large datasets from molecular genetics studies, the methods of numerical classification and eigenvector ordination, promoted by Greig-Smith half a century earlier, exploded in their use to become indispensable tools in the new molecular approaches to taxonomy, genomics, phylogeography, and anthropolgy.\n\n===''Quantitative Plant Ecology'' (book) ===\nGreig-Smith\u2019s most influential work was his book ''Quantitative Plant Ecology'', used by generations of students and young researchers around the world. The book, first published in 1957, enjoyed two subsequent editions in 1964 and 1982<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1957. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1964. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 2d ed. London: Butterworths.</ref><ref>Greig-Smith, Peter. 1982. ''Quantitative plant ecology''. 3d ed. Studies in Ecology 9. Berkeley: Univ. of California Press.</ref>.\n\nThe success of Greig-Smith\u2019s book triggered the publication of many other similar books, many of them by former Greig-Smith collaborators (such as Kershaw 1964<ref>Kershaw, Kenneth A. 1964. ''Quantitative and dynamic ecology''. New York: American Elsevier.</ref> and Orl\u00f3ci 1975<ref>Orl\u00f3ci, L\u00e1szl\u00f3. 1975. ''Multivariate analysis in vegetation research''. The Hague: W. Junk.</ref>), and nurtured an explosion of concepts and ideas around the quantitative treatment of ecological data, many of which arose in Canada (such as [[E. C. Pielou|Pielou]] 1969<ref>Pielou, Evelyn C. 1969. ''Introduction to Mathematical Ecology''. New York: Wiley-Interscience.</ref>) and Australia (such as Williams 1976<ref>Williams, William T., ed. 1976. ''Pattern analysis in agricultural science''. New York: Elsevier Scientific.</ref>).\n\n=== Holism and Reductionism in Ecology ===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the time when the School of Plant Biology at Bangor consolidated as a global magnet for plant ecologists, an active scientific debate, excellently synthesized in Barbour (1996)<ref>Barbour, Michael G. 1996. American ecology and American culture in the 1950s: Who led whom? ''Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America'' 77(1): 44\u201351.</ref>, was taking place worldwide on the role of holism and reductionism as the main tools to understand ecological phenomena. In Britain, this debate centered mostly on the use of descriptive methods or the quest to understand patterns in nature, as opposed to the use of experimental methods or the search for ecological processes. In Bangor, in particular, the most vocal proponent of an experimental and reductionist approach to ecological research was [[John L. Harper]], who often criticized quantitative vegetation scientists on their descriptive, rather than experimental, approach to research. Roy Turkington<ref>Turkington, Roy. 2009. Obituary: Professor John L. Harper FRS CBE (1925\u20132009). ''Journal of Ecology'' 97(5): 835\u2013837.</ref> recalls that Harper strongly favored the power of simple, direct experiments and distrusted complex multivariate methods, often arguing that ordination methods were \u201ca formalized description of consequences.\u201d \u201cNowhere is this holism more apparent than in the way ecology is taught in many schools and universities with its emphasis on complex systems and the ways in which they can be described,\u201d wrote Harper in \u201cAfter Description\u201d<ref>Harper, John L. 1982. After description. In ''The plant community as a working mechanism: Produced as a tribute to A. S. Watt''. Edited by E. I. Newman, 11\u201325. Special Publication of the British Ecological Society 1. Oxford: Blackwell Scientific Publications.</ref>, and he immediately added: \u201cThere is probably no other science in which students are taught by being dropped into the deep end of complexity.\u201d The contrast between experimental ecology in simplified systems, with only one or a few species, against large-scale pattern-seeking methods led Peter Greig-Smith and John Harper into frequent discussions in the form of good-humored debates following departmental seminars in Bangor, which, as amusingly evoked in Hill (2003)<ref>Hill, Mark O. 2003. Peter Greig-Smith (1922\u20132003). ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 34(4): 10\u201311.</ref> and Matlack (2009)<ref>Matlack, Glenn R., ed. 2009. ''Memories of John L. Harper: A remembrance by his friends, students, and colleagues''. 2d ed. Bangor, Wales: SPB. Available online at <nowiki>http://people.virginia.edu/~ja8n/Publications/2011</nowiki> Memories of John L Harper.pdf</ref>, were conducted amid legendary clouds of pipe smoke for the benefit of the students, who could see firsthand how academic arguments conducted both with rigor and humor can be very stimulating and deeply entertaining. \n\nGreig-Smith, however, was not really a holist. From his very first papers on the tropical forests of Trinidad, he embraced Henry Gleason\u2019s \u201cindividualistic\u201d model of plant communities. [[Timothy F. H. Allen|Tim Allen]], a Greig-Smith student in the 1960s, recalls that while in the 1980s \u201cthe use of descriptive multivariate methods degenerated into a ritual that community ecologists were expected to perform\u201d<ref>Allen, Timothy F. H., Amanda J. Zellmer, and C. J. Wuennenberg. 2005. The loss of narrative. In ''Ecological paradigms lost: Routes of theory change''. Edited by Kim Cuddington and Beatrix Beisner, 333\u2013370. Theoretical Ecology 2. Burlington, MA: Elsevier Academic.</ref>, Greig-Smith insisted that ecological research should always have experimental tests addressing the insights gained and the hypotheses derived from the quantitative analysis, as in Morton (1974)<ref>Morton, Andrew J. 1974. Ecological studies of a fixed dune grassland at Newborough Warren, Anglesey: II. Causal factors of the grassland structure. ''Journal of Ecology'' 62(1): 261\u2013278.</ref>. Perhaps the main difference with Harper\u2019s single-species experimental approach lied in Greig-Smith\u2019s interest in complex, multispecies systems, and his opinion that projects should start with observations and the search for patterns, before establishing hypotheses about the processes that drive ecosystem functions and experimenting to tests these hypotheses. The debates between Harper and Greig-Smith at Bangor had a large influence on the development of ecological theory in the last four decades of the 20th Century.\n\n=== Greig-Smith's Intellectual Progeny ===\nIn Bangor, Greig-Smith took the view that it was up to his students and young postdocs to define the project, develop the scientific hypotheses, and do the work, provided that they included quantitative ecology, his own area of expertise, in their graduate research. He rarely put his own name on his students\u2019 research papers, so that his enormous influence is visible often only in the acknowledgements of published papers. However, some of the papers written by students and researchers while at Greig-Smith\u2019s lab rank among the highest cited in ecology, and owe much of their originality to Greig-Smith\u2019s mentorship<ref>Austin, Michael P., and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Orl\u00f3ci. 1966.

Scientifically, he was a disciplinarian and somewhat of a traditionalist but was also a strong proponent of the separation between scientific positions and political or social points of view. In a letter to Michael Barbour, he wrote: \u201c''There may be parallels between ecology and politics but if so I suspect they are coincidental. I see no parallels between my political or social attitudes and my ecological views''.\u201d<ref>Dove, Michael R., and Daniel M. Kammen. 2015. ''Science, society, and the environment: Applying anthropology and physics to sustainability'' (page 11). Routledge (Taylor & Francis Group), London and New York. (ISBN: 978-0-415-71598-0)</ref> Possibly as a result of his work at Trinidad as a young researcher in 1953, he always had a receptive and supportive attitude toward foreign students, and especially toward those from developing countries. [https://nyeleni.org/IMG/pdf/Tewolde_Darwin_Lecture2002.pdf Tewolde B. G. Egziabher]<ref>Egziabher, Tewolde Berhan Gebre. 2002.

He was a friend and follower of Paul W. Richards, CBE, a professor at Bangor and one of Britain\u2019s most outstanding tropical ecologists. In his obituary of Richards, Greig-Smith recalled the establishment by Richards of the MSc course in ecology at Bangor as a program fundamentally directed to meet the needs of students from the tropics<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1995. Obituary: Professor P. W. Richards. ''The Independent'', 11 October 1995.</ref>. After Trinidad, he visited Nigeria in 1966, where he established a long-lasting relationship with the University of Ife as an external examiner. His passion for tropical ecosystems was palpable in the time and effort he devoted to maintain and curate his orchid collection, donated after his death to the [[Treborth Botanic Garden|Treborth Botanical Gardens at Bangor]], as described in [https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL%20Bangoriad%202011%20English.pdf Retallick (2011)]<ref>Retallick, Simon. 2011. Orchids at Treborth Botanic Garden. ''Bangoriad: Bangor University\u2019s Alumni and Friends\u2019 Magazine'' (Spring): 8. Available at: <nowiki>https://www.bangor.ac.uk/alumni/documents/FINAL</nowiki> Bangoriad 2011 English.pdf</ref>\n\nGenerous with his time both for students and colleagues, he was very active in scientific societies. In the 1960s and 1970s he served the British Ecological Society as its secretary (1961\u20131963), as editor of the Journal of Ecology (1964\u20131968), and as president (1978\u20131979), with John Maynard-Smith as his vice president. Always concerned about maintaining a separation between scientific results and political views, in his presidential viewpoint address in the Bulletin of the British Ecological Society, he advised younger ecologists not to become too specialized: \u201cInsight so often comes from initially unconsidered information and ideas,\u201d he wrote, urging colleagues to maintain a broad curiosity for the natural world<ref>Greig-Smith, Peter 1978. Presidential viewpoint. ''Bulletin of the British Ecological Society'' 9(1): 2\u20133.</ref>. His time as editor of the ''Journal of Ecology'' was the only period in the society\u2019s recent history where only one editor was selected to shoulder the burden of the task, and he carried out the charge with grace and efficiency.\n\nThe Bangor School of Plant Biology took a strong blow in the 1980s, when the British government introduced an early-retirement scheme for university staff in order to save money and confront the economic crisis for public universities at that time. Both John Harper and Peter Greig-Smith took early retirement, and, although they continued to lecture for a few years, they were no longer responsible for the department, and their participation in the recruitment and teaching of graduate students declined. Greig-Smith's students remember him as a caring mentor with a dry but kind sense of humor. His core values were rigor, objectivity, and service to science. Under his leadership, quantitative ecology flourished in Britain and around the world. His intellectual descendants are scattered over all five continents, and the methods he championed now form a fundamental part of global ecological, environmental, and biological studies.\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using<ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0089.xml\n\nhttp://treborth.bangor.ac.uk/glasshouses/orchid.php.en\n\nhttps://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0135.xml\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Greig-Smith, Peter}}\n[[Category:1922 births]]\n[[Category:2003 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Eezcurra", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Legacy of Peter Greig-Smith:recycled one reference", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Greig-Smith"}

The creation of [[British Army]] Brigadier [[Orde Charles Wingate]], the Chindits were formed for [[commando|raiding]] operations against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], especially [[long-range penetration]]: attacking Japanese troops, facilities and [[lines of communication]], deep behind Japanese lines.\n\nTheir operations were marked by prolonged marches through extremely difficult terrain, by underfed troops often weakened by diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]]. There is controversy over the extremely high casualty rate and the debatable military value of the achievements of the Chindits.\n\n==Background & formation==\nDuring the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of 1940\u201341, Wingate \u2013 under General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Middle East Command]] \u2013 had begun to explore guerilla tactics, when he created and commanded a unit known as [[Gideon Force]], composed of regular troops from Sudan and Ethiopia, as well as Ethiopean partisans. Gideon Force disrupted [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] supply lines and collected intelligence.\n\nIn 1942, after the disbandment of Gideon Force, Wavell \u2013 who had since been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[India Command]] \u2013 requested the services of Wingate in Burma. It was intended that he would raise irregular forces to operate behind the Japanese lines, in a manner similar to Gideon Force.<ref name=\"Thompson 2008, p. 374\">Thompson 2008, p. 374.</ref> Wingate arrived in Burma in March 1942 and for two months, as Japanese forces advanced rapidly, toured the country developing his theories of long-range penetration, during the two months preceding the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]. <!-- ''Commented out the following passage for undue emphasis/dubious relevance, i.e. was Wingate disobeying orders in doing what he did, i.e. was he ordered to form such units immediately and to stay in Burma? '' During the final stages of the British retreat from Burma, Wingate had himself specially flown back to India while the rest of the army walked out. --> After returning to Delhi, he presented his proposals to Wavell.\n\nThe name Chindits was suggested by Captain Aung Thin<!--The article is about a man born in 1927--> (DSO) of the [[Burma Rifles]].<ref>[http://www.chindits.info/Awards/DSOAungThin.htm]</ref> Chindit is a corrupted form of the Burmese mythical beast ''[[Chinthe|Chinth\u00e9]]'' or ''Chinthay'', statues of which guarded [[Buddhist]] temples.<ref name=Brayley18>Brayley 2002, p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Organisation and training===\nThe first Chindit unit, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]], was gradually formed in the area around [[Jhansi]] in the summer of 1942. Wingate took charge of the training of the troops in the jungles of central India during the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|rainy season]]. Half of the Chindits were British: the 13th Battalion, the [[King's Liverpool Regiment]] (nominally a second-line battalion, which contained a large number of older men) and men from the former Bush Warfare School in Burma, who were formed into 142 [[British Commando|Commando]] Company. The other portion of the force consisted of the 3rd Battalion, the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd Gurkha Rifles]] (a battalion that had only just been raised) and the 2nd Battalion, the [[Burma Rifles]] (a composite unit formed from several depleted battalions of Burmese troops that had retreated into India in 1942).\n\nWingate trained this force as long-range penetration units that were to be supplied by stores parachuted or dropped from transport aircraft, and were to use close air support as a substitute for heavy artillery.<ref>Thompson 1989, p. 375.</ref> They would penetrate the jungle on foot, essentially relying on surprise through mobility to target enemy lines of communication (a tactic that the Japanese had previously used in 1942 to great effect against British forces  in Singapore and Burma).<ref name=Brayley18/>\n\nThe standard brigade and battalion structures were abandoned. The force was instead formed into eight columns, each of which was organised as: an infantry rifle company (with nine [[Bren light machine gun]]s and three [[2-inch mortar]]s); a support group with the heavy weapons (four [[Boys anti-tank rifle]]s, two medium [[Vickers machine gun]]s and two light anti-aircraft guns); a reconnaissance platoon from the Burma Rifles; and a sabotage group from 142 Commando Company. Small detachments from the Royal Air Force (equipped with radios to call in air support), [[Royal Corps of Signals]] and [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] were attached to the column headquarters.<ref name=\"Chinnery 2010, p. 24\">Chinnery 2010, p. 24.</ref> The heavy weapons, radios, reserve ammunition and rations and other stores were carried on mules, which would also provide an emergency source of food once their loads had been depleted.<ref name=Brayley18/> With 57 mule handlers, each British column numbered 306 men (the Gurkha columns were slightly stronger, with 369 men).<ref name=\"Chinnery 2010, p. 24\"/>\n\nEach man carried more than {{convert|72|lb|kg}} of equipment, which was proportionally more than the mules carrying the support weapons and other stores. This included a personal weapon, such as the [[Lee-Enfield#Rifle No. 4|SMLE rifle]] or [[Sten Gun]], ammunition, [[grenade]]s, a machete or Gurkha [[kukri]] knife, seven days' rations, groundsheet, change of uniform and other assorted items. Much of this load was carried in an Everest carrier, which was essentially a metal rucksack frame without a pack.<ref>Brayley 2002, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nShortly before the first operation, one column was broken up to bring the remaining seven up to full strength. Two or more columns were commanded by a group headquarters, which in turn was commanded by the brigade headquarters.\n\n==Operation Longcloth==\n[[Image:Ordecharleswingate.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Brigadier Orde Wingate]]\nThe original intent had been to use the Chindits as a part of a larger offensive. When this offensive was cancelled, Wingate convinced General Wavell to send the Chindits into Burma anyway.  Accordingly, on 8 February 1943, [[Operation Longcloth]] commenced and 3,000 Chindits, Wingate with them, began their march into Burma.\n\nThe Chindits crossed the [[Chindwin River]] on 13 February and faced the first Japanese troops two days later. Two columns marched to the south and received their air supply drops in broad daylight to create an impression that they were the main attack. They even had a man impersonating a British general along with them. The RAF mounted air attacks on Japanese targets to support the deception. These columns were to swing east at the beginning of March and attack the main north-south railway in areas south of the main force. One column successfully carried out demolitions along the railway, but the other column was ambushed. Half of the ambushed column returned to India.\n\nFive other columns proceeded eastward. Two, those of [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]] and [[Bernard Fergusson]], proceeded towards the main north-south railway in Burma. On 4 March, Calvert's column reached the valley and demolished the railway in 70 places. Fergusson arrived two days later to do the same. Despite these successes, however, the railway was only temporarily disabled, and resumed operation shortly afterwards.\n\nOn many occasions, the Chindits could not take their wounded with them; some were left behind in villages. Wingate had, in fact, issued specific orders to leave behind all wounded, but these orders were not strictly followed. Since there were often no established paths in the jungle along their routes, many times they had to clear their own with [[machete]]s and [[kukri]]s (and on one occasion, a commandeered elephant). Supply was delivered by air using three [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]]s and three [[DC-3|Dakota]]s of [[No. 31 Squadron RAF|31 Squadron]] operating out of [[Agartala]] in eastern Bengal.\n\nOnce in Burma, Wingate repeatedly changed his plans, sometimes without informing all the column commanders. The majority of two of the columns marched back to India after being ambushed by the Japanese in separate actions. After the railway attacks, Wingate decided to cross his force over the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]]. However, the area on the other side of the river turned out to be inhospitable to operations. Water was difficult to obtain and the combination of rivers with a good system of roads in the area allowed the Japanese to force the Chindits into a progressively smaller \"box\".\n\nIn late March, Wingate made the decision to withdraw the majority of the force, but sent orders to one of the columns to continue eastward. The operations had reached the range limit of air supply and prospects for new successful operations were low, given the Japanese pressure. The columns were generally left to make their own way back to India. On the journey back, the most difficult actions involved crossing back over the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese had observers and patrols all along the river bank and could quickly concentrate once an attempt at a crossing was detected. Gradually, all the columns broke up into small groups. Wingate's headquarters returned to India on its own ahead of most of the columns. Through the spring and even into the autumn of 1943, individual groups of men from the Chindits made their way back to India. The army did what they could for the men. In one case, an aeroplane was landed in an open area and wounded men were evacuated by air. Part of one column made it to China. Another body of men escaped into the far north of Burma. Others were captured or died.\n\nBy the end of April, after a three-month mission, the majority of the surviving Chindits had crossed the Chindwin river, having marched between 750\u20131,000 miles.<ref name=Brayley19>Brayley 2002, p. 19.</ref> Of the 3,000 men that had begun the operation, a third (818 men) had been killed, taken prisoner or died of disease, and of the 2,182 men who returned, about 600 were too debilitated from their wounds or disease to return to active service.<ref name=Brayley19/><ref name=\"Thompson 2008, p. 374\"/> Of the remaining men, Wingate practically hand picked those few he would retain, while the rest were put back under the normal army command structure as part of their original battalions.\n\n==Interlude==\nAlthough British Army officers in India criticised the effectiveness of the Chindits (Japanese railway communications had been out of commission for less than a week), their effect on the morale of the Allied troops in India was refreshing, and they were given plenty of publicity.\n\nWingate wrote an operations report on returning to India, which was controversial for many reasons, including attacks on officers under his command. The report had a tendency to excuse any mistakes made by its author (Wingate), while making vicious attacks on other officers, often based on limited information. Eventually, through his political allies in London, a copy of the report was given to [[Winston Churchill]], who was impressed and took Wingate with him to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]]. His concepts for long-range penetration operations behind Japanese lines received official backing at high level, and he obtained substantial US support for his force. The [[US Army]] also began its own plans for the group that later became [[Merrill's Marauders]].\n\nAs the members of the first expedition were making their way back to India, a second long range penetration unit, [[111th Indian Infantry Brigade]] was being formed.<ref name=Masters135>Masters 2002, p. 135.</ref> Popularly known as ''The Leopards'',<ref name=Masters135/> the brigade was raised by General Wavell without the knowledge of Wingate, who was still in Burma and who was known to have a strong dislike for the Indian Army, its diverse troop formations, and its British officers in particular. Wavell personally selected the commander of 111th Brigade, Brigadier [[Walter David Alexander Lentaigne|Joe Lentaigne]].<ref name=Masters135/>\n\nWavell intended to use two Chindit brigades alternately during 1944. While one brigade was operating behind Japanese lines for two to three months at a time, the other would be resting in India, while training for and planning the next operation. However, Wingate returned from Quebec with authority to implement far more ambitious plans for the second expedition, which required that the force be greatly expanded to a strength of six brigades. Wingate refused to use [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] formations in this force, because he maintained that their training in long-range penetration techniques would take longer and their maintenance by air would be difficult due to the varied dietary requirements of different Gurkha and Indian [[caste]]s and religions,<ref>Callahan 1978, p. 101.</ref> although he had little choice but to accept 111th Brigade, and two Gurkha battalions in 77th brigade. Since large numbers of trained British infantry were required, three brigades (the [[British 14th Infantry Brigade|14th]], [[British 16th Infantry Brigade|16th]] and [[British 23rd Infantry Brigade|23rd]]) were added to the Chindits by breaking up the experienced [[British 70th Infantry Division]], much against the wishes of Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] and other commanders, who wished to use the division in a conventional role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chindits.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/the-chindits-1944/|title=In 1944 \u2013 The Second & Last Expedition|publisher=Hermes' wings|accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref> A sixth brigade was added to the force by taking a brigade (the 3rd (West African) Infantry Brigade) from the [[British 81st (West Africa) Division]].<ref>Rooney 1992, pp. 112 & 116.</ref>\n\nAt Quebec, Wingate had also succeeded in obtaining a \"private\" air force for the Chindits, the [[1st Air Commando Group]], mainly consisting of [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] aircraft. The Chindits were greatly encouraged by having aircraft on which they could call immediately for supply drops, casualty evacuation and air support. Other welcome American aid was the [[K-ration|\"K\" Ration]] pack which, although it provided insufficient calories for prolonged active operations, was far better than the equivalent British or Indian ration pack.<ref>Masters (1961), p.139</ref>\n\nThe forces for the second Chindit operation were called ''Special Force'', officially '''3rd Indian Infantry Division''', or ''Long Range Penetration Groups'',<ref>Rooney 1992, pp. 110 & 115.</ref> but the nickname, the Chindits, had already stuck.\n\nThe new Chindit force commenced training in [[Gwalior]]. Men were trained in crossing rivers, [[demolitions]] and [[bivouacking]]. Calvert and Fergusson, both newly promoted to Brigadier, took command of two of the brigades, and were responsible for much of the training program and the development of tactical planning.{{Cn|date=December 2019}} Wingate himself was absent for much of the training period, first being out of the country to attend the Quebec Conference and then struck ill with typhoid from drinking bad water in North Africa on his return.<ref>Rooney 1992, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\n===Plans===\nThe plans for the second Chindit operation went through many revisions.\n\nThe methods of the new Long Range Penetration force in 1944 differed from those of 1943. Wingate had decided on a strategy of creating fortified bases behind the Japanese lines, which would then send out raiding columns over short distances. This change was in part forced on him by strengthened Japanese patrols along the Burmese frontier, making a repeat of the successful infiltration in 1943 unlikely.<ref>Slim 1956, p. 219.</ref> In an imaginative move prompted by Colonel [[Philip Cochran]]'s assurance that he could transport both troops and supplies by glider,<ref>[http://www.specialoperations.net/ColCochran.htm Alison, John (Maj. Gen.), ''Phil Cochran, The Most Unforgettable Character I've Met'']</ref> Wingate arranged for the bulk of the force to enter Burma by air, greatly accelerating the force's ability to reach its target objectives.<ref>Masters 2002, p. 172.</ref> Advance units would land in gliders in preselected open fields in Burma, and prepare them for large-scale landings by transport aircraft. The lavish air support provided by Colonels Cochran and [[John R. Alison|Alison]] of the 1st Air Commando Group proved critical to the success of the operation.<ref>Masters 2002, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref>\n\nWingate also had plans for a general uprising of the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] population of Northern Burma. He fought over these plans with the leadership of [[Force 136]] (an organisation set up to liaise with resistance forces in Japanese-occupied countries), which was concerned that a premature uprising of the Kachins without a permanent British military presence would lead to their slaughter by the Japanese at the end of operations. Force 136 also had their own plans for a rising to be coordinated with the arrival of the regular army in Burma. Wingate was eventually convinced to scale back his original plans.{{efn|See British National Archives HS1/2 - Most Secret & personal from head of SOE India to 'P' Division SEAC & GHQ India March 10, 1944 - Military Operations in the Dilwyn Area B/B.100 to head of SOE India March 11, 1944. For the Chindit side see the Operational Report of Dah Force (Imperial War Museum)}} Further complicating relations between the organisations were orders issued by Wingate to the commander of Dah Force (a British-led force of Kachin irregulars attached to the Chindits) not to coordinate operations with Force 136 for security reasons.{{sfn|Captain Herring|p=1}}\n\nDuring the last months of 1943, planning was conducted to carry out the strategy for India as originally determined at the Quebec Conference. In November, the overall plan for the dry season campaign of 1944 determined by [[South East Asia Command]] focused on the use of the Chindits in the reconquest of northern Burma. These plans were approved by the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] and although other offensives in Burma were scaled back or cancelled, Stilwell's Northern Front offensive with the Chindits' participation survived the cuts.{{efn|The [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] changed some of the original plans, but did not affect the plans to use the Chindits to interdict the Japanese 18th Division's supply lines (Slim 1956, p. 214).}} The uncertainty of the plans nevertheless meant that the plans and contingency plans for the use of the Chindits repeatedly changed up to the very start of operations.<ref name=\"plans\">Planning of Operation Thursday\n* Prasad, Bhargava & Khera 1958, pp. 318\u2013320.(?)\n* Slim 1956, p. 204.</ref>\n\nThe Chindits were assigned the task of helping the forces of [[Joseph Stilwell]] push the [[Ledo Road]] through northern Burma to link up with the [[Burma Road]] and re-establish an overland supply route to China, by mounting a long range penetration operation behind the Japanese opposing his forces on the Northern Front. It had originally been intended that the IV Corps would attack on the Central Front and cross the Chindwin to tie up Japanese forces which could otherwise be used to aid the Northern Front. As the Japanese launched their own attack on the Central Front, this advance did not meet its objectives, but it still meant that most Japanese forces were engaged on the Central Front and were not available to reinforce the Japanese 18th Division on the Northern Front. The Japanese offensive on the Central Front resulted in further proposals and refinements of the plans for the Chindits.<ref name=\"plans\"/>\n\nOn 4 February 1944, Lieutenant General Slim, commander of the [[British Fourteenth Army]], and USAAF General [[George E. Stratemeyer]], commander of Eastern Air Command, issued a joint directive to General Wingate and Cols. Cochran and Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group, to march and fly into [[Indaw]] and from there under the command of the Fourteenth Army carry out the objectives of:\n\n<blockquote>(i) Helping the advance of Stilwell's Ledo force on [[Myitkyina]] by cutting the communications of the Japanese 18th Division, harassing its rear, and preventing its reinforcement.<br>(ii) Creating a favourable situation for the [[Yunnan]] Chinese forces to cross the [[Salween River|Salween]] and enter Burma.<br>(iii) Inflicting the greatest possible damage and confusion on the enemy in North Burma.<ref>Slim 1956, p. 259.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Operation Thursday==<!-- This section is linked from [[Invasion]] -->\n[[Image:West African Chindits, Operation Thursday.jpg|thumb|325px|Troops of the [[Nigeria Regiment]], 3rd West African Brigade (Thunder), board an RAF [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]]]]\nOn 5 February 1944, Fergusson's 16th Brigade left [[Ledo, Assam|Ledo]] for Burma. They avoided Japanese forces by traversing exceptionally difficult terrain. The rest of the Brigades were brought in by air to create fortified bases with airstrips.\n\nThree landing zones, codenamed ''Piccadilly'', ''Broadway'' and ''Chowringhee'', were selected. Calvert's 77th Brigade prepared to fly by [[Waco CG-4|Hadrian]] glider into ''Piccadilly'' on the night of 5 March. A last-minute aerial reconnaissance revealed ''Piccadilly'' to be covered with logs, making landing impossible. In some accounts of the incident, Wingate insisted that the operation had been betrayed and that the other landing zones would be ambushed. To proceed would be \"murder\". Slim accepted the responsibility of ordering a willing Calvert to proceed with the operation, using ''Broadway'' instead.<ref>Slim 1956, pp.257\u2013259.</ref> While ''Piccadilly'' had already been used to evacuate casualties during the first Chindit operation in 1943, ''Broadway'' had to be selected from the results of aerial reconnaissance. It turned out to be a poor landing ground and there were many casualties in crash landings, but Calvert's men were just able to make the strip fit to take transport aircraft the next day. Chindit gliders also landed on ''Chowringhee'' the next day, without opposition.\n\nIt was later revealed that the logs on ''Piccadilly'' had been placed there to dry by Burmese teak loggers. The real problem was the failure to maintain continuous observation of the landing zones (e.g. by high-flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] photo-reconnaissance aircraft) before the forces were deployed.\n\nOver the next week, 600 sorties by [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]] transport aircraft transferred 9,000 men to the landing zones. ''Chowringhee'' was abandoned once the fly-in was completed, but ''Broadway'' was held with a garrison which included field artillery, anti-aircraft guns and even Spitfire fighters for a brief period. Fergusson's brigade set up another base named ''Aberdeen'' north of [[Indaw]], into which 14th Brigade was flown. Calvert's brigade established yet another, named ''White City'' at [[Mawlu]], astride the main railway and road leading to the Japanese northern front. 111 Brigade set up ambushes and roadblocks south of Indaw (although part of the brigade which landed at ''Chowringhee'' was delayed in crossing the Irrawaddy River), before moving west to [[Pinlebu]].\n\nFerocious jungle fighting ensued around ''Broadway'' and ''White City''. At times, British and Japanese troops were in close combat, [[bayonet]]s and [[kukri]]s against [[katana]]s. On 27 March, after days of aircraft attack, the Japanese attacked ''Broadway'' for several nights before the attack was repulsed with flown-in artillery and the aid of locally recruited [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] irregulars.\n\nHowever, a setback occurred when Fergusson's brigade tried to capture [[Indaw]] on 24 March. The original intention had been to seize the town and its airfields on 15 March but Fergusson had to report that this was impossible. Wingate appeared ready to change the brigade's mission but on 20 March, he reinstated Indaw as the target.{{efn|Shelford Bidwell speculates that Wingate had revived at short notice a plan codenamed '''Operation Tarzan''', by which the [[Indian 26th Infantry Division]] would fly into the captured airfields, even though this division was already heavily engaged in the Arakan (Bidwell 1979, p. 138).}} The brigade was already exhausted from its long march, and there was no time to properly reconnoitre the objective. The units were dismayed to find that the Japanese controlled the only water sources. Fergusson expected that 14th Brigade would cooperate in the attack, but they moved west instead. Japanese reinforcements had also moved into Indaw, which was a major road and rail centre. Fergusson's battalions, attacking separately, were each repulsed. After this, most of the tired 16th Brigade were flown out.\n\n===Change of command===\nOn 24 March, Wingate flew to [[Imphal]] to confer with air force commanders. On the return journey, the USAAF [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] bomber in which he was flying is believed to have flown into a thunderstorm and crashed in the jungle-covered mountains. All aboard were killed.\n\nSlim, the commander of the [[British Fourteenth Army]] which had loose operational control over Special Force, selected Brigadier Lentaigne to be Wingate's replacement after conferring with Brigadier Derek Tulloch, Wingate's Chief of Staff. Lentaigne was judged to be the most balanced and experienced commander in the force; he had been an instructor at the Staff College at [[Quetta]], had led a Gurkha battalion with distinction during the gruelling retreat from Burma in 1942 and had commanded a Chindit brigade in the field (albeit for only a few weeks, but none of the other brigade commanders had more experience). As an officer of Gurkha troops, he had a similar outlook and background to Slim. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities, mostly without staff qualifications, some of whom had never even commanded a battalion-sized unit in combat before 1944, and Wingate's staff officers lacked the necessary combat experience.<ref>Allen 1984, pp.348\u2013351; summary from {{harvnb|Tulloch|1972|p={{page needed|date=August 2016}}}}.</ref> The force's second-in-command, Major General [[George William Symes]], was bypassed by Slim and formally protested and asked to be relieved.<ref>Allen 1984, pp. 350\u2013351.</ref> In selecting Lentaigne, Slim did not take into account the tensions between those Chindit commanders and staff who were closely associated with Wingate, and Lentaigne, who had a classical \"line\" officer's background and had been critical of Wingate's methods and techniques.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 122.</ref>\n\nIt is probably fair to say that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they knew exactly what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.\n\n===The move north===\nSeveral major changes were made at the highest level. Much of the air support was diverted to the critical battles of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]], where troops were cut off and could only be resupplied by air. 23rd Brigade, yet to fly in, was also despatched to [[Kohima]]. Those Chindits already operating in Burma were formally subordinated to General Joseph Stilwell, who ordered the Chindits to abandon their dispersed operations around Indaw, and concentrate on interdicting the supply lines to the Japanese forces opposing his [[Northern Combat Area Command]].\n\nIn April, Lentaigne ordered the main body of 111 Brigade west of the Irrawaddy, now commanded by [[John Masters]], to move north and build a new stronghold, codenamed ''Blackpool'', which would block the railway and main road at [[Hopin]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Mogaung]]. Calvert was ordered to abandon ''White City'' and ''Broadway'' and move north to support Masters. Calvert was opposed to this, as his brigade had successfully held these two strongholds for months. Stilwell also feared that abandoning ''White City'' would allow Japanese reinforcements to move north. However, Lentaigne insisted that the Chindit brigades were too far apart to support each other, and that it would be difficult to use aircraft at ''White City'' and ''Broadway'' during the [[monsoon]].<ref>Allen 1984, p. 355.</ref>\n\nMasters's force established ''Blackpool'' on 8 May and were almost immediately engaged in fierce fighting. Whereas ''White City'' had been deep in the Japanese rear, its defenders had had plenty of time to prepare their defences and its attackers had been a mixed bag of detachments from several formations, ''Blackpool'' was close to the Japanese northern front, and was immediately attacked by Japanese troops with heavy artillery support. As Calvert and Stilwell had feared, abandoning ''White City'' had allowed the [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 53rd Division]] to move north from Indaw. A heavy attack against ''Blackpool'' was repulsed on 17 May, but a second attack on 24 May captured vital positions inside the defences.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 360.</ref>\n\nBecause the monsoon had broken and heavy rain made movement in the jungle very difficult, neither Calvert nor Brodie's [[British 14th Infantry Brigade|14th Brigade]] could help Masters. Finally, Masters had to abandon ''Blackpool'' on 25 May, because the men were exhausted after 17 days of continual combat. Nineteen Allied soldiers, who were so badly injured as to be beyond hope of recovery and could not be moved, were shot by the medical orderlies and hidden in heavy stands of bamboo.<ref>{{harvnb|Cloonan|1999|p=52}} cites Masters, ''The Road Past Mandalay'', pp. 277\u2013278.<!--This needs to be replaced with a direct cite from Masters--></ref>\n\n===Final operations===\nOn 17 May, Slim had formally handed control of the Chindits to Stilwell. Stilwell insisted that the Chindits capture several well-defended Japanese positions. The Chindits had no support from tanks or artillery and this led to heavier casualties than before. According to David Rooney, the Chindits were misused under Stillwell's command and suffered heavy casualties undertaking roles that they were not trained or equipped for.<ref>Rooney 1992, p. 137.</ref>\n\nOver the period from 6 June to 27 June, Calvert's 77th Brigade took [[Mogaung]] and suffered 800 casualties \u2013 50% of the brigade's men involved in the operation. Fearing that they would then be ordered to join the [[siege of Myitkyina]], Calvert handed Mogaung over to [[Chinese Army in India|Force X]], shut down his radios and retreated to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and Stilwell finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 375.</ref>\n\n111 Brigade, after resting, was ordered to capture a hill known as Point 2171. It did so, but was now utterly exhausted. Most of the men were suffering from [[malaria]], [[dysentery]] and [[malnutrition]]. On 8 July, at the insistence of the Supreme Commander, Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], doctors examined the brigade. Of the 2,200 men present from four and a half battalions, only 119 were declared fit. The brigade was evacuated, although Masters sarcastically kept the fit men, \"111 Company\", in the field until 1 August.\n\nThe portion of 111 Brigade east of the Irrawaddy were known as ''Morris Force'', after its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel J.R. \"Jumbo\" Morris. They had spent several months harassing Japanese traffic from [[Bhamo]] to Myitkyina. They had then attempted to complete the encirclement of Myitkyina. Stilwell was angered that they were unable to do so, but Slim pointed out that Stilwell's Chinese troops (numbering 5,500) had also failed in that task. By 14 July, Morris Force was down to three platoons.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 362.</ref> A week later, they only had 25 men fit for duty. Morris Force was evacuated about the same time as 77th Brigade.\n\n14th Brigade and 3rd West African Brigade remained in action, assisting the newly arrived [[British 36th Infantry Division]] in its advance down the \"Railway Valley\" south of Mogaung. Finally, they were relieved and withdrawn, starting on 17 August. The last Chindit left Burma on 27 August 1944.\n\n===Kohima===\n{{Main|Battle of Kohima}}\n23rd Brigade, which had been diverted from the main Chindit campaign, nevertheless acted as a long range penetration unit behind the Japanese fighting at Kohima. From April to June 1944, they marched long distances through the Naga hills, mostly in monsoon weather which made movement very difficult. They contributed in large measure to the starvation of the Japanese at Kohima, the decisive factor in that battle. Although not engaged in major battles, they accounted for large numbers of Japanese stragglers and foragers, suffering 158 battle casualties themselves.\n\n==The end==\nThe Chindits had suffered heavy casualties: 1,396 killed and 2,434 wounded. Over half had to be confined to hospital and prescribed a special nutritional diet whilst hospitalised. As bad as the casualty figures may seem, those suffered by the force in 1943 were proportionally much higher.\n\nThe healthy men were sent to training camps to await new operations. However, when the army command evaluated the men and equipment required to return the Chindits to operational status, it was decided to transform the force into an Airborne Division in India. Beyond direct replacements, it was known that the British element of the Chindits would be decimated in 1945 by the need to repatriate personnel who had served more than four years overseas.\n\nDuring the early months of 1945, several of the brigade headquarters and many of the veterans of the Chindit operations were reformed into the 14th and 77th Infantry Brigades and merged into the [[44th Airborne Division (India)]], while the force headquarters and signals units formed the core of the [[XXXIV Corps (India)|Indian XXXIV Corps]]. The Chindits were finally disbanded in February 1945.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 22.</ref>\n\n==London memorial==\n[[File:Chindit memorial London.jpg|thumb|Badge of the Chindits on their memorial outside the Ministry of Defence building in London]]\nThere is a memorial to Orde Wingate and the Chindits on the north side of the [[Victoria Embankment]] next to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] headquarters in [[London]]. The memorial was unveiled on 16 October 1990 by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The front of the monument is in memory of the Chindits and also mentions the four men of the Chindits awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]: Major [[Frank Gerald Blaker]], Captain [[Michael Allmand]] and Lieutenant [[George Albert Cairns]] and Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]. The battalions that took part are listed on the sides of the monument. Non-infantry units are mentioned by their parent formations only. No distinction is made between those units that took part in 1943 versus those of 1944. The rear of the monument is exclusively dedicated to Orde Wingate and also mentions his contributions to the state of Israel.<ref>[http://www.chindits.info/Memorial/Main.html Chindit Memorial, London]</ref>\n\nThe memorial is a 4 metres (13&nbsp;ft) high [[Portland stone]] pillar mounted on three steps, on which is a statue by Frank Forster of the [[chinthe]], after which the Chindits are named.\n\n==Military legacy==\nMilitary historians disagree on the Chindits' military significance. The debate is part of the ongoing one of whether the deployment of special forces are a net asset to a campaign or whether the investment in time, materiel and men that such operations demand outweigh the advantages gained. For example, it is questioned whether the interdiction of Japanese supply lines during Operation Thursday by the Chindits contributed more to Stilwell's advance than if the resources committed to the operation had been used to provide Stilwell with another regular division to fight alongside his [[X Force]].\n\nThe views of the majority of the post-war British military establishment were made succinctly by Slim (commander of the Fourteenth Army), when he wrote \"... the Chindits, gave a splendid example of courage and hardihood. Yet I came firmly to the conclusion that such formations, trained, equipped and mentally adjusted for one kind of operation were wasteful. They did not give, militarily, a worth-while return for the resources in men, materiel and time that they absorbed. ... [Special forces] were usually formed by attracting the best men ... The result of these methods was undoubtedly to lower the quality of the rest of the Army\".<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\">Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.</ref> He makes several other arguments against special forces, about the danger of ordinary battalions thinking that some tasks could only be performed by special forces, and that special forces can only stay in the field for relatively short periods compared to regular battalions. He sums up that \"Anything, whatever the short cuts to victory it may promise, which thus weakens the Army spirit is dangerous\".<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\"/>  To underline his point he suggests that \"This cult of special forces is as sensible as to form a Royal Corps of Tree Climbers and say that no soldier, who does not wear its green hat with a bunch of oak leaves stuck in it should be expected to climb a tree\".<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\"/>  He does acknowledge the need for small units to stir up trouble in the enemy's rear area but does not make it clear if he is talking about [[V Force]] or the actions of [[Force 136]].<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\"/>\n\nOthers, like Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]], himself an ex-Chindit, have asserted that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but that they were just badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their [[propaganda]] value in 1943, at a time when the Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 19\u201320.</ref> It has been hard to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.\n\nIt has also been argued that the Chindits contributed to the overall success of the Allied armies in Burma through the innovations in air supply techniques and organisation that their operations required.<ref name=Brayley20>Brayley 2002, p. 20.</ref> The Allied air forces were later to use these tactics to supply increasingly large forces that were cut off by the enemy, or were operating independently of road or rail lines of communication. Conversely, it has been argued that the apparent success of the Chindits led some Japanese commanders to believe that they could employ their own incursion tactics on a much larger scale, and that when they came to implement such tactics during the Chindwin offensive of early 1944, lacking the necessary air support that had enabled the Allies to be successful, the result was disastrous and ultimately led to defeat at both Kohima and Imphal, and later on the plains of Burma in 1945.<ref name=Brayley20/>\n\nThree of the Brigade commanders on ''Operation Thursday'' (two of whom had also served in the first Chindit expedition) subsequently wrote autobiographies, which contained their comments on the Chindits' concept and practice of operations. [[Bernard Fergusson, Baron Ballantrae|Bernard Fergusson]], originally an enthusiastic supporter of Wingate, later came to feel that Wingate lacked both consistency and flexibility in his plans, which contributed to Fergusson's long, pointless march from Ledo and his defeat at Indaw. [[John Masters]], who was a close friend and supporter of Lentaigne, felt that the Chindits' mobility was sacrificed in holding fixed defensive positions or attacking strong Japanese positions, without the necessary support. In criticism of the whole Chindit concept, he pointed out that the Chindit force had the infantry strength of two and a half line divisions, but, without supporting arms, it had the fighting strength of less than one. Michael Calvert, who was closest to Wingate, remained an absolute unquestioning defender of Wingate and his methods.\n\nThe British Army's [[77th Brigade (United Kingdom)|77th Brigade]], raised in 2015 to engage in upstream prevention for the army, was named in tribute to the Chindits.<ref name=GuardJan15>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade|title=British army creates team of Facebook warriors|author=Ewan MacAskill|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Denis Edward Arnold]] MC\n* [[Roland Degg]]\n* [[Order of Battle of the Chindits]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The longest War 1941-45 |publisher=J.M.

The creation of [[British Army]] Brigadier [[Orde Charles Wingate]], the Chindits were formed for [[commando|raiding]] operations against the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], especially [[long-range penetration]]: attacking Japanese troops, facilities and [[lines of communication]], deep behind Japanese lines.\n\nTheir operations were marked by prolonged marches through extremely difficult terrain, by underfed troops often weakened by diseases such as [[malaria]] and [[dysentery]]. There is controversy over the extremely high casualty rate and the debatable military value of the achievements of the Chindits.\n\n==Background & formation==\nDuring the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]] of 1940\u201341, Wingate \u2013 under General [[Archibald Percival Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], Commander-in-Chief of the [[Middle East Command]] \u2013 had begun to explore guerilla tactics, when he created and commanded a unit known as [[Gideon Force]], composed of regular troops from Sudan and Ethiopia, as well as Ethiopean partisans. Gideon Force disrupted [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] supply lines and collected intelligence.\n\nIn 1942, after the disbandment of Gideon Force, Wavell \u2013 who had since been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the [[India Command]] \u2013 requested the services of Wingate in Burma. It was intended that he would raise irregular forces to operate behind the Japanese lines, in a manner similar to Gideon Force.<ref name=\"Thompson 2008, p. 374\">Thompson 2008, p. 374.</ref> Wingate arrived in Burma in March 1942 and for two months, as Japanese forces advanced rapidly, toured the country developing his theories of long-range penetration, during the two months preceding the [[Japanese conquest of Burma]]. <!-- ''Commented out the following passage for undue emphasis/dubious relevance, i.e. was Wingate disobeying orders in doing what he did, i.e. was he ordered to form such units immediately and to stay in Burma? '' During the final stages of the British retreat from Burma, Wingate had himself specially flown back to India while the rest of the army walked out. --> After returning to Delhi, he presented his proposals to Wavell.\n\nThe name Chindits was suggested by Captain Aung Thin<!--The article is about a man born in 1927--> (DSO) of the [[Burma Rifles]].<ref>[http://www.chindits.info/Awards/DSOAungThin.htm]</ref> Chindit is a corrupted form of the Burmese mythical beast ''[[Chinthe|Chinth\u00e9]]'' or ''Chinthay'', statues of which guarded [[Buddhist]] temples.<ref name=Brayley18>Brayley 2002, p. 18.</ref>\n\n===Organisation and training===\nThe first Chindit unit, the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]], was gradually formed in the area around [[Jhansi]] in the summer of 1942. Wingate took charge of the training of the troops in the jungles of central India during the [[Monsoon of Indian subcontinent|rainy season]]. Half of the Chindits were British: the 13th Battalion, the [[King's Liverpool Regiment]] (nominally a second-line battalion, which contained a large number of older men) and men from the former Bush Warfare School in Burma, who were formed into 142 [[British Commando|Commando]] Company. The other portion of the force consisted of the 3rd Battalion, the [[2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles)|2nd Gurkha Rifles]] (a battalion that had only just been raised) and the 2nd Battalion, the [[Burma Rifles]] (a composite unit formed from several depleted battalions of Burmese troops that had retreated into India in 1942).\n\nWingate trained this force as long-range penetration units that were to be supplied by stores parachuted or dropped from transport aircraft, and were to use close air support as a substitute for heavy artillery.<ref>Thompson 1989, p. 375.</ref> They would penetrate the jungle on foot, essentially relying on surprise through mobility to target enemy lines of communication (a tactic that the Japanese had previously used in 1942 to great effect against British forces  in Singapore and Burma).<ref name=Brayley18/>\n\nThe standard brigade and battalion structures were abandoned. The force was instead formed into eight columns, each of which was organised as: an infantry rifle company (with nine [[Bren light machine gun]]s and three [[2-inch mortar]]s); a support group with the heavy weapons (four [[Boys anti-tank rifle]]s, two medium [[Vickers machine gun]]s and two light anti-aircraft guns); a reconnaissance platoon from the Burma Rifles; and a sabotage group from 142 Commando Company. Small detachments from the Royal Air Force (equipped with radios to call in air support), [[Royal Corps of Signals]] and [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] were attached to the column headquarters.<ref name=\"Chinnery 2010, p. 24\">Chinnery 2010, p. 24.</ref> The heavy weapons, radios, reserve ammunition and rations and other stores were carried on mules, which would also provide an emergency source of food once their loads had been depleted.<ref name=Brayley18/> With 57 mule handlers, each British column numbered 306 men (the Gurkha columns were slightly stronger, with 369 men).<ref name=\"Chinnery 2010, p. 24\"/>\n\nEach man carried more than {{convert|72|lb|kg}} of equipment, which was proportionally more than the mules carrying the support weapons and other stores. This included a personal weapon, such as the [[Lee-Enfield#Rifle No. 4|SMLE rifle]] or [[Sten Gun]], ammunition, [[grenade]]s, a machete or Gurkha [[kukri]] knife, seven days' rations, groundsheet, change of uniform and other assorted items. Much of this load was carried in an Everest carrier, which was essentially a metal rucksack frame without a pack.<ref>Brayley 2002, pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nShortly before the first operation, one column was broken up to bring the remaining seven up to full strength. Two or more columns were commanded by a group headquarters, which in turn was commanded by the brigade headquarters.\n\n==Operation Longcloth==\n[[Image:Ordecharleswingate.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Brigadier Orde Wingate]]\nThe original intent had been to use the Chindits as a part of a larger offensive. When this offensive was cancelled, Wingate convinced General Wavell to send the Chindits into Burma anyway.  Accordingly, on 8 February 1943, [[Operation Longcloth]] commenced and 3,000 Chindits, Wingate with them, began their march into Burma.\n\nThe Chindits crossed the [[Chindwin River]] on 13 February and faced the first Japanese troops two days later. Two columns marched to the south and received their air supply drops in broad daylight to create an impression that they were the main attack. They even had a man impersonating a British general along with them. The RAF mounted air attacks on Japanese targets to support the deception. These columns were to swing east at the beginning of March and attack the main north-south railway in areas south of the main force. One column successfully carried out demolitions along the railway, but the other column was ambushed. Half of the ambushed column returned to India.\n\nFive other columns proceeded eastward. Two, those of [[Mike Calvert|Michael Calvert]] and [[Bernard Fergusson]], proceeded towards the main north-south railway in Burma. On 4 March, Calvert's column reached the valley and demolished the railway in 70 places. Fergusson arrived two days later to do the same. Despite these successes, however, the railway was only temporarily disabled, and resumed operation shortly afterwards.\n\nOn many occasions, the Chindits could not take their wounded with them; some were left behind in villages. Wingate had, in fact, issued specific orders to leave behind all wounded, but these orders were not strictly followed. Since there were often no established paths in the jungle along their routes, many times they had to clear their own with [[machete]]s and [[kukri]]s (and on one occasion, a commandeered elephant). Supply was delivered by air using three [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]]s and three [[DC-3|Dakota]]s of [[No. 31 Squadron RAF|31 Squadron]] operating out of [[Agartala]] in eastern Bengal.\n\nOnce in Burma, Wingate repeatedly changed his plans, sometimes without informing all the column commanders. The majority of two of the columns marched back to India after being ambushed by the Japanese in separate actions. After the railway attacks, Wingate decided to cross his force over the [[Ayeyarwady River|Irrawaddy River]]. However, the area on the other side of the river turned out to be inhospitable to operations. Water was difficult to obtain and the combination of rivers with a good system of roads in the area allowed the Japanese to force the Chindits into a progressively smaller \"box\".\n\nIn late March, Wingate made the decision to withdraw the majority of the force, but sent orders to one of the columns to continue eastward. The operations had reached the range limit of air supply and prospects for new successful operations were low, given the Japanese pressure. The columns were generally left to make their own way back to India. On the journey back, the most difficult actions involved crossing back over the Irrawaddy River. The Japanese had observers and patrols all along the river bank and could quickly concentrate once an attempt at a crossing was detected. Gradually, all the columns broke up into small groups. Wingate's headquarters returned to India on its own ahead of most of the columns. Through the spring and even into the autumn of 1943, individual groups of men from the Chindits made their way back to India. The army did what they could for the men. In one case, an aeroplane was landed in an open area and wounded men were evacuated by air. Part of one column made it to China. Another body of men escaped into the far north of Burma. Others were captured or died.\n\nBy the end of April, after a three-month mission, the majority of the surviving Chindits had crossed the Chindwin river, having marched between 750\u20131,000 miles.<ref name=Brayley19>Brayley 2002, p. 19.</ref> Of the 3,000 men that had begun the operation, a third (818 men) had been killed, taken prisoner or died of disease, and of the 2,182 men who returned, about 600 were too debilitated from their wounds or disease to return to active service.<ref name=Brayley19/><ref name=\"Thompson 2008, p. 374\"/> Of the remaining men, Wingate practically hand picked those few he would retain, while the rest were put back under the normal army command structure as part of their original battalions.\n\n==Interlude==\nAlthough British Army officers in India criticised the effectiveness of the Chindits (Japanese railway communications had been out of commission for less than a week), their effect on the morale of the Allied troops in India was refreshing, and they were given plenty of publicity.\n\nWingate wrote an operations report on returning to India, which was controversial for many reasons, including attacks on officers under his command. The report had a tendency to excuse any mistakes made by its author (Wingate), while making vicious attacks on other officers, often based on limited information. Eventually, through his political allies in London, a copy of the report was given to [[Winston Churchill]], who was impressed and took Wingate with him to the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]]. His concepts for long-range penetration operations behind Japanese lines received official backing at high level, and he obtained substantial US support for his force. The [[US Army]] also began its own plans for the group that later became [[Merrill's Marauders]].\n\nAs the members of the first expedition were making their way back to India, a second long range penetration unit, [[111th Indian Infantry Brigade]] was being formed.<ref name=Masters135>Masters 2002, p. 135.</ref> Popularly known as ''The Leopards'',<ref name=Masters135/> the brigade was raised by General Wavell without the knowledge of Wingate, who was still in Burma and who was known to have a strong dislike for the Indian Army, its diverse troop formations, and its British officers in particular. Wavell personally selected the commander of 111th Brigade, Brigadier [[Walter David Alexander Lentaigne|Joe Lentaigne]].<ref name=Masters135/>\n\nWavell intended to use two Chindit brigades alternately during 1944. While one brigade was operating behind Japanese lines for two to three months at a time, the other would be resting in India, while training for and planning the next operation. However, Wingate returned from Quebec with authority to implement far more ambitious plans for the second expedition, which required that the force be greatly expanded to a strength of six brigades. Wingate refused to use [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] formations in this force, because he maintained that their training in long-range penetration techniques would take longer and their maintenance by air would be difficult due to the varied dietary requirements of different Gurkha and Indian [[caste]]s and religions,<ref>Callahan 1978, p. 101.</ref> although he had little choice but to accept 111th Brigade, and two Gurkha battalions in 77th brigade. Since large numbers of trained British infantry were required, three brigades (the [[British 14th Infantry Brigade|14th]], [[British 16th Infantry Brigade|16th]] and [[British 23rd Infantry Brigade|23rd]]) were added to the Chindits by breaking up the experienced [[British 70th Infantry Division]], much against the wishes of Lieutenant General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] and other commanders, who wished to use the division in a conventional role.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chindits.wordpress.com/2011/04/16/the-chindits-1944/|title=In 1944 \u2013 The Second & Last Expedition|publisher=Hermes' wings|accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref> A sixth brigade was added to the force by taking a brigade (the 3rd (West African) Infantry Brigade) from the [[British 81st (West Africa) Division]].<ref>Rooney 1992, pp. 112 & 116.</ref>\n\nAt Quebec, Wingate had also succeeded in obtaining a \"private\" air force for the Chindits, the [[1st Air Commando Group]], mainly consisting of [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] aircraft. The Chindits were greatly encouraged by having aircraft on which they could call immediately for supply drops, casualty evacuation and air support. Other welcome American aid was the [[K-ration|\"K\" Ration]] pack which, although it provided insufficient calories for prolonged active operations, was far better than the equivalent British or Indian ration pack.<ref>Masters (1961), p.139</ref>\n\nThe forces for the second Chindit operation were called ''Special Force'', officially '''3rd Indian Infantry Division''', or ''Long Range Penetration Groups'',<ref>Rooney 1992, pp. 110 & 115.</ref> but the nickname, the Chindits, had already stuck.\n\nThe new Chindit force commenced training in [[Gwalior]]. Men were trained in crossing rivers, [[demolitions]] and [[bivouacking]]. Calvert and Fergusson, both newly promoted to Brigadier, took command of two of the brigades, and were responsible for much of the training program and the development of tactical planning.{{Cn|date=December 2019}} Wingate himself was absent for much of the training period, first being out of the country to attend the Quebec Conference and then struck ill with typhoid from drinking bad water in North Africa on his return.<ref>Rooney 1992, pp. 116\u2013117.</ref>\n\n===Plans===\nThe plans for the second Chindit operation went through many revisions.\n\nThe methods of the new Long Range Penetration force in 1944 differed from those of 1943. Wingate had decided on a strategy of creating fortified bases behind the Japanese lines, which would then send out raiding columns over short distances. This change was in part forced on him by strengthened Japanese patrols along the Burmese frontier, making a repeat of the successful infiltration in 1943 unlikely.<ref>Slim 1956, p. 219.</ref> In an imaginative move prompted by Colonel [[Philip Cochran]]'s assurance that he could transport both troops and supplies by glider,<ref>[http://www.specialoperations.net/ColCochran.htm Alison, John (Maj. Gen.), ''Phil Cochran, The Most Unforgettable Character I've Met'']</ref> Wingate arranged for the bulk of the force to enter Burma by air, greatly accelerating the force's ability to reach its target objectives.<ref>Masters 2002, p. 172.</ref> Advance units would land in gliders in preselected open fields in Burma, and prepare them for large-scale landings by transport aircraft. The lavish air support provided by Colonels Cochran and [[John R. Alison|Alison]] of the 1st Air Commando Group proved critical to the success of the operation.<ref>Masters 2002, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref>\n\nWingate also had plans for a general uprising of the [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] population of Northern Burma. He fought over these plans with the leadership of [[Force 136]] (an organisation set up to liaise with resistance forces in Japanese-occupied countries), which was concerned that a premature uprising of the Kachins without a permanent British military presence would lead to their slaughter by the Japanese at the end of operations. Force 136 also had their own plans for a rising to be coordinated with the arrival of the regular army in Burma. Wingate was eventually convinced to scale back his original plans.{{efn|See British National Archives HS1/2 - Most Secret & personal from head of SOE India to 'P' Division SEAC & GHQ India March 10, 1944 - Military Operations in the Dilwyn Area B/B.100 to head of SOE India March 11, 1944. For the Chindit side see the Operational Report of Dah Force (Imperial War Museum)}} Further complicating relations between the organisations were orders issued by Wingate to the commander of Dah Force (a British-led force of Kachin irregulars attached to the Chindits) not to coordinate operations with Force 136 for security reasons.{{sfn|Captain Herring|p=1}}\n\nDuring the last months of 1943, planning was conducted to carry out the strategy for India as originally determined at the Quebec Conference. In November, the overall plan for the dry season campaign of 1944 determined by [[South East Asia Command]] focused on the use of the Chindits in the reconquest of northern Burma. These plans were approved by the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] and although other offensives in Burma were scaled back or cancelled, Stilwell's Northern Front offensive with the Chindits' participation survived the cuts.{{efn|The [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo Conference]] changed some of the original plans, but did not affect the plans to use the Chindits to interdict the Japanese 18th Division's supply lines (Slim 1956, p. 214).}} The uncertainty of the plans nevertheless meant that the plans and contingency plans for the use of the Chindits repeatedly changed up to the very start of operations.<ref name=\"plans\">Planning of Operation Thursday\n* Prasad, Bhargava & Khera 1958, pp. 318\u2013320.(?)\n* Slim 1956, p. 204.</ref>\n\nThe Chindits were assigned the task of helping the forces of [[Joseph Stilwell]] push the [[Ledo Road]] through northern Burma to link up with the [[Burma Road]] and re-establish an overland supply route to China, by mounting a long range penetration operation behind the Japanese opposing his forces on the Northern Front. It had originally been intended that the IV Corps would attack on the Central Front and cross the Chindwin to tie up Japanese forces which could otherwise be used to aid the Northern Front. As the Japanese launched their own attack on the Central Front, this advance did not meet its objectives, but it still meant that most Japanese forces were engaged on the Central Front and were not available to reinforce the Japanese 18th Division on the Northern Front. The Japanese offensive on the Central Front resulted in further proposals and refinements of the plans for the Chindits.<ref name=\"plans\"/>\n\nOn 4 February 1944, Lieutenant General Slim, commander of the [[British Fourteenth Army]], and USAAF General [[George E. Stratemeyer]], commander of Eastern Air Command, issued a joint directive to General Wingate and Cols. Cochran and Alison of the 1st Air Commando Group, to march and fly into [[Indaw]] and from there under the command of the Fourteenth Army carry out the objectives of:\n\n<blockquote>(i) Helping the advance of Stilwell's Ledo force on [[Myitkyina]] by cutting the communications of the Japanese 18th Division, harassing its rear, and preventing its reinforcement.<br>(ii) Creating a favourable situation for the [[Yunnan]] Chinese forces to cross the [[Salween River|Salween]] and enter Burma.<br>(iii) Inflicting the greatest possible damage and confusion on the enemy in North Burma.<ref>Slim 1956, p. 259.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Operation Thursday==<!-- This section is linked from [[Invasion]] -->\n[[Image:West African Chindits, Operation Thursday.jpg|thumb|325px|Troops of the [[Nigeria Regiment]], 3rd West African Brigade (Thunder), board an RAF [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]]]]\nOn 5 February 1944, Fergusson's 16th Brigade left [[Ledo, Assam|Ledo]] for Burma. They avoided Japanese forces by traversing exceptionally difficult terrain. The rest of the Brigades were brought in by air to create fortified bases with airstrips.\n\nThree landing zones, codenamed ''Piccadilly'', ''Broadway'' and ''Chowringhee'', were selected. Calvert's 77th Brigade prepared to fly by [[Waco CG-4|Hadrian]] glider into ''Piccadilly'' on the night of 5 March. A last-minute aerial reconnaissance revealed ''Piccadilly'' to be covered with logs, making landing impossible. In some accounts of the incident, Wingate insisted that the operation had been betrayed and that the other landing zones would be ambushed. To proceed would be \"murder\". Slim accepted the responsibility of ordering a willing Calvert to proceed with the operation, using ''Broadway'' instead.<ref>Slim 1956, pp.257\u2013259.</ref> While ''Piccadilly'' had already been used to evacuate casualties during the first Chindit operation in 1943, ''Broadway'' had to be selected from the results of aerial reconnaissance. It turned out to be a poor landing ground and there were many casualties in crash landings, but Calvert's men were just able to make the strip fit to take transport aircraft the next day. Chindit gliders also landed on ''Chowringhee'' the next day, without opposition.\n\nIt was later revealed that the logs on ''Piccadilly'' had been placed there to dry by Burmese teak loggers. The real problem was the failure to maintain continuous observation of the landing zones (e.g. by high-flying [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] photo-reconnaissance aircraft) before the forces were deployed.\n\nOver the next week, 600 sorties by [[C-47 Skytrain|Dakota]] transport aircraft transferred 9,000 men to the landing zones. ''Chowringhee'' was abandoned once the fly-in was completed, but ''Broadway'' was held with a garrison which included field artillery, anti-aircraft guns and even Spitfire fighters for a brief period. Fergusson's brigade set up another base named ''Aberdeen'' north of [[Indaw]], into which 14th Brigade was flown. Calvert's brigade established yet another, named ''White City'' at [[Mawlu]], astride the main railway and road leading to the Japanese northern front. 111 Brigade set up ambushes and roadblocks south of Indaw (although part of the brigade which landed at ''Chowringhee'' was delayed in crossing the Irrawaddy River), before moving west to [[Pinlebu]].\n\nFerocious jungle fighting ensued around ''Broadway'' and ''White City''. At times, British and Japanese troops were in close combat, [[bayonet]]s and [[kukri]]s against [[katana]]s. On 27 March, after days of aircraft attack, the Japanese attacked ''Broadway'' for several nights before the attack was repulsed with flown-in artillery and the aid of locally recruited [[Jingpo people|Kachin]] irregulars.\n\nHowever, a setback occurred when Fergusson's brigade tried to capture [[Indaw]] on 24 March. The original intention had been to seize the town and its airfields on 15 March but Fergusson had to report that this was impossible. Wingate appeared ready to change the brigade's mission but on 20 March, he reinstated Indaw as the target.{{efn|Shelford Bidwell speculates that Wingate had revived at short notice a plan codenamed '''Operation Tarzan''', by which the [[Indian 26th Infantry Division]] would fly into the captured airfields, even though this division was already heavily engaged in the Arakan (Bidwell 1979, p. 138).}} The brigade was already exhausted from its long march, and there was no time to properly reconnoitre the objective. The units were dismayed to find that the Japanese controlled the only water sources. Fergusson expected that 14th Brigade would cooperate in the attack, but they moved west instead. Japanese reinforcements had also moved into Indaw, which was a major road and rail centre. Fergusson's battalions, attacking separately, were each repulsed. After this, most of the tired 16th Brigade were flown out.\n\n===Change of command===\nOn 24 March, Wingate flew to [[Imphal]] to confer with air force commanders. On the return journey, the USAAF [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25]] bomber in which he was flying is believed to have flown into a thunderstorm and crashed in the jungle-covered mountains. All aboard were killed.\n\nSlim, the commander of the [[British Fourteenth Army]] which had loose operational control over Special Force, selected Brigadier Lentaigne to be Wingate's replacement after conferring with Brigadier Derek Tulloch, Wingate's Chief of Staff. Lentaigne was judged to be the most balanced and experienced commander in the force; he had been an instructor at the Staff College at [[Quetta]], had led a Gurkha battalion with distinction during the gruelling retreat from Burma in 1942 and had commanded a Chindit brigade in the field (albeit for only a few weeks, but none of the other brigade commanders had more experience). As an officer of Gurkha troops, he had a similar outlook and background to Slim. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities, mostly without staff qualifications, some of whom had never even commanded a battalion-sized unit in combat before 1944, and Wingate's staff officers lacked the necessary combat experience.<ref>Allen 1984, pp.348\u2013351; summary from {{harvnb|Tulloch|1972|p={{page needed|date=August 2016}}}}.</ref> The force's second-in-command, Major General [[George William Symes]], was bypassed by Slim and formally protested and asked to be relieved.<ref>Allen 1984, pp. 350\u2013351.</ref> In selecting Lentaigne, Slim did not take into account the tensions between those Chindit commanders and staff who were closely associated with Wingate, and Lentaigne, who had a classical \"line\" officer's background and had been critical of Wingate's methods and techniques.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 122.</ref>\n\nIt is probably fair to say that nobody could have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they knew exactly what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.\n\n===The move north===\nSeveral major changes were made at the highest level. Much of the air support was diverted to the critical battles of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]], where troops were cut off and could only be resupplied by air. 23rd Brigade, yet to fly in, was also despatched to [[Kohima]]. Those Chindits already operating in Burma were formally subordinated to General Joseph Stilwell, who ordered the Chindits to abandon their dispersed operations around Indaw, and concentrate on interdicting the supply lines to the Japanese forces opposing his [[Northern Combat Area Command]].\n\nIn April, Lentaigne ordered the main body of 111 Brigade west of the Irrawaddy, now commanded by [[John Masters]], to move north and build a new stronghold, codenamed ''Blackpool'', which would block the railway and main road at [[Hopin]], {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of [[Mogaung]]. Calvert was ordered to abandon ''White City'' and ''Broadway'' and move north to support Masters. Calvert was opposed to this, as his brigade had successfully held these two strongholds for months. Stilwell also feared that abandoning ''White City'' would allow Japanese reinforcements to move north. However, Lentaigne insisted that the Chindit brigades were too far apart to support each other, and that it would be difficult to use aircraft at ''White City'' and ''Broadway'' during the [[monsoon]].<ref>Allen 1984, p. 355.</ref>\n\nMasters's force established ''Blackpool'' on 8 May and were almost immediately engaged in fierce fighting. Whereas ''White City'' had been deep in the Japanese rear, its defenders had had plenty of time to prepare their defences and its attackers had been a mixed bag of detachments from several formations, ''Blackpool'' was close to the Japanese northern front, and was immediately attacked by Japanese troops with heavy artillery support. As Calvert and Stilwell had feared, abandoning ''White City'' had allowed the [[53rd Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Japanese 53rd Division]] to move north from Indaw. A heavy attack against ''Blackpool'' was repulsed on 17 May, but a second attack on 24 May captured vital positions inside the defences.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 360.</ref>\n\nBecause the monsoon had broken and heavy rain made movement in the jungle very difficult, neither Calvert nor Brodie's [[British 14th Infantry Brigade|14th Brigade]] could help Masters. Finally, Masters had to abandon ''Blackpool'' on 25 May, because the men were exhausted after 17 days of continual combat. Nineteen Allied soldiers, who were so badly injured as to be beyond hope of recovery and could not be moved, were shot by the medical orderlies and hidden in heavy stands of bamboo.<ref>{{harvnb|Cloonan|1999|p=52}} cites Masters, ''The Road Past Mandalay'', pp. 277\u2013278.<!--This needs to be replaced with a direct cite from Masters--></ref>\n\n===Final operations===\nOn 17 May, Slim had formally handed control of the Chindits to Stilwell. Stilwell insisted that the Chindits capture several well-defended Japanese positions. The Chindits had no support from tanks or artillery and this led to heavier casualties than before. According to David Rooney, the Chindits were misused under Stillwell's command and suffered heavy casualties undertaking roles that they were not trained or equipped for.<ref>Rooney 1992, p. 137.</ref>\n\nOver the period from 6 June to 27 June, Calvert's 77th Brigade took [[Mogaung]] and suffered 800 casualties \u2013 50% of the brigade's men involved in the operation. Fearing that they would then be ordered to join the [[siege of Myitkyina]], Calvert handed Mogaung over to [[Chinese Army in India|Force X]], shut down his radios and retreated to [[Kamaing]], where Stilwell had his headquarters. A court-martial was likely until Stilwell and Calvert met in person, and Stilwell finally appreciated the conditions under which the Chindits had been operating.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 375.</ref>\n\n111 Brigade, after resting, was ordered to capture a hill known as Point 2171. It did so, but was now utterly exhausted. Most of the men were suffering from [[malaria]], [[dysentery]] and [[malnutrition]]. On 8 July, at the insistence of the Supreme Commander, Admiral [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Louis Mountbatten]], doctors examined the brigade. Of the 2,200 men present from four and a half battalions, only 119 were declared fit. The brigade was evacuated, although Masters sarcastically kept the fit men, \"111 Company\", in the field until 1 August.\n\nThe portion of 111 Brigade east of the Irrawaddy were known as ''Morris Force'', after its commander, Lieutenant-Colonel J.R. \"Jumbo\" Morris. They had spent several months harassing Japanese traffic from [[Bhamo]] to Myitkyina. They had then attempted to complete the encirclement of Myitkyina. Stilwell was angered that they were unable to do so, but Slim pointed out that Stilwell's Chinese troops (numbering 5,500) had also failed in that task. By 14 July, Morris Force was down to three platoons.<ref>Allen 1984, p. 362.</ref> A week later, they only had 25 men fit for duty. Morris Force was evacuated about the same time as 77th Brigade.\n\n14th Brigade and 3rd West African Brigade remained in action, assisting the newly arrived [[British 36th Infantry Division]] in its advance down the \"Railway Valley\" south of Mogaung. Finally, they were relieved and withdrawn, starting on 17 August. The last Chindit left Burma on 27 August 1944.\n\n===Kohima===\n{{Main|Battle of Kohima}}\n23rd Brigade, which had been diverted from the main Chindit campaign, nevertheless acted as a long range penetration unit behind the Japanese fighting at Kohima. From April to June 1944, they marched long distances through the Naga hills, mostly in monsoon weather which made movement very difficult. They contributed in large measure to the starvation of the Japanese at Kohima, the decisive factor in that battle. Although not engaged in major battles, they accounted for large numbers of Japanese stragglers and foragers, suffering 158 battle casualties themselves.\n\n==The end==\nThe Chindits had suffered heavy casualties: 1,396 killed and 2,434 wounded. Over half had to be confined to hospital and prescribed a special nutritional diet whilst hospitalised. As bad as the casualty figures may seem, those suffered by the force in 1943 were proportionally much higher.\n\nThe healthy men were sent to training camps to await new operations. However, when the army command evaluated the men and equipment required to return the Chindits to operational status, it was decided to transform the force into an Airborne Division in India. Beyond direct replacements, it was known that the British element of the Chindits would be decimated in 1945 by the need to repatriate personnel who had served more than four years overseas.\n\nDuring the early months of 1945, several of the brigade headquarters and many of the veterans of the Chindit operations were reformed into the 14th and 77th Infantry Brigades and merged into the [[44th Airborne Division (India)]], while the force headquarters and signals units formed the core of the [[XXXIV Corps (India)|Indian XXXIV Corps]]. The Chindits were finally disbanded in February 1945.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 22.</ref>\n\n==London memorial==\n[[File:Chindit memorial London.jpg|thumb|Badge of the Chindits on their memorial outside the Ministry of Defence building in London]]\nThere is a memorial to Orde Wingate and the Chindits on the north side of the [[Victoria Embankment]] next to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] headquarters in [[London]]. The memorial was unveiled on 16 October 1990 by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The front of the monument is in memory of the Chindits and also mentions the four men of the Chindits awarded the [[Victoria Cross]]: Major [[Frank Gerald Blaker]], Captain [[Michael Allmand]] and Lieutenant [[George Albert Cairns]] and Rifleman [[Tulbahadur Pun]]. The battalions that took part are listed on the sides of the monument. Non-infantry units are mentioned by their parent formations only. No distinction is made between those units that took part in 1943 versus those of 1944. The rear of the monument is exclusively dedicated to Orde Wingate and also mentions his contributions to the state of Israel.<ref>[http://www.chindits.info/Memorial/Main.html Chindit Memorial, London]</ref>\n\nThe memorial is a 4 metres (13&nbsp;ft) high [[Portland stone]] pillar mounted on three steps, on which is a statue by Frank Forster of the [[chinthe]], after which the Chindits are named.\n\n==Military legacy==\nMilitary historians disagree on the Chindits' military significance. The debate is part of the ongoing one of whether the deployment of special forces are a net asset to a campaign or whether the investment in time, materiel and men that such operations demand outweigh the advantages gained. For example, it is questioned whether the interdiction of Japanese supply lines during Operation Thursday by the Chindits contributed more to Stilwell's advance than if the resources committed to the operation had been used to provide Stilwell with another regular division to fight alongside his [[X Force]].\n\nThe views of the majority of the post-war British military establishment were made succinctly by Slim (commander of the Fourteenth Army), when he wrote \"... the Chindits, gave a splendid example of courage and hardihood. Yet I came firmly to the conclusion that such formations, trained, equipped and mentally adjusted for one kind of operation were wasteful. They did not give, militarily, a worth-while return for the resources in men, materiel and time that they absorbed. ... [Special forces] were usually formed by attracting the best men ... The result of these methods was undoubtedly to lower the quality of the rest of the Army\".<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\">Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.</ref> He makes several other arguments against special forces, about the danger of ordinary battalions thinking that some tasks could only be performed by special forces, and that special forces can only stay in the field for relatively short periods compared to regular battalions. He sums up that \"Anything, whatever the short cuts to victory it may promise, which thus weakens the Army spirit is dangerous\".<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\"/>  To underline his point he suggests that \"This cult of special forces is as sensible as to form a Royal Corps of Tree Climbers and say that no soldier, who does not wear its green hat with a bunch of oak leaves stuck in it should be expected to climb a tree\".<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\"/>  He does acknowledge the need for small units to stir up trouble in the enemy's rear area but does not make it clear if he is talking about [[V Force]] or the actions of [[Force 136]].<ref name=\"Slim 1956, pp. 546\u2013549.\"/>\n\nOthers, like Sir [[Robert Grainger Ker Thompson|Robert Thompson]], himself an ex-Chindit, have asserted that the idea behind the Chindits was a sound one, but that they were just badly handled and used in operations for which they were not properly equipped or trained, for example in static defence.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} A third view is that, despite the relatively insignificant losses that the Chindits were able to inflict, their [[propaganda]] value in 1943, at a time when the Army was on the defensive, was a morale boost to the people of India and Britain, and helping to dispel the image of Japanese invincibility.<ref>Brayley 2002, p. 19\u201320.</ref> It has been hard to reach a consensus on any of these issues due to the partisan nature of the discussions surrounding Wingate himself.\n\nIt has also been argued that the Chindits contributed to the overall success of the Allied armies in Burma through the innovations in air supply techniques and organisation that their operations required.<ref name=Brayley20>Brayley 2002, p. 20.</ref> The Allied air forces were later to use these tactics to supply increasingly large forces that were cut off by the enemy, or were operating independently of road or rail lines of communication. Conversely, it has been argued that the apparent success of the Chindits led some Japanese commanders to believe that they could employ their own incursion tactics on a much larger scale, and that when they came to implement such tactics during the Chindwin offensive of early 1944, lacking the necessary air support that had enabled the Allies to be successful, the result was disastrous and ultimately led to defeat at both Kohima and Imphal, and later on the plains of Burma in 1945.<ref name=Brayley20/>\n\nThree of the Brigade commanders on ''Operation Thursday'' (two of whom had also served in the first Chindit expedition) subsequently wrote autobiographies, which contained their comments on the Chindits' concept and practice of operations. [[Bernard Fergusson, Baron Ballantrae|Bernard Fergusson]], originally an enthusiastic supporter of Wingate, later came to feel that Wingate lacked both consistency and flexibility in his plans, which contributed to Fergusson's long, pointless march from Ledo and his defeat at Indaw. [[John Masters]], who was a close friend and supporter of Lentaigne, felt that the Chindits' mobility was sacrificed in holding fixed defensive positions or attacking strong Japanese positions, without the necessary support. In criticism of the whole Chindit concept, he pointed out that the Chindit force had the infantry strength of two and a half line divisions, but, without supporting arms, it had the fighting strength of less than one. Michael Calvert, who was closest to Wingate, remained an absolute unquestioning defender of Wingate and his methods.\n\nThe British Army's [[77th Brigade (United Kingdom)|77th Brigade]], raised in 2015 to engage in upstream prevention for the army, was named in tribute to the Chindits.<ref name=GuardJan15>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/31/british-army-facebook-warriors-77th-brigade|title=British army creates team of Facebook warriors|author=Ewan MacAskill|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 January 2015|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Denis Edward Arnold]] MC\n* [[Roland Degg]]\n* [[Order of Battle of the Chindits]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The longest War 1941-45 |publisher=J.M.
