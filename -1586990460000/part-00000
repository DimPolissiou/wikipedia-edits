The press ombudsman ruled that Huffington Post's bungle was a \"serious breach\" of the press code.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://presscouncil.org.za/Ruling/View/afriforum-vs-huffington-post-sa-4205|title=AfriForum vs. Huffington Post SA|publisher=Press Council|access-date=2019-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306111524/https://presscouncil.org.za/Ruling/View/afriforum-vs-huffington-post-sa-4205|archive-date=2019-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Tumi Morake: A Victim Of South Africa's 'Bell Pottinger' |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/pieter-du-toit/tumi-morake-a-victim-of-south-africas-bell-pottinger_a_23207253/ |website=HuffPost South Africa |language=en |date=13 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nIn October 2010, with regard to AfriForum's response to [[Absa Group Limited|Absa Bank]] softening stance on quotas in rugby, Ferial Haffajee wrote in a column in City Press thaty \"while AfriForum is an excellent lobby group with a sense of strategy and tactics, it should be careful that its radical tactics do not dissemble into racist special pleading \u2013 a deeply conservative impulse\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/Columnists/Laager-mentality-is-a-load-of-bull-20101002/ |title=Laager mentality is a load of bull |work=News24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119232400/http://www.citypress.co.za/Columnists/Laager-mentality-is-a-load-of-bull-20101002 |archivedate=2012-11-19 }}</ref>.\n\nIn a column in July 2012, University of Cape Town Professor Pierre de Vos criticised Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande's \"blistering attack against the liberal notion of civil society\", and stated that the appropriate way to \"engage with organisations [such as Afriforum] is not to mutter darkly about how they are trying to take over the country by having the cheek to promote their own ideas\" but to \"criticise their ideas and the actions they take and provide arguments for why one\u2019s own ideas are better\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://constitutionallyspeaking.co.za/how-not-to-engage-in-a-battle-of-ideas/|title=How not to engage in a battle of ideas|work=constitutionallyspeaking.co.za}}</ref>\n\nThe organisation has been criticized by the ruling ANC but also by many media outlets and academics. \n\nThe survivalist group Kommandokorps criticised Afriforum in February 2012, saying that Afriforum \"had not done much to prevent farm murders\".

Up until then, [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] in the [[Sydney]] CBD had been the main venue for racing within the city. The first race held at Randwick was a private event held in June 1833. The course was originally known as the 'Sandy Course' due to the condition of the ground. In 1840 racing ceased at the venue and was only used for training.\n\nIn the early 1840s, the Australian Jockey Club (AJC) was formed and in 1860 moved its headquarters to Randwick. In May of that year, racing resumed at the venue with a crowd of 6,000 people attending.\n\nIn 1863 the land was officially granted to the AJC and was held until 2011 when the AJC and the Sydney Turf Club (STC) merged to become the [[Australian Turf Club]] (ATC). The ATC are the current operators of Royal Randwick Racecourse.<ref>''[http://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/archive/discover_collections/society_art/races/randwick/ Royal Randwick Racecourse]'' - Archive from the State Library of New South Wales</ref>\n\n[[File:Randwick Racecourse Sydney N.S.W.

On this date, upon request, the Queen granted permission for the venue to be known as Royal Randwick. From this date the venue was officially able to be referred to as 'Royal Randwick'.

Up until then, [[Hyde Park, Sydney|Hyde Park]] in the [[Sydney]] CBD had been the main venue for racing within the city. The first race held at Randwick was a private event held in June 1833. The course was originally known as the 'Sandy Course' due to the condition of the ground. In 1840 racing ceased at the venue and was only used for training.\n\nIn the early 1840s, the Australian Jockey Club (AJC) was formed and in 1860 moved its headquarters to Randwick. In May of that year, racing resumed at the venue with a crowd of 6,000 people attending.\n\nIn 1863 the land was officially granted to the AJC and was held until 2011 when the AJC and the Sydney Turf Club (STC) merged to become the [[Australian Turf Club]] (ATC). The ATC are the current operators of Royal Randwick Racecourse.<ref>''[http://www2.sl.nsw.gov.au/archive/discover_collections/society_art/races/randwick/ Royal Randwick Racecourse]'' - Archive from the State Library of New South Wales</ref>\n\n[[File:Randwick Racecourse Sydney N.S.W.

On this date, upon request, the Queen granted permission for the venue to be known as Royal Randwick. From this date the venue was officially able to be referred to as 'Royal Randwick'. An extract from a letter from [[Kenneth Scott (courtier)|Kenneth Scott]], Deputy Private Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II, to the club reads: \"You do not need me to tell you how much The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh enjoyed their visit to the Royal Randwick Racecourse today.

NASA's IV&V Program was founded under the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/ NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)] as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the [https://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster].\n\nSince then, NASA's IV&V Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&V efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, [[Independent Verification and Validation]] (IV&V) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&V. NASA's IV&V Program's primary business, software IV&V, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&V is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report).\n\nNASA's IV&V Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition.\n\nOn February 22, 2019, the facility was renamed to the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility in honor of [[Katherine Johnson]], an African-American woman who worked as a mathematician at NASA for 35 years and who is featured in the film ''[[Hidden Figures]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Gina |title=NASA Honors 'Hidden Figure' Katherine Johnson |url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/the-scene/NASA-Renames-Facility-to-Honor-Hidden-Figure-Katherine-Johnson-506249461.html |website=NBC4 Washington |accessdate=25 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Affiliations ==\nNASA's IV&V Program is affiliated with [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the Educator Resource Center (ERC), funded through a partnership with Fairmont State University, is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities.\n\n== Projects ==\nNASA's IV&V Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&V, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&V efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&V Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&V on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure.\n\n=== Independent Technical Assessments of NASA Systems ===\nNASA's IV&V Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality.\n\n=== Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) ===\nSimulation-to-Flight 1 ([[STF-1]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Simulation To Flight 1 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/jstar/stf1.html |website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |publisher=NASA |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> is [[West Virginia]]\u2019s first [[CubeSat]], or small satellite. It was built under [[NASA]]\u2019s CubeSat Launch Initiative, where potential launch opportunities are provided to select CubeSat proposals from NASA Centers, accredited US educational or non-profit organizations. NASA's main goal in this initiative is to provide CubeSat developers access to a low-cost pathway to conduct research in the areas of science, exploration, technology development, education or operations. [[JSTAR]]\u2019s main goal in this mission is to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the NASA Operational Simulation (NOS) technologies, most notably its development of the NASA Operational Simulation for Small Satellites, or [http://www.stf1.com/NOS3Website/Nos3MainTab.html NOS3].\nJSTAR had a huge outreach opportunity with [[West Virginia University]] through the support of NASA IV&V and West Virginia Space Grants Consortium (WVSGC). By being partnered with JSTAR engineers and scientists, WVU Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics departments got to learn first-hand the rewards and challenges involved in working in any [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] career such as with NASA. More specifically, WVU provided their experimental ideas and worked alongside the JSTAR team to incorporate their scientific instruments into STF-1.\nAlong with offering their professional project management, JSTAR has supported WVU in their scientific development and research. By offering their software resources to this CubeSat, STF-1 has the capability of recording data once it is launched into orbit around Earth\u2014data that can be sent directly to WVU for STEM research and the education of future scientists.\nWhile community outreach is a huge component of this mission, major benefits for NASA and JSTAR have come of it as well.\n\nIn the development of these NASA Operational Simulation technologies and their demonstrations in the STF-1 mission, the IV&V tool-set has been matured to better support current and future NASA missions.\nFor example, these NOS technologies, among them NOS3, have demonstrated significant value in several areas such as: the James Webb Space Telescope, Global Precipitation Measurement, Juno, and Deep Space Climate Observatory in the areas of software development, mission operations/training, verification and validation, test procedure development, and software systems check-out.\n\nSTF-1 launched into [[Low Earth orbit]] on a [[Rocket Lab]] [[Electron]] rocket on December 16, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Sends CubeSats to Space on First Dedicated Launch with US Partner Rocket Lab |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-sends-cubesats-to-space-on-first-dedicated-launch-with-us-partner-rocket-lab |website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |publisher=NASA |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> As of now, STF-1 is orbiting earth in LEO and operating nominally.\n[[File:STF-1 CubeSat.jpg|thumb|none|The fully assembled STF-1 CubeSat.]]\n\n== Educator Resource Center ==\nThanks to a grant with [[Fairmont State University]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114223/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/erc_index.html Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center] (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state.

NASA's IV&V Program was founded under the [http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/ NASA Office of Safety and Mission Assurance (OSMA)] as a direct result of recommendations made by the National Research Council (NRC) and the Report of the Presidential Commission on the [https://history.nasa.gov/sts51l.html Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' disaster].\n\nSince then, NASA's IV&V Program has experienced growth in personnel, projects, capabilities, and accomplishments. NASA IV&V efforts have contributed to NASA's improved safety record since the program's inception. Today, [[Independent Verification and Validation]] (IV&V) is an Agency-level function, delegated from OSMA to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and managed by NASA IV&V. NASA's IV&V Program's primary business, software IV&V, is sponsored by OSMA as a software assurance technology. Having been reassigned as GSFC, NASA IV&V is Code 180 (Center Director's direct report).\n\nNASA's IV&V Program houses approximately 270 employees and leverages the expertise of in-house partners and contractors. Its facilities are located in [[Fairmont, West Virginia]]. In the summer, high school and college interns are employed in addition.\n\nOn February 22, 2019, the facility was renamed to the Katherine Johnson Independent Verification and Validation Facility in honor of [[Katherine Johnson]], an African-American woman who worked as a mathematician at NASA for 35 years and who is featured in the film ''[[Hidden Figures]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cook |first1=Gina |title=NASA Honors 'Hidden Figure' Katherine Johnson |url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/the-scene/NASA-Renames-Facility-to-Honor-Hidden-Figure-Katherine-Johnson-506249461.html |website=NBC4 Washington |accessdate=25 February 2019 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Affiliations ==\nNASA's IV&V Program is affiliated with [[NASA Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the Educator Resource Center (ERC), funded through a partnership with Fairmont State University, is part of a nationwide network of training sites at NASA centers and facilities.\n\n== Projects ==\nNASA's IV&V Program is the lead NASA organization for system software IV&V, and is responsible for the management of all system software IV&V efforts within the Agency. NASA's IV&V Program's role is to provide value-added service to the Agency's system software projects, primarily by appropriately performing IV&V on system software based on the cost, size, complexity, life span, risk, and consequences of failure.\n\n=== Independent Technical Assessments of NASA Systems ===\nNASA's IV&V Program also provides independent technical assessments of NASA systems and software processes/products to identify developmental and operational risks. This effort helps to provide assurance that safe and reliable software is being provided to NASA missions and projects as they work toward successful systems and software development. Independent assessments can address any aspect of software engineering and can be applied within any SDLC phase. This capability provides for multiple spot-checking throughout the SDLC and addresses those issues that can jeopardize mission safety and quality.\n\n=== Simulation-to-Flight 1 (STF-1) ===\nSimulation-to-Flight 1 ([[STF-1]])<ref>{{cite web |title=Simulation To Flight 1 |url=https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/jstar/stf1.html |website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |publisher=NASA |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> is [[West Virginia]]\u2019s first [[CubeSat]], or small satellite. It was built under [[NASA]]\u2019s CubeSat Launch Initiative, where potential launch opportunities are provided to select CubeSat proposals from NASA Centers, accredited US educational or non-profit organizations. NASA's main goal in this initiative is to provide CubeSat developers access to a low-cost pathway to conduct research in the areas of science, exploration, technology development, education or operations. [[JSTAR]]\u2019s main goal in this mission is to fully demonstrate the capabilities of the NASA Operational Simulation (NOS) technologies, most notably its development of the NASA Operational Simulation for Small Satellites, or [http://www.stf1.com/NOS3Website/Nos3MainTab.html NOS3].\nJSTAR had a huge outreach opportunity with [[West Virginia University]] through the support of NASA IV&V and West Virginia Space Grants Consortium (WVSGC). By being partnered with JSTAR engineers and scientists, WVU Engineering, Computer Science, and Physics departments got to learn first-hand the rewards and challenges involved in working in any [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] career such as with NASA. More specifically, WVU provided their experimental ideas and worked alongside the JSTAR team to incorporate their scientific instruments into STF-1.\nAlong with offering their professional project management, JSTAR has supported WVU in their scientific development and research. By offering their software resources to this CubeSat, STF-1 has the capability of recording data once it is launched into orbit around Earth\u2014data that can be sent directly to WVU for STEM research and the education of future scientists.\nWhile community outreach is a huge component of this mission, major benefits for NASA and JSTAR have come of it as well.\n\nIn the development of these NASA Operational Simulation technologies and their demonstrations in the STF-1 mission, the IV&V tool-set has been matured to better support current and future NASA missions.\nFor example, these NOS technologies, among them NOS3, have demonstrated significant value in several areas such as: the James Webb Space Telescope, Global Precipitation Measurement, Juno, and Deep Space Climate Observatory in the areas of software development, mission operations/training, verification and validation, test procedure development, and software systems check-out.\n\nSTF-1 launched into [[Low Earth orbit]] on a [[Rocket Lab]] [[Electron]] rocket on December 16, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASA Sends CubeSats to Space on First Dedicated Launch with US Partner Rocket Lab |url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-sends-cubesats-to-space-on-first-dedicated-launch-with-us-partner-rocket-lab |website=National Aeronautics and Space Administration |publisher=NASA |accessdate=24 March 2019}}</ref> As of now, STF-1 is orbiting earth in LEO and operating nominally.\n[[File:STF-1 CubeSat.jpg|thumb|none|The fully assembled STF-1 CubeSat.]]\n\n== Educator Resource Center ==\nThanks to a grant with [[Fairmont State University]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120612114223/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ivv/education/erc_index.html Independent Verification and Validation Program Educator Resource Center] (ERC) provides resources and training opportunities for approximately 1,000 in-service, pre-service, and informal educators and in West Virginia annually. The materials and training cover a wide range of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics. The ERC also loans hands-on STEM kits to trained teachers which impact over 10,000 students per year in the state.

She was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her first film role in 1983's ''[[Tender Mercies]]'', and for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the 1986 film ''[[Crimes of the Heart (film)|Crimes of the Heart]]''. Her other film appearances include ''[[Flashpoint (1984 film)|Flashpoint]]'' (1984), ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' (1987), ''[[Far North (1988 film)|Far North]]'' (1988), and ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007). She also had a recurring role on the first three seasons of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' (2008\u20132010).\n\n==Early life==\nHarper was born on August 15, 1950, in [[Mammoth Spring, Arkansas]], the daughter of Rosemary (''n\u00e9e'' Langston) and Ed Washam. Most members of her family were quilt makers. On her own time she liked to sit on the porch swing and read. She graduated from high school in 1968. She attended [[Arkansas State University-Beebe]], where she performed in several plays, as well as Southwest Missouri State University (now [[Missouri State University]]) in [[Springfield, Missouri]], where she graduated with a degree in education.\n\n==Career==\nHarper began acting in theater productions, theme parks (including Dogpatch, USA and [[Silver Dollar City]]), [[dinner theatre]], and children's theatre. She had given up hopes of an acting career and was working for a financial institution in [[Texas]]. The institution wanted to produce a TV spot and asked her to be in the spot, which she accepted. In a twist of fate, a casting person with ''[[Tender Mercies]]'' had to spend the night in [[Dallas]] and saw Harper's spot on TV. She called [[Robert Duvall]] and arranged an audition. Director [[Bruce Beresford]] was impressed with Harper and cast her in the lead female role of Rosa Lee, the young widow and mother who marries [[country music|country singer]] Mac Sledge. Beresford said that Harper brought a kind of rural quality to the role without coming across as simple or foolish. He said of Harper, \"She walked into the room and even before she spoke, I thought, 'That's the girl to play the lead.'\"<ref name=\"Miracles\">{{cite video |people= [[Bruce Beresford]] (actor), [[Robert Duvall]] (actor), Tess Harper (actor), Gary Hertz (director) |date= April 16, 2002 |title= Miracles & Mercies |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383509/ |medium= Documentary |publisher= [[Blue Underground]] |location= [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]] |accessdate= January 28, 2008}}</ref> Harper did not realize this, and recalled shortly after the film's release, \"After I did the final [[screen test]], I went to see ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' and started sobbing uncontrollably halfway through it.

She later said that she was so excited about the role that she bit her script just to make sure it was real, and she was so nervous that during her first take she feared the filmmakers would \"come to their senses and say, 'We're sorry, we made a terrible mistake.'\"<ref name=\"Miracles\" /> Duvall, who played the lead role of Mac Sledge, did his best to help Harper in her first film role. During one scene in which Mac Sledge and Rosa Lee were fighting, Duvall yelled at a [[make-up artist]] in front of Harper specifically to make her angry for the scene; Duvall apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot. After filming, Duvall said Harper did a very good job, and he felt her rural past in Arkansas helped her in the part.<ref name=\"Miracles\" /> She earned a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for the role. Duvall won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Actor for his performance.\n\nHarper appeared in the TV mini-series [[Chiefs (miniseries)|''Chiefs'']] (1983) and ''[[Celebrity (television series)|Celebrity]]'' (1984), as well as many [[television movie]]s including ''[[Starflight: The Plane That Couldn't Land]]'' (1983) and ''Reckless Disregard'' (1985). In 1983, she appeared in the full-length feature ''[[Silkwood]]''. In 1986, Harper was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her work as Chick Boyle in ''[[Crimes of the Heart (film)|Crimes of the Heart]]'', which was directed by her ''Tender Mercies'' director Bruce Beresford. She later played parts in ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' (1987), ''Far North'' (1988), ''[[The Man in the Moon]]'' (1991), ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]'' (1997) and ''[[Loggerheads (2005 film)|Loggerheads]]'' (2005). She also took part in [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] [[Black Or White]] (1991) musical minifilm.\n\nHarper had a regular role on the [[CBS]] series ''[[Christy (TV series)|Christy]]'', from 1994-95. Her roles have frequently been that of a Southern lady, although she had worked to lose her [[Arkansas]] accent. She also had a recurring role on another [[CBS]] [[Television program|television series]], ''[[Early Edition]]'', from 1996 to 2000. She portrayed the mother of lead character Gary Hobsen. Harper shared a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] (in the Best Ensemble Cast category) with her fellow cast members in the Oscar-winning film ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', in which she played the wife of [[Tommy Lee Jones|Tommy Lee Jones's]] character.\n\nShe had the recurring role of Mrs. Pinkman on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', appearing in the first three seasons.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

They're not gonna let me do this part!'\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first=  |title=Success, Stress and Tess Harper|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=June 9, 1983 |issue=397|page=40}}</ref>\n\n''Tender Mercies'' was Harper's feature film debut. She later said that she was so excited about the role that she bit her script just to make sure it was real, and she was so nervous that during her first take she feared the filmmakers would \"come to their senses and say, 'We're sorry, we made a terrible mistake.'\"<ref name=\"Miracles\" /> Duvall, who played the lead role of Mac Sledge, did his best to help Harper in her first film role. During one scene in which Mac Sledge and Rosa Lee were fighting, Duvall yelled at a [[make-up artist]] in front of Harper specifically to make her angry for the scene; Duvall apologized to the make-up artist after the scene was shot. After filming, Duvall said Harper did a very good job, and he felt her rural past in Arkansas helped her in the part.<ref name=\"Miracles\" /> She earned a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination for the role. Duvall won the [[Academy Award]] for Best Actor for his performance.\n\nHarper appeared in the TV mini-series [[Chiefs (miniseries)|''Chiefs'']] (1983) and ''[[Celebrity (television series)|Celebrity]]'' (1984), as well as many [[television movie]]s including ''[[Starflight: The Plane That Couldn't Land]]'' (1983) and ''Reckless Disregard'' (1985). In 1983, she appeared in the full-length feature ''[[Silkwood]]''. In 1986, Harper was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her work as Chick Boyle in ''[[Crimes of the Heart (film)|Crimes of the Heart]]'', which was directed by her ''Tender Mercies'' director Bruce Beresford. She later played parts in ''[[Ishtar (film)|Ishtar]]'' (1987), ''Far North'' (1988), ''[[The Man in the Moon]]'' (1991), ''[[The Jackal (1997 film)|The Jackal]]'' (1997) and ''[[Loggerheads (2005 film)|Loggerheads]]'' (2005). She also took part in [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] [[Black Or White]] (1991) musical minifilm.\n\nHarper had a regular role on the [[CBS]] series ''[[Christy (TV series)|Christy]]'', from 1994-95. Her roles have frequently been that of a Southern lady, although she had worked to lose her [[Arkansas]] accent. She also had a recurring role on another [[CBS]] [[Television program|television series]], ''[[Early Edition]]'', from 1996 to 2000. She portrayed the mother of lead character Gary Hobsen. Harper shared a [[Screen Actors Guild Awards|Screen Actors Guild Award]] (in the Best Ensemble Cast category) with her fellow cast members in the Oscar-winning film ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'', in which she played the wife of [[Tommy Lee Jones|Tommy Lee Jones's]] character.\n\nShe had the recurring role of Mrs. Pinkman on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', appearing in the first three seasons.\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
