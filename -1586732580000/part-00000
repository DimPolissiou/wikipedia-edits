She was the younger sister of [[Alexander III of Russia]] and the paternal aunt of Russia's last emperor, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].\n\nIn 1874 Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna married [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], the second son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; she was the only Romanov to marry into the British royal family. The couple had five children: a son, [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred]], and four daughters: [[Marie of Romania|Marie]], [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Victoria Melita]], [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alexandra]], and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Beatrice]]. For the first years of her marriage, Maria Alexandrovna lived in England. She neither adapted to the British court nor overcame her dislike for her adopted country. She accompanied her husband on his postings as an Admiral of the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Malta]] (1886\u20131889) and [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]] (1890\u20131893). The Duchess of Edinburgh travelled extensively through Europe. She visited her family in Russia frequently and stayed for long periods in [[England]] and [[Germany]] attending social and family events.\n\nIn August 1893 Maria Alexandrovna became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha when her husband inherited the duchy on the death of his childless uncle, [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. She enjoyed life in Germany, where she became active in cultural endeavours and charitable work. To her daughters she gave every support, but she was critical of her wayward son, who died young in 1899. Her husband died the following year.\n\nIn her widowhood Maria Alexandrovna continued to live in [[Coburg]]. The outbreak of [[World War I]] divided her sympathies. She sided with Germany against her native Russia. Her only surviving brother, [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], her nephew Tsar Nicholas II and many other relatives were killed during the Russian Revolution and she lost her considerable fortune. From 1893 until her death, she had the distinction of being an Imperial Russian grand duchess (by birth), a British royal Duchess (by marriage), and the consort (and later widow) of a German sovereign Duke.\n\nAfter World War I, [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], the duchy which her husband and nephew had ruled, ceased to exist in November 1918. Maria Alexandrovna died two years later while living under reduced circumstances in exile in [[Switzerland]].\n\n==Grand Duchess of Russia==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Family Alexandre 2.jpg|left|thumb|190px|From left to right: Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, Tsar Alexander II with Grand Duke Sergei in his lap, Grand Duke Vladimir, Grand Duke Alexander on the table with his arms crossed, Grand Duke Alexei and Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich.]]\nGrand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna was born on {{OldStyleDate|17 October|1853|5 October}} at the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]].<ref name=\"Nelipa 22\">Nelipa, ''Alexander III His Life and Reign'', p. 22</ref><ref name=\"Gelardi 10\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 10</ref> She was the sixth child and only surviving daughter among the eight children of [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II of Russia]] and his first wife [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia]], n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.<ref name=\"Gilbert 40\">Gilbert, ''Alexander II and Tsarkoe Selo'', p. 40</ref><ref name=\"Mandache 5\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 5</ref>\nAt the time of her birth, her grandfather, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas I of Russia]], was on the throne and her father was [[Tsarevich]].

Victoria was also suspicious about Russian moves in the direction of [[India]]. The Queen was dismayed, therefore, when she heard that official negotiations had restarted in January 1873. There were rumors going about St Petersburg that Maria Alexandrovna had compromised herself with [[Nikolai Golitsyn|Prince Golitsyn]], the Tsar's aide-de-camp, and her family were anxious to see her settled.<ref name=\"Abrash 395\">Abrash, ''A Curious Royal Romance'', p. 395</ref><ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2127\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2127</ref> Alfred refused to believe those rumors and he was prepared to fight to marry the person he loved.<ref name=\"Abrash 395\"/><ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2127\"/> Queen Victoria therefore swallowed her pride and said nothing. Both mothers continued to look for other partners for their children, but Alfred and Maria would not have anyone else.

Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to [[Scotland]], so that she could meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in [[Cologne]], instead. The Queen called it \"simply impertinent\" that \"I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be ready to run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess.\"<ref name=\"Gelardi 41\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 41</ref> Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar's offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony.

The Queen's eldest daughter, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], and her husband [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick, Crown Prince of Germany]], were present as well.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2267\"/>\n\nThe marriage ceremony consisted of two parts.

Alfred wore the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Tsar looked pale throughout the entire ceremony and said afterwards: \"It is for her happiness, but the light of my life has gone out.\"<ref name=\"Gelardi 43\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 43</ref> After this, the bride and groom each drank thrice from a goblet of wine. The service concluded with the couple joining hands under the priest's stole. Then they all proceeded to the Alexander Hall, where [[Arthur Stanley (priest)|Arthur Stanley]], [[Dean of Westminster]], made Prince Alfred and Maria Alexandrovna man and wife according to the rites of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Golden 20\">Golden, ''Royal Ephemera'', p. 20</ref> The two services were followed by a banquet at the palace. The famous opera singer [[Adelina Patti]] sang for the guests. The evening ended with a ball at St George Hall.\n\nIn London that night, Queen Victoria wore the [[Order of St Catherine]] on her dress and drank a toast to the young couple. Those members of her court who had traveled to St Petersburg were overwhelmed by the scale of the celebrations, receptions and entertainments marking the Anglo-Russian marriage. [[Howard Craufurd Elphinstone|Major-General Sir Howard Elphinstone]] noted that, in one room, supper was served to five hundred people at fifty different tables, with \"palms and exotics ... used to so large an extent that it gives the place the appearance of a conservatory ... the heat of the rooms was almost unbearable, and several ladies left the ballroom in a fainting state.\"<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 64</ref> Lady [[Augusta Stanley]] summed up the wedding in three words: \"What a day.\"\n\nAlfred and Maria spent their wedding night at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 248\">Zeepvat, ''Romanov Autumn'', p. 248</ref> Alexander II had ordered a lavish honeymoon suite on the ground floor, hoping that it would persuade the young couple to remain in Russia.

Alexander II never lost hope that they would return, and the honeymoon suite was kept preserved for the couple for two decades. In 1894, it became the bedroom of the last Tsar and his wife, Nicholas II and Alexandra, who were Maria's nephew and Alfred's niece respectively.<ref name = \" King & Wilson 169\">King & Wilson, ''The Romanovs Adrift'', p. 169</ref>\n\n==Duchess of Edinburgh==\n\n===Arrival in England===\n[[File:Grand Duke Alexei, Tsar Alexander II, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovnsa, Prince Alfred.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Grand Duke Alexei, Tsar Alexander II, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna and Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, May 1874]]\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh arrived in [[England]] on 7 March 1874. The town of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] was decorated in their honour, with [[Union Jack]]s and Russian flags, and Maria was given a great welcome by the waiting crowds. Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: \"I took dear Marie in my arms and kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long had I been in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ... She speaks English wonderfully well.\" Later on, Queen Victoria described her new daughter-in-law as \"most pleasing natural, unaffected and civil\" even if \"she was not pretty or graceful and held herself badly\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> \"I have formed a high opinion of her,\" Queen Victoria reported, impressed with \"her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper \u2013 her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind \u2013 so entirely free from everything fast \u2013 and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion.

Here she had an Orthodox Chapel installed for her and the Russian priest she had brought from St Peterburg.<ref name=\" King & Wilson 169\"/> In addition, they had a country residence, [[Eastwell Park]], a large estate of 2,500 acres near Ashford in Kent, where the Duke enjoyed shooting parties. To alleviate his daughter's homesickness, the Tsar and his son [[Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexei]] paid a family visit to England in May 1874.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 65\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 65</ref>\n\nMaria arrived in England with the intention of making a success of her life in her adopted country, but she found difficult to settle at the British Court.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 94\"/> For her, the climate was detestable, and the food bland. She found Clarence House, her London home, \"gloomy\". She described London as \"an impossible place, where people are mad of pleasure\" and a let down compared to the broad streets, golden domes, and magnificent palaces of Saint Petersburg. In her eyes, [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]] could never compete with the splendours of the Winter Palace.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> Constant visits to her mother-in-law at Windsor Castle and Osborne in the [[Isle of Wight]] were tedious.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> The Queen's company was oppressive, the late nights were tiring, and her husband was a philanderer. Of her sisters and brothers-in-law, she only cared for the two youngest: Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2588\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2588</ref> Proud of her strong intellect, she considered Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, a light-minded and foolish woman. Although she loved music, the duchess did not like the Royal Albert Hall, describing it as \"all ecclesiastical and ... quite boring ... Every concert goes on for several hours\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 66\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 66</ref> When she visited [[Scotland]], Maria Alexandrovna was frozen in her unheated bedroom in [[Balmoral Castle]] and ordered a fire to be lit. When she was out, Queen Victoria entered the room and ordered a maid to throw water on the fire and open all the windows.<ref name=\"Gelardi 73\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 73</ref> The Duchess was soon writing letters home to her father describing Queen Victoria as a \"silly obstinate old fool\". Disenchanted with Britain and life with her difficult mother-in-law, the Duchess of Edinburgh became increasingly homesick for Russia and was happy for any excuse to return there. British people thought her rough and masculine in her manners. Her imperious attitude towards her servants and her defiance of English convention by smoking in public made her unpopular.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> She made it equally plain that she did not care what people thought.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/>\n\n===The Duchess and Queen Victoria===\n[[File:Queen Victoria, The Duchess of Edinburg and Prince Beatrice.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Edinburgh and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice.]]]]\nThe Duchess often squabbled with her mother-in-law on how she should be addressed at court. As the Tsar's only daughter, Maria Alexandrovna had precedence over all the Grand Duchesses in Russia. She therefore deeply resented having to give precedence in England to the Princess of Wales. From her birth, Maria Alexandrovna was an Imperial Highness as the daughter of an Emperor. However, once she married her husband she was only entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Tsar Alexander II alleged that his daughter should continue to be styled as an Imperial Highness, not royal, \"as in all civilized countries\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> Queen Victoria replied that she did not care whether imperial was used or not, as long as royal came first.<ref name=\"Golden 20\"/> There was also the added problem that Maria was both Duchess of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess of Russia, and which title should be written first was a controversial matter.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> In retaliation for the quarrel over precedence, the Duchess of Edinburgh took great pleasure in showing off her magnificent jewellery. The English princesses were clearly jealous of her diamonds, as was Queen Victoria. [[Meriel Buchanan]], daughter of the last British ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Maria's first Drawing Room: \"The Queen compared the Duchess\u2019s tiara with those of her own daughters, shrugging her shoulders like a bird whose plumage has been ruffled, her mouth drawn down at the corners, in an expression which those who knew her had learned to dread.\"<ref name=\"Buchanan 115\">Buchanan, ''Queen Victoria's relations'', p. 115</ref>\n\n===At the British Court===\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh quickly started a family. Just nine months after their marriage, the Duchess gave birth to a son, [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|young Alfred]], born in [[Buckingham Palace]] on 15 October 1874. The Tsarina came to London to visit her daughter during her confinement and to meet her grandson.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 58\">Zeepvat, ''Romanov Autumn'', p. 58</ref>\n\nIn the following years, the family kept growing. A daughter was born on 29 October 1875 at Eastwell Park. She was named Marie, after her mother and grandmother. Maria shocked English society by nursing the children herself. The family's main residence in England was Clarence House, in London.<ref name = \"Pakula 40\">Pakula, ''The Last Romantic'', p. 40</ref> Autumns, Christmas and new year were spent at Eastwell Park, a country estate they leased in Kent.<ref name=\"Pakula 40\"/> On summer holidays, the family went to Osborne Cottage on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref name=\"Pakula 40\"/> While the Duchess was in Malta with her husband, who was stationed there as an officer in the Royal Navy, Maria Alexandrovna gave birth to a second daughter, Victoria Melita, on 25 November 1876. After their return to their sojourn in Malta, in 1877, Russia went to war with Turkey in an attempt to gain control of the Balkans.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 60\">Zeepvat, ''Romanov Autumn'', p. 60</ref> Queen Victoria sent Tsar Alexander II a series of aggressive telegrams that almost led to a state of war between the two countries. The Duchess was deeply shocked at her mother-in-law's hostility towards her country and her own father in particular. The relationship between the Duchess of Edinburgh and her mother-in law deteriorated. Maria Alexandrovna became an Anglophobe.\n[[File:Maira Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh.jpg|right|thumb|140px|The Duchess of Edinburgh]]\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was the heir of his childless uncle Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg, the eldest brother of Prince Albert. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, for a long while, Maria Alexandrovna resided in Coburg, as her husband was expected to succeed his aging uncle.<ref name=\"Korneva & Cheboksarova 86\">Korneva & Cheboksarova, ''Russia & Europe'', p. 86</ref> While in Germany, a third daughter, Alexandra, was born on 1 September 1878 at Rosenau Castle, in Coburg. On 13 October 1879 the Duchess gave birth prematurely to a stillborn son at Eastwell Park.<ref name=\"Mandache 14\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 14</ref> On 17 February 1880, Maria was back in Russia, during the 25th anniversary celebration of her father's coronation.

Their family was completed with the birth of a fourth daughter, Princess Beatrice, born at Eastwell on 20 April 1884.<ref name=\"Mandache 18\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 18</ref> Years later, the Duchess lamented her failure to have more children: \"The only real heavenly moment is the birth of the child. This cannot be compared to anything else. I think if I had even a dozen children I would have kept the same feeling.\"<ref name=\"Wimbles 47\">Wimbles, ''The Daughter of Tsar Alexander II'', p. 47</ref> In July 1884, they traveled to Ilinskoe, outside Moscow, to visit [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Maria's younger brother Grand Duke Sergei]], who had married Queen Victoria's granddaughter [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)|Elisabeth of Hesse]].<ref name=\"Mandache 18\"/>\n\nAlfred was heir to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Expecting to be the Duchess there, Maria Alexandrovna had a palace built for her family in [[Coburg]].

Both the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were avid collectors. In the Edinburgh Palais, there were many objects that reminded Maria Alexandrovna of her homeland.

For the next three years, they spent every winter at the San Anton Palace in Malta. Life in the island was unexciting for the Duchess of Edinburgh, but it was a welcome respite from living in England. While in Malta, the Duchess proved to be an excellent hostess, entertaining naval officers and their wives. In 1887, the couple returned briefly to London to take part in Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.<ref name=\"Mandache 28\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 28</ref> Her husband's career in the British navy and their many relations in the European courts allowed Maria Alexandrovna to travel extensively, something that she truly enjoyed.

Their main residence was the Palais Edinburgh, where the Duchess held court. Her husband, occupied with his naval affairs, was away most of the time. Responsibility for the education of the couple's five children fell upon the Duchess. She was a strict, but devoted mother who made sure to be the most important person in her children's lives.<ref name = \"Pakula 43\">Pakula, ''The Last Romantic'', p. 43</ref> Between August 1890 and June 1893, the Duke was stationed at the Royal Navy's base in [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]].

The Duke was described as \"rude, touchy, willful, unscrupulous, improvident, and unfaithful.\" The Duchess resented her husband's attitude, but kept her marriage going, hiding her troubled married life from her children, providing a happy environment for them. She later confessed to one of her daughters that she felt she was never anything more than her husband's \"legitimate mistress\".<ref name=\"Gelardi 137\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 137</ref> Arguments over their children added to the couple's marital problems.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 163\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 163</ref> The Duke hoped that their eldest daughter, Marie, would marry his nephew, the future [[King George V]].

The succession to the Duchy was complicated by the news that Alfred himself had cancer of the throat, too advanced for any treatment. By May 1900, he was unable to swallow and could only be fed by a tube.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 165\"/> The Duchess and their youngest daughter, Beatrice, who were in England visiting Queen Victoria, returned on 17 July, unaware of the seriousness of the Duke's condition.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 163\"/> On 30 July 1900, he died in his sleep at Schloss Rosenau in Coburg.

Maria Alexandrovna was at Osborne during the final days of her mother-in law, Queen Victoria.<ref name=\"Gelardi 172\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 172</ref> In her widowhood, Maria Alexandrovna kept the Edinburgh Palace as her home in Coburg, and Schloss Friedenstein in Gotha.<ref name=\"Wimbles 52\">Wimbles, ''The Daughter of Tsar Alexander II'', p. 52</ref> Schloss Rosenau served as her country residence.<ref name=\"Wimbles 52\"/> However, she spent most of her time at her villa in [[Tegernsee]] overlooking a lake in Bavaria, near [[Munich]].<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che 82\"/> Her winter residence was the Ch\u00e2teau de Fabron, near [[Nice]].<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che 85\">Be\u00e9che, ''The Coburgs of Europe'', p. 85.</ref> The upkeep of five residences put a strain on her finances.<ref name=\"Wimbles 52\"/>\n\nAlthough she was critical of her daughters, she supported them during their personal crisis.<ref name=\"Gelardi 175\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 175</ref> In 1901, her second daughter Victoria Melita divorced her husband and came to live with her.

Relations with the new Duke were initially tense,<ref name=\"Wimbles 52\"/> but improved when Charles Edward provided his full support to the marriage of Maria Alexandrovna's youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice to [[Infante Alfonso, Duke of Galliera|Alfonso de Orleans y Borb\u00f3n, Infante of Spain]] on 15 July 1909.<ref name=\"Miller & Be\u00e9che 12\">Miller & Be\u00e9che, ''Royal Gatherings Volume II'', p. 12</ref> In the following years, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna continued to make frequent trips to her native Russia in order to stay with her daughter, Victoria Melita, Grand Duchess of Russia.

To avoid complications, Maria Alexandrovna stayed away from Coburg retiring to Tegernsee in [[Bavaria]].<ref name=\"Miller & Be\u00e9che 14\">Miller & Be\u00e9che, ''Royal Gatherings Volume II'', p. 14</ref> At one point, while she was returning home with her two younger daughters, their car was stopped by an angry mob who recognised her and harassed her for her Russian heritage.<ref name=\"Be\u00e9che 222\"/> It took the police over an hour to extricate them from the situation. After that incident Maria Alexandrovna went to live in exile in Switzerland at the Walhaus, an annex of the Dolder Grand Hotel in [[Z\u00fcrich]].<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 203\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 203</ref>\n\nIn August 1917 she wrote: \"At the age of 63, I am very fresh in mind, if not in body, and I can support with patience and resignation a sad and perhaps miserable end of life which is in store for my old age... Sometimes I also seem to despair, but not about myself, but about the state of things in general.\"<ref name=\"Mandache 30\"/> Many of the Grand Duchess' relatives were killed during the Russian revolution, including her only surviving brother Grand Duke Paul and her nephew Tsar Nicholas II with his immediate family. In the aftermath of the war, the Dowager Duchess lost her large fortune as the bulk of it was held in trust in Russia. Her British income was small, and as she never saw a penny of it, she was forced to sell a great part of her jewellery collection.<ref name=\"Mandache 30\"/>\n\nLiving under reduced circumstances in Z\u00fcrich, Maria Alexandrovna was reunited with her two eldest daughters Marie, Queen of Romania, and Victoria Melita, Grand Duchess of Russia who had been on the opposite side during the war.<ref name=\"Sullivan 343\">Sullivan, ''A Fatal Passion'', p. 343</ref> In July 1920, she wrote: \"I am too utterly disgusted with the present state of the world and mankind in general...

She was the younger sister of [[Alexander III of Russia]] and the paternal aunt of Russia's last emperor, [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]].\n\nIn 1874 Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna married [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], the second son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; she was the only Romanov to marry into the British royal family. The couple had five children: a son, [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alfred]], and four daughters: [[Marie of Romania|Marie]], [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Victoria Melita]], [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Alexandra]], and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Beatrice]]. For the first years of her marriage, Maria Alexandrovna lived in England. She neither adapted to the British court nor overcame her dislike for her adopted country. She accompanied her husband on his postings as an Admiral of the [[Royal Navy]] at [[Malta]] (1886\u20131889) and [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]] (1890\u20131893). The Duchess of Edinburgh travelled extensively through Europe. She visited her family in Russia frequently and stayed for long periods in [[England]] and [[Germany]] attending social and family events.\n\nIn August 1893 Maria Alexandrovna became Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha when her husband inherited the duchy on the death of his childless uncle, [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. She enjoyed life in Germany, where she became active in cultural endeavours and charitable work. To her daughters she gave every support, but she was critical of her wayward son, who died young in 1899. Her husband died the following year.\n\nIn her widowhood Maria Alexandrovna continued to live in [[Coburg]]. The outbreak of [[World War I]] divided her sympathies. She sided with Germany against her native Russia. Her only surviving brother, [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], her nephew Tsar Nicholas II and many other relatives were killed during the Russian Revolution and she lost her considerable fortune. From 1893 until her death, she had the distinction of being an Imperial Russian grand duchess (by birth), a British royal Duchess (by marriage), and the consort (and later widow) of a German sovereign Duke.\n\nAfter World War I, [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], the duchy which her husband and nephew had ruled, ceased to exist in November 1918. Maria Alexandrovna died two years later while living under reduced circumstances in exile in [[Switzerland]].\n\n==Grand Duchess of Russia==\n\n===Early life===\n[[File:Family Alexandre 2.jpg|left|thumb|190px|From left to right: Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, Tsar Alexander II with Grand Duke Sergei in his lap, Grand Duke Vladimir, Grand Duke Alexander on the table with his arms crossed, Grand Duke Alexei and Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich.]]\nGrand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna was born on {{OldStyleDate|17 October|1853|5 October}} at the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]].<ref name=\"Nelipa 22\">Nelipa, ''Alexander III His Life and Reign'', p. 22</ref><ref name=\"Gelardi 10\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 10</ref> She was the sixth child and only surviving daughter among the eight children of [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II of Russia]] and his first wife [[Marie of Hesse and by Rhine|Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia]], n\u00e9e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.<ref name=\"Gilbert 40\">Gilbert, ''Alexander II and Tsarkoe Selo'', p. 40</ref><ref name=\"Mandache 5\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 5</ref>\nAt the time of her birth, her grandfather, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Emperor Nicholas I of Russia]], was on the throne and her father was [[Tsarevich]].

The Tsar and his wife were accompanied by seventeen-year-old Maria and her two elder brothers. Alfred also happened to be there, along with the Prince and Princess of Wales. During that summer, Maria and Alfred felt attracted to each other, spending their days walking and talking together. They had a common love of music; Alfred was an enthusiastic amateur violinist, while Maria played the piano.<ref name=\"Wimbles 46\">Wimbles, ''The Daughter of Tsar Alexander II'', p. 46</ref> Although they wished to marry, no engagement was announced, and Alfred returned to England.\nTheir parents were against the match. Alexander II did not want to lose his daughter, to whom he was deeply attached.<ref name=\"Abrash 393\">Abrash, ''A Curious Royal Romance'', p. 393</ref> He presented his daughter's youth as the main obstacle and suggested a waiting period of at least one year before any definitive decision should be taken.<ref name=\"Abrash 390\">Abrash, ''A Curious Royal Romance'', p. 390</ref> The Tsar also objected to a British son-in-law, due to the general anti-English feeling in Russia following the [[Crimean War]].<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2059\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2059</ref> The Tsarina regarded the British customs as peculiar and the English people as cold and unfriendly.

Engagement photograph, 1873.]]\nQueen Victoria was also against the match. No British prince had ever married a Romanov, and she foresaw problems with Maria's [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox religion]] and Russian upbringing.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2191\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2191</ref> The Queen considered that Russia was generally \"unfriendly\" towards Britain. Victoria was also suspicious about Russian moves in the direction of [[India]]. The Queen was dismayed, therefore, when she heard that official negotiations had restarted in January 1873. There were rumors going about St Petersburg that Maria Alexandrovna had compromised herself with [[Nikolai Golitsyn|Prince Golitsyn]], the Tsar's aide-de-camp, and her family were anxious to see her settled.<ref name=\"Abrash 395\">Abrash, ''A Curious Royal Romance'', p. 395</ref><ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2127\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2127</ref> Alfred refused to believe those rumors and he was prepared to fight to marry the person he loved.<ref name=\"Abrash 395\"/><ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2127\"/> Queen Victoria therefore swallowed her pride and said nothing. Both mothers continued to look for other partners for their children, but Alfred and Maria would not have anyone else. Marie liked neither the Prince of W\u00fcrttemberg nor the Prince of Mecklenburg-Strelitz that were presented to her as alternatives.<ref name=\"Abrash 392\">Abrash, ''A Curious Royal Romance'', p. 392</ref> As the Tsarina failed to find a German prince acceptable for her daughter, a meeting among Alfred, the Tsarina and her daughter took place in [[Sorrento]], Italy in mid April 1873.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2148\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2148</ref> The reunion did not go as planned because Marie came down with fever and Alfred could spend only a short time with her.<ref name=\"Abrash 397\">Abrash, ''A Curious Royal Romance'', p. 397</ref> That year, there was an Anglo-Russian dispute over the Afghan border.<ref name = \"Cowles 198\">Cowles, ''The Romanovs'', p. 198</ref> The Queen's ministers thought that a marriage might help to ease the tension between the two countries, if only by putting the monarchs into closer contact with one another.<ref name=\"Cowles 198\"/>\n\nIn June 1873, Tsar Alexander II joined his wife and daughter at [[Bad Ems|Ems]], and Alfred was invited to meet them at Jugenheim.<ref name=\"Abrash 397\"/> Alfred arrived in early July.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2165\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2165</ref> On 11 July, he asked for Maria Alexandrovna's hand and she accepted him.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2182\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2182</ref> He was nearly twenty-nine; she was nineteen. He sent a telegram from Germany back to his mother: \"Maria and I were engaged this morning. Cannot say how happy I am. Hope your blessing rests on us.\"<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2182\"/> The Queen sent her congratulations, but confined her misgivings to her diary on 11 July 1873: \"Not knowing Marie, and realizing that there may still be many difficulties, my thoughts and feelings are rather mixed.\" When breaking the news to her eldest daughter, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia]], Queen Victoria simply said: \"The murder is out.\"<ref name=\"Gelardi 39\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 39</ref>\n\n===Dowry===\n[[File:Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna.]]\nTsar Alexander II granted his daughter the then staggering sum of \u00a3100,000 as a dowry, plus an annual allowance of \u00a332,000.<ref name=\"Wimbles 46\"/> He also bestowed on his only daughter some of the best jewels owned by the Romanovs, including the [[sapphire]]s he had inherited from his mother, Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Charlotte of Prussia)|Alexandra Feodorovna]], as well as a parure that had belonged to [[Catherine the Great]].<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 62\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 62</ref> As a wedding present, the Tsar commissioned a complete [[parure]] of diamonds and [[Burma|Burmese]] rubies from the court jeweller Bolin.<ref name=\"Papi 94\">Papi, ''Jewels of the Romanovs: Family & Court'', p. 94</ref> Her other pieces of jewellery included a ''[[kokoshnik|tiara russe]]'' made of diamonds, which could also be worn as a necklace.<ref name=\"Papi 96\">Papi, ''Jewels of the Romanovs: Family & Court'', p. 96</ref> On his part, Alfred, was made honorary chief of a Russian guards regiment and even had a Russian battleship named after him \u2013 the ''Herzog Edinburgsky''.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 62\"/>\n\nA week after the engagement, the proposed Anglo-Russo alliance experienced its first crisis. Queen Victoria asked the Tsar to bring Maria to [[Scotland]], so that she could meet her future daughter-in-law. Alexander II refused. The Tsarina suggested that they all meet in [[Cologne]], instead. The Queen called it \"simply impertinent\" that \"I ... who have been nearly twenty years longer on the throne than the Emperor of Russia ... and who am a Reigning Sovereign ... should be ready to run to the slightest call of the mighty Russians ... like any little Princess.\"<ref name=\"Gelardi 41\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 41</ref> Victoria also made herself unpopular by refusing the Tsar's offer to make the Prince of Wales colonel of a Russian regiment, and by demanding that an Anglican marriage service be held in St Petersburg alongside the Orthodox ceremony. But Maria Alexandrovna looked forward happily to her marriage: \"How happy I am to belong to him. I feel that my love for him is growing daily. I have a feeling of peace and inexpressible happiness and a boundless impatience to be altogether his own.\"<ref name=\"Corti 214\">Corti, ''The Fall of Three Dynasties'', p. 214</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Wedding of Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia and Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh on 23 January 1874 by an unknown artist.jpg|left|thumb|140px|The wedding of Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna and Prince Alfred at the Winter Palace. 23 January 1874.]]\nOn 4 January 1874, Alfred arrived in St Petersburg for the wedding and stayed in the Winter Palace.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2267\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2267</ref> The other British guests arrived on 18 January.

The Queen's eldest daughter, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], and her husband [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick, Crown Prince of Germany]], were present as well.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2267\"/>\n\nThe marriage ceremony consisted of two parts. The Orthodox service took place first and was performed by the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]]s of St Petersburg, [[Moscow]], and [[Kiev]] in the Imperial Chapel.<ref name=\"Papi 93\"/> Grand Dukes Vladimir, Alexis, and Sergei and the groom's brother [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], relieved each other taking turns holding the golden crowns over the head of the bride and groom.<ref name=\"Papi 93\"/><ref name=\"Van der Kiste 62\"/> Maria wore a glittering coronet and a mantle of crimson velvet trimmed with ermine and a sprig of myrtle, specially sent by Queen Victoria. Alfred wore the uniform of the Royal Navy. The Tsar looked pale throughout the entire ceremony and said afterwards: \"It is for her happiness, but the light of my life has gone out.\"<ref name=\"Gelardi 43\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 43</ref> After this, the bride and groom each drank thrice from a goblet of wine. The service concluded with the couple joining hands under the priest's stole. Then they all proceeded to the Alexander Hall, where [[Arthur Stanley (priest)|Arthur Stanley]], [[Dean of Westminster]], made Prince Alfred and Maria Alexandrovna man and wife according to the rites of the [[Church of England]].<ref name=\"Golden 20\">Golden, ''Royal Ephemera'', p. 20</ref> The two services were followed by a banquet at the palace. The famous opera singer [[Adelina Patti]] sang for the guests. The evening ended with a ball at St George Hall.\n\nIn London that night, Queen Victoria wore the [[Order of St Catherine]] on her dress and drank a toast to the young couple. Those members of her court who had traveled to St Petersburg were overwhelmed by the scale of the celebrations, receptions and entertainments marking the Anglo-Russian marriage. [[Howard Craufurd Elphinstone|Major-General Sir Howard Elphinstone]] noted that, in one room, supper was served to five hundred people at fifty different tables, with \"palms and exotics ... used to so large an extent that it gives the place the appearance of a conservatory ... the heat of the rooms was almost unbearable, and several ladies left the ballroom in a fainting state.\"<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 64</ref> Lady [[Augusta Stanley]] summed up the wedding in three words: \"What a day.\"\n\nAlfred and Maria spent their wedding night at the Alexander Palace in Tsarskoe Selo.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 248\">Zeepvat, ''Romanov Autumn'', p. 248</ref> Alexander II had ordered a lavish honeymoon suite on the ground floor, hoping that it would persuade the young couple to remain in Russia. After a short honeymoon in Tsarskoe Selo, however, Alfred and Maria left Russia to live in England. Alexander II never lost hope that they would return, and the honeymoon suite was kept preserved for the couple for two decades.

The town of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] was decorated in their honour, with [[Union Jack]]s and Russian flags, and Maria was given a great welcome by the waiting crowds. Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: \"I took dear Marie in my arms and kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long had I been in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ... She speaks English wonderfully well.\" Later on, Queen Victoria described her new daughter-in-law as \"most pleasing natural, unaffected and civil\" even if \"she was not pretty or graceful and held herself badly\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> \"I have formed a high opinion of her,\" Queen Victoria reported, impressed with \"her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper \u2013 her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind \u2013 so entirely free from everything fast \u2013 and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion.

She described London as \"an impossible place, where people are mad of pleasure\" and a let down compared to the broad streets, golden domes, and magnificent palaces of Saint Petersburg. In her eyes, [[Buckingham Palace]] and [[Windsor Castle]] could never compete with the splendours of the Winter Palace.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> Constant visits to her mother-in-law at Windsor Castle and Osborne in the [[Isle of Wight]] were tedious.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> The Queen's company was oppressive, the late nights were tiring, and her husband was a philanderer. Of her sisters and brothers-in-law, she only cared for the two youngest: Prince Leopold and Princess Beatrice.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste, loc 2588\">Van der Kiste, ''Alfred: Queen Victoria's Second Son'', loc 2588</ref> Proud of her strong intellect, she considered Alexandra, the Princess of Wales, a light-minded and foolish woman. Although she loved music, the duchess did not like the Royal Albert Hall, describing it as \"all ecclesiastical and ... quite boring ... Every concert goes on for several hours\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 66\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 66</ref> When she visited [[Scotland]], Maria Alexandrovna was frozen in her unheated bedroom in [[Balmoral Castle]] and ordered a fire to be lit. When she was out, Queen Victoria entered the room and ordered a maid to throw water on the fire and open all the windows.<ref name=\"Gelardi 73\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 73</ref> The Duchess was soon writing letters home to her father describing Queen Victoria as a \"silly obstinate old fool\". Disenchanted with Britain and life with her difficult mother-in-law, the Duchess of Edinburgh became increasingly homesick for Russia and was happy for any excuse to return there. British people thought her rough and masculine in her manners. Her imperious attitude towards her servants and her defiance of English convention by smoking in public made her unpopular.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> She made it equally plain that she did not care what people thought.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/>\n\n===The Duchess and Queen Victoria===\n[[File:Queen Victoria, The Duchess of Edinburg and Prince Beatrice.jpg|left|thumb|140px|Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Edinburgh and [[Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom|Princess Beatrice.]]]]\nThe Duchess often squabbled with her mother-in-law on how she should be addressed at court. As the Tsar's only daughter, Maria Alexandrovna had precedence over all the Grand Duchesses in Russia. She therefore deeply resented having to give precedence in England to the Princess of Wales. From her birth, Maria Alexandrovna was an Imperial Highness as the daughter of an Emperor. However, once she married her husband she was only entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Tsar Alexander II alleged that his daughter should continue to be styled as an Imperial Highness, not royal, \"as in all civilized countries\".<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> Queen Victoria replied that she did not care whether imperial was used or not, as long as royal came first.<ref name=\"Golden 20\"/> There was also the added problem that Maria was both Duchess of Edinburgh and Grand Duchess of Russia, and which title should be written first was a controversial matter.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 64\"/> In retaliation for the quarrel over precedence, the Duchess of Edinburgh took great pleasure in showing off her magnificent jewellery. The English princesses were clearly jealous of her diamonds, as was Queen Victoria. [[Meriel Buchanan]], daughter of the last British ambassador to Imperial Russia, described Maria's first Drawing Room: \"The Queen compared the Duchess\u2019s tiara with those of her own daughters, shrugging her shoulders like a bird whose plumage has been ruffled, her mouth drawn down at the corners, in an expression which those who knew her had learned to dread.\"<ref name=\"Buchanan 115\">Buchanan, ''Queen Victoria's relations'', p. 115</ref>\n\n===At the British Court===\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh quickly started a family. Just nine months after their marriage, the Duchess gave birth to a son, [[Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|young Alfred]], born in [[Buckingham Palace]] on 15 October 1874. The Tsarina came to London to visit her daughter during her confinement and to meet her grandson.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 58\">Zeepvat, ''Romanov Autumn'', p. 58</ref>\n\nIn the following years, the family kept growing. A daughter was born on 29 October 1875 at Eastwell Park. She was named Marie, after her mother and grandmother. Maria shocked English society by nursing the children herself. The family's main residence in England was Clarence House, in London.<ref name = \"Pakula 40\">Pakula, ''The Last Romantic'', p. 40</ref> Autumns, Christmas and new year were spent at Eastwell Park, a country estate they leased in Kent.<ref name=\"Pakula 40\"/> On summer holidays, the family went to Osborne Cottage on the [[Isle of Wight]].<ref name=\"Pakula 40\"/> While the Duchess was in Malta with her husband, who was stationed there as an officer in the Royal Navy, Maria Alexandrovna gave birth to a second daughter, Victoria Melita, on 25 November 1876. After their return to their sojourn in Malta, in 1877, Russia went to war with Turkey in an attempt to gain control of the Balkans.<ref name=\"Zeepvat 60\">Zeepvat, ''Romanov Autumn'', p. 60</ref> Queen Victoria sent Tsar Alexander II a series of aggressive telegrams that almost led to a state of war between the two countries. The Duchess was deeply shocked at her mother-in-law's hostility towards her country and her own father in particular. The relationship between the Duchess of Edinburgh and her mother-in law deteriorated. Maria Alexandrovna became an Anglophobe.\n[[File:Maira Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh.jpg|right|thumb|140px|The Duchess of Edinburgh]]\nThe Duke of Edinburgh was the heir of his childless uncle Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg, the eldest brother of Prince Albert. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, for a long while, Maria Alexandrovna resided in Coburg, as her husband was expected to succeed his aging uncle.<ref name=\"Korneva & Cheboksarova 86\">Korneva & Cheboksarova, ''Russia & Europe'', p. 86</ref> While in Germany, a third daughter, Alexandra, was born on 1 September 1878 at Rosenau Castle, in Coburg. On 13 October 1879 the Duchess gave birth prematurely to a stillborn son at Eastwell Park.<ref name=\"Mandache 14\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 14</ref> On 17 February 1880, Maria was back in Russia, during the 25th anniversary celebration of her father's coronation. That day, radicals attempted to assassinate the Tsar and the entire Imperial family.<ref name=\"Mandache 15\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 15</ref> A terrorist bomb demolished the dining room and the guard room at the Winter Palace.<ref name=\"Mandache 15\"/> Maria Alexandrovna returned to Russia again in June 1880, to be with her dying mother.<ref name=\"Mandache 16\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 16</ref> She was back in England at Clarence House when her father was killed by a terrorist bomb.<ref name=\"Mandache 16\"/> Maria Alexandrovna had to rush back to Russia to attend her father's funeral in Saint Petersburg in March 1881.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 94\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 94</ref>\nThe Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were present at the coronation of her brother, Tsar Alexander III, in Moscow in May 1883. Their family was completed with the birth of a fourth daughter, Princess Beatrice, born at Eastwell on 20 April 1884.<ref name=\"Mandache 18\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 18</ref> Years later, the Duchess lamented her failure to have more children: \"The only real heavenly moment is the birth of the child. This cannot be compared to anything else. I think if I had even a dozen children I would have kept the same feeling.\"<ref name=\"Wimbles 47\">Wimbles, ''The Daughter of Tsar Alexander II'', p. 47</ref> In July 1884, they traveled to Ilinskoe, outside Moscow, to visit [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Maria's younger brother Grand Duke Sergei]], who had married Queen Victoria's granddaughter [[Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864\u20131918)|Elisabeth of Hesse]].<ref name=\"Mandache 18\"/>\n\nAlfred was heir to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Expecting to be the Duchess there, Maria Alexandrovna had a palace built for her family in [[Coburg]]. The building, known as the Edinburgh Palais, was built across the central square from the [[Ehrenburg Palace]], the official residence of the reigning duke, and next to the town's opera hall.<ref name=\"Korneva & Cheboksarova 87\">Korneva and Cheboksarova, ''Russia and Europe'', p. 87</ref> The royal couple's rooms were on the second floor, while the bedrooms of the four young princesses were on the third floor. Both the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh were avid collectors. In the Edinburgh Palais, there were many objects that reminded Maria Alexandrovna of her homeland. As a reminder of Russia, Maria Alexandrovna organised entertainment in the Russian fashion.<ref name=\"Korneva & Cheboksarova 87\"/>\n\n===In Malta===\n[[File:Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna and family, George V.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh with their five children, and Prince George of Wales, Prince Maximilian of Baden, and Grand Duke Ernest Louis of Hesse.

For the next three years, they spent every winter at the San Anton Palace in Malta. Life in the island was unexciting for the Duchess of Edinburgh, but it was a welcome respite from living in England. While in Malta, the Duchess proved to be an excellent hostess, entertaining naval officers and their wives. In 1887, the couple returned briefly to London to take part in Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.<ref name=\"Mandache 28\">Mandache, ''Dearest Missy'', p. 28</ref> Her husband's career in the British navy and their many relations in the European courts allowed Maria Alexandrovna to travel extensively, something that she truly enjoyed.

Their main residence was the Palais Edinburgh, where the Duchess held court. Her husband, occupied with his naval affairs, was away most of the time. Responsibility for the education of the couple's five children fell upon the Duchess. She was a strict, but devoted mother who made sure to be the most important person in her children's lives.<ref name = \"Pakula 43\">Pakula, ''The Last Romantic'', p. 43</ref> Between August 1890 and June 1893, the Duke was stationed at the Royal Navy's base in [[Devonport, Plymouth|Devonport]].

They had little in common other than a shared interest in music and their children. He was reserved, taciturn, moody, ill-tempered, and a heavy drinker.<ref name=\"Gelardi 138\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 138</ref> By the mid 1880s he was an alcoholic. The Duke was described as \"rude, touchy, willful, unscrupulous, improvident, and unfaithful.\" The Duchess resented her husband's attitude, but kept her marriage going, hiding her troubled married life from her children, providing a happy environment for them. She later confessed to one of her daughters that she felt she was never anything more than her husband's \"legitimate mistress\".<ref name=\"Gelardi 137\">Gelardi, ''From Splendor to Revolution'', p. 137</ref> Arguments over their children added to the couple's marital problems.<ref name=\"Van der Kiste 163\">Van der Kiste, ''The Romanovs 1818\u20131959'', p. 163</ref> The Duke hoped that their eldest daughter, Marie, would marry his nephew, the future [[King George V]].

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims.\n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail.

Measuring approximately {{convert|1|mi|km}} long by {{convert|0.33|mi|km|abbr=}} wide, Hart Island is part of the [[Pelham Islands]] archipelago, to the east of [[City Island, Bronx|City Island]].\n\nThe island's first public use was as a training ground for the [[United States Colored Troops]] in 1864. Since then, Hart Island has been the location of a [[American Civil War prison camps|Union Civil War prison camp]], a [[psychiatric institution]], a [[tuberculosis sanatorium]], a [[potter's field]] with mass burials, a homeless shelter, a boys' [[reformatory]], a jail, and a drug rehabilitation center. Several other structures, such as an amusement park, were planned for Hart Island but not built. During the [[Cold War (1953\u20131962)|Cold War]], [[Nike missile|Nike defense missiles]] were stationed on Hart Island. The island was intermittently used as a prison and a homeless shelter until 1967, and the last inhabited structures were abandoned in 1977. The island now serves as the city's potter's field, run by the [[New York City Department of Correction]] until 2019, when the [[New York City Council]] voted to transfer jurisdiction to the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation]].\n\nThe remains of more than one million people are buried on Hart Island, though since the first decade of the 21st century, there are fewer than 1,500 burials a year. Burials on Hart Island include individuals who were not claimed by their families or did not have private funerals; the homeless and the indigent; and mass burials of disease victims.\n\nAccess to the island is restricted by the Department of Correction, which operates an infrequent ferryboat service and imposes strict visitation quotas. Burials are conducted by inmates at the [[Rikers Island]] jail.
