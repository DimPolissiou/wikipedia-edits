Diana Mangano also left around the same time and was replaced by vocalist [[Cathy Richardson]]. Once Richardson joined the band, Gaiman and Kantner decided the time was right to record the album,<ref name=jambands/> partly to have an album ready in time for the 2008 US presidential elections.<ref name=prov/> The album would be recorded in California.  As the band's personnel continued to change, it was uncertain who would participate in the new album.  At the time studio sessions began, the band consisted of Paul Kantner, Slick Aguilar, Chris Smith, Cathy Richardson, Donny Baldwin, and David Freiberg.  The band made the decision that the album would be mostly acoustic, so band member [[Slick Aguilar]] did not contribute on most of the songs included.  Although [[Donny Baldwin]] now handled the drums on tour, Prairie Prince returned for the studio sessions.  [[Marty Balin]] was to have recorded lead vocals for a cover of [[Bruce Cockburn]]'s \"[[If I Had a Rocket Launcher]]\" and [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s \"[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]\" but his art touring schedule conflicted with studio sessions and he could not attend.<ref name=albumnotes />  Instead, manager Gaiman took the track \"Maybe for You\" that had appeared on the German version of ''[[Windows of Heaven (album)|Windows of Heaven]]'' and substituted it for Marty's contribution.  Richardson and [[David Freiberg]] recorded vocals for other songs that had been planned for Balin.  [[Jack Casady]] appears on \"Maybe for You\" but did not participate in the recording of the album.  Kantner and [[Grace Slick]]'s daughter [[China Kantner|China]] attempted to convince Slick to sing again, but she did not want to return to performing.<ref name=jambands/> Gaiman convinced Slick to let the band use a previously unreleased recording from 1970<ref name=jambands/><ref name=recdate>{{cite web |url=http://www.fluctu8.com/media/20928/10770/ |title=Jefferson Airplane- Surprise Surprise a golden nugget has arrived from 1970!

Once Richardson joined the band, Gaiman and Kantner decided the time was right to record the album,<ref name=jambands/> partly to have an album ready in time for the 2008 US presidential elections.<ref name=prov/> The album would be recorded in California.  As the band's personnel continued to change, it was uncertain who would participate in the new album.  At the time studio sessions began, the band consisted of Paul Kantner, Slick Aguilar, Chris Smith, Cathy Richardson, Donny Baldwin, and David Freiberg.  The band made the decision that the album would be mostly acoustic, so band member [[Slick Aguilar]] did not contribute on most of the songs included.  Although [[Donny Baldwin]] now handled the drums on tour, Prairie Prince returned for the studio sessions.  [[Marty Balin]] was to have recorded lead vocals for a cover of [[Bruce Cockburn]]'s \"[[If I Had a Rocket Launcher]]\" and [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s \"[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]\" but his art touring schedule conflicted with studio sessions and he could not attend.<ref name=albumnotes />  Instead, manager Gaiman took the track \"Maybe for You\" that had appeared on the German version of ''[[Windows of Heaven (album)|Windows of Heaven]]'' and substituted it for Marty's contribution.  Richardson and [[David Freiberg]] recorded vocals for other songs that had been planned for Balin.

Other material included on the album include songs that Jefferson Starship has been performing since 1992 but had not committed to an album previously, including \"Frenario\" and [[World Entertainment War]]'s \"In a Crisis.\"  Also included are several songs that Kantner had learned from [[The Weavers]], adding his own lyrical twists to them, \"Wasn't That a Time\", \"Follow the Drinking Gourd\", \"Santy Anno\", and \"Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.\"<ref name=albumnotes /> \"Santy Anno\" had been planned for a solo project entitled ''On the Threshold of Fire.''<ref name=lyrica />  Kantner folded several songs he had been writing together to create his new version of \"On the Threshold of Fire.\"<ref name=top40/>    \"Cowboy on the Run\", a song from Freiberg's previous band, [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] is also included. \"The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood\" was not intended for the album until Darby Gould on the first day of mixing wanted to redo her vocals for \"Genesis Hall.\"  Gaiman instead suggested that she record another song, but it would have to be [[a cappella]].  They settled on covering [[Sandy Denny]]'s version of \"The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood.\"<ref name=albumnotes/>  In a nod to the band's past the album features a small image of the cover art to the 1974 Jefferson Starship album ''[[Dragon Fly (album)|Dragon Fly]]'' on its rear cover.\n\n==Bill Thompson / Grace Slick lawsuit==\nAround March 2007, the band performed some concerts to advertise [[Microsoft]]'s product, [[Windows Vista]] and were paid $100,000.<ref name=lawsuit>{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/03/23/BAGBIOQBCI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=SAN FRANCISCO / Paul Kantner sued for using 'Starship' name / Band's ex-manager says trademark is being infringed on | first=Bob | last=Egelko | date=March 23, 2007 | access-date=August 4, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918033113/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2007%2F03%2F23%2FBAGBIOQBCI1.DTL | archive-date=September 18, 2011 | url-status=live |language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Although Kantner had been using the name Jefferson Starship since 1992, it was in fact a violation of the agreement he had signed in 1985 when he had left the band.<ref name=lawsuit/> Bill Thompson as manager of Jefferson Starship sued Kantner for using the band name.  [[Grace Slick]] was named as plaintiff along with Thompson.  The album was in production at the time the case was going to court, and Slick remains uncredited on the album.  The case was however settled in April 2008, with Kantner agreeing to pay a license fee to Thompson and Slick to be able to use the name Jefferson Starship indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfchroniclemarketplace.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/19/BAS2108740.DTL&type=printable |title=Licensing deal ends Jefferson Starship spat - SFGate |publisher=Sfchroniclemarketplace.com |date=2008-04-19 |accessdate=2012-08-11 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909135628/http://www.sfchroniclemarketplace.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/04/19/BAS2108740.DTL&type=printable |archive-date=2012-09-09 |url-status=dead |language=en-US|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Promotion and tour==\nThe album was promoted in several different ways.

In addition, several \"listening parties\" were held where fans in attendance along with press could hear the album in its entirety before the band itself performed.<ref name=bandsite/>  After the June concerts in Larkspur, several concerts in [[California]] and [[New England]] including listening parties followed.  In late July, a tour of the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Italy]] began.  Slick Aguilar could not tour outside of the US, so Jeff Pevar and John Ferenzik took over guitar duties, and Tony Morley joined the band playing rhythm guitar, mandolin, and percussion.<ref name=bandsite/><ref name=\"cottonclubjapan.co.jp\">[http://www.cottonclubjapan.co.jp/jp/sp/336.html]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>  The European tour ended shortly before the album's release and the American tour resumed on the release date of the album, with Aguilar returning and with [[Marty Balin]] joining the band for some of the American concerts.<ref name=bandsite/>  The band decided to tour in two different configurations: for the most part they would perform as an acoustic ensemble with Kantner, Freiberg, Richardson, and Smith; and occasionally they would play a full electric set and include Aguilar, Baldwin, and sometimes Balin. The tour continued throughout 2008 with a tour of the East Coast, West Coast, and Midwest of the United States.

In April, the electric version of the band joined [[David Grisman]] as \"The Jefferson-Grisman\" project for a series of performances in April.  In June, Jeff Pevar joined the band as bassist, and the band changed its focus from the album to Jefferson Airplane's Woodstock Festival material touring in the electric configuration with [[Tom Constanten]], [[Canned Heat]], [[Ten Years After]], [[Big Brother & the Holding Company]], and [[Country Joe MacDonald]] for a tour known as \"[[Heroes of Woodstock]].\"\n\n==Track listing==\n<small>Track listing and author list from liner notes<ref name = albumnotes/></small>\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = Wasn't That a Time\n| note1           = \n| writer1         = [[Lee Hays]], William Lowenfels, additional lyrics by [[Paul Kantner]]\n| length1         = 2:38\n| title2          = Follow the Drinking Gourd\n| note2           = \n| writer2         = traditional\n| length2         = 3:04\n| title3          = Santy Anno\n| note3           = \n| writer3         = traditional, arranged by Kantner\n| length3         = 3:14\n| title4          = Cowboy on the Run\n| note4           = \n| writer4         = [[Dino Valenti]]\n| length4         = 4:34\n| title5          = [[I Ain't Marching Anymore (song)|I Ain't Marching Anymore]]\n| note5           = \n| writer5         = [[Phil Ochs]], additional lyrics by [[Cathy Richardson]]\n| length5         = 3:13\n| title6          = [[Chimes of Freedom (song)|Chimes of Freedom]]\n| note6           = \n| writer6         = [[Bob Dylan]]\n| length6         = 3:54\n| title7          = Genesis Hall\n| note7           = \n| writer7         = [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]]\n| length7         = 3:14\n| title8          = [[Kisses Sweeter Than Wine (song)|Kisses Sweeter Than Wine]]\n| note8           = \n| writer8         = Paul Campbell, [[Lead Belly|Huddie Ledbetter]]\n| length8         = 3:30\n| title9          = [[The Auld Triangle|Royal Canal (The Auld Triangle)]]\n| note9           = \n| writer9         = [[Brendan Behan]]\n| length9         = 3:17\n| title10         = Rising of the Moon\n| note10          = \n| writer10        = J.

The captured images are [[digitization|digitized]] and stored as a [[computer file]] ready for further digital processing, viewing, [[electronic publishing]], or [[digital printing]].\n\nUntil the advent of such technology, [[photograph]]s were made by exposing light sensitive [[photographic film]] and paper, which was [[photographic processing|processed in liquid chemical solutions]] to develop and stabilize the image.

Since 2010, the digital point-and-shoot and DSLR formats have also seen competition from the mirrorless digital camera format, which typically provides better image quality than the point-and-shoot or cell phone formats but comes in a smaller size and shape than the typical DSLR. Many mirrorless cameras accept interchangeable lenses and have advanced features through an electronic viewfinder, which replaces the through-the-lens finder image of the SLR format.\n\n==History==\n{{See|History of the camera#Digital cameras|Digital image#History}}\n\nWhile digital photography has only relatively recently become mainstream, the late 20th century saw many small developments leading to its creation.

It used a [[video camera tube]], followed by a digitizer, rather than a mosaic of [[solid-state electronics|solid state]] sensor elements.

Some can be used as [[webcam]]s, some can use the [[PictBridge]] standard to connect to a printer without using a computer, and some can display pictures directly on a television set. Similarly, many [[camcorder]]s can take still photographs, and store them on [[videotape]] or on [[flash memory]] cards with the same functionality as [[digital camera]]s.\n\nDigital photography is one of the most exceptional instances of the shift from converting conventional analog information to digital information. This shift is so tremendous because it was a chemical and mechanical process and became an all digital process with a built in computer in all digital cameras.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cameras-photography/digital/digital-camera.htm|title=How Digital Cameras Work|date=2006-11-29|newspaper=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Performance metrics===\n\nThe quality of a digital image is a composite of various factors, many of which are similar to those of film cameras. [[Pixel count]] (typically listed in [[megapixel]]s, millions of pixels) is only one of the major factors, though it is the most heavily marketed [[figure of merit]]. Digital camera manufacturers advertise this figure because consumers can use it to easily compare camera capabilities. It is not, however, the major factor in evaluating a digital camera for most applications. The processing system inside the camera that turns the raw data into a color-balanced and pleasing photograph is usually more critical, which is why some 4+ megapixel cameras perform better than higher-end cameras.<!-- These factors are just too many to list. -->\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer= Image at left has a higher [[pixel count]] than the one to the right, but lower [[spatial resolution]].\n| align= right\n| image1= Matakis - blurred.jpg\n| width1= 143\n| image2= MARTAKIS1.jpg\n| width2= 130\n}}\nResolution in pixels is not the only measure of image quality. A larger sensor with the same number of pixels generally produces a better image than a smaller one. One of the most important differences is an improvement in [[image noise]]. This is one of the advantages of digital SLR (single-lens reflex) cameras, which have larger sensors than simpler cameras (so-called point and shoot cameras) of the same resolution.\n*'''Lens quality:''' resolution, [[image distortion|distortion]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (see [[Lens (optics)]])\n*'''Capture medium:''' CMOS, CCD, [[negative film]], [[reversal film]] etc.\n*'''Capture format:''' pixel count, digital file type ([[raw image format|RAW]], [[TIFF]], [[JPEG]]), [[film format]] ([[135 film]], [[120 film]], 5x4, 10x8).\n*'''Processing:''' digital and/or chemical processing of 'negative' and 'print'.\n\n====Pixel counts====\nThe number of [[pixel]]s ''n'' for a given maximum [[image resolution|resolution]] (''w'' horizontal pixels by ''h'' vertical pixels) is the product ''n''= ''w \u00d7 h''. This yields e. g. 1.92 megapixels (1,920,000 pixels) for an image of 1600 \u00d7 1200. \n\nThe [[pixel count]] quoted by manufacturers can be misleading as it may not be the number of full-color pixels. For cameras using single-chip [[image sensor]]s the number claimed is the total number of single-color-sensitive photosensors, whether they have different locations in the plane, as with the [[Bayer sensor]], or in stacks of three co-located photosensors as in the [[Foveon X3 sensor]]. However, the images have different numbers of RGB pixels: Bayer-sensor cameras produce as many RGB pixels as photosensors via [[demosaicing]] (interpolation), while Foveon sensors produce uninterpolated image files with one-third as many RGB pixels as photosensors. Comparisons of megapixel ratings of these two types of sensors are sometimes a subject of dispute.<ref>[http://www.popphoto.com/howto/4276/foveon-x3-sensor-claims-put-to-the-test.html Foveon X3 Sensor Claims Put to the Test] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013144153/http://www.popphoto.com/howto/4276/foveon-x3-sensor-claims-put-to-the-test.html |date=2007-10-13}}</ref>\n\nThe relative increase in detail resulting from an increase in resolution is better compared by looking at the number of pixels across (or down) the picture, rather than the total number of pixels in the picture area. For example, a sensor of 2560 \u00d7 1600 sensor elements is described as \"4 megapixels\" (2560 \u00d7 1600= 4,096,000). Increasing to 3200 \u00d7 2048 increases the pixels in the picture to 6,553,600 (6.5 megapixels), a factor of 1.6, but the pixels per cm in the picture (at the same image size) increases by only 1.25 times. A measure of the comparative increase in linear resolution is the square root of the increase in area resolution, i.e., megapixels in the entire image.\n\n====Dynamic range====\nPractical imaging systems both digital and film, have a limited \"[[dynamic range]]\": the range of [[luminosity]] that can be reproduced accurately. [[Clipping (photography)|Highlights]] of the subject that are too bright are rendered as white, with no detail; [[shadow]]s that are too dark are rendered as black. The loss of detail in the highlights is not abrupt with film, or in dark shadows with digital sensors. \"Highlight burn-out\" of digital sensors, is not usually abrupt in output images due to the tone mapping required to fit their large dynamic range into the more limited dynamic range of the output (be it SDR display or printing). Because sensor elements for different colours saturate in turn, there can be hue or saturation shift in burnt-out highlights.\n\nSome digital cameras can show these blown highlights in the image review, allowing the photographer to re-shoot the picture with a modified exposure. Others compensate for the total contrast of a scene by selectively exposing darker pixels longer. A third technique is used by Fujifilm in its [[FinePix S3 Pro]] digital SLR. The image sensor contains additional [[photodiode]]s of lower sensitivity than the main ones; these retain detail in parts of the image too bright for the main sensor.\n\n[[High-dynamic-range imaging]] (HDR) addresses this problem by increasing the dynamic range of images by either\n*increasing the dynamic range of the image sensor or\n*by using exposure [[bracketing]] and post-processing the separate images to create a single image with a higher dynamic range.\n\n\n{{Further2|[[Crushed black|Exposure]]}}\n\n===Storage===\nMany [[camera phone]]s and most digital cameras use [[memory card]]s having [[flash memory]] to store image data. The majority of cards for separate cameras are [[Secure Digital card|Secure Digital]] (SD) format; many are [[CompactFlash]] (CF) and the other formats are rare. [[XQD card]] format was the last new form of card, targeted at high-definition camcorders and high-resolution digital photo cameras. Most modern digital cameras also use [[internal memory]] for a limited capacity for pictures that can be transferred to or from the card or through the camera's connections; even without a memory card inserted into the camera.\n\nMemory cards can hold vast numbers of photos, requiring attention only when the memory card is full. For most users, this means hundreds of quality photos stored on the same memory card. Images may be transferred to other media for archival or personal use. Cards with high speed and capacity are suited to video and [[burst mode (photography)|burst mode]] (capture several photographs in a quick succession).\n\nBecause photographers rely on the integrity of image files, it is important to take proper care of memory cards. Common advocacy calls for formatting of the cards after transferring the images onto a computer. However, since all cameras only do quick formatting of cards, it is advisable to carry out a more thorough formatting using appropriate software on a PC once in a while. Effectively, this involves scanning of the cards to search for possible errors.\n\n==Market impact==\nIn late 2002, the cheapest digital cameras were available in the United States for around $100.<ref>http://www.kegel.com/cameras.html</ref> At the same time, many discount stores with photo labs introduced a \"digital front end\", allowing consumers to obtain true chemical prints (as opposed to ink-jet prints) in an hour. These prices were similar to those of prints made from film negatives. However, because digital images have a different aspect ratio than 35&nbsp;mm film images, people have started to realize that 4x6 inch prints crop some of the image off the print. Some photofinishers have started offering prints with the same aspect ratio as the digital cameras record.\n\nIn July 2003, digital cameras entered the [[disposable camera]] market with the release of the [[Ritz Dakota Digital]], a 1.2-megapixel (1280 x 960) CMOS-based digital camera costing only $11 (USD). Following the familiar single-use concept long in use with film cameras, Ritz intended the Dakota Digital for single use. When the pre-programmed 25-picture limit is reached, the camera is returned to the store, and the consumer receives back prints and a CD-ROM with their photos. The camera is then refurbished and resold.\n\nSince the introduction of the Dakota Digital, a number of similar single-use digital cameras have appeared. Most single-use digital cameras are nearly identical to the original Dakota Digital in specifications and function, though a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions (such as higher image resolutions and LCD screens). Most, if not all these single-use digital cameras cost less than $20 (USD), not including processing. However, the huge demand for complex digital cameras at competitive prices has often caused manufacturing shortcuts, evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions, high parts prices, and short service life. Some digital cameras offer only a 90-day warranty.\n\nSince 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1039455/digitalfilm.html|title=Digital outsells film, but film still king to some|author=|date=|website=Macworld|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> Prices of 35mm [[compact camera]]s have dropped with manufacturers further outsourcing to countries such as China.

They will continue to produce the low-end [[Nikon FM10]], and the high-end [[Nikon F6]]. In the same month, Konica Minolta announced it was pulling out of the camera business altogether. The price of 35mm and [[Advanced Photo System|APS (Advanced Photo System)]] compact cameras have dropped, probably due to direct competition from digital and the resulting growth of the offer of second-hand film cameras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdnonline.com/pdn/prodtech/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001843429&imw=Y |title=Nikon to End Many Film-Related Products |date=2006-01-11 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223212543/http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/prodtech/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001843429&imw=Y |archive-date=2007-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pentax have reduced production of film cameras but not halted it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1086134375.html |title=Pentax plans to focus on digital |date=2004-06-01 |first=Michael R. |last=Tomkins |publisher=The Imaging Resource |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The technology has improved so rapidly that one of Kodak's film cameras was discontinued before it was awarded a \"camera of the year\" award later in the year. The decline in film camera sales has also led to a decline in purchases of film for such cameras. In November 2004, a German division of [[Agfa-Gevaert]], AgfaPhoto, split off. Within six months it filed for bankruptcy. Konica Minolta Photo Imaging, Inc. ended production of Color film and paper worldwide by March 31, 2007. In addition, by 2005, Kodak employed less than a third of the employees it had twenty years earlier. It is not known if these job losses in the film industry have been offset in the digital image industry. Digital cameras have decimated the film photography industry through declining use of the expensive film rolls and development chemicals previously required to develop the photos. This has had a dramatic effect on companies such as [[Fujifilm|Fuji]], [[Kodak]], and [[Agfa]]. Many stores that formerly offered [[photofinishing]] services or sold film no longer do, or have seen a tremendous decline. In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/eastman-kodak-files-for-bankruptcy/ |work=The New York Times |title=Eastman Kodak Files for Bankruptcy |date=2012-01-19}}</ref> (See [[Photographic film]].)\n\nIn addition, digital photography has resulted in some positive market impacts as well. The increasing popularity of products such as [[digital photo frame]]s and [[canvas print]]s is a direct result of the increasing popularity of digital photography.\n\n[[File:D'Arcy Norman, Professional iPhone Photographer (4728847341).jpg|thumb|A man takes a photo with a smartphone, holding it somewhat awkwardly, as the form factor of a phone is not optimized for use as a camera]]\nDigital camera sales peaked in March 2012 averaging about 11 million units a month, but sales have declined significantly ever since. By March 2014, about 3 million were purchased each month, about 30 percent of the peak sales total. The decline may have bottomed out, with sales average hovering around 3 million a month. The main competitor is [[smartphone]]s, most of which have built-in digital cameras, which routinely get better. Like most digital cameras, they also offer the ability to record videos.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pentaxforums.com/articles/photokina-2014/digital-camera-sales-trends.html |title=Digital Camera Sales Trends A declining trend that's slowly stabilizing |date=September 22, 2014}}</ref> While smartphones continue to improve on a technical level, their form factor is not optimized for use as a camera and battery life is typically more limited compared to a digital camera.\n\n===Social impact===\nDigital photography has made photography available to a larger group of people. The new technology and editing programs available to photographers has changed the way photographs are presented to the public. There are photographs that are so heavily [[photo manipulation|manipulated]] (\"photoshopped\") that they end up looking nothing like the original photograph and this changes the way they are perceived.<ref>Benovsky, Jiri. 2014. \"The Limits of Photography.\" ''International Journal Of Philosophical Studies'' 22, no. 5: 716\u2013733. ''Academic Search Complete'', EBSCO''host'' (Retrieved February 23, 2018).</ref> Until the advent of the digital camera, amateur photographers used either print or [[slide film]] for their cameras. Slides are developed and shown to an audience using a [[slide projector]]. Digital photography revolutionized the industry by eliminating the delay and cost. The ease of viewing, transferring, editing and distributing digital images allowed consumers to manage their digital photos with ordinary [[home computer]]s rather than specialized equipment.\n\n[[Camera phone]]s, being the majority of cameras, have arguably the largest impact. The user can set their [[smartphone]]s to upload their products to the Internet, preserving them even if the camera is destroyed or the images deleted. Some high street photography shops have self-service kiosks that allow images to be printed directly from smartphones via [[Bluetooth]] technology.\n\nArchivists and historians have noticed the transitory nature of digital media. Unlike film and print, which are tangible and immediately accessible to a person, digital image storage is ever-changing, with old media and decoding software becoming obsolete or inaccessible by new technologies. Historians are concerned that we are creating a historical void where information and details about an era would have been lost within either failed or inaccessible digital media. They recommend that professional and amateur users develop strategies for [[digital preservation]] by migrating stored digital images from old technologies to new.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.ca/Pages/NewsColumn.aspx?id=a1ac9c720a01040800b24c9a7f5ded73 |title=How long will my digital pictures last? |first=Rosie |last=Lombardi |date=2006-12-20 |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025725/http://www.pcworld.ca/Pages/NewsColumn.aspx?id=a1ac9c720a01040800b24c9a7f5ded73 |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> [[Scrapbooking|Scrapbookers]] who may have used film for creating artistic and personal memoirs may need to modify their approach to digital photo books to personalize them and retain the special qualities of traditional photo albums.\n\nThe [[world wide web|web]] has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1992 (an image of the [[CERN]] house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]]). Today [[photo sharing site]]s such as [[Flickr]], [[Picasa]], and [[PhotoBucket]], as well as [[social Web]] sites, are used by millions of people to share their pictures. In today's world digital photography and social media websites allow organizations and corporations to make photographs more accessible to a greater and more diverse population. For example, National Geographic Magazine has a Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram accounts and each one includes content aimed for the type of audience that are part of each social media community.<ref>Goldberg, Susan. 2017. \"OUR SOCIAL MEDIA MISSION.\" ''National Geographic'' 231, no. 4: 4.

Sensors with dynamic range in excess of 1,000,000:1 are in development, and software is also available to combine multiple non-HDR images (shot with different [[exposure (photography)|exposures]]) into an HDR image.\n*[[Motion blur]] can be dramatically removed by a [[flutter shutter]] (a flickering shutter that adds a signature to the blur, which postprocessing recognizes).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~aagrawal/sig06/sig06Main.html |title=Coded Exposure Photography: Motion Deblurring using Fluttered Shutter |first=Ramesh |last=Raskar |author2=Amit Agrawal |author3=Jack Tumblin |accessdate=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429183905/http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~aagrawal/sig06/sig06Main.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 }}</ref> It is not yet commercially available.\n*Advanced [[bokeh]] techniques use a hardware system of 2 sensors, one to take the photo as usual while the other records depth information.

This is needed to create attractive images of [[oil painting]]s, for instance. It is not yet commercially available, but some museums are starting to use it.\n*[[Dust reduction system]]s help keep dust off of image sensors. Originally introduced only by a few cameras like Olympus DSLRs, have now become standard in most models and brands of detachable lens camera, except the low-end or cheap ones.\n\nOther areas of progress include improved sensors, more powerful software, advanced camera processors (sometimes using more than one processor, e.g., the Canon 7d camera has 2 Digic 4 processors), enlarged [[gamut]] displays, built in GPS and WiFi, and computer-controlled lighting.\n\n==Comparison with film photography==\n{{Main|Digital versus film photography}}\n\n===Advantages already in consumer level cameras===\nThe primary advantage of consumer-level digital cameras is the low recurring cost, as users need not purchase photographic film. Processing costs may be reduced or even eliminated. Digicams tend also to be easier to carry and to use, than comparable film cameras. They more easily adapt to modern use of pictures. Some, particularly those that are [[smartphone]]s, can send their pictures directly to e-mail or [[web page]]s or other electronic distribution.\n\n===Advantages of professional digital cameras===\n[[File:SF-ggbridge-retouch.gif|thumb|right|225px|The [[Golden Gate Bridge]] retouched for painterly light effects]]\n*Immediate image review and deletion is possible; lighting and composition can be assessed immediately, which ultimately conserves storage space.\n*High volume of images to medium ratio; allowing for extensive photography sessions without changing film rolls. To most users a single memory card is sufficient for the lifetime of the camera whereas film rolls are a re-incurring cost of film cameras.\n*Faster workflow: Management (colour and file), manipulation and printing tools are more versatile than conventional film processes. However, batch processing of RAW files can be time consuming, even on a fast computer.\n*Much faster ingest of images, it will take no more than a few seconds to transfer a high resolution RAW file from a memory card vs many minutes to scan film with a high quality scanner. \n*Precision and reproducibility of processing: since processing in the digital domain is purely numerical, [[image processing]] using deterministic (non-random) algorithms is perfectly reproducible and eliminates variations common with photochemical processing that make many image processing techniques difficult if not impractical.\n*Digital manipulation: A digital image can be modified and manipulated much easier and faster than with traditional negative and print methods. The digital image to the right was captured in [[raw image format]], processed and output in 3 different ways from the source RAW file, then merged and further processed for color saturation and other special effects to produce a more dramatic result than was originally captured with the RAW image.\n\nManufacturers such as [[Nikon]] and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] have promoted the adoption of [[digital single-lens reflex camera]]s (DSLRs) by [[photojournalism|photojournalists]]. Images captured at 2+ [[megapixels]] are deemed of sufficient quality for small images in newspaper or magazine reproduction. Eight- to 24-megapixel images, found in modern digital SLRs, when combined with high-end lenses, can approximate the detail of film prints from [[35mm format|35 mm film]] based SLRs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/shootout.shtml |title=The Ultimate Shoot-Out |first=Michael |last=Reichmann |publisher=The Luminous Landscape |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060131220336/http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/shootout.shtml |archive-date=2006-01-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Disadvantages of digital cameras===\n*As with any sampled signal, the combination of regular (periodic) pixel structure of common electronic image sensors and regular (periodic) structure of (typically man-made) objects being photographed can cause objectionable [[aliasing]] artefacts, such as false colors when using cameras using a [[Bayer pattern]] sensor. Aliasing is also present in film, but typically manifests itself in less obvious ways (such as increased [[granularity]]) due to the stochastic grain structure (stochastic sampling) of film.\nA large number of mechanical film camera existed, such as the Leica M2. These battery-less devices had advantages over digital devices in harsh or remote conditions.\n\n===Equivalent features===\n; Image noise and grain\n\nNoise in a digital camera's image may sometimes be visually similar to [[film grain]] in a film camera.\n\n; Speed of use\n\nTurn of the century digital cameras had a long start-up delay compared to film cameras, i.e., the delay from when they are turned on until they are ready to take the first shot, but this is no longer the case for modern digital cameras with start-up times under 1/4 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html |title=D90 from Nikon, Key Features |publisher=Nikon Inc. |accessdate=2009-09-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909045722/http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25446/D90.html|archivedate=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n; Frame rate\n\nWhile some film cameras could reach up to 14 fps, like the Canon F-1 with rare high speed motor drive.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film111.html |title=New F-1 High Speed Motor Drive Camera |website=Canon Camera Museum}}</ref> professional digital SLR cameras can take still photographs at highest [[frame rate]]s. While the Sony SLT technology allows rates of up to 12 fps, the Canon EOS-1Dx can take stills at a 14 fps rate. The Nikon F5 is limited to 36 continuous frames (the length of the film) without the cumbersome bulk film back, while the digital Nikon D5 is able to capture over 100 14-bit [[raw image format|RAW]] images before its [[buffer (computer science)|buffer]] must be cleared and the remaining space on the [[storage media]] can be used.\n\n; Image longevity\n\nDepending on the materials and how they are stored, analog photographic film and prints may fade as they age. Similarly, the media on which digital images are stored or printed can decay or become corrupt, leading to a loss of image integrity.\n\n; Colour reproduction\n\nColour reproduction ([[gamut]]) is dependent on the type and quality of film or sensor used and the quality of the optical system and film processing. Different films and sensors have different color sensitivity; the photographer needs to understand his equipment, the light conditions, and the media used to ensure accurate colour reproduction. Many digital cameras offer RAW format (sensor data), which makes it possible to choose color space in the development stage regardless of camera settings.\n\nEven in RAW format, however, the sensor and the camera's dynamics can only capture colors within the gamut supported by the hardware. When that image is transferred for reproduction on any device, the widest achievable gamut is the gamut that the end device supports. For a monitor, it is the gamut of the display device. For a photographic print, it is the gamut of the device that prints the image on a specific type of paper. Color gamut or Color space is an area where points of color fit in a three-dimensional space.\n\nProfessional photographers often use specially designed and calibrated monitors that help them to reproduce color accurately and consistently.\n\n===Frame aspect ratios===\nMost digital point & shoot cameras have an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.33 (4:3), the same as [[analog television]] or early movies. However, a [[135 film|35 mm]] picture's aspect ratio is 1.5 (3:2). Several digital cameras take photos in either ratio, and nearly all digital SLRs take pictures in a 3:2 ratio, as most can use lenses designed for 35&nbsp;mm film. Some photo labs print photos on 4:3 ratio paper, as well as the existing 3:2. In 2005 Panasonic launched the first consumer camera with a native aspect ratio of 16:9, matching [[HDTV]]. This is similar to a 7:4 aspect ratio, which was a common size for APS film. Different aspect ratios is one of the reasons consumers have issues when cropping photos.

Some can be used as [[webcam]]s, some can use the [[PictBridge]] standard to connect to a printer without using a computer, and some can display pictures directly on a television set. Similarly, many [[camcorder]]s can take still photographs, and store them on [[videotape]] or on [[flash memory]] cards with the same functionality as [[digital camera]]s.\n\nDigital photography is one of the most exceptional instances of the shift from converting conventional analog information to digital information. This shift is so tremendous because it was a chemical and mechanical process and became an all digital process with a built in computer in all digital cameras.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/cameras-photography/digital/digital-camera.htm|title=How Digital Cameras Work|date=2006-11-29|newspaper=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2016-10-11}}</ref>\n\n===Performance metrics===\n\nThe quality of a digital image is a composite of various factors, many of which are similar to those of film cameras. [[Pixel count]] (typically listed in [[megapixel]]s, millions of pixels) is only one of the major factors, though it is the most heavily marketed [[figure of merit]]. Digital camera manufacturers advertise this figure because consumers can use it to easily compare camera capabilities. It is not, however, the major factor in evaluating a digital camera for most applications. The processing system inside the camera that turns the raw data into a color-balanced and pleasing photograph is usually more critical, which is why some 4+ megapixel cameras perform better than higher-end cameras.<!-- These factors are just too many to list. -->\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer= Image at left has a higher [[pixel count]] than the one to the right, but lower [[spatial resolution]].\n| align= right\n| image1= Matakis - blurred.jpg\n| width1= 143\n| image2= MARTAKIS1.jpg\n| width2= 130\n}}\nResolution in pixels is not the only measure of image quality. A larger sensor with the same number of pixels generally produces a better image than a smaller one. One of the most important differences is an improvement in [[image noise]]. This is one of the advantages of digital SLR (single-lens reflex) cameras, which have larger sensors than simpler cameras (so-called point and shoot cameras) of the same resolution.\n*'''Lens quality:''' resolution, [[image distortion|distortion]], [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] (see [[Lens (optics)]])\n*'''Capture medium:''' CMOS, CCD, [[negative film]], [[reversal film]] etc.\n*'''Capture format:''' pixel count, digital file type ([[raw image format|RAW]], [[TIFF]], [[JPEG]]), [[film format]] ([[135 film]], [[120 film]], 5x4, 10x8).\n*'''Processing:''' digital and/or chemical processing of 'negative' and 'print'.\n\n====Pixel counts====\nThe number of [[pixel]]s ''n'' for a given maximum [[image resolution|resolution]] (''w'' horizontal pixels by ''h'' vertical pixels) is the product ''n''= ''w \u00d7 h''. This yields e. g. 1.92 megapixels (1,920,000 pixels) for an image of 1600 \u00d7 1200. \n\nThe [[pixel count]] quoted by manufacturers can be misleading as it may not be the number of full-color pixels. For cameras using single-chip [[image sensor]]s the number claimed is the total number of single-color-sensitive photosensors, whether they have different locations in the plane, as with the [[Bayer sensor]], or in stacks of three co-located photosensors as in the [[Foveon X3 sensor]]. However, the images have different numbers of RGB pixels: Bayer-sensor cameras produce as many RGB pixels as photosensors via [[demosaicing]] (interpolation), while Foveon sensors produce uninterpolated image files with one-third as many RGB pixels as photosensors. Comparisons of megapixel ratings of these two types of sensors are sometimes a subject of dispute.<ref>[http://www.popphoto.com/howto/4276/foveon-x3-sensor-claims-put-to-the-test.html Foveon X3 Sensor Claims Put to the Test] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013144153/http://www.popphoto.com/howto/4276/foveon-x3-sensor-claims-put-to-the-test.html |date=2007-10-13}}</ref>\n\nThe relative increase in detail resulting from an increase in resolution is better compared by looking at the number of pixels across (or down) the picture, rather than the total number of pixels in the picture area. For example, a sensor of 2560 \u00d7 1600 sensor elements is described as \"4 megapixels\" (2560 \u00d7 1600= 4,096,000). Increasing to 3200 \u00d7 2048 increases the pixels in the picture to 6,553,600 (6.5 megapixels), a factor of 1.6, but the pixels per cm in the picture (at the same image size) increases by only 1.25 times. A measure of the comparative increase in linear resolution is the square root of the increase in area resolution, i.e., megapixels in the entire image.\n\n====Dynamic range====\nPractical imaging systems both digital and film, have a limited \"[[dynamic range]]\": the range of [[luminosity]] that can be reproduced accurately. [[Clipping (photography)|Highlights]] of the subject that are too bright are rendered as white, with no detail; [[shadow]]s that are too dark are rendered as black. The loss of detail in the highlights is not abrupt with film, or in dark shadows with digital sensors. \"Highlight burn-out\" of digital sensors, is not usually abrupt in output images due to the tone mapping required to fit their large dynamic range into the more limited dynamic range of the output (be it SDR display or printing). Because sensor elements for different colours saturate in turn, there can be hue or saturation shift in burnt-out highlights.\n\nSome digital cameras can show these blown highlights in the image review, allowing the photographer to re-shoot the picture with a modified exposure. Others compensate for the total contrast of a scene by selectively exposing darker pixels longer. A third technique is used by Fujifilm in its [[FinePix S3 Pro]] digital SLR. The image sensor contains additional [[photodiode]]s of lower sensitivity than the main ones; these retain detail in parts of the image too bright for the main sensor.\n\n[[High-dynamic-range imaging]] (HDR) addresses this problem by increasing the dynamic range of images by either\n*increasing the dynamic range of the image sensor or\n*by using exposure [[bracketing]] and post-processing the separate images to create a single image with a higher dynamic range.\n\n\n{{Further2|[[Crushed black|Exposure]]}}\n\n===Storage===\nMany [[camera phone]]s and most digital cameras use [[memory card]]s having [[flash memory]] to store image data. The majority of cards for separate cameras are [[Secure Digital card|Secure Digital]] (SD) format; many are [[CompactFlash]] (CF) and the other formats are rare. [[XQD card]] format was the last new form of card, targeted at high-definition camcorders and high-resolution digital photo cameras. Most modern digital cameras also use [[internal memory]] for a limited capacity for pictures that can be transferred to or from the card or through the camera's connections; even without a memory card inserted into the camera.\n\nMemory cards can hold vast numbers of photos, requiring attention only when the memory card is full. For most users, this means hundreds of quality photos stored on the same memory card. Images may be transferred to other media for archival or personal use. Cards with high speed and capacity are suited to video and [[burst mode (photography)|burst mode]] (capture several photographs in a quick succession).\n\nBecause photographers rely on the integrity of image files, it is important to take proper care of memory cards. Common advocacy calls for formatting of the cards after transferring the images onto a computer. However, since all cameras only do quick formatting of cards, it is advisable to carry out a more thorough formatting using appropriate software on a PC once in a while. Effectively, this involves scanning of the cards to search for possible errors.\n\n==Market impact==\nIn late 2002, the cheapest digital cameras were available in the United States for around $100.<ref>http://www.kegel.com/cameras.html</ref> At the same time, many discount stores with photo labs introduced a \"digital front end\", allowing consumers to obtain true chemical prints (as opposed to ink-jet prints) in an hour. These prices were similar to those of prints made from film negatives. However, because digital images have a different aspect ratio than 35&nbsp;mm film images, people have started to realize that 4x6 inch prints crop some of the image off the print. Some photofinishers have started offering prints with the same aspect ratio as the digital cameras record.\n\nIn July 2003, digital cameras entered the [[disposable camera]] market with the release of the [[Ritz Dakota Digital]], a 1.2-megapixel (1280 x 960) CMOS-based digital camera costing only $11 (USD). Following the familiar single-use concept long in use with film cameras, Ritz intended the Dakota Digital for single use. When the pre-programmed 25-picture limit is reached, the camera is returned to the store, and the consumer receives back prints and a CD-ROM with their photos. The camera is then refurbished and resold.\n\nSince the introduction of the Dakota Digital, a number of similar single-use digital cameras have appeared. Most single-use digital cameras are nearly identical to the original Dakota Digital in specifications and function, though a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions (such as higher image resolutions and LCD screens). Most, if not all these single-use digital cameras cost less than $20 (USD), not including processing. However, the huge demand for complex digital cameras at competitive prices has often caused manufacturing shortcuts, evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions, high parts prices, and short service life. Some digital cameras offer only a 90-day warranty.\n\nSince 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1039455/digitalfilm.html|title=Digital outsells film, but film still king to some|author=|date=|website=Macworld|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> Prices of 35mm [[compact camera]]s have dropped with manufacturers further outsourcing to countries such as China.

They will continue to produce the low-end [[Nikon FM10]], and the high-end [[Nikon F6]]. In the same month, Konica Minolta announced it was pulling out of the camera business altogether. The price of 35mm and [[Advanced Photo System|APS (Advanced Photo System)]] compact cameras have dropped, probably due to direct competition from digital and the resulting growth of the offer of second-hand film cameras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdnonline.com/pdn/prodtech/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001843429&imw=Y |title=Nikon to End Many Film-Related Products |date=2006-01-11 |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223212543/http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/prodtech/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001843429&imw=Y |archive-date=2007-02-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pentax have reduced production of film cameras but not halted it.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imaging-resource.com/NEWS/1086134375.html |title=Pentax plans to focus on digital |date=2004-06-01 |first=Michael R. |last=Tomkins |publisher=The Imaging Resource |accessdate=2007-04-03}}</ref> The technology has improved so rapidly that one of Kodak's film cameras was discontinued before it was awarded a \"camera of the year\" award later in the year. The decline in film camera sales has also led to a decline in purchases of film for such cameras. In November 2004, a German division of [[Agfa-Gevaert]], AgfaPhoto, split off. Within six months it filed for bankruptcy. Konica Minolta Photo Imaging, Inc. ended production of Color film and paper worldwide by March 31, 2007. In addition, by 2005, Kodak employed less than a third of the employees it had twenty years earlier. It is not known if these job losses in the film industry have been offset in the digital image industry. Digital cameras have decimated the film photography industry through declining use of the expensive film rolls and development chemicals previously required to develop the photos. This has had a dramatic effect on companies such as [[Fujifilm|Fuji]], [[Kodak]], and [[Agfa]]. Many stores that formerly offered [[photofinishing]] services or sold film no longer do, or have seen a tremendous decline. In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/01/19/eastman-kodak-files-for-bankruptcy/ |work=The New York Times |title=Eastman Kodak Files for Bankruptcy |date=2012-01-19}}</ref> (See [[Photographic film]].)\n\nIn addition, digital photography has resulted in some positive market impacts as well. The increasing popularity of products such as [[digital photo frame]]s and [[canvas print]]s is a direct result of the increasing popularity of digital photography.\n\n[[File:D'Arcy Norman, Professional iPhone Photographer (4728847341).jpg|thumb|A man takes a photo with a smartphone, holding it somewhat awkwardly, as the form factor of a phone is not optimized for use as a camera]]\nDigital camera sales peaked in March 2012 averaging about 11 million units a month, but sales have declined significantly ever since. By March 2014, about 3 million were purchased each month, about 30 percent of the peak sales total. The decline may have bottomed out, with sales average hovering around 3 million a month. The main competitor is [[smartphone]]s, most of which have built-in digital cameras, which routinely get better. Like most digital cameras, they also offer the ability to record videos.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pentaxforums.com/articles/photokina-2014/digital-camera-sales-trends.html |title=Digital Camera Sales Trends A declining trend that's slowly stabilizing |date=September 22, 2014}}</ref> While smartphones continue to improve on a technical level, their form factor is not optimized for use as a camera and battery life is typically more limited compared to a digital camera.\n\n===Social impact===\nDigital photography has made photography available to a larger group of people. The new technology and editing programs available to photographers has changed the way photographs are presented to the public. There are photographs that are so heavily [[photo manipulation|manipulated]] (\"photoshopped\") that they end up looking nothing like the original photograph and this changes the way they are perceived.<ref>Benovsky, Jiri. 2014. \"The Limits of Photography.\" ''International Journal Of Philosophical Studies'' 22, no. 5: 716\u2013733. ''Academic Search Complete'', EBSCO''host'' (Retrieved February 23, 2018).</ref> Until the advent of the digital camera, amateur photographers used either print or [[slide film]] for their cameras. Slides are developed and shown to an audience using a [[slide projector]]. Digital photography revolutionized the industry by eliminating the delay and cost. The ease of viewing, transferring, editing and distributing digital images allowed consumers to manage their digital photos with ordinary [[home computer]]s rather than specialized equipment.\n\n[[Camera phone]]s, being the majority of cameras, have arguably the largest impact. The user can set their [[smartphone]]s to upload their products to the Internet, preserving them even if the camera is destroyed or the images deleted. Some high street photography shops have self-service kiosks that allow images to be printed directly from smartphones via [[Bluetooth]] technology.\n\nArchivists and historians have noticed the transitory nature of digital media. Unlike film and print, which are tangible and immediately accessible to a person, digital image storage is ever-changing, with old media and decoding software becoming obsolete or inaccessible by new technologies. Historians are concerned that we are creating a historical void where information and details about an era would have been lost within either failed or inaccessible digital media. They recommend that professional and amateur users develop strategies for [[digital preservation]] by migrating stored digital images from old technologies to new.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.ca/Pages/NewsColumn.aspx?id=a1ac9c720a01040800b24c9a7f5ded73 |title=How long will my digital pictures last? |first=Rosie |last=Lombardi |date=2006-12-20 |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |accessdate=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928025725/http://www.pcworld.ca/Pages/NewsColumn.aspx?id=a1ac9c720a01040800b24c9a7f5ded73 |archivedate=2007-09-28 }}</ref> [[Scrapbooking|Scrapbookers]] who may have used film for creating artistic and personal memoirs may need to modify their approach to digital photo books to personalize them and retain the special qualities of traditional photo albums.\n\nThe [[world wide web|web]] has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] in 1992 (an image of the [[CERN]] house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]]). Today [[photo sharing site]]s such as [[Flickr]], [[Picasa]], and [[PhotoBucket]], as well as [[social Web]] sites, are used by millions of people to share their pictures. In today's world digital photography and social media websites allow organizations and corporations to make photographs more accessible to a greater and more diverse population. For example, National Geographic Magazine has a Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram accounts and each one includes content aimed for the type of audience that are part of each social media community.<ref>Goldberg, Susan. 2017. \"OUR SOCIAL MEDIA MISSION.\" ''National Geographic'' 231, no. 4: 4.

Here are a few examples.\n*[[3D models]] can be [[3D reconstruction from multiple images|created from collections of normal images]]. The resulting scene can be viewed from novel viewpoints, but creating the model is very computationally intensive. An example is [[Microsoft Live Labs Photosynth|Microsoft's Photosynth]], which provided some models of famous places as examples.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://labs.live.com/photosynth/ |title=Photosynth |publisher=[[Microsoft Research]] |accessdate=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205184512/http://labs.live.com/photosynth/ |archivedate=2007-02-05 }}</ref>\n*[[Panoramic photography|Panoramic photographs]] can be created directly in camera without the need for any external processing. Some cameras feature a [[panoramic photography#3D Panorama|3D Panorama]] capability, combining shots taken with a single lens from different angles to create a sense of depth.\n*[[High-dynamic-range imaging|High-dynamic-range]] cameras and displays are commercially available. Sensors with dynamic range in excess of 1,000,000:1 are in development, and software is also available to combine multiple non-HDR images (shot with different [[exposure (photography)|exposures]]) into an HDR image.\n*[[Motion blur]] can be dramatically removed by a [[flutter shutter]] (a flickering shutter that adds a signature to the blur, which postprocessing recognizes).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~aagrawal/sig06/sig06Main.html |title=Coded Exposure Photography: Motion Deblurring using Fluttered Shutter |first=Ramesh |last=Raskar |author2=Amit Agrawal |author3=Jack Tumblin |accessdate=2007-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429183905/http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~aagrawal/sig06/sig06Main.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 }}</ref> It is not yet commercially available.\n*Advanced [[bokeh]] techniques use a hardware system of 2 sensors, one to take the photo as usual while the other records depth information.

This is needed to create attractive images of [[oil painting]]s, for instance. It is not yet commercially available, but some museums are starting to use it.\n*[[Dust reduction system]]s help keep dust off of image sensors. Originally introduced only by a few cameras like Olympus DSLRs, have now become standard in most models and brands of detachable lens camera, except the low-end or cheap ones.\n\nOther areas of progress include improved sensors, more powerful software, advanced camera processors (sometimes using more than one processor, e.g., the Canon 7d camera has 2 Digic 4 processors), enlarged [[gamut]] displays, built in GPS and WiFi, and computer-controlled lighting.\n\n==Comparison with film photography==\n{{Main|Digital versus film photography}}\n\n===Advantages already in consumer level cameras===\nThe primary advantage of consumer-level digital cameras is the low recurring cost, as users need not purchase photographic film. Processing costs may be reduced or even eliminated. Digicams tend also to be easier to carry and to use, than comparable film cameras. They more easily adapt to modern use of pictures. Some, particularly those that are [[smartphone]]s, can send their pictures directly to e-mail or [[web page]]s or other electronic distribution.\n\n===Advantages of professional digital cameras===\n[[File:SF-ggbridge-retouch.gif|thumb|right|225px|The [[Golden Gate Bridge]] retouched for painterly light effects]]\n*Immediate image review and deletion is possible; lighting and composition can be assessed immediately, which ultimately conserves storage space.\n*High volume of images to medium ratio; allowing for extensive photography sessions without changing film rolls. To most users a single memory card is sufficient for the lifetime of the camera whereas film rolls are a re-incurring cost of film cameras.\n*Faster workflow: Management (colour and file), manipulation and printing tools are more versatile than conventional film processes. However, batch processing of RAW files can be time consuming, even on a fast computer.\n*Much faster ingest of images, it will take no more than a few seconds to transfer a high resolution RAW file from a memory card vs many minutes to scan film with a high quality scanner. \n*Precision and reproducibility of processing: since processing in the digital domain is purely numerical, image processing using deterministic (non-random) algorithms is perfectly reproducible and eliminates variations common with photochemical processing that make many image processing techniques difficult if not impractical.\n*Digital manipulation: A digital image can be modified and manipulated much easier and faster than with traditional negative and print methods. The digital image to the right was captured in [[raw image format]], processed and output in 3 different ways from the source RAW file, then merged and further processed for color saturation and other special effects to produce a more dramatic result than was originally captured with the RAW image.\n\nManufacturers such as [[Nikon]] and [[Canon Inc.|Canon]] have promoted the adoption of [[digital single-lens reflex camera]]s (DSLRs) by [[photojournalism|photojournalists]]. Images captured at 2+ [[megapixels]] are deemed of sufficient quality for small images in newspaper or magazine reproduction. Eight- to 24-megapixel images, found in modern digital SLRs, when combined with high-end lenses, can approximate the detail of film prints from [[35mm format|35 mm film]] based SLRs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/shootout.shtml |title=The Ultimate Shoot-Out |first=Michael |last=Reichmann |publisher=The Luminous Landscape |accessdate=2007-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060131220336/http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/shootout.shtml |archive-date=2006-01-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=September 2011}}\n\n===Disadvantages of digital cameras===\n*As with any sampled signal, the combination of regular (periodic) pixel structure of common electronic image sensors and regular (periodic) structure of (typically man-made) objects being photographed can cause objectionable [[aliasing]] artefacts, such as false colors when using cameras using a [[Bayer pattern]] sensor. Aliasing is also present in film, but typically manifests itself in less obvious ways (such as increased [[granularity]]) due to the stochastic grain structure (stochastic sampling) of film.\nA large number of mechanical film camera existed, such as the Leica M2. These battery-less devices had advantages over digital devices in harsh or remote conditions.\n\n===Equivalent features===\n; Image noise and grain\n\nNoise in a digital camera's image may sometimes be visually similar to [[film grain]] in a film camera.\n\n; Speed of use\n\nTurn of the century digital cameras had a long start-up delay compared to film cameras, i.e., the delay from when they are turned on until they are ready to take the first shot, but this is no longer the case for modern digital cameras with start-up times under 1/4 seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikonusa.com/Find-Your-Nikon/Product/Digital-SLR/25446/D90.html |title=D90 from Nikon, Key Features |publisher=Nikon Inc. |accessdate=2009-09-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909045722/http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/25446/D90.html|archivedate=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n; Frame rate\n\nWhile some film cameras could reach up to 14 fps, like the Canon F-1 with rare high speed motor drive.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://global.canon/en/c-museum/product/film111.html |title=New F-1 High Speed Motor Drive Camera |website=Canon Camera Museum}}</ref> professional digital SLR cameras can take still photographs at highest [[frame rate]]s. While the Sony SLT technology allows rates of up to 12 fps, the Canon EOS-1Dx can take stills at a 14 fps rate. The Nikon F5 is limited to 36 continuous frames (the length of the film) without the cumbersome bulk film back, while the digital Nikon D5 is able to capture over 100 14-bit [[raw image format|RAW]] images before its [[buffer (computer science)|buffer]] must be cleared and the remaining space on the [[storage media]] can be used.\n\n; Image longevity\n\nDepending on the materials and how they are stored, analog photographic film and prints may fade as they age. Similarly, the media on which digital images are stored or printed can decay or become corrupt, leading to a loss of image integrity.\n\n; Colour reproduction\n\nColour reproduction ([[gamut]]) is dependent on the type and quality of film or sensor used and the quality of the optical system and film processing. Different films and sensors have different color sensitivity; the photographer needs to understand his equipment, the light conditions, and the media used to ensure accurate colour reproduction. Many digital cameras offer RAW format (sensor data), which makes it possible to choose color space in the development stage regardless of camera settings.\n\nEven in RAW format, however, the sensor and the camera's dynamics can only capture colors within the gamut supported by the hardware. When that image is transferred for reproduction on any device, the widest achievable gamut is the gamut that the end device supports. For a monitor, it is the gamut of the display device. For a photographic print, it is the gamut of the device that prints the image on a specific type of paper. Color gamut or Color space is an area where points of color fit in a three-dimensional space.\n\nProfessional photographers often use specially designed and calibrated monitors that help them to reproduce color accurately and consistently.\n\n===Frame aspect ratios===\nMost digital point & shoot cameras have an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of 1.33 (4:3), the same as [[analog television]] or early movies. However, a [[135 film|35 mm]] picture's aspect ratio is 1.5 (3:2). Several digital cameras take photos in either ratio, and nearly all digital SLRs take pictures in a 3:2 ratio, as most can use lenses designed for 35&nbsp;mm film. Some photo labs print photos on 4:3 ratio paper, as well as the existing 3:2. In 2005 Panasonic launched the first consumer camera with a native aspect ratio of 16:9, matching [[HDTV]]. This is similar to a 7:4 aspect ratio, which was a common size for APS film. Different aspect ratios is one of the reasons consumers have issues when cropping photos. An aspect ratio of 4:3 translates to a size of 4.5\"x6.0\". This loses half an inch when printing on the \"standard\" size of 4\"x6\", an aspect ratio of 3:2. Similar cropping occurs when printing on other sizes, i.e., 5\"x7\", 8\"x10\", or 11\"x14\".\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Analog photography]]\n*[[Automatic image annotation]]\n*[[Camcorder]]\n*[[Chimping]]\n*[[Design rule for Camera File system]] (DCF)\n*[[Digital camera]]\n*Digital [[image editing]]\n*[[Digital imaging]]\n*[[Digital microscope]]\n**[[USB microscope]]\n*[[Digital photo frame]]\n*[[Digital Print Order Format]] (DPOF)\n*[[Digital Revolution]]\n*[[Digital single-lens reflex camera]]\n*[[Digital watermarking]]\n*[[Exif]] (Exchangeable image file format)\n*[[Geotagged photograph]]\n*[[High-dynamic-range imaging]]\n*[[Lenses for SLR and DSLR cameras]]\n*[[List of digital camera brands]]\n*[[Online proofing]]\n*[[Raw image format]]\n*[[3D camcorder]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://users.cs.duke.edu/~parr/photography/faq.html Digital Photography FAQ]\n\n{{Digital systems}}\n{{Digital art}}\n{{Photography}}\n\n[[Category:Digital photography| ]]\n", "name_user": "Jarble", "label": "safe", "comment": "linking", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_photography"}

The global health crisis and the uncertainly resulting from it profoundly affected organisations' operations as well as individuals \u2013 both employed and independent \u2013 across the sector. Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and an awareness that there would be much new cultural work being produced which had been inspired by the events.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available, equally, financial stimulus from governments, and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East-Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.

Arts and culture sector organisations attempted to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.\n\nBy March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed. In response there were intensive efforts to provide alternative services through digital platforms, and an awareness that there would be much new cultural work being produced which had been inspired by the events.\n\nMany individuals across the sector would temporarily or permanently lose contracts or employment with varying degrees of warning and financial assistance available, equally, financial stimulus from governments, and charities for artists, would provide greatly differing levels of support depending on the sector and the country.\n\n==Closures== \nThrough the first months of 2020, arts and culture sector organisations around the world progressively restricted their public activities and closed completely due to the coronavirus pandemic. Starting with China, and East-Asia, by mid-to-late March most organisations worldwide had either closed voluntarily or by government mandate.
