Individuals had to work together to find fuel for the fire, maintain the fire, and complete other necessary tasks.

Parts of the plant such as stems, mature leaves, enlarged roots, and tubers would have been inaccessible as a food source due to the indigestibility of raw [[cellulose]] and [[starch]]. Cooking, however, made starchy and fibrous foods edible and greatly increased the diversity of other foods available to early humans. Toxin-containing foods including seeds and similar carbohydrate sources, such as [[cyanogenic glycosides]] found in [[linseed]] and [[cassava]], were incorporated into their diets as cooking rendered them non-toxic.<ref name=\"diet\">{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=Ann Brower|date=April 1984|title=Hominid Dietary Selection Before Fire|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=151\u2013168|doi=10.1086/203106}}</ref>\n\nCooking could also kill [[Human parasite|parasites]], reduce the amount of energy required for chewing and digestion, and release more nutrients from plants and meat. Due to the difficulty of chewing raw meat and digesting tough proteins (e.g. [[collagen]]) and carbohydrates, the development of cooking served as an effective mechanism to efficiently process meat and allow for its consumption in larger quantities. With its high caloric density and store of important nutrients, meat thus became a staple in the diet of early humans.<ref>Luca, F., G.H. Perry, and A. Di Rienzo. \"Evolutionary Adaptations to Dietary Changes.\" ''Annual Review of Nutrition''. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 21 August 2010.

Studies show that caloric intake from cooking starches improves 12-35% and 45-78% for protein.

In addition, due to the shape of the molar cusps, it is inferred that the diet was more leaf or fruit\u2013based.

As a result, the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and organs in the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]] decreased in size. This is in contrast to other primates, where a larger digestive tract is needed for fermentation of long carbohydrate chains.

Individuals had to work together to find fuel for the fire, maintain the fire, and complete other necessary tasks.

Genus ''[[Homo]]'' was able to break through the limit by cooking food to lower their feeding time and be able to absorb more nutrients to accommodate the increasing need for energy.<ref name=\":7\" /> In addition, scientists argue that the ''Homo'' species was also able to obtain nutrients like DHA ([[Docosahexaenoic acid]]) from algae that were especially beneficial and critical for brain evolution and, as mentioned in the previous sections, the detoxification of the cooking process enabled early humans to access these resources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bradbury|first=Joanne|date=10 May 2011|title=Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA): An Ancient Nutrient for the Modern Human Brain|journal=Nutrients|language=en|volume=3|issue=5|pages=529\u2013554|doi=10.3390/nu3050529|pmc=3257695|pmid=22254110}}</ref>\n\n==== Changes to diet ====\nBefore the advent of fire, the hominid diet was limited to mostly plant parts composed of simple sugars and [[carbohydrate]]s such as seeds, flowers, and fleshy fruits. Parts of the plant such as stems, mature leaves, enlarged roots, and tubers would have been inaccessible as a food source due to the indigestibility of raw [[cellulose]] and [[starch]]. Cooking, however, made starchy and fibrous foods edible and greatly increased the diversity of other foods available to early humans. Toxin-containing foods including seeds and similar carbohydrate sources, such as [[cyanogenic glycosides]] found in [[linseed]] and [[cassava]], were incorporated into their diets as cooking rendered them non-toxic.<ref name=\"diet\">{{cite journal|last=Stahl|first=Ann Brower|date=April 1984|title=Hominid Dietary Selection Before Fire|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=25|issue=2|pages=151\u2013168|doi=10.1086/203106}}</ref>\n\nCooking could also kill [[Human parasite|parasites]], reduce the amount of energy required for chewing and digestion, and release more nutrients from plants and meat. Due to the difficulty of chewing raw meat and digesting tough proteins (e.g. [[collagen]]) and carbohydrates, the development of cooking served as an effective mechanism to efficiently process meat and allow for its consumption in larger quantities. With its high caloric density and store of important nutrients, meat thus became a staple in the diet of early humans.<ref>Luca, F., G.H. Perry, and A. Di Rienzo. \"Evolutionary Adaptations to Dietary Changes.\" ''Annual Review of Nutrition''. U.S. National Library of Medicine, 21 August 2010.

Studies show that caloric intake from cooking starches improves 12-35% and 45-78% for protein. As a result of the increases in net energy gain from food consumption, survival and reproductive rates in hominids increased.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wrangham | first1 = Richard W. | last2 = Carmody | first2 = Rachel Naomi | year = 2010 | title = Human adaptation to the control of fire | url = https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/8944723/human_adaptation_to_the_control.pdf?sequence=1| journal = Evolutionary Anthropology | volume = 19 | issue = 5| pages = 187\u2013199 | doi=10.1002/evan.20275}}</ref> Through lowering food toxicity and increasing nutritive yield, cooking allows for an earlier weaning age, permitting females to have more children.<ref>Daniel Lieberman, L'histoire du corps humain, JC Latt\u00e8s, 2015, p. 99</ref> In this way too it facilitates population growth.\n\n====Biological changes====\n\nBefore their use of fire, the hominid species had large premolars which were used to chew harder foods such as large seeds. In addition, due to the shape of the molar cusps, it is inferred that the diet was more leaf or fruit\u2013based. In response to consuming cooked foods, the molar teeth of ''Homo erectus'' had gradually shrunk, suggesting that their diet had changed from crunchier foods such as crisp root vegetables to softer cooked foods such as meat.<ref name=\"crunchy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2005/11/22/1514032.htm|title= Homo erectus ate crunchy food|work = News in Science | publisher = abc.net.au | accessdate = 12 November 2007 | last = Viegas | first = Jennifer|date=22 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://anthro.palomar.edu/homo/homo_2.htm|title=Early Human Evolution: Homo ergaster and erectus|accessdate=12 November 2007}}</ref> Cooked foods further selected for the differentiation of their teeth and eventually led to a decreased jaw volume with a variety of smaller teeth in hominids.

As a result, the [[gastrointestinal tract]] and organs in the [[Human digestive system|digestive system]] decreased in size. This is in contrast to other primates, where a larger digestive tract is needed for fermentation of long carbohydrate chains. Thus, humans evolved from the large colons and tracts that are seen in other primates to smaller ones.<ref name=\"thought\">{{cite journal|title=Food for Thought|last=Gibbons|first=Ann|date=15 June 2007|journal=Science|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1558|volume=316|pages=1558\u201360|pmid=17569838|issue=5831}}</ref>    \n\nAccording to Wrangham, control of fire allowed hominids to sleep on the ground and in caves instead of trees and led to more time being spent on the ground.
