When used with a dressing, the dressing is applied directly on a wound, and a bandage used to hold the dressing in place.  Other bandages are used without dressings, such as elastic bandages that are used to reduce swelling or provide support to a sprained ankle.  Tight bandages can be used to slow blood flow to an extremity, such as when a leg or arm is bleeding heavily.\n\nBandages are available in a wide range of types, from generic cloth strips to specialized shaped bandages designed for a specific limb or part of the body.  Bandages can often be improvised as the situation demands, using clothing, blankets or other material.  In [[American English]], the word ''bandage'' is often used to indicate a small gauze dressing attached to an [[adhesive bandage]].\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Adhesive bandage ===\n{{Main|Adhesive bandage}}\n\n=== Liquid bandage ===\n{{Main|Liquid bandage}}\n\n===Gauze bandage (common gauze roller bandage)===\nThe most common type of bandage is the gauze bandage, a woven strip of material with a Telfa absorbent barrier to prevent adhering to wounds. A gauze bandage can come in any number of widths and lengths and can be used for almost any bandage application, including holding a dressing in place.\n\n===Compression bandage===\n{{Main|Elastic bandage}}\nThe term 'compression bandage' describes a wide variety of bandages with many different applications.\n\n[[Image:Bandagedknuckles.jpg|thumb|right|Short stretch compression bandages are good for protecting wounds on one's hands, especially on one's fingers.]]\n\n'''Short stretch compression bandages''' are applied to a limb (usually for treatment of lymphedema or [[venous ulcer]]s). This type of bandage is capable of shortening around the limb after application and is therefore not exerting ever-increasing pressure during inactivity. This dynamic is called resting pressure and is considered safe and comfortable for long-term treatment. Conversely, the stability of the bandage creates a very high resistance to stretch when pressure is applied through internal muscle contraction and joint movement. This force is called working pressure.\n\n'''Long stretch compression bandages''' have long stretch properties, meaning their high compressive power can be easily adjusted. However, they also have a very high resting pressure and must be removed at night or if the patient is in a resting position.\n\n===Triangular bandage===\n[[Image:20070114 dog with bandaged foot.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cavalier King Charles Spaniel]] with bandaged foot.]]\n{{Main|Esmarch bandage}}\n\nAlso known as a cravat bandage, a triangular bandage is a piece of cloth put into a right-angled triangle, and often provided with safety pins to secure it in place. It can be used fully unrolled as a sling, folded as a normal bandage, or for specialized applications, as on the head. One advantage of this type of bandage is that it can be makeshift and made from a fabric scrap or a piece of clothing. The Boy Scouts popularized use of this bandage in many of their first aid lessons, as a part of the uniform is a \"neckerchief\" that can easily be folded to form a cravat.\n\n===Tube bandage===\nA tube bandage is applied using an applicator, and is woven in a continuous circle. It is used to hold dressings or splints on to limbs, or to provide support to sprains and strains, so that it stops bleeding. This bandage was invented in Oldham, UK.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bandage scissors]]\n*[[Tulle gras]]\n*[[Compression stockings]]\n*[[Field dressing (bandage)]]\n*[[Dressing (medical)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bandages}}\n<!-- A similar video uploaded to commons is desirable. -->\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcfYYKglxrc How to apply a bandage in a figure of 8 around an ankle.

For systems with low binding energies, this \"lost\" mass after binding may be fractionally small, whereas for systems with high binding energies, the missing mass may be an easily measurable fraction. This missing mass may be lost during the process of binding as energy in the form of heat or light, with the removed energy corresponding to the removed mass through Einstein's equation [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>]]. In the process of binding, the constituents of the system might enter higher energy states of the nucleus/atom/molecule while retaining their mass, and because of this, it is necessary that they are removed from the system before its mass can decrease. Once the system cools to normal temperatures and returns to ground states regarding energy levels, it will contain less mass than when it first combined and was at high energy. This loss of heat represents the \"mass deficit,\" and the heat itself retains the mass that was lost (from the point of view of the initial system). This mass will appear in any other system that absorbs the heat and gains thermal energy.<ref>E. F. Taylor and J. A. Wheeler, ''Spacetime Physics'', W.H. Freeman and Co., NY. 1992. {{ISBN|0-7167-2327-1}}, see pp. 248-9 for discussion of mass remaining constant after detonation of nuclear bombs until heat is allowed to escape.</ref>\n\nFor example, if two objects are attracting each other in space through their [[gravitational field]], the attraction force accelerates the objects, increasing their velocity, which converts their potential energy (gravity) into kinetic energy. When the particles either pass through each other without interaction or elastically repel during the collision, the gained kinetic energy (related to speed) begins to revert into potential energy, driving the collided particles apart. The decelerating particles will return to the initial distance and beyond into infinity, or stop and repeat the collision (oscillation takes place). This shows that the system, which loses no energy, does not combine (bind) into a solid object, parts of which oscillate at short distances. Therefore, to bind the particles, the kinetic energy gained due to the attraction must be dissipated by resistive force. Complex objects in collision ordinarily undergo [[inelastic collision]], transforming some kinetic energy into internal energy (heat content, which is atomic movement), which is further radiated in the form of photons - the light and heat. Once the energy to escape the gravity is dissipated in the collision, the parts will oscillate at a closer, possibly atomic, distance, thus looking like one solid object. This lost energy, necessary to overcome the potential barrier to separate the objects, is the binding energy. If this binding energy were retained in the system as heat, its mass would not decrease, whereas binding energy lost from the system as heat radiation would itself have mass. It directly represents the \"mass deficit\" of the cold, bound system.\n\nClosely analogous considerations apply in chemical and nuclear reactions. Exothermic chemical reactions in closed systems do not change mass, but do become less massive once the heat of reaction is removed, though this mass change is too small to measure with standard equipment. In [[nuclear reaction]]s, the fraction of mass that may be removed as light or heat, i.e., binding energy, is often a much larger fraction of the system mass. It may thus be measured directly as a mass difference between [[rest mass]]es of reactants and (cooled) products. This is because nuclear forces are comparatively stronger than the Coulombic forces associated with the interactions between electrons and protons that generate heat in chemistry.\n\n===Mass change===\nMass change (decrease) in bound systems, particularly atomic nuclei, has also been termed ''mass defect'', ''mass deficit'', or mass ''packing fraction''.{{citation needed|reason=I've never heard of the term packing fraction used in this context|date=December 2014}}\n\nThe difference between the unbound system calculated mass and experimentally measured mass of nucleus (mass change) is denoted as \u0394''m''. It can be calculated as follows:\n:Mass change = (unbound system calculated mass) \u2212 (measured mass of system)\n:: i.e., (sum of masses of protons and neutrons) \u2212 (measured mass of nucleus)\n\nAfter a nuclear reaction occurs that results in an excited nucleus, the energy that must be [[radiation|radiated]] or otherwise removed as binding energy in order to decay to the unexcited state may be in one of several forms. This may be electromagnetic waves, such as [[gamma radiation]]; the kinetic energy of an ejected particle, such as an electron, in [[internal conversion]] decay; or partly as the rest mass of one or more emitted particles, such as the particles of [[beta decay]]. No mass deficit can appear, in theory, until this radiation or this energy has been emitted and is no longer part of the system.\n\nWhen nucleons bind together to form a nucleus, they must lose a small amount of mass, i.e., there is a change in mass to stay bound. This mass change must be released as various types of photon or other particle energy as above, according to the relation E&nbsp;=&nbsp;mc<sup>2</sup>. Thus, after the binding energy has been removed, '''binding energy = mass change \u00d7 ''c''<sup>2</sup>'''. This energy is a measure of the forces that hold the nucleons together. It represents energy that must be resupplied from the environment for the nucleus to be broken up into individual nucleons.\n\nFor example, an atom of [[deuterium]] has a mass defect of 0.0023884 amu, and its binding energy is nearly equal to 2.23 MeV. This means that 2.23 MeV of energy are required to disintegrate an atom of deuterium.\n\nThe energy given off during either [[nuclear fusion]] or [[nuclear fission]] is the difference of the binding energies of the \"fuel,\" i.e. the initial nuclide(s), from that of the fission or fusion products. In practice, this energy may also be calculated from the substantial mass differences between the fuel and products, which uses previous measurements of the [[atomic mass]]es of known nuclides, which always have the same mass for each species. This mass difference appears once evolved heat and radiation have been removed, which is required for measuring the (rest) masses of the (non-excited) nuclides involved in such calculations.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bond energy]] and [[bond-dissociation energy]]\n*[[Gravitational binding energy]]\n*[[Ionization energy]] (binding energy of one electron)\n*[[Nuclear binding energy]]\n*[[Quantum chromodynamics binding energy]]\n*[[Semi-empirical mass formula]]\n*[[Separation energy]] (binding energy of one nucleon)\n*[[Virial mass]]\n*[[Prout's hypothesis]], an early model of the atom that did not account for [[mass defect]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/nucbin.html Nuclear Binding Energy]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070830110015/http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/nuctek/nuclideunstable.html Mass and Nuclide Stability]\n*[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas03 Experimental atomic mass data compiled Nov. 2003]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Binding Energy}}\n[[Category:Binding energy| ]]\n[[Category:Energy (physics)]]\n[[Category:Mass spectrometry]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Forms of energy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = March 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2014}}\n{{Nuclear physics}}\n\nIn physics, '''binding energy''' (also called separation energy) is the ''minimum'' [[energy]] required to disassemble a system of particles into separate parts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Modern Physics from \u03b1 to Z\u00b0|last=Rohlf |first=James William |date=1994|publisher= John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0471572705|page=20}}</ref> \n\nA bound system is typically at a lower energy level than its unbound constituents. \u00abWhen a dispersed system [...] combines, [...] the total energy of the system must decrease by an amount <math>\\Delta E</math>, the ''binding energy'' [...].

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cassation and damages ===\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]].

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cassation and damages ===\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]].

The company's founding staff of 12 radio technologists<ref name=\"christchurchcitylibraries.com\"/> produced the first generation of all-[[transistor]] [[mobile radio]]s in New Zealand.<ref name=\"victoria.ac.nz\">http://www.victoria.ac.nz/canz/research/docs/tait.pdf</ref>\n\n* In 1973, Tait released the Mini-phone series of mobile radios, which were adopted as the industry standard in New Zealand.<ref name=\"victoria.ac.nz\"/>\n* In 1979, Tait launched a range of portable radios and base stations, exporting over 25% of its production. The first wholly owned subsidiary was opened in [[Huntingdon]], UK.\n* In 1982, Tait opened facilities in [[Houston]], United States.\n* In 1988, Tait opened facilities in [[Brisbane]], Australia.\n* In the mid-1980s Tait moved into developing [[trunking]] technology. Substantial investment followed in a broad range of [[Trunked radio system|trunked]] products and TaitNet systems based on the open [[MPT 1327]] standard.\n* In 1990, the T800 series of modular [[base station]] and repeater equipment was on the market. The T700 series also appeared.\n* In 1992, the T2000 series of mobile radios was released.\n* In 1993, additional offshore subsidiaries were opened and the T3000 series of hand-portables and the Quasi-Sync base station/repeater systems were introduced.\n* In 1994, the first in a series of mobile data despatch products for use with the T2000 radios was launched.\n* In 1996, the T3000 Series II, an enhanced version of the portable series, went to market.\n* In 1997, Tait's T2000 range was updated with the launch of the T2000 Series II.\n* In 1998, Tait released the Orca series of portable radios. Additional base-station and system enhancements followed, including the T1810 single-site [[Trunked radio system|trunked]] channel controller, before the release of Tait's portable radio range, the Tait Orca 5000.\n* In 2003, the release of the 8000 tier of base stations and mobiles replaced the T800 base station and T2000 mobile.\n* In May 2005, Tait launched [[P25]] (Project 25) products based on open standards and open interfaces.\n* In 2008, the TP8100 replaced the Orca portable radio.\n* In 2010, Tait opened facilities in [[Vienna]], Austria.\n* In 2011, Tait opened facilities in [[Melbourne]], Australia<ref>http://www.invest.vic.gov.au/20110211-global-technology-company-tait-radio-expands-its-operations-in-victoria</ref> and expanded in [[Beijing]], China.

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Handbook, Fig. 5.5]]\nThis process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.\n\nA UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism's ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.\n\nIn many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.\n\n\"Sterilization\" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term \"disinfection\" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain [[log reduction]], e.g., 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.\n\nThe effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.\n\n[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.\n\nLamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.\n\nIncreases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nOne method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.<ref >{{cite web\n  |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=49846\n  |title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection\n}}</ref> UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:\n* Flow rate (contact time)\n* Transmittance (light reaching the target)\n* Turbidity (cloudiness)\n* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)\n\nIn air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:\n\nUV dose \u03bcWs/cm<sup>2</sup>  = UV intensity \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>  \u00d7 exposure time (seconds)<ref >[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose]</ref>\n\nThe UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.\n\nTo accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.\n\nThese calculations actually predict the UV fluence and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.\n\n===Inactivation of microorganisms===\nThe degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>)<!--1 \u00b5W\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> =  10 mW\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 W\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup>, the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article-->. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\"/>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n\n===Advantages===\n{{Details|Disinfectant}}\nUV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favourably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labour and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labour and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nUV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate\u2014if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.<ref>Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.</ref>\n\nA disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.\n\n==Safety ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nIn UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.\n\nFor human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation\n  |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]\n  |page=3\n  |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806185506/https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-date=2016-08-06\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" />\n\nAnother potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to one's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules.\n\nUVC radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be \"UV-resistant\" are tested only for UVB, as UVC doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.\n\nThe [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) for UVC exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study was planned, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January\u2013February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n===Air disinfection===\nUVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.\n\nASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in \"Ultraviolet Lamp Systems\", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers \"Ultraviolet air and surface treatment\" in Chapter 60.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapour discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]\n\nUltraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.<ref>Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref> The world's largest water disinfection plant treats drinking water for New York city.

However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UVC when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M.

This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting [[chlorinated organics]] and also because of the [[environmental risk]]s of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], \"UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-scale urban UV [[wastewater treatment]] is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.\n\n===Aquarium and pond===\nUltraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.\n\nAquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.\nMany of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.<ref>{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Laboratory hygiene===\nUVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] (\"hoods\") between uses.\n\n===Food and beverage protection===\nSince the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a 5-[[log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].\n\n== Technology ==\n{{see also|Ultraviolet#Artificial sources}}\n\n===Lamps===\n[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]\n{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}\n\nGermicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\" />{{rp|2\u20136}}\n\nMercury vapor lamps may be categorized as either low pressure (including amalgam) or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1&nbsp;W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps utilize an amalgam to control mercury pressure to allow operation at somewhat higher temperature and power density. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2\u20133&nbsp;W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps operate at much higher temperatures, up to about 800 degrees Celsius, and have a polychromatic output spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30&nbsp;W/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater.\n\nDepending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&nbsp;nm and also at 185&nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.\n\nThe UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal= Environmental Science & Technology|volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===\n[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UVC LEDs]]\nRecent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UVC LEDs. UVC LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&nbsp;nm-280&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Messina 2015\" /> The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. As of 2019, the electrical-to-UVC conversion efficiency of LEDs was lower than that of mercury lamps. The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\">{{Cite journal |last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285&nbsp;nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007|doi-access=free}}</ref> Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\" />\n\nUVC LEDs don't necessarily last longer than traditional germicidal lamps in terms of hours used, and instead have more-variable engineering characteristics and better tolerance for short-term operation. A UVC LED can achieve a longer installed time than a traditional germicidal lamp in intermittent use.  Likewise, LED degradation increases with heat, while filament and HID lamp output wavelength is dependent on temperature, so engineers can design LEDs of particular size and cost to have higher output and faster degradation or lower output and a slower decline over time.\n\n===Water treatment systems===\nSizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\">{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}</ref>{{rp|5-2}}\n\nThe flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.\n\nPoints of interest\u2014such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism\u2014use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are \"fired\" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are \"harvested\" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.\n\nWhen the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> within an envelope of flow and transmittance.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTo validate effectiveness in drinking-water systems, the method described in the EPA UV Guidance Manual is typically used by the U.S., whilst Europe has adopted Germany's DVGW 294 standard.

Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation Handbook, Fig. 5.5]]\nThis process is similar to the effect of longer wavelengths ([[UVB]]) producing [[sunburn]] in humans. Microorganisms have less protection against UV, and cannot survive prolonged exposure to it.\n\nA UVGI system is designed to expose environments such as [[water tank]]s, sealed rooms and [[HVAC|forced air system]]s to germicidal UV. Exposure comes from [[germicidal lamp]]s that emit germicidal UV at the correct wavelength, thus irradiating the environment. The forced flow of air or water through this environment ensures exposure.\n\n==Effectiveness==\nThe effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation, the presence of particles that can protect the microorganisms from UV, and a microorganism's ability to [[Radioresistance|withstand]] UV during its exposure.\n\nIn many systems, redundancy in exposing microorganisms to UV is achieved by circulating the air or water repeatedly. This ensures multiple passes so that the UV is effective against the highest number of microorganisms and will irradiate resistant microorganisms more than once to break them down.\n\n\"Sterilization\" is often misquoted as being achievable. While it is theoretically possible in a controlled environment, it is very difficult to prove and the term \"disinfection\" is generally used by companies offering this service as to avoid legal reprimand. Specialist companies will often advertise a certain [[log reduction]], e.g., 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective, instead of sterilization. This takes into consideration a phenomenon known as light and dark repair ([[photoreactivation]] and [[base excision repair]], respectively), in which a cell can [[Pyrimidine dimer#DNA repair|repair DNA]] that has been damaged by UV light.\n\nThe effectiveness of this form of disinfection depends on [[wikt:line of sight|line-of-sight]] exposure of the microorganisms to the UV light. Environments where design creates obstacles that block the UV light are not as effective. In such an environment, the effectiveness is then reliant on the placement of the UVGI system so that line of sight is optimum for disinfection.\n\n[[Dust]] and films coating the bulb lower UV output. Therefore, bulbs require periodic cleaning and replacement to ensure effectiveness. The lifetime of germicidal UV bulbs varies depending on design. Also, the material that the bulb is made of can absorb some of the germicidal rays.\n\nLamp cooling under airflow can also lower UV output; thus, care should be taken to shield lamps from direct airflow, or to add additional lamps to compensate for the cooling effect.\n\nIncreases in effectiveness and UV intensity can be achieved by using reflection. Aluminum has the highest reflectivity rate versus other metals and is recommended when using UV{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}.\n\nOne method for gauging UV effectiveness in water disinfection applications is to compute UV dose. The U.S. EPA publishes UV dosage guidelines for water treatment applications.<ref >{{cite web\n  |url=https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_Report.cfm?Lab=NRMRL&dirEntryId=49846\n  |title=Design Manual: Municipal Wastewater Disinfection\n}}</ref> UV dose cannot be measured directly but can be inferred based on the known or estimated inputs to the process:\n* Flow rate (contact time)\n* Transmittance (light reaching the target)\n* Turbidity (cloudiness)\n* Lamp age or [[fouling]] or outages (reduction in UV intensity)\n\nIn air and surface disinfection applications the UV effectiveness is estimated by calculating the UV dose which will be delivered to the microbial population. The UV dose is calculated as follows:\n\nUV dose \u03bcWs/cm<sup>2</sup>  = UV intensity \u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>  \u00d7 exposure time (seconds)<ref >[http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-definitions/index.htm UV dose]</ref>\n\nThe UV intensity is specified for each lamp at a distance of 1 meter. UV intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance so it decreases at longer distances. Alternatively, it rapidly increases at distances shorter than 1m. In the above formula the UV intensity must always be adjusted for distance unless the UV dose is calculated at exactly 1m from the lamp. Also, to ensure effectiveness the UV dose must be calculated at the end of lamp life (EOL is specified in number of hours when the lamp is expected to reach 80% of its initial UV output) and at the furthest distance from the lamp on the periphery of the target area. Some ''shatter-proof'' lamps are coated with a fluorated ethylene polymer to contain glass shards and mercury in case of breakage; this coating reduces UV output by as much as 20%.\n\nTo accurately predict what UV dose will be delivered to the target the UV intensity, adjusted for distance, coating and end of lamp life, will be multiplied by the exposure time. In static applications the exposure time can be as long as needed for an effective UV dose to be reached. In case of rapidly moving air, in AC air ducts for example, the exposure time is short so the UV intensity must be increased by introducing multiple UV lamps or even banks of lamps. Also, the UV installation must be located in a long straight duct section with the lamps perpendicular to the air flow to maximize the exposure time.\n\nThese calculations actually predict the UV fluence and it is assumed that the UV fluence will be equal to the UV dose. The UV dose is the amount of germicidal UV energy absorbed by a microbial population over a period of time. If the microorganisms are planktonic (free floating) the UV fluence will be equal the UV dose. However, if the microorganisms are protected by mechanical particles, such as dust and dirt, or have formed [[biofilm]] a much higher UV fluence will be needed for an effective UV dose to be introduced to the microbial population.\n\n===Inactivation of microorganisms===\nThe degree of inactivation by ultraviolet radiation is directly related to the UV dose applied to the water. The dosage, a product of UV light intensity and exposure time, is usually measured in microjoules per square centimeter, or equivalently as microwatt seconds per square centimeter (\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>)<!--1 \u00b5W\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> =  10 mW\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup> = 0.01 W\u00b7s/m<sup>2</sup>, the latter might be better, giving two-digit values for the ones in this article-->. Dosages for a 90% kill of most bacteria and viruses range from 2,000 to 8,000&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup>. Larger parasites such as cryptosporidium require a lower dose for inactivation. As a result, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] has accepted UV disinfection as a method for drinking water plants to obtain cryptosporidium, giardia or virus inactivation credits. For example, for a 90% reduction of cryptosporidium, a minimum dose of 2,500&nbsp;\u03bcW\u00b7s/cm<sup>2</sup> is required based on the U.S. EPA UV Guidance Manual published in 2006.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\"/>{{rp|1\u20137}}\n\n==Strengths and weaknesses==\n\n===Advantages===\n{{Details|Disinfectant}}\nUV water treatment devices can be used for well water and surface water disinfection. UV treatment compares favourably with other water disinfection systems in terms of cost, labour and the need for technically trained personnel for operation. [[Water chlorination]] treats larger organisms and offers residual disinfection, but these systems are expensive because they need special operator training and a steady supply of a potentially hazardous material. Finally, boiling of water is the most reliable treatment method but it demands labour and imposes a high economic cost. UV treatment is rapid and, in terms of primary energy use, approximately 20,000 times more efficient than boiling.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nUV disinfection is most effective for treating high-clarity, purified [[reverse osmosis]] distilled water. Suspended particles are a problem because microorganisms buried within particles are shielded from the UV light and pass through the unit unaffected. However, UV systems can be coupled with a pre-filter to remove those larger organisms that would otherwise pass through the UV system unaffected. The pre-filter also clarifies the water to improve light transmittance and therefore UV dose throughout the entire water column. Another key factor of UV water treatment is the flow rate\u2014if the flow is too high, water will pass through without sufficient UV exposure. If the flow is too low, heat may build up and damage the UV lamp.<ref>Gadgil, A., 1997, ''Field-testing UV Disinfection of Drinking Water'', Water Engineering Development Center, University of Loughborough, UK: LBNL 40360.</ref>\n\nA disadvantage of UVGI is that while water treated by chlorination is resistant to reinfection (until the chlorine off-gasses), UVGI water is not resistant to reinfection. UVGI water must be transported or delivered in such a way as to avoid reinfection.\n\n==Safety ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2008}}\nIn UVGI systems the lamps are shielded or are in environments that limit exposure, such as a closed water tank or closed air circulation system, often with interlocks that automatically shut off the UV lamps if the system is opened for access by humans.\n\nFor human beings, skin exposure to germicidal wavelengths of UV light can produce rapid sunburn and [[skin cancer]].<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" >{{Cite web\n  |title=Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation\n  |publisher=[[University of Liverpool]]\n  |page=3\n  |url=https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806185506/https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/media/livacuk/radiation/pdf/UV_germicidal.pdf\n  |archive-date=2016-08-06\n  |url-status=dead\n}}</ref> Exposure of the eyes to this UV radiation can produce extremely painful inflammation of the [[cornea]] and temporary or permanent [[vision impairment]], up to and including [[blindness]] in some cases.  UV can damage the [[retina]] of the eye.<ref name=\"Liverpool, UVGI\" />\n\nAnother potential danger is the UV production of [[ozone]], which can be harmful to one's health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 [[parts per million]] (ppm) of ozone to be a safe level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254&nbsp;nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) molecules.\n\nUVC radiation is able to break down chemical bonds. This leads to rapid [[polymer degradation|aging]] of plastics, insulation, [[gasket]]s, and other materials. Note that plastics sold to be \"UV-resistant\" are tested only for UVB, as UVC doesn't normally reach the surface of the Earth. When UV is used near plastic, rubber, or insulation, care should be taken to shield these items; metal tape or aluminum foil will suffice.\n\nThe [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists]] (ACGIH) Committee on Physical Agents has established a [[threshold limit value]] (TLV) for UVC exposure to avoid such skin and eye injuries among those most susceptible. For 254&nbsp;nm UV, this TLV is 6&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> over an eight-hour period. The TLV function differs by wavelengths because of variable energy and potential for cell damage. This TLV is supported by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and is used in setting lamp safety standards by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America. When the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study was planned, this TLV was interpreted as if eye exposure in rooms was continuous over eight hours and at the highest eye-level irradiance found in the room. In those highly unlikely conditions, a 6.0&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> dose is reached under the ACGIH TLV after just eight hours of continuous exposure to an irradiance of 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, 0.2&nbsp;\u03bcW/cm<sup>2</sup> was widely interpreted as the upper permissible limit of irradiance at eye height.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanairandwater.com/uv-facts/UV-Safety-Study.pdf|title=Safety of Upper-Room Ultraviolet Germicidal Air Disinfection for Room Occupants: Results from the Tuberculosis Ultraviolet Shelter Study|last=Nardell|first=Edward|date=January\u2013February 2008|website=UV And People's Health|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n===Air disinfection===\nUVGI can be used to disinfect air with prolonged exposure. Disinfection is a function of UV intensity and time. For this reason, it is not as effective on moving air, or when the lamp is perpendicular to the flow, as exposure times are dramatically reduced. Air purification UVGI systems can be free-standing units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves microorganisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.purifier.org/snapcat/iaq.pdf|title=Environmental Analysis of Indoor Air Pollution|publisher=CaluTech UV Air|accessdate=2006-12-05}}</ref>  For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pans of cooling systems will keep microorganisms from forming in these naturally damp places.\n\nASHRAE covers UVGI and its applications in indoor air quality and building maintenance in \"Ultraviolet Lamp Systems\", Chapter 16 of its 2008 Handbook, ''HVAC Systems and Equipment''. Its 2011 Handbook, ''HVAC Applications'', covers \"Ultraviolet air and surface treatment\" in Chapter 60.\n\n===Water disinfection===\n[[Image:Steripen in use.jpg|thumb|right|A portable, battery-powered, low-pressure mercury-vapour discharge lamp for water sterilization.]]\n\nUltraviolet disinfection of water is a purely physical, chemical-free process. Even [[parasite]]s such as ''cryptosporidia'' or ''giardia'', which are extremely resistant to chemical disinfectants, are efficiently reduced. UV can also be used to remove chlorine and chloramine species from water; this process is called [[photolysis]], and requires a higher dose than normal disinfection. The sterilized microorganisms are not removed from the water. UV disinfection does not remove dissolved organics, inorganic compounds or particles in the water.<ref>Harm, W., 1980, ''Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation, International Union of Pure and Applied Biophysics'', Biophysics series, Cambridge University Press.{{pn|date=June 2017}}</ref> The world's largest water disinfection plant treats drinking water for New York city.

However, it was recently discovered that ultraviolet radiation can be somewhat effective for treating the microorganism Cryptosporidium. The findings resulted in the use of UV radiation as a viable method to treat drinking water. Giardia in turn has been shown to be very susceptible to UVC when the tests were based on infectivity rather than excystation.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Inactivation of Giardia muris by low pressure ultraviolet light | author = Ware, M.

This is in large part because of concerns that reaction of the chlorine with organic compounds in the waste water stream could synthesize potentially toxic and long lasting [[chlorinated organics]] and also because of the [[environmental risk]]s of storing chlorine gas or chlorine containing chemicals.  Individual wastestreams to be treated by UVGI must be tested to ensure that the method will be effective due to potential interferences such as [[suspended solids]], dyes, or other substances that may block or absorb the UV radiation. According to the [[World Health Organization]], \"UV units to treat small batches (1 to several liters) or low flows (1 to several liters per minute) of water at the community level are estimated to have costs of US$20 per megaliter, including the cost of electricity and consumables and the annualized capital cost of the unit.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |publisher=WHO |work=Water, sanitation and health |title=Drinking water quality |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081002081406/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/wsh0207/en/index4.html |archivedate=2008-10-02 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-scale urban UV [[wastewater treatment]] is performed in cities such as [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. The use of ultraviolet light has now become standard practice in most municipal wastewater treatment processes. Effluent is now starting to be recognized as a valuable resource, not a problem that needs to be dumped. Many wastewater facilities are being renamed as water reclamation facilities, whether the wastewater is discharged into a river, used to irrigate crops, or injected into an aquifer for later recovery. Ultraviolet light is now being used to ensure water is free from harmful organisms.\n\n===Aquarium and pond===\nUltraviolet sterilizers are often used to help control unwanted microorganisms in aquaria and ponds. UV irradiation ensures that  pathogens cannot reproduce, thus decreasing the likelihood of a disease outbreak in an aquarium.\n\nAquarium and pond sterilizers are typically small, with fittings for tubing that allows the water to flow through the sterilizer on its way from a separate external filter or water pump.  Within the sterilizer, water flows as close as possible to the ultraviolet light source. Water pre-filtration is critical as water turbidity lowers UVC penetration.\nMany of the better UV sterilizers have long dwell times and limit the space between the UVC source and the inside wall of the UV sterilizer device.<ref>{{cite web |title=UV sterilization; aquarium and pond |publisher=American Aquarium Products |url=http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/AquariumUVSterilization.html }}</ref>{{third-party-inline|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Laboratory hygiene===\nUVGI is often used to disinfect equipment such as safety [[goggles]], instruments, [[pipettors]], and other devices.  Lab personnel also disinfect glassware and plasticware this way.  Microbiology laboratories use UVGI to disinfect surfaces inside [[Laminar flow cabinet|biological safety cabinets]] (\"hoods\") between uses.\n\n===Food and beverage protection===\nSince the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] issued a rule in 2001 requiring that virtually all [[Fruit juice|fruit]] and [[vegetable juice]] producers follow [[HACCP]] controls, and mandating a 5-[[log reduction]] in pathogens, UVGI has seen some use in sterilization of juices such as fresh-pressed [[apple cider]].\n\n== Technology ==\n{{see also|Ultraviolet#Artificial sources}}\n\n===Lamps===\n[[Image:Germicidal Lamp 1.jpg|thumb|right|A 9 W [[germicidal lamp]] in a [[compact fluorescent lamp]] form factor]]\n{{Main article|Germicidal lamp}}\n\nGermicidal UV for disinfection is most typically generated by a [[mercury-vapor lamp]]. Low-pressure mercury vapor has a strong emission line at 254&nbsp;nm, which is within the range of wavelengths that demonstrate strong disinfection effect.  The optimal wavelengths for disinfection are close to 270&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\" />{{rp|2\u20136}}\n\nMercury vapor lamps may be categorized as either low pressure (including amalgam) or medium-pressure lamps. Low-pressure UV lamps offer high efficiencies (approx 35% UVC) but lower power, typically 1&nbsp;W/cm power density (power per unit of arc length). Amalgam UV lamps utilize an amalgam to control mercury pressure to allow operation at somewhat higher temperature and power density. They operate at higher temperatures and have a lifetime of up to 16,000 hours. Their efficiency is slightly lower than that of traditional low-pressure lamps (approx 33% UVC output) and power density is approximately 2\u20133&nbsp;W/cm. Medium-pressure UV lamps operate at much higher temperatures, up to about 800 degrees Celsius, and have a polychromatic output spectrum and a high radiation output but lower UVC efficiency of 10% or less. Typical power density is 30&nbsp;W/cm<sup>3</sup> or greater.\n\nDepending on the quartz glass used for the lamp body, low-pressure and amalgam UV emit radiation at 254&nbsp;nm and also at 185&nbsp;nm, which has chemical effects. UV radiation at 185&nbsp;nm is used to generate ozone.\n\nThe UV lamps for water treatment consist of specialized low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps that produce ultraviolet radiation at 254&nbsp;nm, or medium-pressure UV lamps that produce a [[polychromatic]] output from 200&nbsp;nm to visible and infrared energy. The UV lamp never contacts the water; it is either housed in a quartz glass sleeve inside the water chamber or mounted external to the water which flows through the transparent UV tube. Water passing through the flow chamber is exposed to UV rays which are absorbed by suspended solids, such as microorganisms and dirt, in the stream.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wolfe, R.L. |year=1990 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection of potable water |journal= Environmental Science & Technology|volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=768\u2013773|bibcode=1990EnST...24..768W |doi=10.1021/es00076a001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Light emitting diodes (LEDs) ===\n[[File:UVC LED.jpg|thumb|Compact and versatile options with UVC LEDs]]\nRecent developments in [[Light-emitting diode|LED technology]] have led to commercially available UVC LEDs. UVC LEDs use semiconductors to emit light between 255&nbsp;nm-280&nbsp;nm.<ref name=\"Messina 2015\" /> The wavelength emission is tuneable by adjusting the material of the semiconductor. As of 2019, the electrical-to-UVC conversion efficiency of LEDs was lower than that of mercury lamps. The reduced size of LEDs opens up options for small reactor systems allowing for point-of-use applications and integration into medical devices.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\">{{Cite journal |last=Hessling|first=Martin|last2=Gross|first2=Andrej|last3=Hoenes|first3=Katharina|last4=Rath|first4=Monika|last5=Stangl|first5=Felix|last6=Tritschler|first6=Hanna|last7=Sift|first7=Michael|date=2016-01-27|title=Efficient Disinfection of Tap and Surface Water with Single High Power 285&nbsp;nm LED and Square Quartz Tube|journal=Photonics|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=7|doi=10.3390/photonics3010007|doi-access=free}}</ref> Low power consumption of semiconductors introduce UV disinfection systems that utilized small solar cells in remote or Third World applications.<ref name=\"Hessling et al 2016\" />\n\nUVC LEDs don't necessarily last longer than traditional germicidal lamps in terms of hours used, and instead have more-variable engineering characteristics and better tolerance for short-term operation. A UVC LED can achieve a longer installed time than a traditional germicidal lamp in intermittent use.  Likewise, LED degradation increases with heat, while filament and HID lamp output wavelength is dependent on temperature, so engineers can design LEDs of particular size and cost to have higher output and faster degradation or lower output and a slower decline over time.\n\n===Water treatment systems===\nSizing of a UV system is affected by three variables: flow rate, lamp power, and UV transmittance in the water. Manufacturers typically developed sophisticated [[Computational fluid dynamics|Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) models validated with [[Bioassay#Environmental bioassays|bioassay]] testing. This involves testing the UV reactor's disinfection performance with either [[Bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] or T1 [[bacteriophage]]s at various flow rates, UV transmittance, and power levels in order to develop a regression model for system sizing. For example, this is a requirement for all drinking water systems in the United States per the EPA UV Guidance Manual.<ref name=\"epa_lt2\">{{Cite web |title=Ultraviolet disinfection guidance manual for the final long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule |url=http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw000/disinfection/lt2/pdfs/guide_lt2_uvguidance.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=November 2006 |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |location=Washington, DC }}</ref>{{rp|5-2}}\n\nThe flow profile is produced from the chamber geometry, flow rate, and particular turbulence model selected. The radiation profile is developed from inputs such as water quality, lamp type (power, germicidal efficiency, spectral output, arc length), and the transmittance and dimension of the quartz sleeve. Proprietary CFD software simulates both the flow and radiation profiles. Once the 3D model of the chamber is built, it is populated with a grid or mesh that comprises thousands of small cubes.\n\nPoints of interest\u2014such as at a bend, on the quartz sleeve surface, or around the wiper mechanism\u2014use a higher resolution mesh, whilst other areas within the reactor use a coarse mesh. Once the mesh is produced, hundreds of thousands of virtual particles are \"fired\" through the chamber. Each particle has several variables of interest associated with it, and the particles are \"harvested\" after the reactor. Discrete phase modeling produces delivered dose, head loss, and other chamber-specific parameters.\n\nWhen the modeling phase is complete, selected systems are validated using a professional third party to provide oversight and to determine how closely the model is able to predict the reality of system performance. System validation uses non-pathogenic surrogates such as MS 2 phage or ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' to determine the Reduction Equivalent Dose (RED) ability of the reactors. Most systems are validated to deliver 40&nbsp;mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> within an envelope of flow and transmittance.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nTo validate effectiveness in drinking-water systems, the method described in the EPA UV Guidance Manual is typically used by the U.S., whilst Europe has adopted Germany's DVGW 294 standard. For wastewater systems, the NWRI/AwwaRF Ultraviolet Disinfection Guidelines for Drinking Water and Water Reuse protocols are typically used, especially in wastewater reuse applications.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Treatment technology report for recycled water |url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/certlic/drinkingwater/Documents/DWdocuments/treatmenttechnology.pdf |accessdate=30 January 2011 |date=January 2007  |publisher=State Of California Division of Drinking Water and Environmental Management |page={{page needed|date=January 2011}} }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[HEPA]] filter\n*[[Portable water purification]]\n*[[Sanitation]]\n*[[Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures]]\n*[[Solar water disinfection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|sanitation}}\n* [http://iuva.org/ International Ultraviolet Association]\n\n{{Wastewater}}\n\n[[Category:Radiobiology]]\n[[Category:Ultraviolet radiation]]\n[[Category:Hygiene]]\n[[Category:Waste treatment technology]]\n[[Category:Sterilization (microbiology)]]\n", "name_user": "Widefox", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWater treatment systems:fix case", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_germicidal_irradiation"}
