This resulted in the Fillmores' studying world religions, spiritual healing, and the link between science and religion.  They were influenced by Dr. E. B. Weeks, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] and [[Mary Baker Eddy]] (the founder of [[Christian Science]]).\n\nIn 1891 the Fillmores named the movement Unity and began publication of their first magazine called ''Unity''.  Later magazines included ''Wee Wisdom'' (for children) and ''Daily Word''.  Book publishing began with ''Lessons in Truth'' by [[H. Emilie Cady]].  In 1906, Mr. and Mrs. Fillmore accepted ordination and ordained 7 other ministers.<ref>[http://www.unity.org/timeline www.unity.org/timeline]</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Unity Village, which became a 1,200-acre incorporated town, was developed 15 miles from Kansas City. After Charles Fillmore's death, the movement was initially led by the Fillmores\u2019 sons and grandchildren.<ref name=EBOnline>{{cite web| title = Unity School of Christianity| work = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online| publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]| date = | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/617994/Unity-School-of-Christianity| doi = | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nIndividual Unity churches are autonomous, each governed by its own Board, choosing its minister, and seeking affiliation according to guidelines. Minister training, ministerial placement, and educational resources are offered at Unity World Headquarters, which also publishes magazines, books, and pamphlets. The organization's prayer ministry, Silent Unity \u2014 a telephone and email service \u2014 offers prayer and counseling.\n\nUnity operates several programs, including the prayer program ''Silent Unity'', the ''Unity Society of Practical Christianity'', ''Unity School of Christianity'', ''Unity Institute'', the Office of Prayer Research, the ''Association of Unity Churches'', and ''Unity House'', the church's publishing arm. The home of Unity is at [[Unity Village, Missouri|Unity Village]], [[Missouri]], a suburb of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].\n\nEach Unity Church sponsors its own chapter of Youth of Unity (YOU), a group of high school-aged teens who come together to learn Unity principles and spiritual practices. All the chapters in a YOU region come together at least once a year for a weekend retreat called a 'rally.' An International YOU Conference is held each summer at Unity headquarters at Unity Village, Missouri, for seven days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitygold.us/about-youth-unity|title=About Youth of Unity {{!}} Unity in the Gold County Spiritual Center|website=www.unitygold.us|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unitysouthcentral.org/youth-of-unity/|title=Youth of Unity \u2013 Unity Worldwide Ministries South Central Region|website=unitysouthcentral.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of Unity==\n[[File:Unity Village.jpg|thumb|Unity School of Christianity]]\nUnity describes itself as a worldwide organization offering an approach to Christianity which teaches a positive approach to life, seeking to accept the good in all people and events.

People must [[Action (philosophy)|live them]].\"\n\nUnity aims to demonstrate  that the teachings of Jesus Christ can be lived every day. Its followers believe that the true \"Church\" is a \"state of consciousness in mankind.\"<ref>Fillmore(1997) p37</ref> Unity teaches that each person is a unique expression of God, that each person is sacred, and each person is worthy. Unity emphasizes the creative power of thought in people's experience, and encourages taking personal responsibility to choose life-affirming thoughts, words and actions, in order to experience a more fulfilling and abundant life.<ref>Fillmore, Charles, Talks on Truth,17th ed 1998 pp. 7\u201313</ref><ref>Cady, Emilie  Lessons in Truth, 15th ed 1995, pp. 97\u2013109, 143\u2013154</ref>\n\n[[H. Emilie Cady]]'s 1896 book ''Lessons in Truth, A Course of Twelve Lessons in Practical Christianity'' is considered a core text of Unity.\n\n===God===\n\nUnity Church views God as [[spiritual energy]] which is present everywhere and is available to all people. Members of the church believe that God only seeks to express the highest good through everyone and everything.<ref>Shepherd, Thomas, \"I've Always Wondered About\"  Unity Magazine, Sept\u2013Oct 2007, p. 10</ref>  According to Unity co-founder Charles Fillmore:\n{{quote|God is not a person who has set creation in motion and gone away and left it to run down like a clock. God is Spirit, infinite Mind, the immanent force and intelligence everywhere manifest in nature. God is the silent voice that speaks into visibility all the life there is.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talks on Truth, by Charles Fillmore, page 9|url=http://newthoughtlibrary.com/fillmoreCharles/talks/talks_009.htm#TopOfText|publisher=The New Thought Library|accessdate=2 November 2015}}</ref>}}\n\nHe later states that: \n{{quote|God is your higher self and is in constant waiting upon you.

They believe that Jesus was a master teacher who expressed this divine potential and sought to show others how to do the same.<ref>Fillmore(1997) p111</ref> Unity uses the term \"Christ\" to mean the divinity in all people. For them Jesus is the great example of the Christ in physical form.<ref>Fillmore(1997) p25</ref><ref>Braden, Charles,  Spirits in Rebellion:The Rise and Development of New Thought.  1987, Southern Methodist University Press.  pp. 260\u2013262</ref>\n\n===The nature of humanity===\n\nUnity Church teaches that all people are individual, eternal expressions of God, and that their essential nature is divine and therefore inherently good. Unity followers believe their purpose in life is to express their divine potential as demonstrated by Jesus, and that the more they awaken to their divine nature, the more they can do this.<ref>Cady, Emilie, Lessons in Truth, 15th ed 1995 pp. 17\u201324</ref><ref>Butterworth, Eric MetaMorality: A Metaphysical Approach to The Ten Commandments. 1988, pp. 119\u2013122</ref>\n[[Salvation]], in the Unity view, is found in conscious understanding of one's innate divinity and then putting that knowledge into practice in everyday life.<ref>Braden, Charles Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought. 1987, Southern Methodist University Press. p. 238</ref>\n\n===The Bible===\n\nUnity founders, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, studied the [[Bible]] as history and allegory. They interpreted it as a metaphysical representation of each soul's evolutionary journey toward spiritual awakening. Unity understands the Bible as a complex collection of writings compiled over many centuries. The Bible is a valuable spiritual resource, but is understood as a reflection of the comprehension and inspiration of the writers and their times.<ref>Fillmore(1997) p. 24</ref><ref>Turner, Elizabeth S.

This resulted in the Fillmores' studying world religions, spiritual healing, and the link between science and religion.  They were influenced by Dr. E. B. Weeks, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Emma Curtis Hopkins]] and [[Mary Baker Eddy]] (the founder of [[Christian Science]]).\n\nIn 1891 the Fillmores named the movement Unity and began publication of their first magazine called ''Unity''.  Later magazines included ''Wee Wisdom'' (for children) and ''Daily Word''.  Book publishing began with ''Lessons in Truth'' by [[H. Emilie Cady]].  In 1906, Mr. and Mrs. Fillmore accepted ordination and ordained 7 other ministers.<ref>[http://www.unity.org/timeline www.unity.org/timeline]</ref>\n\nAfter [[World War I]], Unity Village, which became a 1,200-acre incorporated town, was developed 15 miles from Kansas City. After Charles Fillmore's death, the movement was initially led by the Fillmores\u2019 sons and grandchildren.<ref name=EBOnline>{{cite web| title = Unity School of Christianity| work = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online| publisher = [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]| date = | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/617994/Unity-School-of-Christianity| doi = | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}</ref>\n\n==Organization==\nIndividual Unity churches are autonomous, each governed by its own Board, choosing its minister, and seeking affiliation according to guidelines. Minister training, ministerial placement, and educational resources are offered at Unity World Headquarters, which also publishes magazines, books, and pamphlets. The organization's prayer ministry, Silent Unity \u2014 a telephone and email service \u2014 offers prayer and counseling.\n\nUnity operates several programs, including the prayer program ''Silent Unity'', the ''Unity Society of Practical Christianity'', ''Unity School of Christianity'', ''Unity Institute'', the Office of Prayer Research, the ''Association of Unity Churches'', and ''Unity House'', the church's publishing arm. The home of Unity is at [[Unity Village, Missouri|Unity Village]], [[Missouri]], a suburb of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].\n\nEach Unity Church sponsors its own chapter of Youth of Unity (YOU), a group of high school-aged teens who come together to learn Unity principles and spiritual practices. All the chapters in a YOU region come together at least once a year for a weekend retreat called a 'rally.' An International YOU Conference is held each summer at Unity headquarters at Unity Village, Missouri, for seven days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unitygold.us/about-youth-unity|title=About Youth of Unity {{!}} Unity in the Gold County Spiritual Center|website=www.unitygold.us|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unitysouthcentral.org/youth-of-unity/|title=Youth of Unity \u2013 Unity Worldwide Ministries South Central Region|website=unitysouthcentral.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Overview of Unity==\n[[File:Unity Village.jpg|thumb|Unity School of Christianity]]\nUnity describes itself as a worldwide organization offering an approach to Christianity which teaches a positive approach to life, seeking to accept the good in all people and events.

People must [[Action (philosophy)|live them]].\"\n\nUnity aims to demonstrate  that the teachings of Jesus Christ can be lived every day. Its followers believe that the true \"Church\" is a \"state of consciousness in mankind.\"<ref>Fillmore(1997) p37</ref> Unity teaches that each person is a unique expression of God, that each person is sacred, and each person is worthy. Unity emphasizes the creative power of thought in people's experience, and encourages taking personal responsibility to choose life-affirming thoughts, words and actions, in order to experience a more fulfilling and abundant life.<ref>Fillmore, Charles, Talks on Truth,17th ed 1998 pp. 7\u201313</ref><ref>Cady, Emilie  Lessons in Truth, 15th ed 1995, pp. 97\u2013109, 143\u2013154</ref>\n\n[[H.

Members of the church believe that God only seeks to express the highest good through everyone and everything.<ref>Shepherd, Thomas, \"I've Always Wondered About\"  Unity Magazine, Sept\u2013Oct 2007, p. 10</ref>  According to Unity co-founder Charles Fillmore:\n{{quote|God is not a person who has set creation in motion and gone away and left it to run down like a clock.

They believe that Jesus was a master teacher who expressed this divine potential and sought to show others how to do the same.<ref>Fillmore(1997) p111</ref> Unity uses the term \"Christ\" to mean the divinity in all people. For them Jesus is the great example of the Christ in physical form.<ref>Fillmore(1997) p25</ref><ref>Braden, Charles,  Spirits in Rebellion:The Rise and Development of New Thought.  1987, Southern Methodist University Press.  pp. 260\u2013262</ref>\n\n===The nature of humanity===\n\nUnity Church teaches that all people are individual, eternal expressions of God, and that their essential nature is divine and therefore inherently good. Unity followers believe their purpose in life is to express their divine potential as demonstrated by Jesus, and that the more they awaken to their divine nature, the more they can do this.<ref>Cady, Emilie, Lessons in Truth, 15th ed 1995 pp. 17\u201324</ref><ref>Butterworth, Eric MetaMorality: A Metaphysical Approach to The Ten Commandments. 1988, pp. 119\u2013122</ref>\n[[Salvation]], in the Unity view, is found in conscious understanding of one's innate divinity and then putting that knowledge into practice in everyday life.<ref>Braden, Charles Spirits in Rebellion: The Rise and Development of New Thought. 1987, Southern Methodist University Press. p. 238</ref>\n\n===The Bible===\n\nUnity founders, Charles and Myrtle Fillmore, studied the [[Bible]] as history and allegory. They interpreted it as a metaphysical representation of each soul's evolutionary journey toward spiritual awakening. Unity understands the Bible as a complex collection of writings compiled over many centuries. The Bible is a valuable spiritual resource, but is understood as a reflection of the comprehension and inspiration of the writers and their times.<ref>Fillmore(1997) p. 24</ref><ref>Turner, Elizabeth S.

The film features a large [[ensemble cast]], including [[Josh Hartnett]], [[Ewan McGregor]], [[Eric Bana]], [[Tom Sizemore]], [[William Fichtner]], [[Sam Shepard]], and [[Tom Hardy]] in his first film role.\n\n''Black Hawk Down'' won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Mixing|Best Sound Mixing]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]].<ref name=\"Oscars2002\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/74th-winners.html |title=The 74th Academy Awards (2002) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=2011-11-19 |website=Oscars.org}}</ref> In 2006, an extended cut of the film was released on DVD.

After the bulk of the peacekeepers withdraw, the Mogadishu-based militia loyal to [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]] declares war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, the U.S. Army deploys three of its [[Special forces|special operations forces]] &ndash; [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Rangers]], [[Delta Force]] counter-terrorist operators, and [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th SOAR - Night Stalkers]] aviators &ndash; to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president.\n\nTo consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments. The UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture [[Osman Atto|Osman Ali Atto]], a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. The US then plans a mission to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers.\n\nThe U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including 18-year-old [[Private First Class#United States Army|Private First Class]] Todd Blackburn and [[Specialist (rank)#United States|Specialist]] John Grimes, a desk clerk. [[Staff Sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Matthew Eversmann receives his first command, of Ranger [[Chalk (military)|Chalk]] Four, after his lieutenant suffers a seizure. Eversmann responds to mocking remarks about Somalis from fellow soldiers by saying he respects the Somalis and has compassion for the terrible conditions of civil war for the Somali people, saying there are two things we can do, \"We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN.\"\n\nThe operation begins, and Delta Force operators capture Aidid's advisers inside the target building, while the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire. Blackburn is severely injured when he falls from one of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters, so three Humvees led by [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] [[Jeff Struecker]] are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held [[Mogadishu Airport]].\n\n[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column departs, and shortly thereafter Black Hawk ''Super Six-One'', piloted by [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]] Clifton \"Elvis\" Wolcott, is shot down by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]]. Wolcott and his co-pilot are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and one Delta Force sniper on board, Busch, escapes in an [[MH-6 Little Bird]] helicopter but dies later from his wounds.\n\nThe ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site. The Somali militia erects roadblocks, and [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Danny McKnight's Humvee column is unable to reach the crash area and sustains heavy casualties. Meanwhile, two Ranger Chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach ''Super-Six One''{{'}}s crash site and set up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, ''Super Six-Four'', piloted by Chief Warrant Officer [[Michael Durant]], is also shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashes several blocks away.\n\nWith [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Michael D. Steele|Mike Steele]]'s Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach ''Super Six-Four''{{'}}s crash site nor reinforce the Rangers defending ''Super Six-One''. Two Delta Force snipers, [[Sergeant First Class#United States Army|Sergeant First Class]] [[Randy Shughart]] and [[Master Sergeant#United States|Master Sergeant]] [[Gary Gordon]], are inserted by helicopter to ''Super Six-Four''{{'}}s crash site, where they find Durant still alive. The site is eventually overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured by Aidid's militia.\n\nMcKnight's column relinquishes their attempt to reach ''Six-One''{{'}}s crash site, and returns to base with their prisoners and the casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the Rangers and the fallen pilots, and Major General Garrison sends Lieutenant Colonel Joe Cribbs to ask for reinforcements from the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]], including Malaysian and Pakistani armored units from the UN coalition.\n\nAs night falls, Aidid's militia launches a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at ''Super Six-One''{{'}}s crash site. The militants are held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from [[MD Helicopters MH-6 Little Bird|AH-6J Little Bird]] helicopter gunships, until the 10th Mountain Division's relief column is able to reach the American soldiers. The wounded and casualties are evacuated in the vehicles, but a few Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are [[Mogadishu Mile|forced to run on foot]] from the crash site to reach the Safe Zone at the stadium.\n\nThe end titles recount the immediate aftermath of the mission and end of US military operations in Somalia: Michael Durant was released after 11 days of captivity, after which [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] withdrew all US forces from Somalia. During the raid more than 1000 Somalis died, and 19 American soldiers lost their lives. The names of the 19 soldiers who died, including Delta Sgts. Gordon and Shughart, who were the first soldiers to receive the Medal of Honor posthumously since the [[Vietnam War]], were listed by name. Mohamed Farah Aidid was killed in 1996.

They also claim the abrasive way lines are delivered and lack of authenticity regarding Somali culture fails to capture the tone, mannerisms, and spirit of actual life in Somalia. No Somali actors were used in the movie.<ref name=\"SFTBBH\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2002/jan/24/somalis_flock_to |title=Somalis flock to bootleg 'Black Hawk' |website=ljworld|accessdate=2011-02-21}}</ref>\n\nIn an interview with the [[BBC]], the faction leader [[Osman Ali Atto]] said that many aspects of the film are factually incorrect. Taking exception with the ostentatious depiction of his character, Ali Atto claimed he looks nothing like the actor who portrayed him, nor that he smoked cigars or wore earrings.<ref name=\"WTDFSF\">{{cite news |title=Warlord thumbs down for Somalia film |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1789170.stm |accessdate=February 3, 2012 |newspaper=BBC News |date=January 29, 2002}}</ref> These details were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper [[Howard E. Wasdin]] in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, in reality, Atto seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him.<ref name=\"Wasdin\">{{cite book |last=Wasdin |first=Howard |title=SEAL Team Six \u2013 Memoirs of a US Navy Sniper |year=2011 |pages=225\u2013226}}</ref> Atto additionally stated that he had not been consulted about the project, nor was he approached for permission to use his likeness, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies:<ref name=\"WTDFSF\" />\n\n{{quote|First of all when I was caught on 21 September, I was only travelling with one [[Fiat 124]], not three vehicles as it shows in the film[\u2026] And when the helicopter attacked, people were hurt, people were killed[...] The car we were travelling in, (and) I have got proof, it was hit at least 50 times.

It was not right.<ref name=\"WTDFSF\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\nNavy SEAL Wasdin similarly remarked that while olive green military rigger's tape was used to mark the roof of the car in question in the movie, his team in actuality managed to track down Atto's whereabouts using a much more sophisticated technique involving the implantation of a homing device. (This was hidden in a cane presented to Atto as a gift from a contact who routinely met with him, which eventually led the team directly to the faction leader.<ref name=\"Wasdin\"/>)\n\n[[Malaysia]]n military officials whose own troops were involved in the fighting have likewise raised complaints regarding the film's accuracy. Retired Brigadier-General Abdul Latif Ahmad, who at the time commanded Malaysian forces in Mogadishu, told the [[AFP news agency]] that Malaysian moviegoers would be under the erroneous impression that the real battle was fought by the Americans alone, with Malaysian troops relegated to serving as \"mere bus drivers to ferry them out\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1773466.stm |title=Jingoism jibe over Black Hawk Down |work=[[BBC News]] |date=January 21, 2002 |accessdate=2010-01-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Pervez Musharraf|General Pervez Musharraf]], who later became President of [[Pakistan]] after a coup, similarly accused the filmmakers of not crediting the work done by the Pakistani soldiers. In his autobiography ''[[In the Line of Fire: A Memoir]]'', Musharraf wrote:\n\n{{quote|The outstanding performance of the Pakistani troops under adverse conditions is very well known at the [[United Nations|UN]]. Regrettably, the film ''Black Hawk Down'' ignores the role of Malaysia and Pakistan in Somalia. When U.S. troops were trapped in the thickly populated Madina Bazaar area of Mogadishu, it was the Seventh [[Frontier Force Regiment]] of the [[Pakistan Army]] that reached out and extricated them. The bravery of the U.S. troops notwithstanding, we deserved equal, if not more, credit; but the filmmakers depicted the incident as involving only Americans.<ref>{{cite book|author=Musharraf, Pervez |title=In the Line of Fire: A Memoir|url=https://archive.org/details/inlineoffirememo00mush |url-access=registration |publisher=Free Press|date= 2006|page=[https://archive.org/details/inlineoffirememo00mush/page/76 76]}}</ref>}}\n\n===Mogadishu Mile===\nIt is often believed that the soldiers involved in the [[Mogadishu Mile]] had to run all the way to the [[Mogadiscio Stadium]], as shown in the film. However, in that scene the filmmakers took artistic license and dramatized the event, departing from the book. In the film, the Mogadishu Mile ends with about a dozen soldiers entering the Mogadiscio Stadium having run all the way through the city. In the book, it ends with soldiers reaching a rendezvous point on National Street (in the opposite direction from the stadium):\n\n{{quote|\n\"As he approached the intersection of Hawlwadig Road and National Street, about five blocks south of the Olympic Hotel, he saw a tank and the line of APCs and Humvees and a mass of men in desert battle dress.

After the bulk of the peacekeepers withdraw, the Mogadishu-based militia loyal to [[Mohamed Farrah Aidid]] declares war on the remaining UN personnel. In response, the U.S. Army deploys three of its [[Special forces|special operations forces]] &ndash; [[75th Ranger Regiment (United States)|75th Rangers]], [[Delta Force]] counter-terrorist operators, and [[160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne)|160th SOAR - Night Stalkers]] aviators &ndash; to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president.\n\nTo consolidate his power and subdue the population in the south, Aidid and his militia seize Red Cross food shipments. The UN forces are powerless to intervene directly. Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture [[Osman Atto|Osman Ali Atto]], a faction leader selling arms to Aidid's militia. The US then plans a mission to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid's top advisers.\n\nThe U.S. forces include experienced men as well as new recruits, including 18-year-old [[Private First Class#United States Army|Private First Class]] Todd Blackburn and [[Specialist (rank)#United States|Specialist]] John Grimes, a desk clerk. [[Staff Sergeant#U.S. Army|Staff Sergeant]] Matthew Eversmann receives his first command, of Ranger [[Chalk (military)|Chalk]] Four, after his lieutenant suffers a seizure. Eversmann responds to mocking remarks about Somalis from fellow soldiers by saying he respects the Somalis and has compassion for the terrible conditions of civil war for the Somali people, saying there are two things we can do, \"We can help, or we can sit back and watch a country destroy itself on CNN.\"\n\nThe operation begins, and Delta Force operators capture Aidid's advisers inside the target building, while the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground-extraction convoy take heavy fire. Blackburn is severely injured when he falls from one of the [[Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk|Black Hawk]] helicopters, so three Humvees led by [[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] [[Jeff Struecker]] are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held [[Mogadishu Airport]].\n\n[[Sergeant#United States|Sergeant]] Dominick Pilla is shot and killed just as Struecker's column departs, and shortly thereafter Black Hawk ''Super Six-One'', piloted by [[Warrant Officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]] Clifton \"Elvis\" Wolcott, is shot down by a [[rocket-propelled grenade]]. Wolcott and his co-pilot are killed, the two crew chiefs are wounded, and one Delta Force sniper on board, Busch, escapes in an [[MH-6 Little Bird]] helicopter but dies later from his wounds.\n\nThe ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site. The Somali militia erects roadblocks, and [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Danny McKnight's Humvee column is unable to reach the crash area and sustains heavy casualties. Meanwhile, two Ranger Chalks, including Eversmann's unit, reach ''Super-Six One''{{'}}s crash site and set up a defensive perimeter to await evacuation with the two wounded men and the fallen pilots. In the interim, ''Super Six-Four'', piloted by Chief Warrant Officer [[Michael Durant]], is also shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashes several blocks away.\n\nWith [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Michael D. Steele|Mike Steele]]'s Rangers pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach ''Super Six-Four''{{'}}s crash site nor reinforce the Rangers defending ''Super Six-One''.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contents resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nAs might be expected, in the breakout scenario the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft.

They were carried out near [[Ansbach, Germany]] between March and May 1972, primarily by units of the US [[7th Army]] and the [[German Army]], with active participation from the [[Canadian Army]]. In historical works, they are often known as the '''Ansbach Tests'''.\n\nBlue Force was equipped primarily with [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]]-firing [[Bell AH-1 Cobra|AH-1 Cobras]] supported by [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58 Kiowa]] scout helicopters, while Red Force combined German [[Leopard 1|Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS|Vulcan air defense vehicles]] representing a typical [[Warsaw Pact]] (WTO) armored brigade. The outcome was overwhelmingly one-sided; Blue Force lost a total of 10 helicopters while destroying 167 tanks and 29 Vulcans.\n\nThis result came just as the [[US Army]] was facing a crisis. Under the 1960s [[New Look (policy)|New Look policy]], the answer to any WTO attack would be to use [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, primarily from [[NATO]] [[strike aircraft]], to destroy WTO armor ''en masse''. Assuming this, conventional forces had been allowed to stagnate. By the early 1970s there was a huge disparity in tank numbers, with the WTO having about 14,000 tanks to NATOs 5,500.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} With the [[Soviet Union]] reaching strategic parity in the early 1970s, a massive atomic attack was no longer viable, leaving NATO dangerously underpowered.\n\nThe Ansbach Tests suggested that this could be addressed by a force of a few hundred attack helicopters, which could be purchased and deployed for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent tank fleet. This sparked off one of the most intense debates in the long history of tank-versus-antitank arguments. [[US Army]] doctrine to that point was that \"the best defense against a tank is another tank,\" but proponents of the helicopter claimed that \"the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate\". In the years following the tests, the Army began converting their Cobras to the eight-TOW AH-1S model and changing their role to be primarily anti-tank vehicles.\n\n==Background==\nAnsbach was carried out as a result of several previous events and studies stretching out over a decade. Among them were the 1960 Rogers Board recommendations on Army aircraft development, which had comments about the development of the helicopter as a combat vehicle. In April 1962, [[Robert McNamara]] sent a directive to the Army to broaden its thinking about air operations and try to avoid inventing yet-another logistics vehicle.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=3}} These comments led to the formation of the [[Howze Board]], which enthusiastically supported the use of helicopters in combat. The increasing use and specialization of helicopters during the [[Vietnam War]] served to drive these concepts home, and in 1965 the Army began the Advanced Aerial Fire Support System (AAFSS) to develop its first dedicated [[attack helicopter]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Advanced Aerial Fire Support System |website=Global Security |url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/aircraft/aafss.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, the [[British Army of the Rhine]] ran a series of tests known as [[Operation Hell Tank]] with the goal of testing the use of anti-tank missiles against simulated WTO forces. In one operation, Hell Tank IV, the helicopters ran up a 45-to-1 score over tanks that were executing a breakout. The tests also demonstrated that the helicopters were much less useful against tanks in defensive positions with their engines turned off, making them very difficult to spot from the air.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The RUSI Journal |volume=121 |issue=2 |pages=53-62 |date=1976 |first=S. |last=Hickey |doi=10.1080/03071847609419264 |title=The British Army and the Battlefield Aerial Vehicle. The Way Ahead.}}</ref>\n\nWhile these events were occurring, in 1969 [[Richard Nixon]] formulated the [[Nixon Doctrine]], which called for the US to exit Vietnam and leave the combat to PAVN, a process later known as [[Vietnamization]]. It also re-focused the military on combat against Soviet-led forces in Europe.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=5}} Through this period the USSR had reached a level of parity in [[strategic nuclear weapons]], and US leaders concluded that employing nuclear weapons in any form might lead to mutual annihilation. As it stood, the WTO had an almost three-to-one superiority in tanks, which suggested NATO would lose a ground war with or without the use of [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s, and that only the \"macabre option\" of a strategic exchange might save it.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} Given increasing fiscal restraint, the Army simply could not purchase enough tanks to offset this imbalance,{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=12}} and the attack helicopter appeared to be an alternative that was \"a relatively cheap, flexible and highly potent weapons system.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=15}}\n\n==Trial by fire==\nThe AAFSS contents resulted in a complex design who's development dragged on for years before it was finally canceled. Looking for interim design to quickly deploy to Viet Nam, the [[AH-1 Cobra]] was introduced in combat in 1968.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Birth of the Cobra |first=Stephen |last=Joiner |magazine=Air and Space |date=August 2017 |url=https://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/13_aug2017-birth-of-the-cobra-180963930/}}</ref>\n\nBetween February and April 1971, the US and South Vietnamese [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) carried out [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the invasion of [[Laos]] in an effort to disrupt the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. Over a period of time, the North's [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) was able to amass a significant counter-invasion force, including extremely strong anti-aircraft forces and massed artillery. As these forces began to push ARVN out of Laos, Fire Base 31 was the subject of a classic armor attack by [[T-34]], [[T-55]] and [[PT-76]] tanks.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|pp=33-35}} This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7&nbsp;mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters outright destroyed six tanks, had nineteen \"mobility kills\" and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and \"...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks.\"{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n[[File:Huey armed with TOW missiles in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|In 1972, two experimental TOW-firing UH-1's killed twenty-four tanks and dozens of other targets over a three week period without receiving a single hit.]]\n\nSuch a weapon arrived on 24 April 1972, when two experimental [[BGM-71 TOW]]-equipped [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1B Huey]] were sent to [[Kon Tum]] during the [[Easter Offensive]]. After shakedown and crew training, they entered combat on 4 May and on their first mission killed four [[M41 Walker Bulldog]] tanks, a 2.5 ton truck, and a 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, all US-supplied equipment that had been captured from ARVN earlier in the campaign. Over the next weeks, the team killed dozens of targets of various sorts as PAVN prepared for an assault on Kon Tum.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe battle opened in earnest on 25 May. The TOWs killed ten [[T-54]]s and added another two on the 27th, one of which the crew abandoned un-hit with the engine still running. In another case, a tank crew backed their tank into a house to avoid attack, only to be destroyed by a TOW fired in through a window.<ref>{{cite book |title=A Bright Shining Lie |first=Neil |last=Sheehan |date= 2009 |publisher=Doubleday |page=782 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&pg=PA782}}</ref> By the time the battle ended on 12 June, they had accounted for 24 tanks, 2 [[armored personnel carriers|APCs]], 7 trucks, a twin 23&nbsp;mm anti-aircraft gun, a 122&nbsp;mm rocket launcher and many other targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\nThe two helicopters remained until 14 October, by which point they had fired 85 TOWs to produce 26 confirmed tank kills, 3 suspected tank kills, 15 wheeled vehicles destroyed, and 33 other point targets hit. During this entire time, neither helicopter received a single hit.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=35}}\n\n==Canadian interest==\nIn 1969, [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s [[Cabinet of Canada]] called into question the [[Canadian Army]]'s force structure in Europe, which was an expensive contingent to maintain given its low expected lifetime in combat. The existing tank support, based on the [[Centurion tank|Centurion]], was obsolete and needed replacement. Wishing to remove the nuclear strike mission as well, the Army was tasked with coming up with a new mission for the European force with a total contingent roughly half that of the existing force.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=124}}\n\nConsidering the options, General [[Jean Victor Allard]] proposed a light force focused on anti-tank combat that could be rapidly deployed across Germany in order to stop WTO armored breakouts. The force was equipped mainly with [[M113]]s for mobility and armed with TOW and [[M47 Dragon]] missiles, as well as six Cobras and a number of to-be-determined Direct Fire Support Vehicles. A series of wargames in March 1970, \"Bronze Nimbus\", demonstrated the small force would inflict huge casualties on typical WTO formation, but invariably the sheer number of WTO tanks ate up their ammunition and overwhelmed them.{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=57}}\n\nThis led the Army to consider becoming a completely airmobile force, adding more attack helicopters to the mix, and using the hunter/killer structure developed in Vietnam.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=126}} While data from Vietnam was useful, it was not clear how this force would fair in Europe given the WTO's much stronger organic air defenses. Basing the entire future of the Canadian Army's European presence would demand better data and testing if it were to go forward.{{sfn|Kasurak|2013|p=136}}{{sfn|Maas|2017|p=58}}\n\n==Tests==\n[[File:Cobra and Kiowa DF-ST-86-10445.JPEG|thumb|right|Ansbach demonstrated the value of the \"hunter/killer\" teams combining the Cobra gunship and Kiowa scout.]]\n[[File:ZSU-23-4-Camp-Pendleton.jpg|thumb|right|Ansbach suggested the ''Shilka'' was easy prey for helicopters using pop-up attacks.]]\n\nAll of these changes resulted in intense interest in helicopter combat in the US, Canada and, increasingly, the German [[Bundeswehr]]. The [[United States Army Europe]] began forming plans for extensive tests of helicopter combat for early 1972, with German and Canadian participation. The WTO forces would be made up from Bundeswehr [[Leopard tank]]s and US [[M163 VADS]] playing the part of the [[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], which had no direct counterpart in NATO.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} [[Laser]]s were used by all vehicles to simulate weapons fire, and laser receivers firing [[smoke grenade]]s registered hits.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=25}}{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nTwo types of combat scenarios were considered. In one, a single AH-1G Cobra attack helicopter simulating a TOW-equipped AH-1Q was paired with two OH-58 helicopters providing forward observation. This sort of \"hunter/killer\" team had been used to great effect in Vietnam. It was not clear this was suitable in an armor-heavy battle expected in Europe, so the same setups were repeated with two Cobras and no Kiohas. Groups of three Leopards with one Vulcan attempted to move forward against this opposition.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=26}} Three separate scenarios were trialed. In the first, the helicopters were working in concert with in-place defensive forces, acting as additional anti-tank weapons. In the second, the goal was to delay an attacking force to give time for other forces to get into position to defend against them. In the third, the helicopters were being sent against a successful armored breakthrough with the goal being to kill as many vehicles as possible.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}} A total of 60 trial runs were conducted.{{sfn|Bell|Cocke|1974|p=41}}\n\nAs might be expected, in the breakout scenario the helicopters benefited from a lack of information on the part of the attackers, which were repeatedly engaged at long range and often had no idea there was a helicopter nearby.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}} The value of the hunter/killer teams, in this case, was clear in the results; when acting alone in this scenario, the helicopters often blundered into the tanks and this resulted in the highest losses, six attack helicopters. However, this scenario also resulted in the highest total losses to the attacking force, with 73 vehicles killed, for an exchange ratio of 12 to 1. Over the entire series of runs, the hunter/killer teams killed 167 vehicles for the loss of 6 helicopters for an exchange of 11 to 1, and the all-attack teams killed 127 vehicles for six losses, a ratio of almost 15 to 1.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}\n\nThe takeaway results of the tests were twofold:\n\n{{quote|The inclusion of scout helicopters in the antiarmor team is essential and noticeably enhances the survivability of the missile firing aircraft.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nand:\n\n{{quote|Pilots effectively employed nap-of-the-earth flight techniques to conceal their presence and, when they were acquired, usually presented fleeting targets.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nSerious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=28}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe most immediate effect of the Ansbach tests was the reopening of the debate about the obsolescence of the tank on the modern battlefield. That the tank was the primary weapon of the anti-tank defense had risen to the point of being official doctrine; FM 17-1 stated that \"The tank is the primary armor-defeating weapon of armored formations.\" Ansbach caused those in support of the helicopter to claim the era of the tank was over, or as one observer put it:\n\n{{quote|For the advocates of airmobility, the attack helicopter represents the final resolution of the tank-antitank debate. For the protagonists, the attack helicopter represents a pipedream that will be quickly and devastatingly shattered by the reality of combat.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=27}}}}\n\nThe tests had been carried out just as the new [[M1 Abrams|XM-1]] tank began its design cycle and was spearheading a renewed interest in tanks. This was bolstered by the events in the [[Yom Kippur War]] of 1973, where the [[Israel Defense Forces]] (IDF) \"utterly defeated combined armies equal in strength to NATO Europe\" and suggested that it was \"obvious that armor is battlefield-decisive so long as it is used wisely.\"{{sfn|Brower|1974|p=15}}\n\n==THES==\nLooking to gain further clarity as the debate about the Ansbach results, the Army commissioned BDM International, now part of [[Vinnell]], to prepare a follow-up theoretical study. The Tactical Helicopter Employment Study, or THES, was largely a literature search, an attempt to find and collect all useful information on the topic of attack helicopters to date.{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=31}} Published in November 1973, THES made three broad conclusions:{{sfn|Ebitz|1975|p=32}}\n\n# previous experiments and operations generally supported each other's results\n# doctrines developed during these events appeared to be correct and well accepted\n# the attack helicopter could be used as a primary anti-armor weapon\n\nTHES also considered the issue of weather, and using data collected from sixteen sites over a ten-year span, they concluded that the Cobra could fly 91% of the time, even during the worst weather in November and December.<ref>{{cite techreport |url=https://archive.org/stream/DTIC_ADA147750/DTIC_ADA147750_djvu.txt |title=Determining the Optimum Aviation Organization for the Operational Level of War |first=Carlton |last=Hood |date=May 1984 |publisher=United States Army}}</ref>\n\n==Outcomes==\nIn 1976, as a direct result of the tests and the THEL results, the Army began updating all AH-1G, -1Q and -1R to the modernized AH-1S. The -1S retained the Cobra's direct-fire capabilities with rockets and guns, but shifted its primary mission to anti-tank, carrying eight TOW missiles. In March 1978, a further 100 new-build AH-1S's were ordered.{{sfn|McGowen|2005|p=158}}\n\nIn Canada, the tests were used to bolster arguments for the new mobile force structure. However, when the cost of the helicopters was considered, it appeared there was only enough money to equip one formation with the required number of aircraft.
