Napier & Son]] during [[World War II]]. The engine evolved to become one of the most powerful [[Inline engine (aviation)|inline]] piston aircraft engines in the world, developing from {{Convert|2,200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} in its earlier versions to {{convert|3500|hp|abbr=on}} in late-model prototypes.\n\nThe first operational aircraft to be powered by the Sabre were the [[Hawker Typhoon]] and [[Hawker Tempest]]; the first aircraft powered by the Sabre was the [[Napier-Heston Racer]], which was designed to capture the world speed record.{{#tag:ref|The Napier-Heston Racer used the first production Sabre engine. The world-record contender crashed during early tests and the project was discontinued.|group=nb}} Other aircraft using the Sabre were early prototype and production variants of the [[Blackburn Firebrand]], the [[Martin-Baker MB 3]] prototype and a [[Hawker Sea Fury|Hawker Fury]] prototype. The rapid introduction of [[jet engine]]s after the war led to the quick demise of the Sabre, as there was less need for high power military piston aero engines and because Napier turned its attention to developing [[turboprop]] engines such as the [[Napier Naiad|Naiad]] and [[Napier Eland|Eland]].\n\n==Design and development==\nPrior to the Sabre, Napier had been working on large aero engines for some time. Their most famous was the [[Napier Lion|Lion]], which had been a very successful engine between the World Wars and in modified form had powered several of the [[Supermarine]] [[Schneider Trophy]] competitors in 1923 and 1927, as well as several [[land speed record]] cars. By the late 1920s, the Lion was no longer competitive and work started on replacements.\n\nNapier followed the Lion with two new [[H engine|H-block]] designs: the H-16 ([[Napier Rapier|Rapier]]) and the H-24 ([[Napier Dagger|Dagger]]). The H-block has a compact layout, consisting of two horizontally opposed engines, lying one atop or beside another. Since the cylinders are opposed, the motion in one is balanced by the  motion on the opposing side, leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration. In these new designs, Napier chose air cooling but in service, the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly, which made the engines unreliable.\n\n===Genesis===\n[[File:Napier-Heston racer.jpg|thumb|The first aircraft designed around the Sabre engine \u2013 the [[Napier-Heston Racer]] which crashed during early flight tests.]]\nDuring the 1930s, studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement (about 45&nbsp;kW/[[litre]]). This power output was needed to propel aircraft large enough to carry large fuel loads, for long range flights. A typical large engine of the era, the [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830]] ''Twin Wasp'', developed about 1,200&nbsp;hp (895&nbsp;kW) from 1,820 [[cubic inch]]es (30 litres), so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed. This called for radical changes and while many companies tried to build such an engine, none succeeded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn 1927, [[Harry Ricardo]] published a study on the concept of the [[sleeve valve]] engine. In it, he wrote that traditional [[poppet valve]] engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500&nbsp;hp (1,100&nbsp;kW), a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines. To pass this limit, the sleeve valve would have to be used, to increase [[volumetric efficiency]], as well as to decrease the engine's sensitivity to detonation, which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time.<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.145</ref> Halford had worked for Ricardo 1919-1922 at their London office{{#tag:ref|21 Suffolk St, Westminster, London, a little cul-de-sac off Pall Mall East.|group=nb}} and Halford's 1923 office was in Ladbroke Grove, North Kensington, only a few miles from Ricardo, while Halford's 1929 office was even closer (700 yards),<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.103</ref><ref>Boxkite to Jet - the remarkable career of Frank B Halford, Douglas Taylor, 1999,{{ISBN|1 872922 16 3}}, p.73</ref> and while in 1927 Ricardo started work with [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Engines]] on a line of sleeve-valve designs,<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.186</ref> Halford started work with Napier<ref>Boxkite to Jet - the remarkable career of Frank B Halford, Douglas Taylor, 1999,{{ISBN|1 872922 16 3}}, p.81</ref>, using the Dagger as the basis. The layout of the H-block, with its inherent balance and the Sabre's relatively short stroke, allowed it to run at a higher rate of rotation, to deliver more power from a smaller displacement, provided that good volumetric efficiency could be maintained (with better breathing), which sleeve valves could do.<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.187</ref>\n\nThe Napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquid\u2013cooled engine, capable of producing at least 2,000&nbsp;hp (1,491&nbsp;kW) in late 1935. Although the company continued with the opposed H layout of the Dagger, this new design positioned the cylinder blocks horizontally and it was to use sleeve valves.<ref name=\"Flight309\">[F C Sheffield] 23 March 1944. \"[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1944/1944%20-%200072.html 2,200 h.p.

By March, they were passing tests at 2,050&nbsp;hp (1,500&nbsp;kW) and by June 1940, when the Sabre passed the [[Air Ministry]]'s 100-hour test, the first production versions were delivering 2,200&nbsp;hp (1,640&nbsp;kW) from their 2,238 cubic inch (37 litre) displacements.<ref name=\"Flight309\"/> By the end of the year, they were producing 2,400&nbsp;hp (1,800&nbsp;kW). The contemporary 1940 [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] II was generating just over 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) from a 1,647 cubic inch (27 litre) displacement.\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon 2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawker Typhoon]] was the first operational Sabre-powered aircraft, entering service with the RAF in mid-1941. Problems with both the Sabre engine and the airframe nearly led to the Typhoon's withdrawal from service.]]\nProblems arose as soon as mass production began. Prototype engines had been hand-assembled by Napier craftsmen and it proved to be difficult to adapt it to assembly-line production techniques. The sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel, leading to seized cylinders, which caused the loss of the sole prototype [[Martin-Baker MB 3]].<ref name=\"Flinov45\">Flight 1945, p.550.</ref><ref>Aeroplane 2010, pp. 65\u201366.</ref> The Ministry of Aircraft Production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] from their Taurus engine forgings. These nitrided austenitic steel sleeves were the result of many years of intensive sleeve development, experience that Napier did not have. Air filters had to be fitted when a new sleeve problem appeared in 1944 when aircraft were operating from Normandy soil with its abrasive, gritty dust.<ref>I Kept No Diary-60 Years with Marine Diesels, Automobile and Aero Engines, F.R. Banks 1978, Airlife Publications, {{ISBN|0 9504543 9 7}}, p.133</ref>\n\nQuality control proved to be inadequate, engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings, broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine.<ref name=\"tempest\">[http://www.hawkertempest.se/NapierSabre1.htm Napier Sabre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623153341/http://www.hawkertempest.se/NapierSabre1.htm |date=23 June 2012 }} Retrieved on 17 July 2009.</ref> Mechanics were overworked trying to keep the Sabres running and during cold weather they had to run them every two hours during the night so that the engine oil would not congeal and prevent the engine from starting the next day.{{#tag:ref|Unlike current \"multigrade\" [[motor oil]]s, the lubricants in use in the 1940s thickened up at low temperatures, thus preventing the Sabre from \"picking-up\" when started.|group=nb}} These problems took too long to remedy and the engine gained a bad reputation. To make matters worse, mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine, tended to blame the Sabre for problems that were caused by not following correct procedures. This was exacerbated by the representatives of the competing Rolls-Royce company, which had its own agenda. In 1944, Rolls-Royce produced a similar design prototype called the [[Rolls-Royce Eagle (1944)|Eagle]].\n\nNapier seemed complacent and tinkered with the design for better performance. In 1942, it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance, with the addition of a three-speed, two-stage [[supercharger]], when the basic engine was still not running reliably. In December 1942, the company was purchased by the [[English Electric|English Electric Company]], which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems, which was achieved quickly.\n\nBy 1944, the Sabre V was delivering 2,400 [[horsepower]] (1,800&nbsp;kW) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve. This was the last version to enter service, being used in the [[Hawker Typhoon]] and its derivative, the [[Hawker Tempest]]. Without the advanced supercharger, the engine's performance over {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} fell off rapidly and pilots flying Sabre-powered aircraft, were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude. At low altitude, both planes were formidable. As air superiority over Continental Europe was slowly gained, Typhoons were increasingly used as [[fighter-bomber]]s, notably by the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force]]. The Tempest became the principal destroyer of the [[V-1 flying bomb]] ([[Fieseler Fi 103]]), since it was the fastest of all the Allied fighters at low levels. Later, the Tempest destroyed about 20 [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet aircraft.\n\nDevelopment continued and the later Sabre VII delivered 3,500&nbsp;hp (2,600&nbsp;kW) with a new supercharger. The final test engines delivered 5,500&nbsp;hp <ref>Setright p.134</ref>(4,100&nbsp;kW) at 45&nbsp;lb/in<sup>2</sup> boost. By the end of World War II, there were several engines in the same power class. The [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major]] four-row, 28-cylinder radial produced 3,000&nbsp;hp (2,280&nbsp;kW) at first and later types produced 3,800&nbsp;hp (2,834&nbsp;kW), but these required almost twice the displacement in order to do so, 4,360 cubic inches (71 litres).\n\n==Variants==\nNote:{{#tag:ref|List from Lumsden unless otherwise noted.|group=nb}}\n;Sabre I (E.107)\n:(1939) 2,000 horsepower (1,490 kW).\n;Sabre II\n:(1940) 2,300 horsepower (1,715 kW).

The rapid introduction of [[jet engine]]s after the war led to the quick demise of the Sabre, as there was less need for high power military piston aero engines and because Napier turned its attention to developing [[turboprop]] engines such as the [[Napier Naiad|Naiad]] and [[Napier Eland|Eland]].\n\n==Design and development==\nPrior to the Sabre, Napier had been working on large aero engines for some time. Their most famous was the [[Napier Lion|Lion]], which had been a very successful engine between the World Wars and in modified form had powered several of the [[Supermarine]] [[Schneider Trophy]] competitors in 1923 and 1927, as well as several [[land speed record]] cars. By the late 1920s, the Lion was no longer competitive and work started on replacements.\n\nNapier followed the Lion with two new [[H engine|H-block]] designs: the H-16 ([[Napier Rapier|Rapier]]) and the H-24 ([[Napier Dagger|Dagger]]). The H-block has a compact layout, consisting of two horizontally opposed engines, lying one atop or beside another. Since the cylinders are opposed, the motion in one is balanced by the  motion on the opposing side, leading to no first order vibration or second order vibration. In these new designs, Napier chose air cooling but in service, the rear cylinders proved to be impossible to cool properly, which made the engines unreliable.\n\n===Genesis===\n[[File:Napier-Heston racer.jpg|thumb|The first aircraft designed around the Sabre engine \u2013 the [[Napier-Heston Racer]] which crashed during early flight tests.]]\nDuring the 1930s, studies showed the need for engines capable of developing one horsepower per cubic inch of displacement (about 45&nbsp;kW/[[litre]]). This power output was needed to propel aircraft large enough to carry large fuel loads, for long range flights. A typical large engine of the era, the [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830]] ''Twin Wasp'', developed about 1,200&nbsp;hp (895&nbsp;kW) from 1,820 [[cubic inch]]es (30 litres), so an advance of some 50 percent would be needed. This called for radical changes and while many companies tried to build such an engine, none succeeded.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nIn 1927, [[Harry Ricardo]] published a study on the concept of the [[sleeve valve]] engine. In it, he wrote that traditional [[poppet valve]] engines would be unlikely to produce much more than 1,500&nbsp;hp (1,100&nbsp;kW), a figure that many companies were eyeing for next generation engines. To pass this limit, the sleeve valve would have to be used, to increase [[volumetric efficiency]], as well as to decrease the engine's sensitivity to detonation, which was prevalent with the poor quality fuels in use at the time.<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.145</ref> Halford had worked for Ricardo 1919-1922 at their London office{{#tag:ref|21 Suffolk St, Westminster, London, a little cul-de-sac off Pall Mall East.|group=nb}} and Halford's 1923 office was in Ladbroke Grove, North Kensington, only a few miles from Ricardo, while Halford's 1929 office was even closer (700 yards),<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.103</ref><ref>Boxkite to Jet - the remarkable career of Frank B Halford, Douglas Taylor, 1999,{{ISBN|1 872922 16 3}}, p.73</ref> and while in 1927 Ricardo started work with [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol Engines]] on a line of sleeve-valve designs,<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.186</ref> Halford started work with Napier<ref>Boxkite to Jet - the remarkable career of Frank B Halford, Douglas Taylor, 1999,{{ISBN|1 872922 16 3}}, p.81</ref>, using the Dagger as the basis. The layout of the H-block, with its inherent balance and the Sabre's relatively short stroke, allowed it to run at a higher rate of rotation, to deliver more power from a smaller displacement, provided that good volumetric efficiency could be maintained (with better breathing), which sleeve valves could do.<ref>Engines and Enterprise: The Life and Work of Sir Harry Ricardo, John Reynolds,1999 {{ISBN|978-0750917124}}, p.187</ref>\n\nThe Napier company decided first to develop a large 24 cylinder liquid\u2013cooled engine, capable of producing at least 2,000&nbsp;hp (1,491&nbsp;kW) in late 1935. Although the company continued with the opposed H layout of the Dagger, this new design positioned the cylinder blocks horizontally and it was to use sleeve valves.<ref name=\"Flight309\">[F C Sheffield] 23 March 1944. \"[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1944/1944%20-%200072.html 2,200 h.p.

By March, they were passing tests at 2,050&nbsp;hp (1,500&nbsp;kW) and by June 1940, when the Sabre passed the [[Air Ministry]]'s 100-hour test, the first production versions were delivering 2,200&nbsp;hp (1,640&nbsp;kW) from their 2,238 cubic inch (37 litre) displacements.<ref name=\"Flight309\"/> By the end of the year, they were producing 2,400&nbsp;hp (1,800&nbsp;kW). The contemporary 1940 [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] II was generating just over 1,000&nbsp;hp (750&nbsp;kW) from a 1,647 cubic inch (27 litre) displacement.\n\n===Production===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon 2 ExCC.jpg|thumb|The [[Hawker Typhoon]] was the first operational Sabre-powered aircraft, entering service with the RAF in mid-1941. Problems with both the Sabre engine and the airframe nearly led to the Typhoon's withdrawal from service.]]\nProblems arose as soon as mass production began. Prototype engines had been hand-assembled by Napier craftsmen and it proved to be difficult to adapt it to assembly-line production techniques. The sleeves often failed due to the way they were manufactured from chrome-molybdenum steel, leading to seized cylinders, which caused the loss of the sole prototype [[Martin-Baker MB 3]].<ref name=\"Flinov45\">Flight 1945, p.550.</ref><ref>Aeroplane 2010, pp. 65\u201366.</ref> The Ministry of Aircraft Production was responsible for the development of the engine and arranged for sleeves to be machined by the [[Bristol Aeroplane Company]] from their Taurus engine forgings. These nitrided austenitic steel sleeves were the result of many years of intensive sleeve development, experience that Napier did not have. Air filters had to be fitted when a new sleeve problem appeared in 1944 when aircraft were operating from Normandy soil with its abrasive, gritty dust.<ref>I Kept No Diary-60 Years with Marine Diesels, Automobile and Aero Engines, F.R. Banks 1978, Airlife Publications, {{ISBN|0 9504543 9 7}}, p.133</ref>\n\nQuality control proved to be inadequate, engines were often delivered with improperly cleaned castings, broken piston rings and machine cuttings left inside the engine.<ref name=\"tempest\">[http://www.hawkertempest.se/NapierSabre1.htm Napier Sabre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623153341/http://www.hawkertempest.se/NapierSabre1.htm |date=23 June 2012 }} Retrieved on 17 July 2009.</ref> Mechanics were overworked trying to keep the Sabres running and during cold weather they had to run them every two hours during the night so that the engine oil would not congeal and prevent the engine from starting the next day.{{#tag:ref|Unlike current \"multigrade\" [[motor oil]]s, the lubricants in use in the 1940s thickened up at low temperatures, thus preventing the Sabre from \"picking-up\" when started.|group=nb}} These problems took too long to remedy and the engine gained a bad reputation. To make matters worse, mechanics and pilots unfamiliar with the different nature of the engine, tended to blame the Sabre for problems that were caused by not following correct procedures. This was exacerbated by the representatives of the competing Rolls-Royce company, which had its own agenda. In 1944, Rolls-Royce produced a similar design prototype called the [[Rolls-Royce Eagle (1944)|Eagle]].\n\nNapier seemed complacent and tinkered with the design for better performance. In 1942, it started a series of projects to improve its high-altitude performance, with the addition of a three-speed, two-stage [[supercharger]], when the basic engine was still not running reliably. In December 1942, the company was purchased by the [[English Electric|English Electric Company]], which ended the supercharger project immediately and devoted the whole company to solving the production problems, which was achieved quickly.\n\nBy 1944, the Sabre V was delivering 2,400 [[horsepower]] (1,800&nbsp;kW) consistently and the reputation of the engine started to improve. This was the last version to enter service, being used in the [[Hawker Typhoon]] and its derivative, the [[Hawker Tempest]]. Without the advanced supercharger, the engine's performance over {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}} fell off rapidly and pilots flying Sabre-powered aircraft, were generally instructed to enter combat only below this altitude. At low altitude, both planes were formidable. As air superiority over Continental Europe was slowly gained, Typhoons were increasingly used as [[fighter-bomber]]s, notably by the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force]]. The Tempest became the principal destroyer of the [[V-1 flying bomb]] ([[Fieseler Fi 103]]), since it was the fastest of all the Allied fighters at low levels. Later, the Tempest destroyed about 20 [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet aircraft.\n\nDevelopment continued and the later Sabre VII delivered 3,500&nbsp;hp (2,600&nbsp;kW) with a new supercharger. The final test engines delivered 5,500&nbsp;hp <ref>Setright p.134</ref>(4,100&nbsp;kW) at 45&nbsp;lb/in<sup>2</sup> boost. By the end of World War II, there were several engines in the same power class. The [[Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major]] four-row, 28-cylinder radial produced 3,000&nbsp;hp (2,280&nbsp;kW) at first and later types produced 3,800&nbsp;hp (2,834&nbsp;kW), but these required almost twice the displacement in order to do so, 4,360 cubic inches (71 litres).\n\n==Variants==\nNote:{{#tag:ref|List from Lumsden unless otherwise noted.|group=nb}}\n;Sabre I (E.107)\n:(1939) 2,000 horsepower (1,490 kW).\n;Sabre II\n:(1940) 2,300 horsepower (1,715 kW).

Because of her suicide attempt, House can hold Alice in the hospital under psychiatric hold for 72 hours, but Alice is uncooperative and the team must diagnose her before she is allowed to leave. Meanwhile, House takes Cuddy on a double date with Wilson and his girlfriend, Sam (guest star [[Cynthia Watros]]).\n\nWhen the team gets Alice an MRI, three metal screws are ripped out of her leg by the strong magnetic field. She claims they are from treatment following a skiing accident. House is convinced that the key to unlocking the mysteries of Alice's condition lies in the pages of her most recent novel and suspects that fictional character Helen Rutherford's symptoms are actually Alice's symptoms that she's been writing about in her book. The symptoms all point to lupus, but House is unhappy with the diagnosis as it's not curable and he wants to take her pain away.\n\nLater, House suspects the screw implants were actually from a car accident, and that the seat belt damaged Alice's thyroid glands. Taub suggests a post traumatic [[syringomyelia]] that grew over the years and pressed on her spine, causing all her symptoms. When the team can't find her old medical records, Cuddy suggests that Alice Tanner may be a pen-name.\n\nHouse discovers that her real name is Helen and the books are about her son who died in a car accident.

Because of her suicide attempt, House can hold Alice in the hospital under psychiatric hold for 72 hours, but Alice is uncooperative and the team must diagnose her before she is allowed to leave. Meanwhile, House takes Cuddy on a double date with Wilson and his girlfriend, Sam (guest star [[Cynthia Watros]]).\n\nWhen the team gets Alice an MRI, three metal screws are ripped out of her leg by the strong magnetic field. She claims they are from treatment following a skiing accident. House is convinced that the key to unlocking the mysteries of Alice's condition lies in the pages of her most recent novel and suspects that fictional character Helen Rutherford's symptoms are actually Alice's symptoms that she's been writing about in her book. The symptoms all point to lupus, but House is unhappy with the diagnosis as it's not curable and he wants to take her pain away.\n\nLater, House suspects the screw implants were actually from a car accident, and that the seat belt damaged Alice's thyroid glands. Taub suggests a post traumatic [[syringomyelia]] that grew over the years and pressed on her spine, causing all her symptoms. When the team can't find her old medical records, Cuddy suggests that Alice Tanner may be a pen-name.\n\nHouse discovers that her real name is Helen and the books are about her son who died in a car accident. Helen refuses treatment until House lies and tells her that her son died from a brain aneurysm that caused the crash. After being cured, she decides to stop writing the book series but House demands that she write a new ending for the last book with more resolution than the cliffhanger she originally wrote.

It aired on November 22, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\nA patient is admitted to Princeton Plainsboro after reenacting the [[Crucifixion]]. During the initial conversation, the patient reveals that he crucified himself to honor a bargain he made with God for curing his daughter's cancer. Taub comes up with a sound diagnosis but the patient starts losing teeth so the team scraps the idea. However, Chase and Masters break into the patient's apartment to see that he has been starving himself which was the likely cause of the tooth loss. Regardless, the patient refuses the treatment because of the promise he made to God to save his daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, Cuddy walls House for an apology about lying to her and also pulls him for the wedding dinner of the hospital's chairman-of-board. Chase takes Foreman to the wedding as a wingman and fixes him up with a girl, telling her that Foreman's his boss. At the end of the night, Chase takes off with that very girl and a friend of hers. While House and Cuddy start leaving for the rehearsal dinner, Cuddy makes a cynical remark by telling him that the marrying couple has only nineteen months because, in the state of New Jersey, couples can only divorce after 18 months of living separated, implying they would split-up after their honeymoon. House and Cuddy discuss Cuddy's wedding gown of preference and House says that it wouldn't be Cuddy's first marriage if she married. She says that it would, but deducing from her remark about New Jersey divorce laws, House says that he had checked the records stating that she was married for six days in 1987 and that she lied to him, but he forgives her. Cuddy storms off.\n\nTaub notices his wife take her cellphone to the bathroom that morning and suspects that she's having an affair. Confronting her about it, he learns that she's been corresponding with somebody from an infidelity support group. At the wedding dinner, Taub and Rachel have an argument about her friend. Rachel stands her ground, implying taking revenge on Taub's adulterous past.\n\nAfter the dinner, during a conversation with Taub, Foreman, and Wilson, House gets an idea and runs back to the hospital. He visits the patient and tells him that the annual CT scans that his daughter receives were unable to detect tiny spots of remaining tumor and the PET scans he did revealed them. He concludes that the patient should receive the treatment because God had already broken the bargain. Embittered, the patient agrees. Later on, House reveals that he had been lying, but that the patient is recovering. Instead of losing his faith, he thinks that the proof that, even after accepting stem cell treatment, God did not punish him proves that God is merciful and all about love, as his daughter said.\n\nMeanwhile, Wilson tells House that Sam asked him to review her medical files in order for things to run smooth for a management change. House checks them in Wilson's absence and remarks that Sam had five files which point towards a misconduct about medicine doses. Wilson struggles for a cover but House reassures him that Sam must have done so because the patients were most likely terminal and overdosing would serve as some sort of relief, adding that Sam and Wilson were a perfect match. Wilson reveals that he's going to propose during the wedding. Wilson proposes to Sam by telling her how impressed he is about her moral sense about those five cases. Sam is afraid of commitment and gets cold feet. She covers it up by accusing Wilson that she was honest when she said she did not interfere and blames Wilson for not trusting her. Wilson comes home to see Sam packing up ready to flee. After a volatile argument about confidence, Sam dumps Wilson and runs away.\n\nAt the end of the episode, House apologizes to Cuddy and asks for a leap of faith, promising never to lie to her again. That night, Wilson comes over to House's apartment. House tells him that he apologized to Cuddy but in fact he was lying again.\n\n==Music==\n*\"[[Shark in the Water]]\" by [[V V Brown]]\n*\"I Know\" by [[Jude (singer)|Jude]]\n*\"[[You Mean the World to Me (Toni Braxton song)|You Mean the World to Me]]\" by [[Toni Braxton]]\n*\"[[Love Rollercoaster]]\" by [[The Ohio Players]]\n\n==Reception ==\n\n===Critical response  {{anchor|Critics}} ===\nThe A.V.

[[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] {{PDBe|2NN6}} See the [[#List of subunits|legend]] below. The channel through which RNA passes during degradation is visible at the center of the protein complex]]\n\nThe '''exosome complex''' (or '''PM/Scl complex''', often just called the '''exosome''') is a multi-[[protein]] intracellular [[Protein complex|complex]] capable of degrading various types of [[RNA]] (ribonucleic acid) molecules. Exosome complexes are found in both [[eukaryotic]] cells and [[archaea]], while in [[bacteria]] a simpler complex called the [[degradosome]] carries out similar functions.\n\nThe core of the exosome contains a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the [[cytoplasm]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and especially the [[nucleolus]], although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include [[messenger RNA]], [[ribosomal RNA]], and many species of [[small RNA]]s. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the [[3\u2032 end]] in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.\n\nSeveral proteins in the exosome are the target of [[autoantibodies]] in patients with specific [[autoimmune diseases]] (especially the [[Scleromyositis|PM/Scl overlap syndrome]]) and some [[antimetabolite|antimetabolic]] [[chemotherapies]] for [[cancer]] function by blocking the activity of the exosome.

The exact nature of these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' [[exoribonuclease]], meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their [[3' end]]. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the [[phosphodiester bond]]s \u2013 releasing [[Adenosine diphosphate|nucleotide diphosphates]]. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to [[hydrolysis|hydrolyse]] these bonds \u2013 releasing [[Adenosine monophosphate|nucleotide monophosphates]].\n\nIn archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of the complex is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease.

[[Protein Data Bank|PDB]] {{PDBe|2NN6}} See the [[#List of subunits|legend]] below. The channel through which RNA passes during degradation is visible at the center of the protein complex]]\n\nThe '''exosome complex''' (or '''PM/Scl complex''', often just called the '''exosome''') is a multi-[[protein]] intracellular [[Protein complex|complex]] capable of degrading various types of [[RNA]] (ribonucleic acid) molecules. Exosome complexes are found in both [[eukaryotic]] cells and [[archaea]], while in [[bacteria]] a simpler complex called the [[degradosome]] carries out similar functions.\n\nThe core of the exosome contains a six-membered ring structure to which other proteins are attached. In eukaryotic cells, the exosome complex is present in the [[cytoplasm]], [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and especially the [[nucleolus]], although different proteins interact with the exosome complex in these compartments regulating the RNA degradation activity of the complex to [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s specific to these cell compartments. Substrates of the exosome include [[messenger RNA]], [[ribosomal RNA]], and many species of [[small RNA]]s. The exosome has an exoribonucleolytic function, meaning it degrades RNA starting at one end (the [[3\u2032 end]] in this case), and in eukaryotes also an endoribonucleolytic function, meaning it cleaves RNA at sites within the molecule.\n\nSeveral proteins in the exosome are the target of [[autoantibodies]] in patients with specific [[autoimmune diseases]] (especially the [[Scleromyositis|PM/Scl overlap syndrome]]) and some [[antimetabolite|antimetabolic]] [[chemotherapies]] for [[cancer]] function by blocking the activity of the exosome. In addition, mutations in [[exosome component 3]] cause [[pontocerebellar hypoplasia]] and spinal [[motor neuron disease]].\n\n==Discovery==\nThe exosome was first discovered as an [[RNase]] in 1997 in the budding yeast ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'', an often-used [[model organism]].<ref name=\"Mitchell\">{{cite journal\n|last1=Mitchell\n|title=The Exosome: A Conserved Eukaryotic RNA Processing Complex Containing Multiple 3\u2032\u21925\u2032 Exoribonucleases\n|journal=[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]\n|year=1997\n|volume=91\n|first1=P\n|issue=4\n|pages=457\u2013466\n|pmid=9390555\n|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80432-8\n|last2=Petfalski\n|first2=E\n|last3=Shevchenko\n|first3=A\n|last4=Mann\n|first4=M\n|last5=Tollervey\n|first5=D}}</ref> Not long after, in 1999, it was realized that the exosome was in fact the yeast equivalent of an already described complex in human cells called the ''PM/Scl complex'', which had been identified as an autoantigen in patients with certain [[autoimmune disease]]s years earlier (see [[#Disease|below]]).<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Allmang\n|title=The yeast exosome and human PM-Scl are related complexes of 3' --> 5' exonucleases\n|journal=Genes & Development\n|year=1999\n|volume=13\n|first1=C\n|issue=16\n|pages=2148\u201358\n|pmid=10465791\n|doi=10.1101/gad.13.16.2148\n|last2=Petfalski\n|first2=E\n|last3=Podtelejnikov\n|first3=A\n|last4=Mann\n|first4=M\n|last5=Tollervey\n|first5=D\n|last6=Mitchell\n|first6=P\n|pmc=316947}}</ref> Purification of this \"PM/Scl complex\" allowed the identification of more human exosome proteins and eventually the characterization of all components in the complex.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Brouwer\n|title=Three novel components of the human exosome\n|year=2001\n|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry\n|volume=276\n|first1=R\n|pages=6177\u201384\n|pmid=11110791\n|doi=10.1074/jbc.M007603200\n|last2=Allmang\n|first2=C\n|last3=Raijmakers\n|first3=R\n|last4=Van Aarssen\n|first4=Y\n|last5=Egberts\n|first5=WV\n|last6=Petfalski\n|first6=E\n|last7=Van Venrooij\n|first7=WJ\n|last8=Tollervey\n|first8=D\n|last9=Pruijn\n|first9=GJ\n|issue=9\n|doi-access=free\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Chen\n|title=AU binding proteins recruit the exosome to degrade ARE-containing mRNAs\n|year=2001\n|journal=Cell\n|volume=107\n|first1=CY\n|pages=451\u201364\n|pmid=11719186\n|doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(01)00578-5\n|last2=Gherzi\n|first2=R\n|last3=Ong\n|first3=SE\n|last4=Chan\n|first4=EL\n|last5=Raijmakers\n|first5=R\n|last6=Pruijn\n|first6=GJ\n|last7=Stoecklin\n|first7=G\n|last8=Moroni\n|first8=C\n|last9=Mann\n|first9=M\n|last10=Karin\n|first10=Michael\n|issue=4|display-authors=8\n}}</ref> In 2001, the increasing amount of [[Genome project|genome data]] that had become available allowed the prediction of exosome proteins in archaea, although it would take another 2 years before the first exosome complex from an archaeal organism was purified.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Koonin\n|title=Prediction of the archaeal exosome and its connections with the proteasome and the translation and transcription machineries by a comparative-genomic approach\n|journal=Genome Research\n|year=2001\n|volume=11\n|first1=EV\n|issue=2\n|pages=240\u201352\n|pmid=11157787\n|doi=10.1101/gr.162001\n|last2=Wolf\n|first2=YI\n|last3=Aravind\n|first3=L\n|pmc=311015|authorlink1=Koonin\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Evguenieva-Hackenberg\n|title=An exosome-like complex in Sulfolobus solfataricus\n|journal=[[EMBO Reports]]\n|year=2003\n|volume=4\n|first1=E\n|issue=9\n|pages=889\u201393\n|pmid=12947419\n|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.embor929\n|last2=Walter\n|first2=P\n|last3=Hochleitner\n|first3=E\n|last4=Lottspeich\n|first4=F\n|last5=Klug\n|first5=G\n|pmc=1326366 }}</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Core proteins===\n[[Image:Exosome crystal structure.png|thumb|Top and side view of the [[X-ray crystallography|crystal structure]] of the human exosome complex.

The exact nature of these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' [[exoribonuclease]], meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their [[3' end]]. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the RNase PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the RNase R and RNase D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the [[phosphodiester bond]]s \u2013 releasing [[Adenosine diphosphate|nucleotide diphosphates]]. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to [[hydrolysis|hydrolyse]] these bonds \u2013 releasing [[Adenosine monophosphate|nucleotide monophosphates]].\n\nIn archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of the complex is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein are present in the ring and are responsible for the activity of the complex.<ref name=\"pmid17174886\"/> In eukaryotes, none of the RNase PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last1=Liu\n|title=Erratum: Reconstitution, activities, and structure of the eukaryotic RNA exosome\n|journal= [[Cell (journal)|Cell]]\n|year=2007\n|volume=131\n|first1=Q\n|pages=188\u2013189\n|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.09.019\n|last2=Greimann\n|first2=JC\n|last3=Lima\n|first3=CD\n|issue=1 |doi-access=free\n}}</ref> Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archaea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function.

It aired on October 11, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n\nA young woman ([[Erin Cahill]]) is home alone. She hears a noise, notices the front door was open and calls her husband, Billy ([[Zachary Knighton]]). She searches the house, fearing intruders. It turns out to be nothing but the wind, but when she runs into Billy arriving downstairs, she begins projectile vomiting.\n\nHouse ([[Hugh Laurie]]) is introduced to Kelly Benedict ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), the new fellow Chase ([[Jesse Spencer]]) hired. Not surprisingly House doesn't give her a warm reception. A few ideas are tossed around about the vomiting woman, one of which is lead poisoning.\n\nHouse tells Wilson ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]) he and Cuddy ([[Lisa Edelstein]]) aren't spending the night together at her place and he isn't spending any time with Cuddy's daughter. While working on Margaret, Chase assures Kelly not to worry about the cool reception she got from House and Foreman ([[Omar Epps]]). They notice multiple broken ribs, something she never told the doctors about.\n\nAt Margaret's house, Foreman denies having feelings for Thirteen ([[Olivia Wilde]]). They find a credit card receipt from a lunch Margaret never mentioned. Margaret tells the docs the lunch was an honest mistake and the fractures are a decade old. House is less than romantic the next time Cuddy leaves his place. As she leaves, an attractive blonde masseuse arrives.\n\nDoing research into her past, Kelly finds Margaret is using the social security number of a woman born in the 1940s. Meanwhile Margaret seizes with a heart attack. Margaret wakes up to House asking who she is. She tells Billy that five years ago she was married to an abusive man. She left him, but he found her, stalked her and poisoned her dog. She took a dead woman's identity to escape the man (named Carl). She tells them her real name is Jenny.\n\nHouse grills Kelly for answers about Jenny's dueling stomach/heart issues. She doesn't come up with anything. House suggests the ex used the poison with which he killed the dog to poison Jenny as well. Foreman isn't convinced Kelly is talented enough to work with them. He thinks Chase wants to sleep with her.\n\nBilly is upset she never told him about the abusive ex and leaves. Cuddy asks House about the masseuse. House says she is a hooker he used to get \"happy endings\" from. After going through 15 different massage therapists, this is the only one he likes. Cuddy says she won't see him any more unless he stops seeing the hooker/masseuse.\n\nChase learns from Kelly she was not, in fact, the lead editor for the paper at her medical school. She asks if he regrets hiring her, but he says no. Chase gets a page that Billy has just been admitted to the ER. House tells Wilson the hooker/masseuse issue will set a principle for the entire relationship. Wilson thinks he needs to make this sacrifice to save the relationship.\n\nBilly tells the doctors he found a guy named Carl in Jenny's address book and went to see him. When Carl denied everything, Billy got upset and then got beaten up. Carl is not pressing charges, but Kelly thinks Billy should. Carl said he was just a guy Jenny used to work with. Jenny's temperature begins to spike.\n\nHouse shows a picture of Chase's mother on a projector and suggests the similarity in appearance to Kelly is why he hired her. Kelly mentions [[Legionnaires' disease]]. House decides they should look into it. Foreman figures out it was actually Chase who came up with the Legionnaires' disease idea and told that to Kelly during prep.\n\nIn the hallway, Chase wants to know why Foreman is so upset about Kelly being unqualified. He guesses Foreman is picking on her because he's scared to take on House. House hires an attractive man named Felipe ([[Eddie Matos (actor)|Eddie Matos]]) to give Cuddy a massage. She tries to get out of it but ends up getting the massage. During the massage, she figures out he is a male prostitute.\n\nKelly is stressed-out and tells Chase she's considering quitting. Chase counters she should lean on her background in psychiatry. Billy tells Kelly he found out that the abuse counseling center in Trenton that Jenny claimed to have visited does not exist. He's worried she could be lying about any number of things, but Kelly tells him to relax for the time being.\n\nHouse tells Cuddy he isn't bothered by a male prostitute giving her a massage and she should treat him the same way. She points out the difference in the situation and wonders whether this is House's way of sabotaging the relationship. House responds that she should invite him over and introduce him to her daughter. She says she wants to protect her daughter and this makes House think she's holding back.\n\nWhen Jenny wakes up, Billy calmly asks her about the lies. During this conversation she begins to hallucinate, seeing flames and snakes all over the room. House wakes up alone. The doctors assume whatever is happening has hit Jenny's brain. Kelly is the only one to suggest these latest symptoms could be unrelated, simply the first signs of mental illness. House orders a brain [[biopsy]].\n\nDuring surgery, Jenny's temperature breaks. House talks with Kelly, Taub ([[Peter Jacobson]]) and Chase and they realize her temperature could have been gone since the day before and that she hasn't vomited since being admitted. House goes to the OR and turns off Jenny's pacemaker. Nothing happens. All that's left of her symptoms are her delusions. Kelly wonders if maybe they were prompted by the physical symptoms. House thinks it was just the opposite and orders that Jenny be treated with [[haloperidol]] and [[lorazepam]].\n\nHouse talks to the still-hallucinating but calm Jenny. He goes through all of her lies (former husband, treatments, etc.) and has her admit to Billy that she has [[schizophrenia]]. On his way out of the room, House makes a crack about Kelly not being able to figure this out from the beginning.\n\nBilly goes to House and tells him he thinks it may be too hard to live with her now. \"It's always hard,\" House says. In the elevator, Chase tells House he should probably get rid of Kelly.

It aired on October 11, 2010.\n\n==Plot==\n\nA young woman ([[Erin Cahill]]) is home alone. She hears a noise, notices the front door was open and calls her husband, Billy ([[Zachary Knighton]]). She searches the house, fearing intruders. It turns out to be nothing but the wind, but when she runs into Billy arriving downstairs, she begins projectile vomiting.\n\nHouse ([[Hugh Laurie]]) is introduced to Kelly Benedict ([[Vinessa Shaw]]), the new fellow Chase ([[Jesse Spencer]]) hired. Not surprisingly House doesn't give her a warm reception. A few ideas are tossed around about the vomiting woman, one of which is lead poisoning.\n\nHouse tells Wilson ([[Robert Sean Leonard]]) he and Cuddy ([[Lisa Edelstein]]) aren't spending the night together at her place and he isn't spending any time with Cuddy's daughter. While working on Margaret, Chase assures Kelly not to worry about the cool reception she got from House and Foreman ([[Omar Epps]]). They notice multiple broken ribs, something she never told the doctors about.\n\nAt Margaret's house, Foreman denies having feelings for Thirteen ([[Olivia Wilde]]). They find a credit card receipt from a lunch Margaret never mentioned. Margaret tells the docs the lunch was an honest mistake and the fractures are a decade old. House is less than romantic the next time Cuddy leaves his place. As she leaves, an attractive blonde masseuse arrives.\n\nDoing research into her past, Kelly finds Margaret is using the social security number of a woman born in the 1940s. Meanwhile Margaret seizes with a heart attack. Margaret wakes up to House asking who she is. She tells Billy that five years ago she was married to an abusive man. She left him, but he found her, stalked her and poisoned her dog. She took a dead woman's identity to escape the man (named Carl). She tells them her real name is Jenny.\n\nHouse grills Kelly for answers about Jenny's dueling stomach/heart issues. She doesn't come up with anything. House suggests the ex used the poison with which he killed the dog to poison Jenny as well. Foreman isn't convinced Kelly is talented enough to work with them. He thinks Chase wants to sleep with her.\n\nBilly is upset she never told him about the abusive ex and leaves. Cuddy asks House about the masseuse. House says she is a hooker he used to get \"happy endings\" from. After going through 15 different massage therapists, this is the only one he likes. Cuddy says she won't see him any more unless he stops seeing the hooker/masseuse.\n\nChase learns from Kelly she was not, in fact, the lead editor for the paper at her medical school. She asks if he regrets hiring her, but he says no. Chase gets a page that Billy has just been admitted to the ER. House tells Wilson the hooker/masseuse issue will set a principle for the entire relationship. Wilson thinks he needs to make this sacrifice to save the relationship.\n\nBilly tells the doctors he found a guy named Carl in Jenny's address book and went to see him. When Carl denied everything, Billy got upset and then got beaten up. Carl is not pressing charges, but Kelly thinks Billy should. Carl said he was just a guy Jenny used to work with. Jenny's temperature begins to spike.\n\nHouse shows a picture of Chase's mother on a projector and suggests the similarity in appearance to Kelly is why he hired her. Kelly mentions [[Legionnaires' disease]]. House decides they should look into it. Foreman figures out it was actually Chase who came up with the Legionnaires' disease idea and told that to Kelly during prep.\n\nIn the hallway, Chase wants to know why Foreman is so upset about Kelly being unqualified. He guesses Foreman is picking on her because he's scared to take on House. House hires an attractive man named Felipe ([[Eddie Matos (actor)|Eddie Matos]]) to give Cuddy a massage. She tries to get out of it but ends up getting the massage. During the massage, she figures out he is a male prostitute.\n\nKelly is stressed-out and tells Chase she's considering quitting. Chase counters she should lean on her background in psychiatry. Billy tells Kelly he found out that the abuse counseling center in Trenton that Jenny claimed to have visited does not exist. He's worried she could be lying about any number of things, but Kelly tells him to relax for the time being.\n\nHouse tells Cuddy he isn't bothered by a male prostitute giving her a massage and she should treat him the same way. She points out the difference in the situation and wonders whether this is House's way of sabotaging the relationship. House responds that she should invite him over and introduce him to her daughter. She says she wants to protect her daughter and this makes House think she's holding back.\n\nWhen Jenny wakes up, Billy calmly asks her about the lies. During this conversation she begins to hallucinate, seeing flames and snakes all over the room. House wakes up alone. The doctors assume whatever is happening has hit Jenny's brain. Kelly is the only one to suggest these latest symptoms could be unrelated, simply the first signs of mental illness. House orders a brain [[biopsy]].\n\nDuring surgery, Jenny's temperature breaks. House talks with Kelly, Taub ([[Peter Jacobson]]) and Chase and they realize her temperature could have been gone since the day before and that she hasn't vomited since being admitted. House goes to the OR and turns off Jenny's pacemaker. Nothing happens. All that's left of her symptoms are her delusions. Kelly wonders if maybe they were prompted by the physical symptoms. House thinks it was just the opposite and orders that Jenny be treated with [[haloperidol]] and [[lorazepam]].\n\nHouse talks to the still-hallucinating but calm Jenny. He goes through all of her lies (former husband, treatments, etc.) and has her admit to Billy that she has [[schizophrenia]]. On his way out of the room, House makes a crack about Kelly not being able to figure this out from the beginning.\n\nBilly goes to House and tells him he thinks it may be too hard to live with her now. \"It's always hard,\" House says. In the elevator, Chase tells House he should probably get rid of Kelly. House disagrees, since she was the only one to get him to the right answer.\n\nHouse agrees he will stop seeing his hooker/masseuse. Cuddy invites him over. Chase finds Kelly packing up her stuff to quit. She is going to leave, but asks him out. House, Cuddy, and her daughter have dinner together. \"Aren't you adorable,\" he says to her when Cuddy leaves the room.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Critical response ===\nThe AV Club gave the episode a C+ score.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/house-massage-therapy-1798166186|title=House: \"Massage Therapy\"|website=TV Club}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110307045222/http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/season-7/episode-04.htm \"Massage Therapy\"] at [[Fox.com]]\n* {{IMDb episode|1726378|Massage Therapy}}\n* {{tv.com episode|house/massage-therapy-1358459|Massage Therapy}}\n\n{{House (TV series)}}\n\n[[Category:House (season 7) episodes]]\n[[Category:2010 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about schizophrenia]]\n\n[[fr:Le Message du massage]]\n", "name_user": "Gonnym", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massage_Therapy_(House)"}

It first aired on February 7, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nCuddy's mother Arlene ([[Candice Bergen]]) is brought to the ER and is placed under House's care, but he thinks she is imagining most of her symptoms. She refuses treatment from House after he demonstrates that giving her placebos, made to look like a drug which has certain side effects, makes her develop some of those side effects, thus proving that at least part of her problem is [[hypochondria]].\n\nThe case is transferred to Dr. Kaufmann, but Cuddy has House stay on the case, unbeknownst to the mother. Meanwhile, since Masters thinks that treating a patient who expressly refused to be treated by a certain doctor is unethical, House has her run inconsequential treatment on trivial cases.\n\nHouse and his team deduce that Arlene has [[endocarditis]], while Dr. Kaufmann had her started on prednisone, which would make endocarditis worse. House tries to make his team switch Arlene's IV to give her antibiotics instead of prednisone, and after Chase, Foreman, and Taub are unable to do it because of various interferences, he has Cuddy switch the medication. This only leads to Arlene developing an allergy, so she is taken off the antibiotics.\n\nMasters wants to disclose the situation to Arlene, but House tells her he will have her thrown out of medical school&mdash;and he has the means to do it, because he has set her up with the trivial cases he had been busying her with. One of those patients had prohibited treatment without express consent of relatives, House hid this from Masters, and she drew blood from him, which, according to House, would constitute a criminal assault.\n\nHouse, his team, and Cuddy talk about the dangers of slipping the patient drugs without the knowledge of the attending physician, now that they have moved on to a diagnosis of fungal endocarditis which requires giving her a dangerous antibiotic. Before the situation is resolved, Masters tells Kaufmann and Arlene what House has been doing.\n\nArlene asks to be transferred to Princeton General. Cuddy caves in and orders an ambulance to get her to the other hospital. Before Arlene can leave, however, House makes Cuddy realize she's been unable to confront her mother, which can now cost her the life of her mother, but sooner or later she would blame this death on House. Cuddy gathers her courage and talks to Arlene, making her stay in Princeton Plainsboro.\n\nWhile House and Cuddy prep her mother for treatment from fungal endocarditis, their small talk reveals that as far as two days ago, Arlene was unable to detect House's sarcasm in a conversation with him. House determines this to be caused by a deficit in the right [[parahippocampal gyrus]].\n\nImmediately after that, Arlene faints, with her heart rate skyrocketing. House diagnoses heavy metal poisoning. Arlene had already been treated briefly for possible lead poisoning, got better, but then got worse again, so House concludes she continues to be poisoned&mdash;by her artificial hip. After an operation and chelation for cobalt poisoning, Arlene recovers.\n\nHouse once again \"unfires\" Masters, because he feels that, now that Cuddy is his girlfriend, she's becoming too soft on him, and he needs someone to stand up to him to keep him from doing something unethical in extreme cases. Earlier, this had always been Cuddy's role as his boss; now that she's his girlfriend, he thinks Masters could fulfill this role.\n\nThe only other storyline in the episode deals with Taub, who's pressed for money now that he had to move out and live in a hotel. He gets a referral by his ex-wife to her brother, a torts lawyer who needs a medical expert. A side glance at a brain image he finds in the brother's office makes Taub think a boy who was run over by a [[pizza delivery]] truck and is getting a settlement for legs trauma, also has a minor bleed in his brain.\n\nTaub informs the boy's mother, she calls off her assent to a settlement and reports the lawyer to the bar for trying to hide additional damage. An angiogram shows it was nothing, and the lawyer arrives at the hospital to beat Taub up&mdash;as he did five years ago when it was revealed that Taub was cheating on his wife, the lawyer's sister. Thus the lawyer's five years of therapy&mdash;presumably for rage fits&mdash;turn out to be for nothing. Taub's wife comes to him to say he's a good person and console him for his broken nose and the blown chance of finding additional income.\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical Response {{anchor|Critics}} ===\n[[The A.V.
