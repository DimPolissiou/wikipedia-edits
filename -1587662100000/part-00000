Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler. As with a steam engine, the naphtha boils into a gas to drive a piston and then is recovered as a liquid through condensing coils.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Nehemiah|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aI5RAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover|title=New Catechism of the Steam Engine: With Chapters on Gas, Oil and Hot Air Engines|date=1904|publisher=T.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]].<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n==== Gear ====\nSailboats employ [[standing rigging]] to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\".

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]].

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were [[Fore-and-aft rig|fore-and-aft]] [[Lugger|luggers]], [[Schooner|schooners]], and [[Sloop|sloops]]. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nIn the late 19th century, a yacht owner would base his choice of vessels upon preferred lifestyle and budget, which would determine the size and type of vessel, which would most likely be a fore-and aft, two-masted sailing vessel. A treatise on the subject, ''A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing'', provided detailed information on selecting, equipping, sailing, seamanship, management of the paid crew, and racing such vessels. It included a brief section on steam yachts, the recirculating coil steam engine just having made such yachts efficient enough for leisure travel on the water.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kemp|first=Dixon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_vAOAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Sailing+yacht#v=onepage|title=A Manual of Yacht and Boat Sailing|date=1882|publisher=Horace Cox|isbn=|location=London|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Power===\n[[File:WIlliam L.

The power plants started with the [[steam engine]] and transitioned to the [[internal combustion]] engine. Whereas sailing yachts continued to be steered from the after portion of the vessel, power yachts adopted the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]] in a forward cabin structure that afforded better forward and sideways visibility.<ref name=\":02\" />\n==== Steam ====\nThe history of steam yachts starts with large sailing yachts with a [[Steam engine|steam auxiliary engine]]. Early examples, driven with paddle wheels, had a railed platform from which the person conning the vessel could walk across the vessel above the main deck, the origin of the [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]]. In the late 18th century, steam engines became more efficient, spars were removed and  a [[Propeller|screw propellors]] became standard. Large steam yachts were luxurious; their staff included a [[captain]], [[Engine officer|engineer]], and stewards, as well as deck hands.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nThe [[History of the steam engine|development of the steam engine]] figured in yacht design. In England, the practice was to use [[Fire-tube boiler|fire-tube boilers]] wherein the hot gases of combustion ran through parallel tubes surrounded by water; a design that required as slow process of heating the water to avoid damaging the boiler before making steam. In the United States, the practice was to use [[Water-tube boiler|water-tube boilers]], wherein the water is surrounded by the hot gases of combustion, allowing for making steam more rapidly. While the boiler was the source of steam, the [[marine steam engine]] is where the steam was converted to mechanical power. With smaller, more rapidly spinning propellors engines comprised cylinders with pistons, connected to a crank shaft, driven by steam.<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nNear the end of the 19th century, [[Compound engine|compound engines]] came into widespread use. Compound engines exhausted steam into successively larger cylinders to accommodate the higher volumes at reduced pressures, giving improved efficiency. These stages were called expansions, with double- and triple-expansion engines being common, especially in shipping where efficiency was important to reduce the weight of coal carried.<ref name=Hunter>{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=Louis C.|title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930|publisher=University Press of Virginia|year=1985|volume=Vol. 2: Steam Power|location=Charlottesville}}</ref> Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of the [[steam turbine]], [[electric motor]]s and [[internal combustion engine]]s gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines.<ref name=Hunter/><ref name=\"Wiser\">{{cite book|last=Wiser|first=Wendell H.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UmMx9ixu90kC|title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user|year=2000|isbn=978-0-387-98744-6|page=190}}</ref>\n\n==== External combustion ====\nThe steam engine continued as a means of yacht propulsion until the 20th century. In the 1880s the [[naphtha engine]] made its appearance in boats. The naphtha engine is an [[external combustion engine]], where the [[working fluid]] and fuel are both [[naphtha]], which unusually is also used as a liquid fuel to power the boiler.

Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n== Accommodations ==\n[[File:Babainterior.jpg|thumb|Cruising yacht interior with fold-down table in main salon, galley (kitchen) on left, and navigation station on right and forward cabin visible beyond.

In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the [[galley (kitchen)|galley]].

Such vessels have flat surfaces on the undersides.\n* ''Semi-displacement hulls'' allow speeds that are faster than the [[hull speed]] of a displacement vessel because they rise somewhat out of the water and create smaller waves. They also provide greater comfort than planing hulls.\n* ''Full-displacement hulls'' move the water up and out of the way of the vessel, making a wave. They are limited in speed by the square root of the waterline length multiplied by a factor, depending on the units used. Added horsepower cannot increase the maximum speed, only the size of the waves produced. \n\nA typical semi-displacement yacht has a wedge-shaped bow, which promotes penetrating waves, that transitions to flatter, wider surfaces aft, which promotes lifting the vessel out of the water.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.powerandmotoryacht.com/boat-design/the-basics-of-hull-design-explained|title=The Basics of Hull Design Explained|last=Prince|first=Bill|date=June 2019|website=Power & Motoryacht|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nMotor yachts typically have one or two [[internal combustion engine]]s that burn [[diesel fuel]] or [[gasoline]].

A few live in villages near the town of [[Mahuva, Bhavnagar|Mahuva]], in a village  Nanivavdi near the town [[Ranpur, Gujarat|Ranpur]],Sathara near the town Mahuva and in Kadvasan in [[Kodinar]] area and also in a village of Khadol near the town [[Dhandhuka]].They are also found in some villages like Chareliya, Gadhethad, Diu (Union territory) and most of the parts of Upleta taluka. They were one of the greatest clans in India but as India became independent they had to live normal life as landowners.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kBzQAAAACAAJ&sitesec=buy&source=gbs_atb|title=The Rajputs of Saurashtra|last=Singhji|first=Virbhadra|date=1994|publisher=Sangam|isbn=9780861323272|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vala (Clan)}}\n[[Category:Rajput clans of Gujarat]]\n", "name_user": "2402:3a80:848:4c8f:0:47:77a8:ed01", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Some more additional known points)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vala_clan"}

The song was offered to be the Israeli national anthem by some Israelis, but it didn't happen. Often contrasted with the official anthem [[Hatikva]], the original song described the [[Jews|Jewish]] people's 2,000-year longing to return to [[Jerusalem]].

She later acknowledged hearing Hendel perform Pello Joxepe in the mid-1960s, and that she had unconsciously based some of the melody on the lullaby. Shemer felt very bad when she found that it was similar to ''Pello Joxepe'', but when Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez was asked how he felt about the issue, he replied he was \"glad it helped in some way\", and that he was not angry, nor did he perceive it as [[plagiarism]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Idit Avrahami |author2=Nurit Wurgaft |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/naomi-shemer-had-no-reason-to-feel-bad-says-basque-singer-1.157926 |title=Naomi Shemer had no reason to feel bad, says Basque singer |newspaper=Haaretz |date=6 May 2005 |accessdate=11 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] was still controlled by the [[Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan]] and under its sovereign rule.

Human genetics encompasses a variety of overlapping fields including: [[classical genetics]], [[cytogenetics]], [[molecular genetics]], [[biochemical genetics]], [[genomics]], [[population genetics]], [[developmental genetics]], [[clinical genetics]], and [[genetic counseling]].\n\nGenes are the common factor of the qualities of most human-inherited traits. Study of human genetics can answer questions about human nature, can help understand diseases and the development of effective disease treatment, and help us to understand the genetics of human life. This article describes only basic features of human genetics; for the genetics of disorders please see: [[medical genetics]].\n\n[[File:Gen\u00e9tica Humana - py5aal.jpg|thumb|Representation of the double helix structure of human [[DNA]]]]\n\n== Genetic differences and inheritance patterns ==\n[[File:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|[[Autosomal dominant]] pattern, a 50/50 chance.]]\nInheritance of traits for humans are based upon [[Gregor Mendel]]'s model of inheritance. Mendel deduced that inheritance depends upon discrete units of inheritance, called factors or genes.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\">{{cite book | last=Nussbaum | first=Robert L. | first2=Roderick R. | last2=McInnes | first3=Huntington F. | last3=Willard | title=Genetics in Medicine | edition=7th | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Saunders | year=2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== Autosomal dominant inheritance ===\nAutosomal traits are associated with a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome)\u2014they are called \"[[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]\" because a single copy\u2014inherited from either parent\u2014is enough to cause this trait to appear. This often means that one of the parents must also have the same trait, unless it has arisen due to an unlikely new mutation. Examples of autosomal dominant traits and disorders are [[Huntington's disease]] and [[achondroplasia]].\n\n=== Autosomal recessive inheritance ===\n[[File:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Autosomal recessive inheritance, a 25% chance]]\nAutosomal recessive traits is one pattern of inheritance for a trait, disease, or disorder to be passed on through families. For a recessive trait or disease to be displayed two copies of the trait or disorder needs to be presented. The trait or gene will be located on a non-sex chromosome. Because it takes two copies of a trait to display a trait, many people can unknowingly be carriers of a disease. From an evolutionary perspective, a recessive disease or trait can remain hidden for several generations before displaying the phenotype. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders are [[albinism]], [[cystic fibrosis]].\n\n=== X-linked and Y-linked inheritance ===\nX-linked genes are found on the sex X chromosome. X-linked genes just like autosomal genes have both dominant and recessive types. Recessive X-linked disorders are rarely seen in females and usually only affect males. This is because males inherit their X chromosome and all X-linked genes will be inherited from the maternal side. Fathers only pass on their Y chromosome to their sons, so no X-linked traits will be inherited from father to son. Men cannot be carriers for recessive X linked traits, as they only have one X chromosome, so any X linked trait inherited from the mother will show up.\n\nFemales express X-linked disorders when they are homozygous for the disorder and become carriers when they are heterozygous. X-linked dominant inheritance will show the same phenotype as a heterozygote and homozygote. Just like X-linked inheritance, there will be a lack of male-to-male inheritance, which makes it distinguishable from autosomal traits. One example of an X-linked trait is [[Coffin\u2013Lowry syndrome]], which is caused by a mutation in ribosomal protein gene. This mutation results in skeletal, craniofacial abnormalities, mental retardation, and short stature.\n\nX chromosomes in females undergo a process known as [[X inactivation]]. X inactivation is when one of the two X chromosomes in females is almost completely inactivated. It is important that this process occurs otherwise a woman would produce twice the amount of normal X chromosome proteins. The mechanism for X inactivation will occur during the embryonic stage. For people with disorders like [[trisomy X]], where the genotype has three X chromosomes, X-inactivation will inactivate all X chromosomes until there is only one X chromosome active. Males with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], who have an extra X chromosome, will also undergo X inactivation to have only one completely active X chromosome.\n\nY-linked inheritance occurs when a gene, trait, or disorder is transferred through the Y chromosome. Since Y chromosomes can only be found in males, Y linked traits are only passed on from father to son. The [[testis determining factor]], which is located on the Y chromosome, determines the maleness of individuals. Besides the maleness inherited in the Y-chromosome there are no other found Y-linked characteristics.\n\n=== Pedigrees analysis ===\n\n[[File:Autosomal Recessive Pedigree Chart.svg|thumb|right|An example of a family pedigree displaying an autosomal recessive trait]]\n\nA [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] is a diagram showing the ancestral relationships and transmission of genetic traits over several generations in a family. Square symbols are almost always used to represent males, whilst circles are used for females. Pedigrees are used to help detect many different genetic diseases. A pedigree can also be used to help determine the chances for a parent to produce an offspring with a specific trait.\n\nFour different traits can be identified by pedigree chart analysis: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or y-linked. Partial penetrance can be shown and calculated from pedigrees. Penetrance is the percentage expressed frequency with which individuals of a given genotype manifest at least some degree of a specific mutant phenotype associated with a trait.\n\n[[Inbreeding]], or mating between closely related organisms, can clearly be seen on pedigree charts. Pedigree charts of royal families often have a high degree of inbreeding, because it was customary and preferable for royalty to marry another member of royalty. Genetic counselors commonly use pedigrees to help couples determine if the parents will be able to produce healthy children.\n\n=== Karyotype ===\n[[File:Human male karyotype.gif|thumb|right|A [[karyotype]] of a human male, showing 46 chromosomes including XY sex chromosomes.]]\nA [[karyotype]] is a very useful tool in cytogenetics. A karyotype is picture of all the chromosomes in the [[metaphase]] stage arranged according to length and centromere position. A karyotype can also be useful in clinical genetics, due to its ability to diagnose genetic disorders. On a normal karyotype, [[aneuploidy]] can be detected by clearly being able to observe any missing or extra chromosomes.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\" />\n\nGiemsa banding, [[g-banding]], of the karyotype can be used to detect [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], duplications, inversions, and [[translocations]]. G-banding will stain the chromosomes with light and dark bands unique to each chromosome. A FISH, [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], can be used to observe deletions, insertions, and translocations. FISH uses fluorescent probes to bind to specific sequences of the chromosomes that will cause the chromosomes to fluoresce a unique color.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\" />\n\n== Genomics ==\nGenomics is the field of genetics concerned with structural and functional studies of the genome.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\" /> A [[genome]] is all the DNA contained within an organism or a cell including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The [[human genome]] is the total collection of genes in a human being contained in the human chromosome, composed of over three billion nucleotides.<ref>{{cite web | title=Glossary | work=Genetics Home Reference | date=14 March 2008 | publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine <http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/> }}</ref> In April 2003, the [[Human Genome Project]] was able to sequence all the DNA in the human genome, and to discover that the human genome was composed of around 20,000 protein coding genes.\n\n==Medical genetics==\n{{Main|Medical genetics}}\n''Medical genetics'' is the branch of [[medicine]] that involves the diagnosis and management of [[hereditary disorder]]s.  Medical genetics is the application of genetics to medical care.  It overlaps human genetics, for example, research on the causes and inheritance of [[genetic disorders]] would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics, while the diagnosis, management, and counseling of individuals with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\n\n== Population genetics ==\nPopulation genetics is the branch of evolutionary biology responsible for investigating processes that cause changes in allele and genotype frequencies in populations based upon [[Mendelian inheritance]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Freeman | first=Scott | last2=Jon C. | first2=Herron | title=Evolutionary Analysis | edition=4th | publisher=Upper Saddle River: Pearson:Prentice Hall | year=2007 }}</ref> Four different forces can influence the frequencies: [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]] (migration), and [[genetic drift]]. A population can be defined as a group of interbreeding individuals and their offspring. For human genetics the populations will consist only of the human species. The [[Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle]] is a widely used principle to determine allelic and genotype frequencies.\n\n== Mitochondrial DNA ==\nIn addition to [[nuclear DNA]], humans (like almost all [[eukaryotes]]) have [[mitochondrial DNA]]. [[Mitochondria]], the \"power houses\" of a cell, have their own DNA. Mitochondria are inherited from one's mother, and their DNA is frequently used to trace maternal lines of descent (see [[mitochondrial Eve]]). Mitochondrial DNA is only 16kb in length and encodes for 62 genes.\n\n[[File:A region in the pseudoautosomal region of the short arms of the X- and Y-chromosome.jpg|thumbnail|XY Chromosomes]]\n\n=== Genes and sex ===\n{{Main|XY sex-determination system}}\nThe '''XY sex-determination system''' is the [[sex-determination system]] found in [[human]]s, most other [[mammal]]s, some insects (''[[Drosophila]]''), and some plants (''[[Ginkgo]]''). In this system, the [[sex]] of an individual is determined by a pair of '''sex chromosomes''' ('''gonosomes'''). Females have two of the same kind of sex [[chromosome]] (XX), and are called the [[homogametic sex]]. Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the [[heterogametic sex]].\n\n=== X-linked traits ===\n{{Main|Sex linkage}}\nSex linkage is the phenotypic expression of an allele related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. This mode of inheritance is in contrast to the inheritance of traits on autosomal chromosomes, where both sexes have the same probability of inheritance. Since humans have many more genes on the X than the [[Y chromosome|Y]], there are many more [[X chromosome|X-linked traits]] than Y-linked traits.\nHowever, females carry two or more copies of the X chromosome, resulting in a potentially toxic dose of''' X-linked genes'''.<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/x-chromosome-x-inactivation-323 | title=X Chromosome Inactivation | last=Ahn | first=J. | last2=Lee | first2=J. | journal=SciTable | publisher=Nature Education | year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nTo correct this imbalance, mammalian females have evolved a unique mechanism of [[dosage compensation]].  In particular, by way of the process called [[lyonization|X-chromosome inactivation]] (XCI), female mammals transcriptionally silence one of their two Xs in a complex and highly coordinated manner.<ref name=\"nature.com\" />\n{| border=1\n!

introduction to the topic|Introduction to genetics}}\n\n'''Human genetics''' is the study of inheritance as it occurs in [[human beings]]. Human genetics encompasses a variety of overlapping fields including: [[classical genetics]], [[cytogenetics]], [[molecular genetics]], [[biochemical genetics]], [[genomics]], [[population genetics]], [[developmental genetics]], [[clinical genetics]], and [[genetic counseling]].\n\nGenes are the common factor of the qualities of most human-inherited traits. Study of human genetics can answer questions about human nature, can help understand diseases and the development of effective disease treatment, and help us to understand the genetics of human life. This article describes only basic features of human genetics; for the genetics of disorders please see: [[medical genetics]].\n\n[[File:Gen\u00e9tica Humana - py5aal.jpg|thumb|Representation of the double helix structure of human [[DNA]]]]\n\n== Genetic differences and inheritance patterns ==\n[[File:Autosomal dominant - en.svg|thumb|right|[[Autosomal dominant]] pattern, a 50/50 chance.]]\nInheritance of traits for humans are based upon [[Gregor Mendel]]'s model of inheritance. Mendel deduced that inheritance depends upon discrete units of inheritance, called factors or genes.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\">{{cite book | last=Nussbaum | first=Robert L. | first2=Roderick R. | last2=McInnes | first3=Huntington F. | last3=Willard | title=Genetics in Medicine | edition=7th | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Saunders | year=2007 }}</ref>\n\n=== Autosomal dominant inheritance ===\nAutosomal traits are associated with a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome)\u2014they are called \"[[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]]\" because a single copy\u2014inherited from either parent\u2014is enough to cause this trait to appear. This often means that one of the parents must also have the same trait, unless it has arisen due to an unlikely new mutation. Examples of autosomal dominant traits and disorders are [[Huntington's disease]] and [[achondroplasia]].\n\n=== Autosomal recessive inheritance ===\n[[File:Autorecessive.svg|thumb|right|Autosomal recessive inheritance, a 25% chance]]\nAutosomal recessive traits is one pattern of inheritance for a trait, disease, or disorder to be passed on through families. For a recessive trait or disease to be displayed two copies of the trait or disorder needs to be presented. The trait or gene will be located on a non-sex chromosome. Because it takes two copies of a trait to display a trait, many people can unknowingly be carriers of a disease. From an evolutionary perspective, a recessive disease or trait can remain hidden for several generations before displaying the phenotype. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders are [[albinism]], [[cystic fibrosis]].\n\n=== X-linked and Y-linked inheritance ===\nX-linked genes are found on the sex X chromosome. X-linked genes just like autosomal genes have both dominant and recessive types. Recessive X-linked disorders are rarely seen in females and usually only affect males. This is because males inherit their X chromosome and all X-linked genes will be inherited from the maternal side. Fathers only pass on their Y chromosome to their sons, so no X-linked traits will be inherited from father to son. Men cannot be carriers for recessive X linked traits, as they only have one X chromosome, so any X linked trait inherited from the mother will show up.\n\nFemales express X-linked disorders when they are homozygous for the disorder and become carriers when they are heterozygous. X-linked dominant inheritance will show the same phenotype as a heterozygote and homozygote. Just like X-linked inheritance, there will be a lack of male-to-male inheritance, which makes it distinguishable from autosomal traits. One example of an X-linked trait is [[Coffin\u2013Lowry syndrome]], which is caused by a mutation in ribosomal protein gene. This mutation results in skeletal, craniofacial abnormalities, mental retardation, and short stature.\n\nX chromosomes in females undergo a process known as [[X inactivation]]. X inactivation is when one of the two X chromosomes in females is almost completely inactivated. It is important that this process occurs otherwise a woman would produce twice the amount of normal X chromosome proteins. The mechanism for X inactivation will occur during the embryonic stage. For people with disorders like [[trisomy X]], where the genotype has three X chromosomes, X-inactivation will inactivate all X chromosomes until there is only one X chromosome active. Males with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], who have an extra X chromosome, will also undergo X inactivation to have only one completely active X chromosome.\n\nY-linked inheritance occurs when a gene, trait, or disorder is transferred through the Y chromosome. Since Y chromosomes can only be found in males, Y linked traits are only passed on from father to son. The [[testis determining factor]], which is located on the Y chromosome, determines the maleness of individuals. Besides the maleness inherited in the Y-chromosome there are no other found Y-linked characteristics.\n\n=== Pedigrees analysis ===\n\n[[File:Autosomal Recessive Pedigree Chart.svg|thumb|right|An example of a family pedigree displaying an autosomal recessive trait]]\n\nA [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] is a diagram showing the ancestral relationships and transmission of genetic traits over several generations in a family. Square symbols are almost always used to represent males, whilst circles are used for females. Pedigrees are used to help detect many different genetic diseases. A pedigree can also be used to help determine the chances for a parent to produce an offspring with a specific trait.\n\nFour different traits can be identified by pedigree chart analysis: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or y-linked. Partial penetrance can be shown and calculated from pedigrees. Penetrance is the percentage expressed frequency with which individuals of a given genotype manifest at least some degree of a specific mutant phenotype associated with a trait.\n\n[[Inbreeding]], or mating between closely related organisms, can clearly be seen on pedigree charts. Pedigree charts of royal families often have a high degree of inbreeding, because it was customary and preferable for royalty to marry another member of royalty. Genetic counselors commonly use pedigrees to help couples determine if the parents will be able to produce healthy children.\n\n=== Karyotype ===\n[[File:Human male karyotype.gif|thumb|right|A [[karyotype]] of a human male, showing 46 chromosomes including XY sex chromosomes.]]\nA [[karyotype]] is a very useful tool in cytogenetics. A karyotype is picture of all the chromosomes in the [[metaphase]] stage arranged according to length and centromere position. A karyotype can also be useful in clinical genetics, due to its ability to diagnose genetic disorders. On a normal karyotype, [[aneuploidy]] can be detected by clearly being able to observe any missing or extra chromosomes.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\" />\n\nGiemsa banding, [[g-banding]], of the karyotype can be used to detect [[deletion (genetics)|deletions]], [[insertion (genetics)|insertions]], duplications, inversions, and [[translocations]]. G-banding will stain the chromosomes with light and dark bands unique to each chromosome. A FISH, [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], can be used to observe deletions, insertions, and translocations. FISH uses fluorescent probes to bind to specific sequences of the chromosomes that will cause the chromosomes to fluoresce a unique color.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\" />\n\n== Genomics ==\nGenomics is the field of genetics concerned with structural and functional studies of the genome.<ref name=\"Nussbaum, Robert L. 2007\" /> A [[genome]] is all the DNA contained within an organism or a cell including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The [[human genome]] is the total collection of genes in a human being contained in the human chromosome, composed of over three billion nucleotides.<ref>{{cite web | title=Glossary | work=Genetics Home Reference | date=14 March 2008 | publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine <http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/> }}</ref> In April 2003, the [[Human Genome Project]] was able to sequence all the DNA in the human genome, and to discover that the human genome was composed of around 20,000 protein coding genes.\n\n==Medical genetics==\n{{Main|Medical genetics}}\n''Medical genetics'' is the branch of [[medicine]] that involves the diagnosis and management of [[hereditary disorder]]s.  Medical genetics is the application of genetics to medical care.  It overlaps human genetics, for example, research on the causes and inheritance of [[genetic disorders]] would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics, while the diagnosis, management, and counseling of individuals with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\n\n== Population genetics ==\nPopulation genetics is the branch of evolutionary biology responsible for investigating processes that cause changes in allele and genotype frequencies in populations based upon [[Mendelian inheritance]].<ref>{{cite web | last=Freeman | first=Scott | last2=Jon C. | first2=Herron | title=Evolutionary Analysis | edition=4th | publisher=Upper Saddle River: Pearson:Prentice Hall | year=2007 }}</ref> Four different forces can influence the frequencies: [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]] (migration), and [[genetic drift]]. A population can be defined as a group of interbreeding individuals and their offspring. For human genetics the populations will consist only of the human species. The [[Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle]] is a widely used principle to determine allelic and genotype frequencies.\n\n== Mitochondrial DNA ==\nIn addition to [[nuclear DNA]], humans (like almost all [[eukaryotes]]) have [[mitochondrial DNA]]. [[Mitochondria]], the \"power houses\" of a cell, have their own DNA. Mitochondria are inherited from one's mother, and their DNA is frequently used to trace maternal lines of descent (see [[mitochondrial Eve]]). Mitochondrial DNA is only 16kb in length and encodes for 62 genes.\n\n[[File:A region in the pseudoautosomal region of the short arms of the X- and Y-chromosome.jpg|thumbnail|XY Chromosomes]]\n\n=== Genes and sex ===\n{{Main|XY sex-determination system}}\nThe '''XY sex-determination system''' is the [[sex-determination system]] found in [[human]]s, most other [[mammal]]s, some insects (''[[Drosophila]]''), and some plants (''[[Ginkgo]]''). In this system, the [[sex]] of an individual is determined by a pair of '''sex chromosomes''' ('''gonosomes'''). Females have two of the same kind of sex [[chromosome]] (XX), and are called the [[homogametic sex]]. Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the [[heterogametic sex]].\n\n=== X-linked traits ===\n{{Main|Sex linkage}}\nSex linkage is the phenotypic expression of an allele related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. This mode of inheritance is in contrast to the inheritance of traits on autosomal chromosomes, where both sexes have the same probability of inheritance. Since humans have many more genes on the X than the [[Y chromosome|Y]], there are many more [[X chromosome|X-linked traits]] than Y-linked traits.\nHowever, females carry two or more copies of the X chromosome, resulting in a potentially toxic dose of''' X-linked genes'''.<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/x-chromosome-x-inactivation-323 | title=X Chromosome Inactivation | last=Ahn | first=J. | last2=Lee | first2=J. | journal=SciTable | publisher=Nature Education | year=2008 }}</ref>\n\nTo correct this imbalance, mammalian females have evolved a unique mechanism of [[dosage compensation]].  In particular, by way of the process called [[lyonization|X-chromosome inactivation]] (XCI), female mammals transcriptionally silence one of their two Xs in a complex and highly coordinated manner.<ref name=\"nature.com\" />\n{| border=1\n!
