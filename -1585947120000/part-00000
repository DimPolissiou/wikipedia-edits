Russo states that he coined the name \"Total Nonstop Action\", the initials of the company \"TNA\" being a play on \"[[T & A (professional wrestling)|T&A]]\".

That night, however, in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] just before they went on the air, a 450 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] wrestler named Cheex hit the ropes with so much force that one of them broke. The estimated repair time was 30\u201360 minutes, which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes, whether the ring was ready or not. Backstage, the producers shuffled the schedule so that some non-wrestling segments went first to give the ring crew some more time, but they did not have many of them. The ring crew fixed the rope with the help of [[The Harris Brothers|Ron and Don Harris]], and everyone went live hoping for the best.<ref name=\"The History of TNA: Year 1\"/>\n\nInitially, TNA's weekly [[pay-per-view]] show operated as the company's main source of revenue, in place of [[List of TNA pay-per-view events|monthly pay-per-view events]] used by other promotions.

Russo states that he coined the name \"Total Nonstop Action\", the initials of the company \"TNA\" being a play on \"[[T & A (professional wrestling)|T&A]]\".

That night, however, in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]] just before they went on the air, a 450 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] wrestler named Cheex hit the ropes with so much force that one of them broke. The estimated repair time was 30\u201360 minutes, which they did not have because the schedule called for them to go live in a few minutes, whether the ring was ready or not. Backstage, the producers shuffled the schedule so that some non-wrestling segments went first to give the ring crew some more time, but they did not have many of them. The ring crew fixed the rope with the help of [[The Harris Brothers|Ron and Don Harris]], and everyone went live hoping for the best.<ref name=\"The History of TNA: Year 1\"/>\n\nInitially, TNA's weekly [[pay-per-view]] show operated as the company's main source of revenue, in place of [[List of TNA pay-per-view events|monthly pay-per-view events]] used by other promotions.

This is called masking (when an animal applies materials from the environment to its body), more specifically this is a type of masking called corpse camouflage<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />. The nymphs use this camouflage to hide from predators and aid in the capture of their prey<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\nTo build its mask ''Acanthaspis petax'' must first capture its prey. Once captured ''Acanthaspis petax'' injects the prey with [[Digestive enzyme|digestive enzymes]] and drinks the dissolved tissues, leaving an empty [[exoskeleton]] behind<ref name=\":0\" />. This [[exoskeleton]] is fixed to the back of ''Acanthaspis petax'' using adhesive threads it secretes from secretory hairs on its [[Insect morphology|abdomen]]<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nHow exactly this carcass mound camouflages ''Acanthaspis petax'' is still up for debate as little research has been done on the topic. The theory with the most support is that of Robinson's Hypothesis of bizarre forms<ref name=\":0\" />. The insect may attach so many items to its back that it is unrecognizable to predators<ref name=\":0\" />. Not camouflaging as something else but simply disrupting it's own image. Interestingly, ants are not the only organisms ''Acanthaspis petax'' preys on, but they are the main ones it builds it\u2019s mask out of<ref name=\":1\" />. This is possibly because spiders are a major predator of ''Acanthaspis petax'' but not of ants. In fact, spiders may avoid a cluster of ants in fear of being swarmed by them<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" />. This theory suggests A''canthaspis petax'' is camouflaging itself as a swarm of ants<ref name=\":2\" />. It has been suggested that it is a type of olfactory camouflage, meaning the smell of the ants would mask that of the insect<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/this-insect-uses-its-victims-carcasses-as-camouflage-83656246/|title=This Insect Uses Its Victims\u2019 Carcasses As Camouflage|last=Stromberg|first=Joseph|website=Smithsonian Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>. However, it should be noted that this last theory has not been tested. \n\nWhat is known is that masked bugs get preyed upon much less than naked bugs by [[Jumping spider|salticide]] spiders (who have good vision and bad olfactory senses), leading to the conclusion that the camouflage is at least partially visual<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n=== Other Camouflage ===\nThe [[Insect life cycle|nymphs]] also cover themselves in sand particles for camouflage<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nThe nymphs are active during the day and use camouflage heavily<ref name=\":1\" />. The adults are active at night and therefore have less of a need for camouflage<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n== Feeding ==\n''Acanthaspis petax'' stalks its prey, until it gets close enough to spring on the prey<ref name=\":1\" />. It then pierces the prey with its syringe-like [[proboscis]]<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. Paralyzing saliva and digestive enzymes are sent down the proboscis into the prey<ref name=\":0\" />. Once the prey is extra-corporeally digested ''Acanthaspis'' ''petax'' sucks the liquefied tissues up the proboscis leaving only the exoskeleton of the prey behind<ref name=\":0\" />.\n\n== Behaviours ==\nWhen grabbed by a predator ''Acanthaspis petax'' can release its body from its mask and run away or hide, leaving behind only a ball of ant carcasses<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />. If a nymph is caught it plays dead and will not move for many minutes even if it is released<ref name=\":1\" />. \n\n''Acanthaspis petax'' generally move infrequently and in short bursts. This type of movement enhances the effectiveness of the camouflage<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nNymphs can go many days without food or water making them well adapted to their seemingly unattractive habitat<ref name=\":1\" />.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Odhiambo, Thomas R.

The Giant Bombcast, hosted originally by Ryan Davis until his death and now hosted by Brad Shoemaker, unites the San Francisco Office's senior Staff to talk about their week, discuss news and answer e-mails.

Lance and Snider at the time were running their own joint venture known as Enemy Kite, in which they had created Comic Vine. Comic Vine would become the first Whiskey Media website, complete with a full conversion from the [[PHP]] format to Whiskey Media's de facto framework, [[Django (Web framework)|Django]].\n\nLater in the year [[Jeff Gerstmann]] also left CNET after being controversially fired from his position as Editorial Director of [[GameSpot]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Jeff Gerstmann on GameSpot, Giant Bomb, and snark |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/f/jeff-gerstmann-on-gamespot-giant-bomb-and-snark/a-20080403102237110057 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> This began a chain reaction in which Ryan Davis, Alex Navarro, Brad Shoemaker and Vinny Caravella would leave after the incident. This led to Whiskey Media and Gerstmann getting in touch with each other and with Ryan Davis they created the video game website, [[Giant Bomb]], which Caravella, Shoemaker, and Navarro now all work for.\n\nGiant Bomb and subsequent websites, Anime Vice (launched in 2008), Tested and Screened (both launched in 2010) were designed around the same \"social publishing\" concept as Comic Vine, content created by tech-savvy communities, while being run by small teams of editorial staff, video producers and engineers.<ref>{{cite web |date=2010-05-20 |title=Whiskey Media's (And Former CNET CEO) Shelby Bonnie Talks Content and More! |url=http://allthingsd.com/20100520/whiskey-medias-and-former-cnet-ceo-shelby-bonnie-talks-content-and-more/ |publisher=althingsd.com |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> In an interview with [[The New York Times]], Bonnie explained that creating a small staffed company as opposed to CNET was a, \"great constraint that forces us to do smart stuff.\" When asked why they didn't go down the route of blog sites such as [[Joystiq]] or [[Engadget]], Bonnie said that, \"what blogs figured out was how to create a scalable inexpensive model, but there is not a shelf space for content.

With over one-hundred thousand downloads weekly, it is the most popular feature of the site, consistently being placed in the top ten most downloaded gaming podcasts globally on [[iTunes]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/euro/itunes/charts/podcasts/top10podcastsgameshobbies.html |title=iTunes Store Top 10 Podcasts - Games & Hobbies |publisher=Apple |accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> Quick Looks are usually long unedited videos of two or more staff members playing through part(s) of a game, usually at the beginning. One of the most relevant video series was the Persona 4 Endurance Run, which featured Vinny Caravella and Jeff Gerstmann playing ''[[Persona 4]]'' from start to finish during almost 100 hours, its success gaining the acknowledgement of [[Atlus#Atlus USA|Atlus USA]] itself, to which Gerstmann comically thanked them for, \"not having [their] legal team get in touch with us.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/e3-2009-interview-persona-psp/17-829/ |title=E3 2009 Interview: Persona PSP|publisher=Giant Bomb|date=2009-06-05|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> Davis was the presenter on the This Ain't No Game feature, in which he reviewed [[films]] that are based on [[video games]]. [[Mortal Kombat]] co-creator [[Ed Boon]] commented on Davis's review of [[Mortal Kombat Annihilation]], stating that his overly negative review was still, \"a bit too kind to it.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trmk.org/news/12674/mmm_giant_bombs_take_on_mk_annihilation.html|title=MMM: Giant Bomb's Take on MK Annihilation|publisher=TRMK|date=2009-07-27|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2009 Giant Bomb has had several staff additions including former intern Drew Scanlon becoming Video Producer in 2009, Alex Navarro becoming a writer in addition to his work on [[Whiskey Media#Screened|Screened]] in April 2010 and Brad Nicholson becoming an external news writer in May 2010.

Gerstmann hosted the Bombcast and live shows in his place for some time until he passed the podcast host role to Brad Shoemaker in 2014. Vinny Caravella moved to NYC in mid 2014 to form an east-coast office with Alex Navarro, now affectionately known as the GBEast. Dan Ryckert and Jason Oestreicher moved from Game Informer to join the San Francisco office in mid 2014. Patrick Klepek announced his departure from Giant Bomb in the last Game of the Year podcast for 2014 and in early January announced his new job as News Editor for Kotaku. After interviewing for his replacement, it was announced on May 30, 2015 that Austin Walker would be joining Giant Bomb as News Editor, and would be working from the New York office.\n\nGiant Bomb has regularly produced new content, including a multiplayer livestreaming show, Thursday Night Throwdown on Justin.tv,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.giantbomb.com/monday-night-combat/61-29806/thursday-night-throwdown-0819-monday-night-combat/35-439670/#143 |title=Thursday Night Throwdown 08/19: Monday Night Combat |publisher=Giant Bomb|date=2010-09-19|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> coverage of major video game conventions at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3)]], [[Game Developers Conference|Game Developers Conference (GDC)]] and [[Penny Arcade Expo|Penny Arcade Expo (PAX)]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/videos/6/ |title=Events Videos - Giant Bomb|publisher=Giant Bomb|date=2011-04-18|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> other playthroughs,<ref>{{cite web \n|url = http://www.giantbomb.com/endurance-run-deadly-premonition-part-vj-01/17-2281/ |title=Endurance Run: Deadly Premonition: Part VJ-01|publisher=Giant Bomb|date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref> several other podcasts, a game development series called \"Building the Bastion\" with [[Supergiant Games]], reuniting the former GameSpot Editors with their former Editor-in-chief [[Greg Kasavin]], who record the development of the video game ''[[Bastion (video game)|Bastion]]'', much in the same vein as the How to Build a Bomb videos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://supergiantgames.com/?p=285|title=This Is Bastion|publisher=[[Supergiant Games]]|date=2010-09-02\n|accessdate=2011-04-18}}</ref>\n\n====Comic Vine<!--'Comic Vine' redirects here-->====\n{| class=wikitable align=right\n|+ Comic Vine Editorial Team as of May 2015\n|-\n!

An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users.

A message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the Caesar Cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/|title=Caesar Cipher in Cryptography|date=2016-06-02|website=GeeksforGeeks|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nAround 800 A.D., Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] developed the technique of [[frequency analysis]] - which was an attempt to systematically crack Caesar ciphers.<ref name=\":4\" /> This technique looked at the frequency of letters in the encrypted message to determine the appropriate shift. This technique was rendered ineffective after the creation of the [[Polyalphabetic cipher]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leone Alberti]] in 1465, which incorporated different sets of [[Language|languages]]. In order for frequency analysis to be useful, the person trying to decrypt the message would need to know which language the sender chose.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n\n=== 19th-20th century ===\nAround 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] theorized a cipher to encode and decode messages in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence. The cipher, known today as the Wheel Cipher or the [[Jefferson disk|Jefferson Disk]], although never actually built, was theorized as a spool that could jumble an English message up to 36 characters. The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/wheel-cipher|title=Wheel Cipher|website=www.monticello.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nA similar device to the Jefferson Disk, the [[M-94]], was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne.

The Enigma Machine was more complex because unlike the Jefferson Wheel and the M-94, each day the jumble of letters switched to a completely new combination.

[[Authenticated encryption]] algorithms are designed to provide both encryption and integrity protection together. Standards for [[cryptographic software]] and [[Hardware encryption|hardware to perform encryption]] are widely available, but successfully using encryption to ensure security may be a challenging problem. A single error in system design or execution can allow successful attacks. Sometimes an adversary can obtain unencrypted information without directly undoing the encryption. See for example [[traffic analysis]], [[TEMPEST]], or [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usa.kaspersky.com/internet-security-center/threats/trojans#.VV3oaWDTvfY|title=What is a Trojan Virus - Malware Protection - Kaspersky Lab US}}</ref>\n\nIntegrity protection mechanisms such as [[message authentication code|MACs]] and [[Digital signature|digital signatures]] must be applied to the ciphertext when it is first created, typically on the same device used to compose the message, to protect a message [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end]] along its full transmission path; otherwise, any node between the sender and the encryption agent could potentially tamper with it. Encrypting at the time of creation is only secure if the encryption device itself has correct [[Key (cryptography)|keys]] and has not been tampered with. If an endpoint device has been configured to trust a [[root certificate]] that an attacker controls, for example, then the attacker can both inspect and tamper with encrypted data by performing a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] anywhere along the message's path. The common practice of [[Transport Layer Security#TLS_interception|TLS interception]] by network operators represents a controlled and institutionally sanctioned form of such an attack, but countries have also attempted to employ such attacks as a form of control and censorship.<ref>{{cite article|url=https://thehackernews.com/2019/07/kazakhstan-https-security-certificate.html|title=Kazakhstan Begins Intercepting HTTPS Internet Traffic Of All Citizens Forcefully|first1=Mohit|last1=Kumar|date=July 2019|publisher=The Hacker News}}</ref>\n\n=== Ciphertext length and padding ===\n\n{{main| Padding (cryptography)}}\n\nEven when encryption correctly hides a message's content and it cannot be tampered with at rest or in transit, a message's ''length'' is a form of [[metadata]] that can still leak sensitive information about the message.

A message encoded with this type of encryption could be decoded with the fixed number on the Caesar Cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/|title=Caesar Cipher in Cryptography|date=2016-06-02|website=GeeksforGeeks|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nAround 800 A.D., Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] developed the technique of [[frequency analysis]] - which was an attempt to systematically crack Caesar ciphers.<ref name=\":42\" /> This technique looked at the frequency of letters in the encrypted message to determine the appropriate shift. This technique was rendered ineffective after the creation of the [[Polyalphabetic cipher]] by [[Leon Battista Alberti|Leone Alberti]] in 1465, which incorporated different sets of [[Language|languages]]. In order for frequency analysis to be useful, the person trying to decrypt the message would need to know which language the sender chose.<ref name=\":42\" />\n\n=== 19th-20th century ===\nAround 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] theorized a cipher to encode and decode messages in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence. The cipher, known today as the Wheel Cipher or the [[Jefferson disk|Jefferson Disk]], although never actually built, was theorized as a spool that could jumble an English message up to 36 characters. The message could be decrypted by plugging in the jumbled message to a receiver with an identical cipher.'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/wheel-cipher|title=Wheel Cipher|website=www.monticello.org|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>'''\n\nA similar device to the Jefferson Disk, the [[M-94]], was developed in 1917 independently by US Army Major Joseph Mauborne.

If an endpoint device has been configured to trust a [[root certificate]] that an attacker controls, for example, then the attacker can both inspect and tamper with encrypted data by performing a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] anywhere along the message's path. The common practice of [[Transport Layer Security#TLS_interception|TLS interception]] by network operators represents a controlled and institutionally sanctioned form of such an attack, but countries have also attempted to employ such attacks as a form of control and censorship.<ref>{{cite article|url=https://thehackernews.com/2019/07/kazakhstan-https-security-certificate.html|title=Kazakhstan Begins Intercepting HTTPS Internet Traffic Of All Citizens Forcefully|first1=Mohit|last1=Kumar|date=July 2019|publisher=The Hacker News}}</ref>\n\n=== Ciphertext length and padding ===\n\n{{main| Padding (cryptography)}}\n\nEven when encryption correctly hides a message's content and it cannot be tampered with at rest or in transit, a message's ''length'' is a form of [[metadata]] that can still leak sensitive information about the message. For example, the well-known [[CRIME]] and [[BREACH]] attacks against [[HTTPS]] were [[Side-channel attack|side-channel attacks]] that relied on information leakage via the length of encrypted content.<ref>{{cite report|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7457|title= Summarizing Known Attacks on Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS (DTLS)|first1=Y.|last1=Sheffer|first2=R.|last2=Holz|first3=P.|last3=Saint-Andre|date= February 2015}}</ref> [[Traffic analysis]] is a broad class of techniques that often employs message lengths to infer sensitive implementation about traffic flows by aggregating information about a large number of messages.\n\n[[Padding (cryptography)|Padding]] a message's payload before encrypting it can help obscure the cleartext's true length, at the cost of increasing the ciphertext's size and introducing or increasing [[Overhead (computing)|bandwidth overhead]]. Messages may be padded [[Padding (cryptography)#Randomized_padding|randomly]] or [[Padding (cryptography)#Deterministic_padding|deterministically]], with each approach having different tradeoffs. Encrypting and padding messages to form [[PURB (cryptography)|padded uniform random blobs or PURBs]] is a practice guaranteeing that the cipher text leaks no [[metadata]] about its cleartext's content, and leaks asymptotically minimal <math>O(\\log\\log M)</math> [[Entropy (information theory)|information]] via its length.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://petsymposium.org/2019/files/papers/issue4/popets-2019-0056.pdf|title=Reducing Metadata Leakage from Encrypted Files and Communication with PURBs|first1=Kirill|last1=Nikitin|first2=Ludovic|last2=Barman|first3=Wouter|last3=Lueks|first4=Matthew|last4=Underwood|first5=Jean-Pierre|last5=Hubaux|first6=Bryan|last6=Ford|journal=Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETS)|volume=2019|issue=4|pages=6\u201333|doi=10.2478/popets-2019-0056|year=2019}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col |colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Multiple encryption]]\n* [[Substitution cipher]]\n* [[Rotor machine|Rotor cipher machines]]\n<!--* [[MicroTokenization]]-->\n* [[Brute-force attack]]\n* [[Cold boot attack]]\n* [[Dictionary attack]]\n* [[Rainbow table]]\n* [[Encrypted function]]\n* [[Export of cryptography]]\n* [[Cyberspace Electronic Security Act]] (US)\n* [[Disk encryption]]\n* [[Key management]]\n* [[Information-theoretic security#Physical layer encryption|Physical Layer Encryption]]\n* [[Geo-blocking]]\n* [[Television encryption]]\n* [[Active Defense|Active defense]]\n* [[Cryptography]]\n* [[Tokenization (data security)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Citation | last = Fouch\u00e9 Gaines | first = Helen | author-link = Helen Fouch\u00e9 Gaines | title = Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution | place = New York | publisher = Dover Publications Inc | year = 1939 | isbn = 978-0486200972 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/cryptanalysis00hele }}\n* [[David Kahn (writer)|Kahn, David]], ''The Codebreakers - The Story of Secret Writing'' ({{ISBN|0-684-83130-9}}) (1967)\n* [[Bart Preneel|Preneel, Bart]], \"Advances in Cryptology \u2014 EUROCRYPT 2000\", Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-540-67517-4}}\n* [[Abraham Sinkov|Sinkov, Abraham]], ''Elementary Cryptanalysis: A Mathematical Approach'', Mathematical Association of America, 1966. {{ISBN|0-88385-622-0}}\n* {{Citation | last1 =Yehuda | first1 = Lindell|last2=Jonathan|first2=Katz | title = Introduction to modern cryptography | publisher =  Hall/CRC | year = 2014 | isbn =  978-1466570269 }}\n \n{{Wiktionary|encryption}}\n{{Commons category|Cryptographic algorithms|position=}}\n\n{{Cryptography navbox}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cryptography]]\n[[Category:Data protection]]\n", "name_user": "Zoharrab", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed citations", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption"}
