After former [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] club [[Peterborough & Fletton United F.C.|Peterborough & Fletton United]] folded in 1932, there had been no senior football in the Peterborough area. In the summer of 1934, a new professional club, named Peterborough United, was founded to take its place. It was welcomed into membership of the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]] for 1934\u201335,<ref name=PUFCHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.theposh.com/club/history/ |title=Peterborough United FC History |publisher=Peterborough United F.C. |accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> and the club's first team finished that initial season in mid-table.<ref name=FCHD/> They entered the national [[cup competition]], the [[FA Cup]], the [[1935\u201336 FA Cup|following season]], but lost their opening match 3\u20130 at home to [[Rushden Town F.C.|Rushden Town]] in the first qualifying round.<ref name=FACupArchive/> When competitive football resumed after the Second World War, Peterborough enjoyed improved performances in both league and cup competition.

Repeated attempts at election to the Football League failed{{snd}}albeit narrowly in 1958\u201359{{snd}}until they finally gained admission to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1960 at the expense of [[Gateshead A.F.C.|Gateshead]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/League&Cup/Champions.htm |title=Premier League and Football League |website=footballsite.co.uk |accessdate=21 May 2016}} Select seasons required via Div 3S and Div 4 links; pages give breakdown of voting figures.</ref>\n\nTheir momentum continued into the new Football League season: in second place with Christmas approaching, Peterborough did not lose again until the following April.<ref name=11v11>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/peterborough-united/tab/leagueTables/ |title=Peterborough United league performance history |postscript=none}} and {{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/peterborough-united/tab/matches/ |title=Peterborough United football club complete match record |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=16 July 2018}} Select date(s) required via dropdown menus.</ref> They won the Fourth Division title, scoring what remains a Football League record 134 goals.<ref name=FLGoals/> [[Terry Bly]] supplied 52 of those 134{{snd}}not a league record, but a seasonal total which has not been surpassed since.<ref name=FLGoals>{{cite web |url=http://www.fl125.co.uk/records/league-goals |title=Goals |publisher=The Football League |accessdate=21 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170916172648/http://www.fl125.co.uk/records/league-goals |archive-date=16 September 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> They followed up with four top-half finishes at the higher level before dropping to mid-table, eliminated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] among others on their way to the sixth round (quarter-final) of the [[1964\u201365 FA Cup]], and went one step further in the [[1965\u201366 Football League Cup|1965\u201366 League Cup]], losing to [[West Bromwich Albion]] in the semifinal,<ref name=FCHD/> but problems off the field disrupted their further progress. In November 1967, [[the Football Association]] and Football League met to consider charges of making illegal payments to players, poor accounting practices and poor internal governance, stemming from claims surrounding an FA Cup match against [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] the previous January.

In the summer of 1934, a new professional club, named Peterborough United, was founded to take its place. It was welcomed into membership of the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]] for 1934\u201335,<ref name=PUFCHistory>{{cite web |url=http://www.theposh.com/club/history/ |title=Peterborough United FC History |publisher=Peterborough United F.C. |accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> and the club's first team finished that initial season in mid-table.<ref name=FCHD/> They entered the national [[cup competition]], the [[FA Cup]], the [[1935\u201336 FA Cup|following season]], but lost their opening match 3\u20130 at home to [[Rushden Town F.C.|Rushden Town]] in the first qualifying round.<ref name=FACupArchive/> When competitive football resumed after the Second World War, Peterborough enjoyed improved performances in both league and cup competition.

The segment has been featured on the programme since the [[1970\u201371 in English football|1970\u201371]] season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Typically, a selection of eight or ten goals from the month are shown before the Goal of the Month is decided. Until the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season, viewers were given the chance to win a prize by selecting the correct winner and the winner would be decided by a vote firstly by post then by text and phone votes. For the majority of the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]] season, the BBC did not allow any competitions due to a money-for-competitions-entry scandal, but towards the end of the season and for the goal of the season competition, normal service was resumed.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC website: ''Goal of the Month in Match of the Day''  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/6970432.stm |accessdate=2 September 2007| date=13 September 2007 |work=BBC News}}</ref> When ''Match of the Day'' moved to ''Match of the Day 2'' when [[Colin Murray]] presented the winner was decided by the subjective opinion of one of the pundits, such as [[Alan Hansen]], [[Mark Lawrenson]] or [[Alan Shearer]]. From October 2013, BBC ''Match of the Day 2'' viewers have picked the Goal of the Month in a poll conducted by voting on the BBC Sport website or sending the hashtag of the viewers favourite goal via Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Goal of the Month|url=http://vote.tectonicinteractive.com/#/|website=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313110618/http://vote.tectonicinteractive.com/#/|archive-date=13 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe award of Goal of the Month was usually given as first-, second- and third-best goal of the month on ''Match of the Day'' up until the BBC lost the right to show Premier League highlights from 2000\u201301. When highlights returned to the BBC for 2004\u201305, the format was reduced to only the best goal of the month being announced.  Contending goals used to feature from other competitions which the BBC had the broadcasting rights for, most usually from the [[FA Cup]], this was up to 2007\u201308 when its rights were transferred to ITV.  Once the FA Cup returned to the BBC from 2014\u201315, Goal of the Month remained exclusively a Premier League affair.  The winners usually go forth to contest the [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]].\n\nFrom 2016\u201317, the Premier League has run its own [[Premier League Goal of the Month|Goal of the Month]] award, whose winners can conflict with the ''Match of the Day'' accolade, as had happened six times in its maiden season.\n\n==Records==\n* During the period in which a top three was announced each month, [[Dennis Bergkamp]] was the only player to have achieved the deemed first, second, and third best goals of the month in one calendar month, August 1997. Only two goals came from his hat-trick against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]\u2014not all three as is widely cited. The third was from a previous game against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Goal of the Month 1997|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NlHVNsPHKE}}</ref>\n*The record for players having more than one nomination for GOTS is three- This has happened twice, the first time in 1992-93 when [[Ryan Giggs]] (September and May), [[Dalian Atkinson]] (October and December) and [[Dwight Yorke]] (February and March) each won two Goal of The Month awards. The second was in 1995-96 with [[Tony Yeboah]] (August and September); [[Ian Wright]] (October and January) and [[Alan Shearer]] (December and April) each having two goals in contention. There have been numerous occasions where two players have been nominated twice. but as of 2018-19, no player has yet had 3 goals selected in a Premier League season.\n*[[Gareth Bale]] is the last player to have had 2 goals selected, in 2012-13 season. None of the subsequent seasons (up to 2018-19) have seen any player win GOTM more than once.\n*Consecutive GOTM wins has occurred only 3 times. The players to have achieved this are Yorke in 1992-93 (February and March); Yeboah in 1995-96 (August and September) and Bale in 2012-13 (January and February).\n*Since the advent of the Premier League in 1992-93 [[Jack Wilshere]] is the only player to have won GOTS in consecutive seasons (2013-14 and 2014-15) although [[BBC Goal of the Season|his latter win was controversial.]]\n*[[Wayne Rooney]] is the player with the most GOTS wins in the Premier League era, having won the award 3 times - 2004-05; 2006-07 and 2010-11.\n\n==Winners==\n===1992\u201393===\n{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n'''Key:''' \n{{legend2|#A9F5A9|'''Goal of the Season'''|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Month\n!Scorer\n!For\n!Against\n!Stadium\n!Competition\n!Date\n|-\n|September\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Ryan|Giggs}}|WAL}}\n|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]\n|[[White Hart Lane]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|19 September 1992\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|October\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dalian|Atkinson}}|ENG}}\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Selhurst Park]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|3 October 1992\n|-\n|November\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Clive|Freeman}}|ENG}}\n|[[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]]\n|[[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]\n|[[Moss Lane]]\n|[[FA Cup|FA Cup 2nd Round]]\n|25 November 1992\n|-\n|December\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dalian|Atkinson}}|ENG}}\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]\n|[[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|5 December 1992\n|-\n|January\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Julian|Joachim}}|ENG}}\n|[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]\n|[[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]\n|[[Oakwell Stadium|Oakwell]]\n|[[FA Cup|FA Cup 3rd Round Replay]]\n|20 January 1993\n|-\n|February\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dwight|Yorke}}|TRI}}\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]\n|[[Villa Park]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|6 February 1993\n|-\n|March\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dwight|Yorke}}|TRI}}\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]\n|[[Villa Park]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|17 March 1993\n|-\n|April\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Ian|Rush}}|WAL}}\n|[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]\n|[[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]\n|[[Anfield]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|10 April 1993\n|-\n|May\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Ryan|Giggs}}|WAL}}\n|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]\n|[[Old Trafford]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|3 May 1993\n|}\n\n===1993\u201394===\n{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n'''Key:''' \n{{legend2|#A9F5A9|'''Goal of the Season'''|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Month\n!Scorer\n!For\n!Against\n!Stadium\n!Competition\n!Date\n|-\n|August\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Jeremy|Goss}}|WAL}}\n|[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]\n|[[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]\n|[[Elland Road]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|21 August 1993\n|-\n|September\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Efan|Ekoku}}|NGA}}\n|[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]\n|[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]\n|[[Goodison Park]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|25 September 1993\n|-\n|October\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Matt|Le Tissier}}|ENG}}{{efn|Le Tissier was born in Guernsey, which has status of [[County Football Association]] within [[the Football Association]].

The segment has been featured on the programme since the [[1970\u201371 in English football|1970\u201371]] season.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Typically, a selection of eight or ten goals from the month are shown before the Goal of the Month is decided. Until the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season, viewers were given the chance to win a prize by selecting the correct winner and the winner would be decided by a vote firstly by post then by text and phone votes. For the majority of the [[2007\u201308 in English football|2007\u201308]] season, the BBC did not allow any competitions due to a money-for-competitions-entry scandal, but towards the end of the season and for the goal of the season competition, normal service was resumed.<ref>{{cite news |title=BBC website: ''Goal of the Month in Match of the Day''  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/match_of_the_day/6970432.stm |accessdate=2 September 2007| date=13 September 2007 |work=BBC News}}</ref> When ''Match of the Day'' moved to ''Match of the Day 2'' when [[Colin Murray]] presented the winner was decided by the subjective opinion of one of the pundits, such as [[Alan Hansen]], [[Mark Lawrenson]] or [[Alan Shearer]]. From October 2013, BBC ''Match of the Day 2'' viewers have picked the Goal of the Month in a poll conducted by voting on the BBC Sport website or sending the hashtag of the viewers favourite goal via Twitter.<ref>{{cite web|title=BBC Goal of the Month|url=http://vote.tectonicinteractive.com/#/|website=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313110618/http://vote.tectonicinteractive.com/#/|archive-date=13 March 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe award of Goal of the Month was usually given as first-, second- and third-best goal of the month on ''Match of the Day'' up until the BBC lost the right to show Premier League highlights from 2000\u201301. When highlights returned to the BBC for 2004\u201305, the format was reduced to only the best goal of the month being announced.  Contending goals used to feature from other competitions which the BBC had the broadcasting rights for, most usually from the [[FA Cup]], this was up to 2007\u201308 when its rights were transferred to ITV.  Once the FA Cup returned to the BBC from 2014\u201315, Goal of the Month remained exclusively a Premier League affair.  The winners usually go forth to contest the [[BBC Goal of the Season|Goal of the Season]].\n\nFrom 2016\u201317, the Premier League has run its own [[Premier League Goal of the Month|Goal of the Month]] award, whose winners can conflict with the ''Match of the Day'' accolade, as had happened six times in its maiden season.\n\n==Records==\n* During the period in which a top three was announced each month, [[Dennis Bergkamp]] was the only player to have achieved the deemed first, second, and third best goals of the month in one calendar month, August 1997. Only two goals came from his hat-trick against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]\u2014not all three as is widely cited. The third was from a previous game against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Goal of the Month 1997|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NlHVNsPHKE}}</ref>\n*The record for players having more than one nomination for GOTS is three- This has happened twice, the first time in 1992-93 when [[Ryan Giggs]] (September and May), [[Dalian Atkinson]] (October and December) and [[Dwight Yorke]] (February and March) each won two Goal of The Month awards. The second was in 1995-96 with [[Tony Yeboah]] (August and September); [[Ian Wright]] (October and January) and [[Alan Shearer]] (December and April) each having two goals in contention. There have been numerous occasions where two players have been nominated twice. but as of 2018-19, no player has yet had 3 goals selected in a Premier League season.\n*[[Gareth Bale]] is the last player to have had 2 goals selected, in 2012-13 season. None of the subsequent seasons (up to 2018-19) have seen any player win GOTM more than once.\n*Consecutive GOTM wins has occurred only 3 times. The players to have achieved this are Yorke in 1992-93 (February and March); Yeboah in 1995-96 (August and September) and Bale in 2012-13 (January and February).\n*Since the advent of the Premier League in 1992-93 [[Jack Wilshere]] is the only player to have won GOTS in consecutive seasons (2013-14 and 2014-15) although [[BBC Goal of the Season|his latter win was controversial.]]\n*[[Wayne Rooney]] is the player with the most GOTS wins in the Premier League era, having won the award 3 times - 2004-05; 2006-07 and 2010-11.\n\n==Winners==\n===1992\u201393===\n{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n'''Key:''' \n{{legend2|#A9F5A9|'''Goal of the Season'''|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Month\n!Scorer\n!For\n!Against\n!Stadium\n!Competition\n!Date\n|-\n|September\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Ryan|Giggs}}|WAL}}\n|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]\n|[[White Hart Lane]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|19 September 1992\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|October\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dalian|Atkinson}}|ENG}}\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Selhurst Park]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|bgcolor=#A9F5A9|3 October 1992\n|-\n|November\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Clive|Freeman}}|ENG}}\n|[[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]]\n|[[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]\n|[[Moss Lane]]\n|[[FA Cup|FA Cup 2nd Round]]\n|25 November 1992\n|-\n|December\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dalian|Atkinson}}|ENG}}\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]\n|[[Hillsborough Stadium|Hillsborough]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|5 December 1992\n|-\n|January\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Julian|Joachim}}|ENG}}\n|[[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]\n|[[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]\n|[[Oakwell Stadium|Oakwell]]\n|[[FA Cup|FA Cup 3rd Round Replay]]\n|20 January 1993\n|-\n|February\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dwight|Yorke}}|TRI}}\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]]\n|[[Villa Park]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|6 February 1993\n|-\n|March\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Dwight|Yorke}}|TRI}}\n|[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]\n|[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]\n|[[Villa Park]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|17 March 1993\n|-\n|April\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Ian|Rush}}|WAL}}\n|[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]\n|[[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]\n|[[Anfield]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|10 April 1993\n|-\n|May\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Ryan|Giggs}}|WAL}}\n|[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]\n|[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]\n|[[Old Trafford]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|3 May 1993\n|}\n\n===1993\u201394===\n{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n'''Key:''' \n{{legend2|#A9F5A9|'''Goal of the Season'''|border=solid 1px #AAAAAA}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Month\n!Scorer\n!For\n!Against\n!Stadium\n!Competition\n!Date\n|-\n|August\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Jeremy|Goss}}|WAL}}\n|[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]\n|[[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]]\n|[[Elland Road]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|21 August 1993\n|-\n|September\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Efan|Ekoku}}|NGA}}\n|[[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]]\n|[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]\n|[[Goodison Park]]\n|[[Premier League|Premiership]]\n|25 September 1993\n|-\n|October\n|{{flagathlete|{{sortname|Matt|Le Tissier}}|ENG}}{{efn|Le Tissier was born in Guernsey, which has status of [[County Football Association]] within [[the Football Association]].

While the first of the Larut wars broke out over land and water rights, the rivalry between the two groups already existed in Ujong Salang, Selangor, Penang, Singapore and Kwangtung itself where both groups fought with each other between 1855 and 1868.<ref name=\"sea\"/>\n\nTo many people it appeared that the trouble in Larut was merely a continuation of the trouble between the Ghee Hin and Tua Pek Kong societies in Ujong Salang in 1859 which later spread to Penang. The Larut Wars were fought between Hakka and Hakka. The [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] miners were mainly Hakka men from Cheng Sheng. The first two battles (1861 and 1865) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and the Hui Chew Hakka of the Ghee Hin. The Last two (1872 and 1873) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and the Sin Neng Hakka of the Ghee Hin, the Hui Chew Hakka from the Ghee Hin from the earlier two battles having gone down to Selangor to join Yap Ah Loy, a Hui Chew Hakka who was head of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] in Selangor. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin), Ho Ghi Siu and Chin Seng Yam (\u9648\u4e9a\u708e, Chin Ah Yam \u9673\u4e9e\u708e) were Sin Neng Hakka.\n\n=== First Larut War (1861) ===\nThe First Larut War began in July 1861 when arguments over control of watercourse to their mines escalated and led members of the Hai San Society to drive the members of the Ghee Hin society out of Klian Bahru (now known as [[Kamunting]]). [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|The Governor of Straits Settlement]], Colonel [[William Orfeur Cavenagh]] intervened and the Mentri of Larut, Ngah Ibrahim, was made to compensate the Ghee Hin with $17,447 on behalf of the Sultan of Perak.<ref name=\"Comber\">Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya: A Survey of the Triad Society from 1800 to 1900 By Leon Comber Published for the Association for Asian Studies by J.J.

According to Parkinson in his book British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877 the \"[[Hai San Secret Society|Hysan]] or Tokong\" leader in Penang was \"Chan Keng Kwi\", with \"Lew Ah Sam\" as leader in Larut.<ref name=\"Modern South-East Asia p. 300\">The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The Western Impact - Economic and Social Change V. 2 By D. J. M. Tate Published by Oxford University Press, 1971 p. 300</ref>\n\nThe Hai San members took 14 Ghee Hin as prisoners, 13 of whom were killed. The 14th escaped to inform his clan and the Ghee Hin retaliated by attacking the Hai San village, razing it to the ground and killing 40 men in the process.\n\nThe battle continued back and forth and spread to Province Wellesley and the island of Penang and other secret societies joined the fray. Both sides, exhausted, finally came to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders, banished.\n\nSo Ah Chiang, leader of the Ghee Hin was captured by Ngah Ibrahim at Teluk Kertang (Port Weld) and executed.<ref name=\"Modern South-East Asia p. 300\"/>\n\nBy around 1870 there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other. It is this proximity that might explain how the next battle began.\n\n=== Third Larut War (1872) ===\nAccording to Charles John Irving, then Auditor-General of the Straits Settlements, and later Acting Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, there were about 20,000 to 25,000 Chinese in Larut around February 1872, 2,000 to 3,000 of whom were Cantonese or \"Macao Men\" as he referred to them, and the remainder being Khay (Hakka) men from Cheng Sheng and Sin Neng.<ref>Memo dated 24 July 1872, Charles John Irving.</ref><ref>Statement of Ong Ah Yu to Captain Speedy, 18 October 1872.</ref>\n\nIn February 1872 Cheng Sheng miners had a dispute with Sin Neng miners over the boundaries of some mining lands. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin) represented the Sin Neng and attempted to negotiate but was murdered on 16 February on the pretext of an adulterous affair.\n\nIt has been believed that The Third Larut War erupted in 1872 over a scandal involving the Lee Ah Kun (\u674e\u4e9e\u52e4 / \u674e\u4e9a\u52e4), the attorney at Larut (for the Ghee Hin leader Ho Ghi Sui) and the wife of a nephew of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] leader, Chung, Keng Quee. It is said that upon discovery, the allegedly adulterous couple was caught, tortured, put into a pig basket ({{zh|s=\u732a\u7b3c|t=\u8c6c\u7c60}}) and thrown into a disused mining pond where they drowned.<ref name=\"sea\"/><ref>A History of Perak By Richard Olof Winstedt, [[Richard James Wilkinson]], William Edward Maxwell, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch Published by Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1974.

For the first time, the Hai Sans were driven out of Larut. About 10,000 Hai San men sought sanctuary in Penang. It took months before the Hai Sans, supported by Ngah Ibrahim recovered their Matang and Larut mines.\n\nOthers hold that the alleged \"intrigue\" never happened and was merely a [[political fiction]] to justify the murder of Ah Kun (aka Lee Coyn) in a manner that would permit Tokong to save face for the death sentence passed down on their leader Khoo Thean Tek for his part in the Penang Riots of 1869 where Ah Kun apparently got off Scot free.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&lpg=PA276&dq=%22chang%20Keng%22&lr=&num=100&as_brr=3&pg=PA276#v=onepage&q=%22chang%20Keng%22&f=false - ''Triad And Tabut - Triad societies: western accounts of the history, sociology and linguistics of Chinese secret societies''] by Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne, Kingsley Bolton, Christopher Hutton, James K.

Chinese coming overseas did not bring their wives with them and it is highly improbable that \"the near relative of Ah Kwi\" whose name is not given but who will have been a Hakka and a Tokong, would have had any woman in his household but a Cantonese (Triad) prostitute, whose death meant nothing to the Tokongs and was merely an added sacrifice incidental to the death of Li Ah Kun upon the altar of Tokong vengeance.\" - Triad and tabut: a survey of the origin and diffusion of Chinese and Mohamedan secret societies in the Malay Peninsula, A.D. 1800-1935, Parts 1800-1935 by Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne, Government Printing Office, 1941, Pg 276</ref>\n\nAt this time, Raja Abdullah a claimant to the royal throne of Perak and an enemy of Ngah Ibrahim, took sides against the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai Sans]] and Ngah Ibrahim.<ref name=\"sea\"/>\n\nOn 26 September 1872, Chung Keng Quee signed a petition together with 44 other Chinese leaders, seeking British interference following the attack of 12,000 men of Chung Shan by 2,000 men of Sen Ning. (See [[s:The Petition of Chung Keng Quee & 44 Others|The Petition of Chung Keng Quee & 44 Others]] and [[s:The humble petition of Ah Yeu, Ung Keng Sin, Soh Ah Pang, Su Ah Fooed, and others|The humble petition of Ah Yeu, Ung Keng Sin, Soh Ah Pang, Su Ah Fooed, and others]])\n\n=== Fourth Larut War (1873) ===\nThe Fourth Larut War occurred in 1873, merely a year after the previous battle. Weeks after the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai Sans]] regained Larut, the Ghee Hin, supported by [[Sultan Abdullah of Perak|Raja Abdullah]], counter-attacked with arms and men from [[Singapore]] and [[China]]. Ngah Ibrahim's properties in Matang were destroyed. Local Malay residents were also killed and their property, destroyed. Trouble spread to Krian, Pangkor and Dindings.\n\nThe quarrelling Malay chiefs who had taken sides in the Larut Wars were now alarmed at the disorder created by the Chinese miners and secret societies.  The Straits Settlement Penang Chinese seeing their investments destroyed in the Larut Wars sought intervention form British. Over 40,000 Chinese from the Go-Kuan and Si-Kuan were engaged in the fratricidal war involving the Perak royal family.\n\nIn August 1873, [[Edward Anson|Archibald Edward Harbord Anson]], the last Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, sought to bring about a ceasefire between the two parties and convened a meeting at the beginning of the month attended, apart from Anson, by Chung Keng Quee ([[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]), Ho Ghi Sui (Ghee Hin), [[Foo Tye Sin]] (pro-[[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]), Ngah Ibrahim (pro-Hai San), Abdullah (pro-Ghee Hin), Tengku Kudin (pro-Abdullah) and a British Naval Captain.<ref name=\"Comber\"/>\n\nThe two sides agreed to keep the peace pending British arbitration with Ngah Ibrahim taking responsibility for the Hai San and Abdullah taking responsibility for the Ghee Hin. Abdullah failed so completely in his task in ensuring the Ghee Hin kept the peace that the British were prompted to back Ngah Ibrahim and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]].\n\nOn 3 September 1873 outgoing Straits Settlements Governor Sir [[Harry Ord]] recognised Ngah Ibrahim, through a proclamation, as the independent (i.e. independent of Perak rule) ruler of Larut.  On 5 September he temporarily lifted an arms embargo (imposed since February) just long enough for the Hai San in Larut to receive munitions.  In the middle of that month a British vessel got into an entanglement with some Ghee Hin junks and this led to British bombardment and capture of Ghee hin stockades at Matang and Kuala Selinsing.\n\nNgah Ibrahim's Penang residence was blown up on 16 September 1873. A week later two things happened - a similar attempt was made on Chung Keng Quee's house and Abdullah and his Ghee Hin cohorts were arrested at sea and brought back to Penang where they were eventually released but forbidden to return to Perak.<ref>Governor's Despatch 271, 19 September 1873 (C.111, p. 46)</ref>\n\n=== Abdullah's mission to Singapore ===\nMeantime the Perak sultanate, involved in a protracted succession struggle was unable to maintain order. Things were increasingly getting out of hand and chaos was proving bad for the Malays, Chinese and British. In her book \"The Golden Chersonese and The Way Thither\" (Published 1892 G.P. Putnam's Sons) Victorian traveller and adventuress [[Isabella Bird|Isabella Lucy Bird]] (1831\u20131904) describes how Raja Muda Abdullah as he then was turned to the head of the Ghee Hin in Singapore, [[Tan Kim Ching]].\n\nAbdullah met with Tan in Singapore in October 1873. He was accompanied by Raja Dris, the Shahbandar and a Penang lawyer. Tan offered to put Abdullah on the throne in return for five elevenths (5/11) of all duties collected between Telok Serah and Krian for a period of ten years.\n\n[[Tan Kim Ching]] introduced Abdullah to [[William Henry Macleod Read]] (W. H. M. Read) and Read in turn introduced Abdullah to Sir Henry Ord on the eve of Ord's retirement as Governor of the Straits Settlements. A letter was drafted by Tan and Read on Abdullah's behalf to new incoming Governor Sir Andrew Clarke seeking British recognition of Abdullah as ruler of Perak, British protection and the provision of \"a man of sufficient abilities to live with us in Perak. .. and show us a good system of government for our dominions. ..\"\n\nThe letter dated 30 December 1873 did not reach Clarke's hands till 9 January 1874 by which time he had already taken the first steps towards bringing Perak under British control.\n\n=== Sir Andrew Clarke takes charge ===\nClarke's main objective was to mediate peace between the two Chinese factions and settle their differences so that tin production could resume and threats to the internal security of British-held Penang would cease. [[C. Northcote Parkinson|Parkinson]] tells us in British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877 that [[Andrew Clarke (British Army officer, born 1824)|Sir Andrew Clarke]] decided to summon the Chinese factions to a conference following a meeting on or about 9 January 1874 between Chung Keng Quee and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] headmen and [[W.A. Pickering|Pickering]] (together with [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair|McNair]] and [[Samuel Dunlop|Dunlop]]) who had been sent to meet them at the mouth of the Larut River to persuade them to accept arbitration.<ref name=\"sea\"/><ref>The Making of Modern South-East Asia: economic and social change By D.

A Biography by R. N. Jackson.</ref>\n\nSir Andrew Clarke, just weeks after his arrival in Singapore, had already found evidence of the continuing disturbances in Perak and Selangor. Apart from his executive council, he talked to [[Tan Kim Ching]]. Clarke decided that both the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Hin should have access to Larut with neither side being excluded, a complete reversal of the policy of his predecessor, Sir Henry Ord. Tan Kim Ching agreed and wrote to the Ghee Hin at Penang to put this to them and advocate peace.<ref name=\"Malaya pp. 80, 124\"/>\n\nClarke then sent Pickering to Penang to talk to the respective headmen in Penang. Pickering gave Tan Kim Ching's letter to Chin Ah Yam (\u9673\u4e9e\u708e / \u9648\u4e9a\u708e). Twenty Ghee Hin headmen met through the night at the Ghee Hin Kongsi house considering [[Tan Kim Ching]]'s letter. In the morning they met with Pickering and agreed to surrender their forces in seven days time.<ref name=\"Malaya pp. 80, 124\"/> It was also at this time that Clarke saw an opportunity to settle the question of succession to the throne in Perak and to make use of that as a means to further British interests in the Malay Peninsula by getting the sultan to accept a British Resident.\n\nFollowing the surrender of the Ghee Hin to Pickering and the outcome of a meeting with Chung Keng Quee whom Pickering also met, Sir Andrew Clarke then gathered the main Chinese leaders (principally Chung Keng Quee and Chin Ah Yam and some Malays \u2013 including Abdullah \u2013 at Pulau Pangkor where the 'Pangkor Engagement' was formulated and signed, recognising Abdullah as Sultan, and getting the Chinese to agree to settle their differences in Larut under British arbitration.<ref name=\"sea\"/><ref name=\"MSB\"/><ref name=\"Malaya pp. 80, 124\"/><ref>The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The Western Impact - Economic and Social Change V. 2 By D. J. M. Tate Published by Oxford University Press, 1971 p. 279, 300</ref>\n\n== Pangkor Engagement ==\nThe need to restore law and order in Perak gave cause for a new British policy concerning intervention in the affairs of the Malay States which resulted in the [[Treaty of Pangkor]].\n\nOn 20 January 1874, the [[Straits Settlements]] governor Sir Andrew Clarke convened a meeting aboard the H. M. S. Pluto anchored off Pangkor island. Documents were signed aboard the ship The Pluto at Pangkor Island to settle the Chinese dispute, clear the Sultan succession dispute and pave the way for the acceptance of British [[Resident (title)|Residency]] - [[Tristam Speedy|Captain Speedy]] was appointed to administer Larut as assistant to the British Resident. Abdullah was recognised as Sultan by the British and was to be installed on the throne of Perak in preference to his rival, Sultan Ismail.\n\nIn actuality there were two distinctive agreements made. The primary agreement was intended to ensure an end to the fighting between Ghee Hin and [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and pave the way for peaceful coexistence in future. The second, to settle the issue of succession in Perak.<ref>Chronology of World History: A Calendar of Principal Events from 3000 BC to AD 1973 By Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville Published by Rowman & Littlefield, 1975; p. 537</ref><ref name=\"The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica p. 855\">The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: ready reference and index (10 v.)

The second (more recently drafted) agreement concerned the succession dispute around the Perak throne and was unsatisfactory from the very beginning.\"\n\n=== Chinese Engagement ===\nChung, Keng Quee was one of the two main signatories to the treaty known as the [[Pangkor Engagement]] ([[s:Pangkor Engagement|copy of treaty]]) entered into aboard the H.M.S. Pluto at [[Pangkor Island]] by twenty-six headmen of the Chinese Secret Societies. Chung, Keng Quee and Chin, Ah Yam, leaders of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Hin, respectively, were ennobled by the British with the title of Kapitan China (leader of the Chinese community) and the town of Larut was renamed [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] (\"\u592a\u5e73\" in Chinese, meaning \"everlasting peace\") as a confirmation of the new state of truce.<ref name=\"The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica p. 855\"/><ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica p. 113\"/><ref name=\"The Protected Malay States p. 181\"/><ref name=\"Malaya, A.D pp. 157, 301\"/><ref name=\"The Branch p. 21\"/><ref name=\"Parliamentary Paper C pp. 83-84\"/>\n\n=== Malay Engagement ===\nThere were three possibilities for the Perak throne and of these only one was present at the meeting - Abdullah. Sultan Ismail who was the crowned ruler, had refused to attend. The British did not appear to know of the existence of the third possible claimant, Raja Yusof, who was naturally not invited.\n\nThe agreement that was signed recognised Abdullah as Sultan giving Ismail the status of Sultan Muda, and provided for a British officer called Resident whose advice must be asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching on Malay Religion and Custom. Ngah Ibrahim's position in Larut as granted by Sultan Ja'afar and confirmed by Sultan Ali was recognised.\n\nHowever, as far as the chiefs of Perak (who were not present) were concerned (with this agreement made between the British and Abdullah or the British's recognition of Abdullah as Sultan) - the issue of succession was settled three years earlier with the election of Sultan Ismail. To these Chiefs the British may have proclaimed Abdullah Sultan but his accession was not valid in their eyes and indeed in Malay eyes if he did not hold the (royal) regalia which was at that time in the hands of Sultan Ismail, all attempts at recovering these from him having failed.\n\n== Pacification Commission ==\nThree days afterwards, Chung, Keng Quee was appointed a member of [[Commission for the Pacification of Larut]] also comprising [[Samuel Dunlop|Captain S. Dunlop]], [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]], [[Frank Swettenham]], [[William A. Pickering|W. A. Pickering]] and Chin Seng Yam, whose terms of reference, among others, was to arrange for an amicable settlement relating to the Larut tin mines.

He also acknowledged that long after that time when Chung, Keng Quee visited China he was accused of piracy by his rivals in the tin mining business and while he was initially arrested and brought before the mandarins in Canton he was triumphantly acquitted of the charge.\n\nSir Hugh goes on to state categorically that \"Captain Ah Kwi\" who was at that time a long-standing member of the State Council, had never ever been \"arrested on criminal charges where British influence prevailed\", and had in fact from the very beginning \"been a strenuous supporter of the settlement of the State of Perak\".\n\nThe insertion ended with an apology from the author, [[Frederick Boyle]], to the editor of Harper's Magazine.\n\nThe relationship between Sir Hugh Low and Chung Keng Quee goes all the way back to Sir Hugh's arrival in Perak. At that time Chung Keng Quee was getting frustrated with the management of the revenue farm that had been given over to him and it was Sir Hugh Low who, as he recalls in his journal \"laughed him out of the nonsense about giving up the farm\".<ref>Hugh Low Journal Entry 15 May 1877</ref>\n\nThe two of them had many long and frank discussions about the mining business in general as well as revenue farming and the system of \"advancers\". On 15 May 1877 in a casual meeting between the two, Chung Keng Quee advocated the granting of land leases for the mines for periods of 21 years arguing that this would make it easier for miners to raise money. On 11 September the same year, Sir Hugh Low made this so.<ref>PCM, 11 September 1877</ref><ref>The Malay States, 1877-1895: Political Change and Social Policy By Philip Fook Seng Loh Published by Oxford University Press, 1969; p. 111, 214, 215</ref>\n\nFor Sir Hugh Low, Chung Keng Quee represented a stabilising factor in mining communities that had yet to settle down following the Larut Wars. His was the voice of reason, admonishing the towkays who had stirred up a riot in 1879 and it was a voice that Sir Hugh trusted and backed up.\n\n==Business interests==\nChung Keng Quee was involved in many different businesses but he was first and foremost a tin man. Not only did he help his sons start out in the business, he was apt to support others as well.

In Penang, Chung, Keng Quee and his friends and relatives made up one of three similar syndicate groups that dominated the [[Opium]] Farms there.\n\nChung Keng Quee apart from being a man of vision was also a great risk-taker. Sir Hugh Low in his own notes describing negotiations over the leasing out of the Perak revenue farms compares Chung Keng Quee and Khoo Thian Teik. Chung Keng Quee had told him that he needed five thousand more coolies to make the venture successful while Khoo Thian Teik had talked of two or three hundred more.<ref>A History of the Peninsular Malays with Chapters on Perak & Selangor</ref> Not only did he get his coolies from China, Ah Quee also employed coolies from India.<ref>Ah Quee (the \" Capitan Cheena,\" before adverted to, p. 7), being desirous of\nextending his mining operations, resolved upon employing Klings (natives of ..., vide Tin Mining in Larut By Patrick Doyle Published by Spon, 1879; p. 7, 29, 30</ref>\n\nHis exceptional management of the revenue farms entrusted to him helped bring fresh capital into Perak and helped him to become, by 1886, the largest financier in Larut.\n\nWhile he obviously was making a lot of money from revenue farming, in 1897 Sir Hugh Low, then the Resident, negotiated with Chung, Keng Quee, who was at that time owner of the largest mine in the country and probably the most influential financier of tin mines in the country, to abolish the supply of opium in return for greater protection of tin mine employers from their absconding coolies and for longer working hours.\n\nFrom 1880 to 1897, in partnership with the Tan, Yeoh, Lim, Cheah, and Khoo families, Chung Keng Quee invested over $2.8 million to dominate all the revenue farms from upper to lower Perak.<ref name=\"Yeetuan\"/><ref>Penang Gazette and Straits Chronicle, 31 October 1879, p. 4; 10 October 1891, p. 5; 30 October 1894, p. 3.</ref>\n\n=== Tobacco farming ===\nHe had many tobacco farms in several areas in Perak, including Larut, Kuala Kangsar, Kerian and Selama.<ref>66 Usahawan Malaysia by Mohamad Ashadi bin Mohd Zaini, published by PTS Professional, {{ISBN|978-983-3376-62-9}}, Page 162</ref> Together with Chen Eok he held the Tobacco farms in Larut and Larut Coast between 1883 and 1885.<ref>Triad societies: western accounts of the history, sociology and linguistics ...

Apart from the monopolies for tobacco, liquor, opium and gambling revenue farming in Perak that these two jointly obtained from Sir [[Hugh Low]], British Resident at Perak in 1889, they were both heads of their respective secret societies which were allied against their common foe, the Ghee Hin.

Chung, Keng Quee and Khoo, Thean Teik together represented the allied Haisan-Khianteik group of Perak Hakkas and Penang Hockiens.\n\nBoth Chung and Khoo were in the business of procuring, supplying or employing coolies. Khoo, Thean Teik aided by Koh, Seang Thye on one occasion supplied $60,000 in goods, money and ammunition to Chung, Keng Quee and Tan, Yit Hoon for their mining activities and for their military activities against the Ghee Hin in return for seven-tenths of the percentage of the tin they produced.<ref name=\"Yeetuan\">[http://csds.anu.edu.au/volume_1_2007/Wong.pdf The Big Five Hokkien Families in Penang, 1830s\u20131890s \u00a92007 Yeetuan Wong Chinese Southern Diaspora Studies, Volume 1, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719013321/http://csds.anu.edu.au/volume_1_2007/Wong.pdf |date=19 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>Khoo Kay Kim, The Western Malay States 1850\u20131873: the Effects of Commercial Development on Malay Politics, p. 209</ref><ref>Wong Choon San, A Gallery of Chinese Kapitans (Singapore: Ministry of Culture, 963), pp. 77, 78, 104</ref><ref>Cases heard and determined in her Majesty's Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements, Somerset: Legal Library (Publishing) Services, vol.4 (1885/1890), pp. 136-40.</ref>\n\n== Chung Keng Quee and Foo Choo Choon ==\nFoo Choo Choon originally worked for Chung Keng Kwee in his Lahat mining concession.<ref>The Richest Chinaman in the World by IpohWorld, Ipoh Echo, HKT</ref> He went on to marry a niece of Chung Keng Quee.\n\n== The ''Sri Sarawak'' ==\nChung Keng Quee had a screw steamer, the ''Sri Sarawak'', that plied a route between the Larut river and Penang.

The Educational Institution organised campaigns to encourage the [[Chinese people|Chinese]] in Penang to respect education. The motto of the campaigns was \"Jing Xi Zi Zhi\" or to respect the words written on the paper.

Opened for the recreation and general use of the engineers who formed a large part of the European community (30%). Originally the institute occupied rooms in Beach Street but later moved to a beautiful double storey building presented by the Capitan Chung Kheng Kwi at the junction of Leith Street and Farquhar Street. On 5 March 1888, an institute was opened for the recreation and general convenience of [[Europe]]an mechanical engineers. For some time membership was confined exclusively to engineers and mechanics but was so popular that before long the regulations were altered so as to include deck officers, and certain longshoremen. The growth and development of the institute proceeded so rapidly that larger buildings were soon required, and, by arrangement with Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee, a new two storey headquarters building was erected at the junction of Leith and Farquhar streets. Upon the staircase was a beautiful stained-glass window presented by Chung, Keng Quee, and bearing the inscription, \"Erected by Captain Cheng Kheng Kwi, Perak and Pinang, 1901\". Near at hand was a portrait of the donor.<ref>[http://www.penang.gov.my/index.php?ch=16&pg=99&ac=15&lang=eng&format= Engineer's Institute, Penang State Government Official Portal, Last updated: 22/02/2005]</ref>\n\n=== Property donations ===\nWhen the Lim Ancestral Temple building on Beach Street was completed in 1866, the Kew Leong Tong (Hall of Nine Dragons) Lim Kongsi, one of the three Lim Clan Associations in [[Penang]], moved its office there. The address was 234 Beach Street. Later, Ah Quee Street was established when Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee donated his Beach Street shophouse to be demolished to create the street that bears his name. Ah Quee Street runs beside 164 Beach Street which also happens to be the longest shophouse in Penang. (Source: Timothy Tye)\n\n=== Recognition and reward by the Qing Imperial Government, China ===\nFor his many acts of greatness the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] Imperial government in 1894 conferred on him the title of \"Mandarin, Second Rank\" retrospectively for three generations. This meant that Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee, his father, Chung, Hsing Fah, and his grandfather, Chung, Tung Lin, the last two posthumously, simultaneously became Mandarins of the Second Rank. In line with his elevation he then adopted the fancy name of \"Sheng Chih\".\n\n== Townhouse and temple on Church Street ==\n[[File:Pinang Peranakan Mansion.JPG|thumb|[[Pinang Peranakan Mansion]], or Hye Kee Chan]]\n\nIn Georgetown, Penang Chung, Keng Quee became known as the city's great connoisseur of architecture.\n\nIn 1893, Chung, Keng Quee acquired two adjacent properties along Church Street on Penang Island. The first was the former headquarters of the Ghee Hin - the Hai San had ousted them in the 1870s. The second was a Chinese school, the Goh Hock Tong (or Ng Fook Tong in Cantonese) meaning Five Luck Villa. He offered the school an alternative site in Chulia Street, where a new building was completed in 1898.\n\nChung, Keng Quee converted the former Ghee Hin headquarters into his townhouse and office and named this, [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion|Hye Kee Chan]] (\u6d77\u8bb0\u6808), or Sea Remembrance Store. It has interior fittings including Victorian cast iron columns from [http://glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=macfarlane_w-co Walter Macfarlane & Co of Glasgow (also known as The Saracen Foundry]).\n\nMacfarlane was also responsible for the beautiful iron gates and fencing of the former Five Luck Villa building which was converted into a personal temple (Shen-chih hsueh-shu where Shen-chih was his fancy name and hsueh-shu means a traditional-style private family school).\n\nIn the temple stands a life-size bronze statue of Chung Keng Quee. The statue was commissioned by the Engineers' Institute that he had generously donated a new building to. It was created by [[Benjamin Creswick]] and a facsimile of it was shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1903.<ref>'The Late Chung Keng Quee (listed as The Late Cheng Keng Lei)', Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951, University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011 [http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/object.php?id=msib4_1203077132, accessed 6 September 2012]</ref> On the base of the statue will be found the signature of Benjamin Creswick, and an imprint, [[Broad and Sons]], the bronze founders in Birmingham who cast the statue.<ref>Email from Annie Creswick Dawson</ref>\n\nToday, Hye Kee Chan is more commonly known as the [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion]].

While the first of the Larut wars broke out over land and water rights, the rivalry between the two groups already existed in Ujong Salang, Selangor, Penang, Singapore and Kwangtung itself where both groups fought with each other between 1855 and 1868.<ref name=\"sea\"/>\n\nTo many people it appeared that the trouble in Larut was merely a continuation of the trouble between the Ghee Hin and Tua Pek Kong societies in Ujong Salang in 1859 which later spread to Penang. The Larut Wars were fought between Hakka and Hakka. The [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] miners were mainly Hakka men from Cheng Sheng. The first two battles (1861 and 1865) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and the Hui Chew Hakka of the Ghee Hin. The Last two (1872 and 1873) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and the Sin Neng Hakka of the Ghee Hin, the Hui Chew Hakka from the Ghee Hin from the earlier two battles having gone down to Selangor to join Yap Ah Loy, a Hui Chew Hakka who was head of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] in Selangor. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin), Ho Ghi Siu and Chin Seng Yam (\u9648\u4e9a\u708e, Chin Ah Yam \u9673\u4e9e\u708e) were Sin Neng Hakka.\n\n=== First Larut War (1861) ===\nThe First Larut War began in July 1861 when arguments over control of watercourse to their mines escalated and led members of the Hai San Society to drive the members of the Ghee Hin society out of Klian Bahru (now known as [[Kamunting]]). [[List of British Governors of the Straits Settlements|The Governor of Straits Settlement]], Colonel [[William Orfeur Cavenagh]] intervened and the Mentri of Larut, Ngah Ibrahim, was made to compensate the Ghee Hin with $17,447 on behalf of the Sultan of Perak.<ref name=\"Comber\">Chinese Secret Societies in Malaya: A Survey of the Triad Society from 1800 to 1900 By Leon Comber Published for the Association for Asian Studies by J.J.

According to Parkinson in his book British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877 the \"[[Hai San Secret Society|Hysan]] or Tokong\" leader in Penang was \"Chan Keng Kwi\", with \"Lew Ah Sam\" as leader in Larut.<ref name=\"Modern South-East Asia p. 300\">The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The Western Impact - Economic and Social Change V. 2 By D.

The 14th escaped to inform his clan and the Ghee Hin retaliated by attacking the Hai San village, razing it to the ground and killing 40 men in the process.\n\nThe battle continued back and forth and spread to Province Wellesley and the island of Penang and other secret societies joined the fray. Both sides, exhausted, finally came to terms. An official inquiry took place and both the Hai San and Ghee Hin societies were fined $5,000 each for violating the peace of Penang and their leaders, banished.\n\nSo Ah Chiang, leader of the Ghee Hin was captured by Ngah Ibrahim at Teluk Kertang (Port Weld) and executed.<ref name=\"Modern South-East Asia p. 300\"/>\n\nBy around 1870 there were a combined total of about 40,000 Hakka and Cantonese mine workers in the Larut district and the mining areas between the two groups were near to each other. It is this proximity that might explain how the next battle began.\n\n=== Third Larut War (1872) ===\nAccording to Charles John Irving, then Auditor-General of the Straits Settlements, and later Acting Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, there were about 20,000 to 25,000 Chinese in Larut around February 1872, 2,000 to 3,000 of whom were Cantonese or \"Macao Men\" as he referred to them, and the remainder being Khay (Hakka) men from Cheng Sheng and Sin Neng.<ref>Memo dated 24 July 1872, Charles John Irving.</ref><ref>Statement of Ong Ah Yu to Captain Speedy, 18 October 1872.</ref>\n\nIn February 1872 Cheng Sheng miners had a dispute with Sin Neng miners over the boundaries of some mining lands. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin) represented the Sin Neng and attempted to negotiate but was murdered on 16 February on the pretext of an adulterous affair.\n\nIt has been believed that The Third Larut War erupted in 1872 over a scandal involving the Lee Ah Kun (\u674e\u4e9e\u52e4 / \u674e\u4e9a\u52e4), the attorney at Larut (for the Ghee Hin leader Ho Ghi Sui) and the wife of a nephew of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] leader, Chung, Keng Quee. It is said that upon discovery, the allegedly adulterous couple was caught, tortured, put into a pig basket ({{zh|s=\u732a\u7b3c|t=\u8c6c\u7c60}}) and thrown into a disused mining pond where they drowned.<ref name=\"sea\"/><ref>A History of Perak By Richard Olof Winstedt, [[Richard James Wilkinson]], William Edward Maxwell, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland Malaysian Branch Published by Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1974.

For the first time, the Hai Sans were driven out of Larut. About 10,000 Hai San men sought sanctuary in Penang. It took months before the Hai Sans, supported by Ngah Ibrahim recovered their Matang and Larut mines.\n\nOthers hold that the alleged \"intrigue\" never happened and was merely a [[political fiction]] to justify the murder of Ah Kun (aka Lee Coyn) in a manner that would permit Tokong to save face for the death sentence passed down on their leader Khoo Thean Tek for his part in the Penang Riots of 1869 where Ah Kun apparently got off Scot free.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6irEoGgDrm4C&lpg=PA276&dq=%22chang%20Keng%22&lr=&num=100&as_brr=3&pg=PA276#v=onepage&q=%22chang%20Keng%22&f=false - ''Triad And Tabut - Triad societies: western accounts of the history, sociology and linguistics of Chinese secret societies''] by Mervyn Llewelyn Wynne, Kingsley Bolton, Christopher Hutton, James K.

(See [[s:The Petition of Chung Keng Quee & 44 Others|The Petition of Chung Keng Quee & 44 Others]] and [[s:The humble petition of Ah Yeu, Ung Keng Sin, Soh Ah Pang, Su Ah Fooed, and others|The humble petition of Ah Yeu, Ung Keng Sin, Soh Ah Pang, Su Ah Fooed, and others]])\n\n=== Fourth Larut War (1873) ===\nThe Fourth Larut War occurred in 1873, merely a year after the previous battle. Weeks after the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai Sans]] regained Larut, the Ghee Hin, supported by [[Sultan Abdullah of Perak|Raja Abdullah]], counter-attacked with arms and men from [[Singapore]] and [[China]]. Ngah Ibrahim's properties in Matang were destroyed. Local Malay residents were also killed and their property, destroyed. Trouble spread to Krian, Pangkor and Dindings.\n\nThe quarrelling Malay chiefs who had taken sides in the Larut Wars were now alarmed at the disorder created by the Chinese miners and secret societies.  The Straits Settlement Penang Chinese seeing their investments destroyed in the Larut Wars sought intervention form British. Over 40,000 Chinese from the Go-Kuan and Si-Kuan were engaged in the fratricidal war involving the Perak royal family.\n\nIn August 1873, [[Edward Anson|Archibald Edward Harbord Anson]], the last Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, sought to bring about a ceasefire between the two parties and convened a meeting at the beginning of the month attended, apart from Anson, by Chung Keng Quee ([[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]), Ho Ghi Sui (Ghee Hin), [[Foo Tye Sin]] (pro-[[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]]), Ngah Ibrahim (pro-Hai San), Abdullah (pro-Ghee Hin), Tengku Kudin (pro-Abdullah) and a British Naval Captain.<ref name=\"Comber\"/>\n\nThe two sides agreed to keep the peace pending British arbitration with Ngah Ibrahim taking responsibility for the Hai San and Abdullah taking responsibility for the Ghee Hin. Abdullah failed so completely in his task in ensuring the Ghee Hin kept the peace that the British were prompted to back Ngah Ibrahim and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]].\n\nOn 3 September 1873 outgoing Straits Settlements Governor Sir [[Harry Ord]] recognised Ngah Ibrahim, through a proclamation, as the independent (i.e. independent of Perak rule) ruler of Larut.  On 5 September he temporarily lifted an arms embargo (imposed since February) just long enough for the Hai San in Larut to receive munitions.  In the middle of that month a British vessel got into an entanglement with some Ghee Hin junks and this led to British bombardment and capture of Ghee hin stockades at Matang and Kuala Selinsing.\n\nNgah Ibrahim's Penang residence was blown up on 16 September 1873. A week later two things happened - a similar attempt was made on Chung Keng Quee's house and Abdullah and his Ghee Hin cohorts were arrested at sea and brought back to Penang where they were eventually released but forbidden to return to Perak.<ref>Governor's Despatch 271, 19 September 1873 (C.111, p. 46)</ref>\n\n=== Abdullah's mission to Singapore ===\nMeantime the Perak sultanate, involved in a protracted succession struggle was unable to maintain order. Things were increasingly getting out of hand and chaos was proving bad for the Malays, Chinese and British. In her book \"The Golden Chersonese and The Way Thither\" (Published 1892 G.P. Putnam's Sons) Victorian traveller and adventuress [[Isabella Bird|Isabella Lucy Bird]] (1831\u20131904) describes how Raja Muda Abdullah as he then was turned to the head of the Ghee Hin in Singapore, [[Tan Kim Ching]].\n\nAbdullah met with Tan in Singapore in October 1873. He was accompanied by Raja Dris, the Shahbandar and a Penang lawyer. Tan offered to put Abdullah on the throne in return for five elevenths (5/11) of all duties collected between Telok Serah and Krian for a period of ten years.\n\n[[Tan Kim Ching]] introduced Abdullah to [[William Henry Macleod Read]] (W. H. M. Read) and Read in turn introduced Abdullah to Sir Henry Ord on the eve of Ord's retirement as Governor of the Straits Settlements. A letter was drafted by Tan and Read on Abdullah's behalf to new incoming Governor Sir Andrew Clarke seeking British recognition of Abdullah as ruler of Perak, British protection and the provision of \"a man of sufficient abilities to live with us in Perak. .. and show us a good system of government for our dominions. ..\"\n\nThe letter dated 30 December 1873 did not reach Clarke's hands till 9 January 1874 by which time he had already taken the first steps towards bringing Perak under British control.\n\n=== Sir Andrew Clarke takes charge ===\nClarke's main objective was to mediate peace between the two Chinese factions and settle their differences so that tin production could resume and threats to the internal security of British-held Penang would cease. [[C. Northcote Parkinson|Parkinson]] tells us in British Intervention in Malaya 1867-1877 that [[Andrew Clarke (administrator)|Sir Andrew Clarke]] decided to summon the Chinese factions to a conference following a meeting on or about 9 January 1874 between Chung Keng Quee and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] headmen and [[W.A. Pickering|Pickering]] (together with [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair|McNair]] and [[Samuel Dunlop|Dunlop]]) who had been sent to meet them at the mouth of the Larut River to persuade them to accept arbitration.<ref name=\"sea\"/><ref>The Making of Modern South-East Asia: economic and social change By D.

A Biography by R. N. Jackson.</ref>\n\nSir Andrew Clarke, just weeks after his arrival in Singapore, had already found evidence of the continuing disturbances in Perak and Selangor. Apart from his executive council, he talked to [[Tan Kim Ching]]. Clarke decided that both the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Hin should have access to Larut with neither side being excluded, a complete reversal of the policy of his predecessor, Sir Henry Ord. Tan Kim Ching agreed and wrote to the Ghee Hin at Penang to put this to them and advocate peace.<ref name=\"Malaya pp. 80, 124\"/>\n\nClarke then sent Pickering to Penang to talk to the respective headmen in Penang. Pickering gave Tan Kim Ching's letter to Chin Ah Yam (\u9673\u4e9e\u708e / \u9648\u4e9a\u708e). Twenty Ghee Hin headmen met through the night at the Ghee Hin Kongsi house considering [[Tan Kim Ching]]'s letter. In the morning they met with Pickering and agreed to surrender their forces in seven days time.<ref name=\"Malaya pp. 80, 124\"/> It was also at this time that Clarke saw an opportunity to settle the question of succession to the throne in Perak and to make use of that as a means to further British interests in the Malay Peninsula by getting the sultan to accept a British Resident.\n\nFollowing the surrender of the Ghee Hin to Pickering and the outcome of a meeting with Chung Keng Quee whom Pickering also met, Sir Andrew Clarke then gathered the main Chinese leaders (principally Chung Keng Quee and Chin Ah Yam and some Malays \u2013 including Abdullah \u2013 at Pulau Pangkor where the 'Pangkor Engagement' was formulated and signed, recognising Abdullah as Sultan, and getting the Chinese to agree to settle their differences in Larut under British arbitration.<ref name=\"sea\"/><ref name=\"MSB\"/><ref name=\"Malaya pp. 80, 124\"/><ref>The Making of Modern South-East Asia: The Western Impact - Economic and Social Change V. 2 By D.

M. S. Pluto anchored off Pangkor island. Documents were signed aboard the ship The Pluto at Pangkor Island to settle the Chinese dispute, clear the Sultan succession dispute and pave the way for the acceptance of British [[Resident (title)|Residency]] - [[Tristam Speedy|Captain Speedy]] was appointed to administer Larut as assistant to the British Resident. Abdullah was recognised as Sultan by the British and was to be installed on the throne of Perak in preference to his rival, Sultan Ismail.\n\nIn actuality there were two distinctive agreements made. The primary agreement was intended to ensure an end to the fighting between Ghee Hin and [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and pave the way for peaceful coexistence in future. The second, to settle the issue of succession in Perak.<ref>Chronology of World History: A Calendar of Principal Events from 3000 BC to AD 1973 By Greville Stewart Parker Freeman-Grenville Published by Rowman & Littlefield, 1975; p. 537</ref><ref name=\"The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica p. 855\">The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: ready reference and index (10 v.)

Pluto at [[Pangkor Island]] by twenty-six headmen of the Chinese Secret Societies. Chung, Keng Quee and Chin, Ah Yam, leaders of the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] and Ghee Hin, respectively, were ennobled by the British with the title of Kapitan China (leader of the Chinese community) and the town of Larut was renamed [[Taiping, Perak|Taiping]] (\"\u592a\u5e73\" in Chinese, meaning \"everlasting peace\") as a confirmation of the new state of truce.<ref name=\"The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica p. 855\"/><ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica p. 113\"/><ref name=\"The Protected Malay States p. 181\"/><ref name=\"Malaya, A.D pp. 157, 301\"/><ref name=\"The Branch p. 21\"/><ref name=\"Parliamentary Paper C pp. 83-84\"/>\n\n=== Malay Engagement ===\nThere were three possibilities for the Perak throne and of these only one was present at the meeting - Abdullah. Sultan Ismail who was the crowned ruler, had refused to attend. The British did not appear to know of the existence of the third possible claimant, Raja Yusof, who was naturally not invited.\n\nThe agreement that was signed recognised Abdullah as Sultan giving Ismail the status of Sultan Muda, and provided for a British officer called Resident whose advice must be asked and acted upon on all questions other than those touching on Malay Religion and Custom. Ngah Ibrahim's position in Larut as granted by Sultan Ja'afar and confirmed by Sultan Ali was recognised.\n\nHowever, as far as the chiefs of Perak (who were not present) were concerned (with this agreement made between the British and Abdullah or the British's recognition of Abdullah as Sultan) - the issue of succession was settled three years earlier with the election of Sultan Ismail. To these Chiefs the British may have proclaimed Abdullah Sultan but his accession was not valid in their eyes and indeed in Malay eyes if he did not hold the (royal) regalia which was at that time in the hands of Sultan Ismail, all attempts at recovering these from him having failed.\n\n== Pacification Commission ==\nThree days afterwards, Chung, Keng Quee was appointed a member of [[Commission for the Pacification of Larut]] also comprising [[Samuel Dunlop|Captain S. Dunlop]], [[John Frederick Adolphus McNair]], [[Frank Swettenham]], [[William A. Pickering|W. A. Pickering]] and Chin Seng Yam, whose terms of reference, among others, was to arrange for an amicable settlement relating to the Larut tin mines.

He also acknowledged that long after that time when Chung, Keng Quee visited China he was accused of piracy by his rivals in the tin mining business and while he was initially arrested and brought before the mandarins in Canton he was triumphantly acquitted of the charge.\n\nSir Hugh goes on to state categorically that \"Captain Ah Kwi\" who was at that time a long-standing member of the State Council, had never ever been \"arrested on criminal charges where British influence prevailed\", and had in fact from the very beginning \"been a strenuous supporter of the settlement of the State of Perak\".\n\nThe insertion ended with an apology from the author, [[Frederick Boyle]], to the editor of Harper's Magazine.\n\nThe relationship between Sir Hugh Low and Chung Keng Quee goes all the way back to Sir Hugh's arrival in Perak. At that time Chung Keng Quee was getting frustrated with the management of the revenue farm that had been given over to him and it was Sir Hugh Low who, as he recalls in his journal \"laughed him out of the nonsense about giving up the farm\".<ref>Hugh Low Journal Entry 15 May 1877</ref>\n\nThe two of them had many long and frank discussions about the mining business in general as well as revenue farming and the system of \"advancers\". On 15 May 1877 in a casual meeting between the two, Chung Keng Quee advocated the granting of land leases for the mines for periods of 21 years arguing that this would make it easier for miners to raise money. On 11 September the same year, Sir Hugh Low made this so.<ref>PCM, 11 September 1877</ref><ref>The Malay States, 1877-1895: Political Change and Social Policy By Philip Fook Seng Loh Published by Oxford University Press, 1969; p. 111, 214, 215</ref>\n\nFor Sir Hugh Low, Chung Keng Quee represented a stabilising factor in mining communities that had yet to settle down following the Larut Wars. His was the voice of reason, admonishing the towkays who had stirred up a riot in 1879 and it was a voice that Sir Hugh trusted and backed up.\n\n==Business interests==\nChung Keng Quee was involved in many different businesses but he was first and foremost a tin man. Not only did he help his sons start out in the business, he was apt to support others as well.

Opened for the recreation and general use of the engineers who formed a large part of the European community (30%). Originally the institute occupied rooms in Beach Street but later moved to a beautiful double storey building presented by the Capitan Chung Kheng Kwi at the junction of Leith Street and Farquhar Street. On 5 March 1888, an institute was opened for the recreation and general convenience of [[Europe]]an mechanical engineers. For some time membership was confined exclusively to engineers and mechanics but was so popular that before long the regulations were altered so as to include deck officers, and certain longshoremen. The growth and development of the institute proceeded so rapidly that larger buildings were soon required, and, by arrangement with Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee, a new two storey headquarters building was erected at the junction of Leith and Farquhar streets. Upon the staircase was a beautiful stained-glass window presented by Chung, Keng Quee, and bearing the inscription, \"Erected by Captain Cheng Kheng Kwi, Perak and Pinang, 1901\". Near at hand was a portrait of the donor.<ref>[http://www.penang.gov.my/index.php?ch=16&pg=99&ac=15&lang=eng&format= Engineer's Institute, Penang State Government Official Portal, Last updated: 22/02/2005]</ref>\n\n=== Property donations ===\nWhen the Lim Ancestral Temple building on Beach Street was completed in 1866, the Kew Leong Tong (Hall of Nine Dragons) Lim Kongsi, one of the three Lim Clan Associations in [[Penang]], moved its office there. The address was 234 Beach Street. Later, Ah Quee Street was established when Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee donated his Beach Street shophouse to be demolished to create the street that bears his name. Ah Quee Street runs beside 164 Beach Street which also happens to be the longest shophouse in Penang. (Source: Timothy Tye)\n\n=== Recognition and reward by the Qing Imperial Government, China ===\nFor his many acts of greatness the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Qing dynasty]] Imperial government in 1894 conferred on him the title of \"Mandarin, Second Rank\" retrospectively for three generations. This meant that Kapitan Chung, Keng Quee, his father, Chung, Hsing Fah, and his grandfather, Chung, Tung Lin, the last two posthumously, simultaneously became Mandarins of the Second Rank. In line with his elevation he then adopted the fancy name of \"Sheng Chih\".\n\n== Townhouse and temple on Church Street ==\n[[File:Pinang Peranakan Mansion.JPG|thumb|[[Pinang Peranakan Mansion]], or Hye Kee Chan]]\n\nIn Georgetown, Penang Chung, Keng Quee became known as the city's great connoisseur of architecture.\n\nIn 1893, Chung, Keng Quee acquired two adjacent properties along Church Street on Penang Island. The first was the former headquarters of the Ghee Hin - the Hai San had ousted them in the 1870s. The second was a Chinese school, the Goh Hock Tong (or Ng Fook Tong in Cantonese) meaning Five Luck Villa. He offered the school an alternative site in Chulia Street, where a new building was completed in 1898.\n\nChung, Keng Quee converted the former Ghee Hin headquarters into his townhouse and office and named this, [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion|Hye Kee Chan]] (\u6d77\u8bb0\u6808), or Sea Remembrance Store. It has interior fittings including Victorian cast iron columns from [http://glasgowsculpture.com/pg_biography.php?sub=macfarlane_w-co Walter Macfarlane & Co of Glasgow (also known as The Saracen Foundry]).\n\nMacfarlane was also responsible for the beautiful iron gates and fencing of the former Five Luck Villa building which was converted into a personal temple (Shen-chih hsueh-shu where Shen-chih was his fancy name and hsueh-shu means a traditional-style private family school).\n\nIn the temple stands a life-size bronze statue of Chung Keng Quee. The statue was commissioned by the Engineers' Institute that he had generously donated a new building to. It was created by [[Benjamin Creswick]] and a facsimile of it was shown at the Royal Academy of Arts in 1903.<ref>'The Late Chung Keng Quee (listed as The Late Cheng Keng Lei)', Mapping the Practice and Profession of Sculpture in Britain and Ireland 1851-1951, University of Glasgow History of Art and HATII, online database 2011 [http://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/object.php?id=msib4_1203077132, accessed 6 September 2012]</ref> On the base of the statue will be found the signature of Benjamin Creswick, and an imprint, [[Broad and Sons]], the bronze founders in Birmingham who cast the statue.<ref>Email from Annie Creswick Dawson</ref>\n\nToday, Hye Kee Chan is more commonly known as the [[Pinang Peranakan Mansion]].
