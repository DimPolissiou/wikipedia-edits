It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The capital and largest city is [[Sofia]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]]. With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2}}, Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|16th-largest country]].\n\nOne of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[ancient Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire]] lost some of these territories to an invading [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries.\n\nThe [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|one-party socialist state]] and part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[multi-party]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy.\n\nSince adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the [[sovereign state]] has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million resides mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the [[Provinces of Bulgaria|27 provinces]]. The population has declined since the late 1980s.\n\nBulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the [[UN Security Council]] three times. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture.

It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The capital and largest city is [[Sofia]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]]. With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2}}, Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|16th-largest country]].\n\nOne of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[ancient Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. The [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire]] lost some of these territories to an invading [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries.\n\nThe [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|one-party socialist state]] and part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[multi-party]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy.\n\nSince adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the [[sovereign state]] has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million resides mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the [[Provinces of Bulgaria|27 provinces]]. The population has declined since the late 1980s.\n\nBulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the [[UN Security Council]] three times. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture. Bulgaria is a [[developing country]] and ranks 52nd in the [[Human Development Index]], the lowest development rank in the EU alongside [[Romania]]. [[Corruption in Bulgaria|Widespread corruption]] is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/files/content/pages/2018_CPI_Executive_Summary.pdf |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 Executive Summary p. 12 |publisher=[[Transparency International]]|website=transparency.org |access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bulgaria'' is derived from the ''[[Bulgars]]'', a tribe of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin that founded the country.

While starting out as a typical jock character, Steve has grown into a more paternal and caring character as the show has progressed, a development that has received widespread acclaim from critics and fans alike and has led to Steve becoming one of the show\u2019s most beloved and enduring characters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/stranger-things-3-steve-harrington-actor-joe-keery-interview|title= An Ode to Steve Harrington, the soft hero Stranger Things fans deserve|date=2019-07-04|website=Vanity Fair|language=en|access-date=2019-07-19}}</ref> Initially a part of the recurring cast, Joe Keery was promoted to the main cast in the second season. Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist of [[Stranger Things (season 1)|season 1]], and one of the main protagonists of [[Stranger Things (season 2)|season 2]] and [[Stranger Things (season 3)|season 3]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Season 1===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 1)}}\nSteve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s jock character, antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating [[Nancy Wheeler]] but after he harasses [[List of Stranger Things characters#Jonathan Byers|Jonathan Byers]] by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways. Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}\nSteve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also finds himself at odds with [[List of Stranger Things characters#Billy Hargrove|Billy Hargrove]], a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with [[Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)|Mike Wheeler]] and his friends after [[Dustin Henderson|Dustin]] asks him to help find his \"pet\" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demogorgon. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve takes Mike, Lucas, and Billy's stepsister [[List of Stranger Things characters#Max Mayfield|Max]] under his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, giving time for [[Eleven (Stranger Things)|Eleven]] and [[Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)|Jim Hopper]] to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nNow graduated from high school, Steve works at the Scoops Ahoy! ice cream parlor at Starcourt Mall with Robin Buckley ([[Maya Hawke]]), a former classmate who teases him frequently. Dustin, having returned from science camp and set up a [[ham radio]] tower to talk with his new girlfriend Suzie in Utah, gets Steve's help to translate a Russian radio message he overheard. Robin helps with the translation, indicating a site at the mall, and Lucas' sister Erica (Priah Ferguson) is recruited to sneak into the site in exchange for free ice cream. Steve, Robin, Dustin, and Erica find a secret Russian base under the mall that is attempting to open a portal to the Upside Down. Though Steve and Robin are captured and drugged, Dustin and Erica help save them and return to the surface to warn the others. Whilst coming down off the drugs, Steve admits he is attracted to Robin and learns that Robin is a lesbian, yet accepts her sexuality. In the following battle with the Mind Flayer, Steve helps to stop the possessed Billy from ramming the car that the others are using to escort Eleven away, and joins the rest in distracting the Mind Flayer with fireworks as the gate in the Russian base is shut down. With the mall's destruction from the battle, Steve and Robin lose their jobs at Scoops Ahoy! and get work at the local [[Family Video]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe character appears in ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' as a DLC character along with [[Nancy Wheeler]] as a fellow survivor being hunted by the Demogorgon throughout the Hawkins Lab.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter |title= ''Stranger Things'' is coming to ''Dead by Daylight'' in a new update |date=2019-08-19 |website=Polygon |language=en |access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Steve Harrington in the [[Stranger Things 2|second season of the show]] has been met with acclaim and has led to Steve becoming a fan-favorite character and critical darling on the show, and Joe Keery received critical acclaim for his performance. The transition from stereotypical bully and lothario to a caring and protective character was lauded by critics and audiences.

Steve is a side antagonist turned protagonist of [[Stranger Things (season 1)|season 1]], and one of the main protagonists of [[Stranger Things (season 2)|season 2]] and [[Stranger Things (season 3)|season 3]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Season 1===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 1)}}\nSteve is initially portrayed as a stereotypical 1980s jock character, antagonistic and unlikable. Steve had been dating [[Nancy Wheeler]] but after he harasses [[List of Stranger Things characters#Jonathan Byers|Jonathan Byers]] by breaking his camera, Nancy seems to become close to Jonathan. Steve accosts Jonathan, but Jonathan beats him in a fight and Steve sees the error of his ways. Traveling to the Byers' home to apologize, he becomes involved in Nancy and Jonathan's fight against the Demogorgon, which they defeat. At the conclusion of the season, Nancy buys Jonathan a new camera and Steve continues his relationship with Nancy.\n\n===Season 2===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 2)}}\nSteve's relationship with Nancy is stressed, and he breaks up with her after she will not say she loves him. He calls her out after her drunken tirade at a party where she calls their relationship fake. Steve also finds himself at odds with [[List of Stranger Things characters#Billy Hargrove|Billy Hargrove]], a new student at the school who seeks to become its tough guy. Steve becomes involved with [[Mike Wheeler (Stranger Things)|Mike Wheeler]] and his friends after [[Dustin Henderson|Dustin]] asks him to help find his \"pet\" D'Artagnan, unaware it is a Demogorgon. Steve and Dustin bond over how to talk to girls, and soon Steve takes Mike, Lucas, and Billy's stepsister [[List of Stranger Things characters#Max Mayfield|Max]] under his wing. Steve protects the children as Demodogs start ravaging across Hawkins, giving time for [[Eleven (Stranger Things)|Eleven]] and [[Jim Hopper (Stranger Things)|Jim Hopper]] to close the gate to the Upside Down, and for Will Byers to have the Mind Flayer exorcised from his body.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{See also|Stranger Things (season 3)}}\nNow graduated from high school, Steve works at the Scoops Ahoy! ice cream parlor at Starcourt Mall with Robin Buckley ([[Maya Hawke]]), a former classmate who teases him frequently. Dustin, having returned from science camp and set up a [[ham radio]] tower to talk with his new girlfriend Suzie in Utah, gets Steve's help to translate a Russian radio message he overheard. Robin helps with the translation, indicating a site at the mall, and Lucas' sister Erica (Priah Ferguson) is recruited to sneak into the site in exchange for free ice cream. Steve, Robin, Dustin, and Erica find a secret Russian base under the mall that is attempting to open a portal to the Upside Down. Though Steve and Robin are captured and drugged, Dustin and Erica help save them and return to the surface to warn the others. Whilst coming down off the drugs, Steve admits he is attracted to Robin and learns that Robin is a lesbian, yet accepts her sexuality. In the following battle with the Mind Flayer, Steve helps to stop the possessed Billy from ramming the car that the others are using to escort Eleven away, and joins the rest in distracting the Mind Flayer with fireworks as the gate in the Russian base is shut down. With the mall's destruction from the battle, Steve and Robin lose their jobs at Scoops Ahoy! and get work at the local [[Family Video]].\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe character appears in ''[[Dead by Daylight]]'' as a DLC character along with [[Nancy Wheeler]] as a fellow survivor being hunted by the Demogorgon throughout the Hawkins Lab.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/19/20812070/stranger-things-dead-by-daylight-nancy-wheeler-steve-harrington-demogorgon-chapter |title= ''Stranger Things'' is coming to ''Dead by Daylight'' in a new update |date=2019-08-19 |website=Polygon |language=en |access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character development of Steve Harrington in the [[Stranger Things 2|second season of the show]] has been met with acclaim and has led to Steve becoming a fan-favorite character and critical darling on the show, and Joe Keery received critical acclaim for his performance.

Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in October 2017. While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.
