At the age of 13 he joined the British Spiritual Church and began his apprenticeship there.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/selbsternanntes-medium-botschaften-aus-dem-jenseits-1.3046246 Botschaften aus dem Jenseits] [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]: translation from the source: \"At the age of 13 he joined the British Spiritual Church.

With this he had some success and decided to work mainly as a medium. Originally he wanted to go back to London when he had an appearance on [[RTL (German TV channel)|RTL]] Mysteries with J\u00f6rg Draeger. With this performance he suddenly became known to an audience of millions and received laundry baskets of mail.<ref>[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/selbsternanntes-medium-botschaften-aus-dem-jenseits-1.3046246 Botschaften aus dem Jenseits] [[S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung]]: translation from the source: \"That he would stay in Germany was not planned.

The postman brought laundry baskets full of letters afterwards. Then Meek decided to stay in Bavaria.\"</ref>\n\nTherefore. Meek decided to stay in Munich. Numerous other television appearances followed. Since then, Meek has been performing in events where he (allegedly) establishes contact between people in the audience and their deceased to convey messages. Originally, Meek offered single sessions, but soon stopped as he couldn't meet the demand  . He wrote books, produced DVDs and CDs which became bestsellers, and gives seminars for further education.

With this he had some success and decided to work mainly as a medium.

The postman brought laundry baskets full of letters afterwards. Then Meek decided to stay in Bavaria.\"</ref>\n\nTherefore. Meek decided to stay in Munich. Numerous other television appearances followed. Since then, Meek has been performing in events where he (allegedly) establishes contact between people in the audience and their deceased to convey messages. Originally, Meek offered single sessions, but soon stopped as he couldn't meet the demand  . He wrote books, produced DVDs and CDs which became bestsellers, and gives seminars for further education.
