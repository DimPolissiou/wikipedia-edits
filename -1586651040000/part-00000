The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

In his first appearance at Augusta in 1981, he led during the second nine but ended up finishing fourth. In 1986, after birdieing holes 14 through 17 to tie Nicklaus for the lead, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 into the patrons surrounding the green and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.  In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff when [[Larry Mize]] holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)  Crenshaw first won at Augusta in 1984.\n\nIn 1997, 21 year-old [[Tiger Woods]] became the youngest champion in Masters history, winning by 12 shots with an 18-under par 270 which broke the 72-hole record that had stood for 32 years.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> In 2001 Woods completed his \"Tiger Slam\" by winning his fourth straight major championship at the Masters by two shots over [[David Duval]]. <ref name=past-results/> He won again the following year, making him only the third player in history (after Nicklaus and Faldo) to win the tournament in consecutive years,<ref name=past-results/> as well as in 2005 when he defeated [[Chris DiMarco]] in a playoff for his first major championship win in almost three years.<ref name=past-results/>\n\nThe club was targeted by [[Martha Burk]], who organized a failed protest at the 2003 Masters to pressure the club into accepting female members.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]] when [[Billy Casper]] defeated [[Gene Littler]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

After the arrangement continued into 2004, the tournament reinstated sponsorships for 2005, with the new partners of ExxonMobil, IBM, and SBC.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/28/sports/sp-masters28 |title=Masters Is Back to Commercials |last=Stewart |first=Larry |date=2004-08-28 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2018-04-08 |issn=0458-3035 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/2003/04/08/8104128/the-battle-of-augusta-hootie-vs-martha-a-chronology-of-developments-in-golfs-most-famous-feud-between-martha-burk-the-chairwoman-of-the-national-council-of-womens-organizations-ncwo-and-hootie-johnson-the-chairman-of-augusta-na |title=The Battle of Augusta Hootie vs. Martha: A Chronology of Developments in Golf's Most Famous Feud, Between Martha Burk, the Chairwoman of the National Council Of Women's Organizations (NCWO), and Hootie Johnson, the Chairman of Augusta National Golf Club  |last=Yen |first=Yi-Wyn |magazine=Sports Illustrated |date=April 8, 2003 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe club also sells separate sponsorship packages, which do not provide rights to air commercials on the U.S. telecasts, to two \"international partners\"; in 2014, those companies were [[Rolex]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] (the latter of which replaced Mercedes-Benz upon that company's elevation to \"global sponsor\" status).<ref name=\"2014 sponsors\"/>\n\n===Radio coverage===\nWestwoodOne (previously [[Dial Global]] and [[CBS Radio Network|CBS Radio]]) has provided live radio play-by-play coverage in the United States since 1956.

After making his final putt to win, he broke down sobbing at the hole and was consoled and embraced by his caddie.  In the post-tournament interview, Crenshaw said: \"I had a 15th club in my bag,\" a reference to Penick. (The \"15th club\" reference is based on the golf rule that limits a player to carrying 14 clubs during a round.)

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder [[Clifford Roberts]] is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

{"title_page": "Mental health in education", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=March 2019}}\n\n'''Mental health''' refers to the emotional wellbeing of a person. It is often viewed as an adult issue, but in fact, almost half of [[adolescents in the United States]] are affected by mental disorders, and about 20% of these are categorized as \u201csevere.\u201d<ref name=\"Any Disorder Among Children\">{{cite web|title=Any Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref> Mental health issues can pose a huge problem for students in terms of academic and social success in school.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" /> [[Education]] systems around the world treat this topic differently, both directly through official policies and indirectly through cultural views on mental health and [[well being]]. These curriculums are in place to effectively identify mental health disorders and treat it using [[therapy]], medication, or other tools of alleviation.\n\n== Prevalence of Mental Health Issues In Adolescents ==\n\nAccording to the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], approximately 46% of American adolescents aged 13\u201318 will suffer from some form of [[mental disorder]]. About 21% will suffer from a disorder that is categorized as \u201csevere,\u201d meaning that the disorder impairs their daily functioning,<ref name=\"Any Disorder Among Children\"/> but almost two-thirds of these adolescents will not receive formal mental health support.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\">{{cite web|title=Youth Mental Health and Academic Achievement|url=https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/.../mental-health-and-academic-achievement-2-24-12.pdf|publisher=National Center for Mental Health Checkups at Columbia University|accessdate=24 November 2017}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The most common types of disorders among adolescents as reported by the NIMH is [[anxiety disorders]] (including [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[phobias]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]], and others), with a lifetime prevalence of about 25% in youth aged 13\u201318 and 6% of those cases being categorized as severe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Any Anxiety Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-anxiety-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref> Next is [[mood disorders]] ([[major depressive disorder]], [[dysthymic disorder]], and/or [[bipolar disorder]]), with a lifetime prevalence of 14% and 4.7% for severe cases in adolescents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Any Mood Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-mood-disorder-in-children.shtmll|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health|accessdate=November 24, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> An effect of this high prevalence is high suicide rates among adolescents. [[Suicide]] in the United States is the second leading cause of death for adolescents aged 10 to 24. More teenagers and young adults die from suicide than cancer, heart disease, AIDS, birth defects, stroke, pneumonia, influenza, and chronic lung disease combined. There are an average of over 3,470 attempts by students in grades 9\u201312.<ref>{{cite web|title=Youth Suicide Statistics|url=http://prp.jasonfoundation.com/facts/youth-suicide-statistics/|publisher=Jason Foundation |accessdate=November 18, 2017}}</ref> Some of these suicides are because of, or in part due to the stress they are under during school. A similarly common disorder is [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), which is categorized as a childhood disorder but oftentimes carries through into adolescence and adulthood. The prevalence for ADHD in American adolescents is 9%, and 1.8% for severe cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Among Children|url=https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-among-children.shtml|publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=November 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[American_Psychological_Association|APA]], the percentage of students going for college mental health counselling has been rising in recent years, which by report for anxiety as the most common factor, depression as the second, stress as the third, family issues as the forth, and academic performance and relationship problems as the fifth and sixth most.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Winerman |first1=Lea |title=By the Numbers: Stress on Campus |url=https://www.apa.org/monitor/2017/09/numbers |website=Monitor on Psychology |publisher=American Psychological Association |accessdate=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Effects On Academics and School Life ==\nMental disorders can lead to many academic problems, such as poor attendance, difficulties with academic, poor social integration, trouble adjusting to school, problems with behavior regulation, and attention and concentration issues. High school students who screen positive for psychosocial dysfunction report three times as many absent and tardy days as students who do not identify dysfunction, and students with high levels of psychosocial stress are much more likely to view themselves as academically incompetent. This leads to much higher dropout rates and lower overall academic achievement,<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" /> as well as specific academic and social problems associated with various disorders.\n\n=== Anxiety ===\nStudents with anxiety disorders are statistically less likely to attend college than those without, and those with [[social phobias]] are twice as likely to fail a grade or not finish high school as students who have never had the condition.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" /> Anxiety manifests in many of the same ways as [[ADHD]], and so students with anxiety disorders often experience problems concentrating, filtering out distracting external stimuli, and completing multi-step or complicated tasks.

Some researches estimate that for every successful suicide in adolescence, there are between 50 and 100 unsuccessful attempts. Most suicides reported in [[Ohio]] from 1963 to 1965 revealed that they tended to be social outcasts (played no sports, had no hobbies, and were not part of any clubs). They also suggested that half of these students were failing or near-failing at the time of their deaths. These periods of failure and frustration lower the individual's self-concept to a point where they have little sense of self-worth.<ref name=\"Reese 1968\">{{cite journal |last1=Reese |first1=Frederick D. |title=School Age Suicide and the Educational Environment |journal=Theory into Practice |date=February 1968 |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages=10\u201313 |jstor=1475581 |doi=10.1080/00405846809542105}}</ref> In fact, students who perceive their academic performance as \"failing\" are three times more likely to attempt suicide than those who perceive their performance to be acceptable.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" />\n\n=== Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ===\nAttention disorders are the principal predictors of diminished academic achievement.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" /> Students with ADHD tend to have trouble mastering behaviors and practices demanded of them by the public education system in the United States, such as the ability to sit still and quietly or to apply themselves to one focused task for extended durations.

School systems within the United States, either on the state or city/county level, seem to typically make decisions on what mental health policies should be included.\nThere has been a growing popularity with [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/6/1839 school based mental health services] in United States public school systems, in which schools have their students covered for mental health care. This concept has potential to allow students to have access to services that can help them understand and work through any stressors they may face within their schooling, as well as a better chance of intervention for those students who need it.\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the Mental Health Strategy highlights the importance of mental health promotion, stigma reduction, and early recognition of mental health problems in schools to be a priority (Mental Health Commission, 2012). Implementing comprehensive school health and post-secondary mental health initiatives that promote mental health and prevention for those at risk was recommended by the Mental Health Commission of Canada. A major focus of school programming is to promote positive mental health to all students instead of just doing so to those already identified as having a mental health problem. This is a preventative measure as it seeks to promote well-being and emotional regulation in all students to avoid mental health problems from further occurring or escalating.\n\n=== Bhutan ===\nIn [[Education in Bhutan|Bhutan]], efforts toward developing education began in 1961 thanks to [[Ugyen Wangchuck]] and the introduction of the [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|First Development Plan]], which provided free primary education. By 1998, 400 schools were established. Students' tuition, books, supplies, equipment, and food were all free for boarding schools in the 1980s, and some schools also provided their students with clothing. The assistance of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]s' [[World Food Programme]] allowed free midday meals in some primary schools. This governmental assistance is important to note in the country's [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH), which is at the forefront of developmental policies and is the responsibility of the government.. Article 9 of the Constitution of Bhutan states that \"the state shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness.\"<ref name=\"Tobgay 2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Tobgay|first1=Tashi|last2=Dophu|first2=Ugen|last3=Torres|first3=Cristina|last4=Na-Bangchang|first4=Kesara|title=Health and Gross National Happiness: review of current status in Bhutan|journal=Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare|date=2011|pmc=3155859|pmid=21847351|doi=10.2147/JMDH.S21095|volume=4|pages=293\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==== Gross National Happiness ====\nGNH in Bhutan is based on four principles: sustainable and equitable economic development, conservation of the environment, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance. Their constitution prescribes that the state will provide free access to public health services through a three-tiered health system which provides preventative, promotive, and curative services. Because of this policy, Bhutan was able to eliminate iodine deficiency disorder in 2003, leprosy in 1997, and achieved childhood immunization for all children in 1991. It became the first country to ban tobacco in 2004, and cases of malaria decreased from 12,591 cases in 1999 to 972 cases in 2009.<ref name=\"Tobgay 2011\" /> The elimination of these diseases and the strong push for GNH allows for all people (including adolescents who are provided with many necessary items and free education) to live happier lives than they otherwise may have had.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Educationin]] [[Education in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] is working on developing a whole organizational approach to support mental health and character education. A [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/634731/Practice_example-Whole_organisational_approach.pdf joint report] published in October 2017 from the Departments for Education and Health outline this approach with regards to staff training, raising awareness of mental health challenges that children face, and involvement of parents and families in students' mental health.\n\n=== Singapore ===\n[https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=1635 REACH] is a program in [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]] that looks to provide interventions for students struggling with mental illness. A quote from the REACH website reads, \"The majority of children and adolescents do not suffer from mental illness. However, when a student has been identified, the school counselor, with consultation from the school\u2019s case management team, will look into managing the care of the student. When necessary, guidance specialists and educational psychologists from the Ministry of Education will render additional support.\n\nIn 2010, the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), in collaboration with National Council of Social Service (NCSS), have also been invited to join this network to provide community and clinical support to at-risk children.\nStudents/children with severe emotional and behavioural problems may need more help. The REACH team collaborates with school counsellors/VWOs to provide suitable school-based interventions to help these students. Such school/VWO based interventions often provide the requisite, timely help that these students/children need.\nFurther specialised assessment or treatment may be necessary for more severe cases. The student/child may be referred to the Child Guidance Clinic after assessment by the REACH team for further psychiatric evaluation and intervention. These interventions may include medications, psychotherapy, group or family work and further assessments.\"\n\n=== Mexico ===\nTraditionally, mental health was not considered a part of public health in [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]] because of other health priorities, lack of knowledge about the true magnitude of mental health problems, and a complex approach involving the intervention of other sectors in addition to the public health sector. Among the key documents anticipating the policy change was a report presented by the Mexican Health Foundation in 1995, which opened a very constructive debate. It introduced basic tenets for health improvement, elements for an analysis of the health situation related to the burden of disease approach, and a strategic proposal with concurrent recommendations for reforming the system. Mexico has an extensive legal frame of reference dealing with health and mental health. The objectives are to promote a healthy psychosocial development of different population groups, and reduce the effects of behavioural and psychiatric disorders. This should be achieved through graded and complementary interventions, according to the\nlevel of care, and with the coordinated participation of the public, social, and private sectors in municipal, state, and national settings. The strategic lines consider training and qualification of human resources, growth, rehabilitation, and regionalization of\nmental health service networks, formulation of guidelines and evaluation. All age groups as well as specific sub-populations (indigenous groups, women, street children, populations in disaster areas), and other state and regional priorities are considered.\n\n=== Japan and China ===\nIn [[Education in Japan|Japan]] and [[Education in China|China]], the approach to mental health is focused on the collective of students, much like the national aims of these Asian countries. Much like in the US, there is much research done in the realm of student mental health, but not many national policies in place to prevent and aid mental health problems students face. Japanese students face considerable academic pressure as imposed by society and school systems. In 2006, Japanese police gathered notes left from students who had committed suicide that year and noted overarching school pressures as the primary source of their problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/why-do-so-many-japanese-schoolchildren-kill-themselves-391648 |title=Why Do So Many Japanese Schoolchildren Kill Themselves? |publisher=Newsweek |date=2015-08-11}}</ref> Additionally, the dynamic of collective thinking\u2014the centripetal force of Japan's society, wherein individual identity is sacrificed for the functioning benefit of a greater collective\u2014results in the stigmatization of uniqueness. As child psychiatrist Dr. Ken Takaoka explained to CNN, schools prioritize this collectivism, and \u201cchildren who do not get along in a group will suffer.\u201d\n\n=== South Korea ===\n\nSouth Korea has traditionally placed much value on education. As a nation that has a  degree of enthusiasm like no other for education has created an environment where children are pressured to study more than ever. When mental health issues affect students there are very few resources available to help students cope. The nation's general view of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression or thoughts of suicide, is that they are believed to be a sign of personal weakness that could bring shame upon a family if a member would be discovered to have such an illness. This is true if the problem arises in a social, educational or family setting. Rather than perceiving mental health issues as a medical condition and concern requiring treatment especially in students, a majority of Korea\u2019s population has perceived them as a cultural stigma. A study conducted by Yuri Yang <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Yuri|last2=Chiriboga|first2=David A.|last3=Okazaki|first3=Sumie|date=2009-01-01|title=Attitudes toward mental health services: Age-group differences in Korean American adults|journal=Aging & Mental Health|volume=13|issue=1|pages=127\u2013134|doi=10.1080/13607860802591070|issn=1360-7863|pmc=2737391|pmid=19197698}}</ref>, a professor at the University of Florida and a member of the Department of Aging and Mental Health, found when surveying over 600 Korean citizens from the age of 20-60+ years in 2008, most of the older people, many of whom are parents, shared similar and negative views on mental health issues such as depression. The older adults generally were also found to have a negative view of mental health services, including those offered through the educational system, as they are deeply influenced by the cultural stigma around the topic. This negative view of mental health services in education has provided implications for students who are struggling emotionally, as many do not know what, if any, help might be available in the facilities of education. However, this does not mean no mental health services exist in the world or in the educational setting. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 collected data <ref> https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/korea_who_aims_report.pdf?ua=1 </ref> regarding Korea\u2019s mental health system. The goal of collecting this information was to attempt to improve the mental health system and to provide a baseline for monitoring the change. Despite Korea having a low budget for mental health services compared to other developed countries, it has taken steps to create long term mental health plans to advance its national health system such as raising more awareness for mental health, creating communities for students, and removing the cultural stigma around mental health. \n== Alleviation and Fostering Adjustment ==\n=== Prevention ===\nSome schools may need recognize that they are not just an institution, but are intended to help shape the lives of students and allow them to participate meaningfully in a social aspect of this environment. Psychologically, this can overshadow the academic aspect, yet often little heed is given. Athletics, faculty-student relationships, clubs, and other social activities are important so that no student is left in a \"social limbo year after year.\" The pressures of school, extracurricular activities, work and relationships with friends and family can be a lot for an individual to manage and at times can be overwhelming. In order to prevent these overwhelming feelings from turning into a mental health problem, taking measures to prevent these emotions from escalating is essential. School-based programs that help students with emotional-regulation, stress management, conflict resolution, and active coping and cognitive restructuring are a few suggested ways that give students resources that can promote their mental health (Mental Health Commission, 2012).  Educators need to pay as much attention to the well-being of their students as they do on the academic aspect to ensure they are setting their students up for success in the future.\n\n=== Belonging ===\nBelonging in the school environment may be the most important and relevant factors affecting students' performance in an academic setting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} School-related stress and an increase in academic expectations may increase school-related stress and in turn negatively affect their academic performance.

Some researches estimate that for every successful suicide in adolescence, there are between 50 and 100 unsuccessful attempts. Most suicides reported in [[Ohio]] from 1963 to 1965 revealed that they tended to be social outcasts (played no sports, had no hobbies, and were not part of any clubs). They also suggested that half of these students were failing or near-failing at the time of their deaths. These periods of failure and frustration lower the individual's self-concept to a point where they have little sense of self-worth.<ref name=\"Reese 1968\">{{cite journal |last1=Reese |first1=Frederick D. |title=School Age Suicide and the Educational Environment |journal=Theory into Practice |date=February 1968 |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages=10\u201313 |jstor=1475581 |doi=10.1080/00405846809542105}}</ref> In fact, students who perceive their academic performance as \"failing\" are three times more likely to attempt suicide than those who perceive their performance to be acceptable.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" />\n\n=== Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) ===\nAttention disorders are the principal predictors of diminished academic achievement.<ref name=\"Teen Screen PDF\" /> Students with ADHD tend to have trouble mastering behaviors and practices demanded of them by the public education system in the United States, such as the ability to sit still and quietly or to apply themselves to one focused task for extended durations. Much like anxiety, ADHD can mean that students have problems concentration, filtering out distracting external stimuli, and seeing large tasks through to completion. These students can also struggle with time management and organization.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThere has been a rising concern about the increased misuses of ADHD medicines in recent years, especially among college students. The most frequent misused ADHD medicines is [[Adderall]], but many other [[stimulant]] medications such as [[Ritalin]] and [[Methylin]] have also been found as in most cases these drugs are getting from friends. Based on the drugs' function which can serve as a [[cognitive enhancer]], common reasons of misuses by college students include better academic performance, creating [[euphoria]], being awake and arousal, peer pressure, and also as which happened more in female for weight loss. Side effects such as mood changes and [[insomnia]] are shown differently by people but in severe cases, the misuse could even be associated with sudden death.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nikroo |first1=C |last2=Park |first2=S |last3=Nishi |first3=R |last4=Chang |first4=A |last5=Mohanakrishnan |first5=M |last6=Prabhu |first6=A |last7=Afghani |first7=B |title=87 Stimulant Misuse among College Students in the United States (U.s.): a Literature Review |journal=Journal of Investigative Medicine |date=2018 |volume=66 |issue=1 |page=A101 |doi=10.1136/jim-2017-000663.87 |doi-broken-date=2020-01-22 }}</ref>\n\n=== Middle School Malaise ===\nMiddle school malaise happens on children during the transition from elementary school to middle school when they encountering a lot of significant biological, psychological and environmental changes.

School systems within the United States, either on the state or city/county level, seem to typically make decisions on what mental health policies should be included.\nThere has been a growing popularity with [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/113/6/1839 school based mental health services] in United States public school systems, in which schools have their students covered for mental health care. This concept has potential to allow students to have access to services that can help them understand and work through any stressors they may face within their schooling, as well as a better chance of intervention for those students who need it.\n\n=== Canada ===\nIn Canada, the Mental Health Strategy highlights the importance of mental health promotion, stigma reduction, and early recognition of mental health problems in schools to be a priority (Mental Health Commission, 2012). Implementing comprehensive school health and post-secondary mental health initiatives that promote mental health and prevention for those at risk was recommended by the Mental Health Commission of Canada. A major focus of school programming is to promote positive mental health to all students instead of just doing so to those already identified as having a mental health problem. This is a preventative measure as it seeks to promote well-being and emotional regulation in all students to avoid mental health problems from further occurring or escalating.\n\n=== Bhutan ===\nIn [[Education in Bhutan|Bhutan]], efforts toward developing education began in 1961 thanks to [[Ugyen Wangchuck]] and the introduction of the [[Five-Year Plans of Bhutan|First Development Plan]], which provided free primary education. By 1998, 400 schools were established. Students' tuition, books, supplies, equipment, and food were all free for boarding schools in the 1980s, and some schools also provided their students with clothing. The assistance of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]]s' [[World Food Programme]] allowed free midday meals in some primary schools. This governmental assistance is important to note in the country's [[Gross National Happiness]] (GNH), which is at the forefront of developmental policies and is the responsibility of the government.. Article 9 of the Constitution of Bhutan states that \"the state shall strive to promote those conditions that will enable the pursuit of Gross National Happiness.\"<ref name=\"Tobgay 2011\">{{cite journal|last1=Tobgay|first1=Tashi|last2=Dophu|first2=Ugen|last3=Torres|first3=Cristina|last4=Na-Bangchang|first4=Kesara|title=Health and Gross National Happiness: review of current status in Bhutan|journal=Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare|date=2011|pmc=3155859|pmid=21847351|doi=10.2147/JMDH.S21095|volume=4|pages=293\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==== Gross National Happiness ====\nGNH in Bhutan is based on four principles: sustainable and equitable economic development, conservation of the environment, preservation and promotion of culture, and good governance. Their constitution prescribes that the state will provide free access to public health services through a three-tiered health system which provides preventative, promotive, and curative services. Because of this policy, Bhutan was able to eliminate iodine deficiency disorder in 2003, leprosy in 1997, and achieved childhood immunization for all children in 1991. It became the first country to ban tobacco in 2004, and cases of malaria decreased from 12,591 cases in 1999 to 972 cases in 2009.<ref name=\"Tobgay 2011\" /> The elimination of these diseases and the strong push for GNH allows for all people (including adolescents who are provided with many necessary items and free education) to live happier lives than they otherwise may have had.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Educationin]] [[Education in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] is working on developing a whole organizational approach to support mental health and character education. A [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/634731/Practice_example-Whole_organisational_approach.pdf joint report] published in October 2017 from the Departments for Education and Health outline this approach with regards to staff training, raising awareness of mental health challenges that children face, and involvement of parents and families in students' mental health.\n\n=== Singapore ===\n[https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=1635 REACH] is a program in [[Education in Singapore|Singapore]] that looks to provide interventions for students struggling with mental illness. A quote from the REACH website reads, \"The majority of children and adolescents do not suffer from mental illness. However, when a student has been identified, the school counselor, with consultation from the school\u2019s case management team, will look into managing the care of the student. When necessary, guidance specialists and educational psychologists from the Ministry of Education will render additional support.\n\nIn 2010, the Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs), in collaboration with National Council of Social Service (NCSS), have also been invited to join this network to provide community and clinical support to at-risk children.\nStudents/children with severe emotional and behavioural problems may need more help. The REACH team collaborates with school counsellors/VWOs to provide suitable school-based interventions to help these students. Such school/VWO based interventions often provide the requisite, timely help that these students/children need.\nFurther specialised assessment or treatment may be necessary for more severe cases. The student/child may be referred to the Child Guidance Clinic after assessment by the REACH team for further psychiatric evaluation and intervention. These interventions may include medications, psychotherapy, group or family work and further assessments.\"\n\n=== Mexico ===\nTraditionally, mental health was not considered a part of public health in [[Education in Mexico|Mexico]] because of other health priorities, lack of knowledge about the true magnitude of mental health problems, and a complex approach involving the intervention of other sectors in addition to the public health sector. Among the key documents anticipating the policy change was a report presented by the Mexican Health Foundation in 1995, which opened a very constructive debate. It introduced basic tenets for health improvement, elements for an analysis of the health situation related to the burden of disease approach, and a strategic proposal with concurrent recommendations for reforming the system. Mexico has an extensive legal frame of reference dealing with health and mental health. The objectives are to promote a healthy psychosocial development of different population groups, and reduce the effects of behavioural and psychiatric disorders. This should be achieved through graded and complementary interventions, according to the\nlevel of care, and with the coordinated participation of the public, social, and private sectors in municipal, state, and national settings. The strategic lines consider training and qualification of human resources, growth, rehabilitation, and regionalization of\nmental health service networks, formulation of guidelines and evaluation. All age groups as well as specific sub-populations (indigenous groups, women, street children, populations in disaster areas), and other state and regional priorities are considered.\n\n=== Japan and China ===\nIn [[Education in Japan|Japan]] and [[Education in China|China]], the approach to mental health is focused on the collective of students, much like the national aims of these Asian countries. Much like in the US, there is much research done in the realm of student mental health, but not many national policies in place to prevent and aid mental health problems students face. Japanese students face considerable academic pressure as imposed by society and school systems. In 2006, Japanese police gathered notes left from students who had committed suicide that year and noted overarching school pressures as the primary source of their problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/why-do-so-many-japanese-schoolchildren-kill-themselves-391648 |title=Why Do So Many Japanese Schoolchildren Kill Themselves? |publisher=Newsweek |date=2015-08-11}}</ref> Additionally, the dynamic of collective thinking\u2014the centripetal force of Japan's society, wherein individual identity is sacrificed for the functioning benefit of a greater collective\u2014results in the stigmatization of uniqueness. As child psychiatrist Dr. Ken Takaoka explained to CNN, schools prioritize this collectivism, and \u201cchildren who do not get along in a group will suffer.\u201d\n\n=== South Korea ===\n\nSouth Korea has traditionally placed much value on education. As a nation that has a  degree of enthusiasm like no other for education has created an environment where children are pressured to study more than ever. When mental health issues affect students there are very few resources available to help students cope. The nation's general view of mental health problems, such as anxiety, depression or thoughts of suicide, is that they are believed to be a sign of personal weakness that could bring shame upon a family if a member would be discovered to have such an illness. This is true if the problem arises in a social, educational or family setting. Rather than perceiving mental health issues as a medical condition and concern requiring treatment especially in students, a majority of Korea\u2019s population has perceived them as a cultural stigma. A study conducted by Yuri Yang <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jang|first=Yuri|last2=Chiriboga|first2=David A.|last3=Okazaki|first3=Sumie|date=2009-01-01|title=Attitudes toward mental health services: Age-group differences in Korean American adults|journal=Aging & Mental Health|volume=13|issue=1|pages=127\u2013134|doi=10.1080/13607860802591070|issn=1360-7863|pmc=2737391|pmid=19197698}}</ref>, a professor at the University of Florida and a member of the Department of Aging and Mental Health, found when surveying over 600 Korean citizens from the age of 20-60+ years in 2008, most of the older people, many of whom are parents, shared similar and negative views on mental health issues such as depression. The older adults generally were also found to have a negative view of mental health services, including those offered through the educational system, as they are deeply influenced by the cultural stigma around the topic. This negative view of mental health services in education has provided implications for students who are struggling emotionally, as many do not know what, if any, help might be available in the facilities of education. However, this does not mean no mental health services exist in the world or in the educational setting. The World Health Organization (WHO) in 2006 collected data <ref> https://www.who.int/mental_health/evidence/korea_who_aims_report.pdf?ua=1 </ref> regarding Korea\u2019s mental health system. The goal of collecting this information was to attempt to improve the mental health system and to provide a baseline for monitoring the change. Despite Korea having a low budget for mental health services compared to other developed countries, it has taken steps to create long term mental health plans to advance its national health system such as raising more awareness for mental health, creating communities for students, and removing the cultural stigma around mental health. \n== Alleviation and Fostering Adjustment ==\n=== Prevention ===\nSome schools may need recognize that they are not just an institution, but are intended to help shape the lives of students and allow them to participate meaningfully in a social aspect of this environment. Psychologically, this can overshadow the academic aspect, yet often little heed is given. Athletics, faculty-student relationships, clubs, and other social activities are important so that no student is left in a \"social limbo year after year.\" The pressures of school, extracurricular activities, work and relationships with friends and family can be a lot for an individual to manage and at times can be overwhelming. In order to prevent these overwhelming feelings from turning into a mental health problem, taking measures to prevent these emotions from escalating is essential. School-based programs that help students with emotional-regulation, stress management, conflict resolution, and active coping and cognitive restructuring are a few suggested ways that give students resources that can promote their mental health (Mental Health Commission, 2012).  Educators need to pay as much attention to the well-being of their students as they do on the academic aspect to ensure they are setting their students up for success in the future.\n\n=== Belonging ===\nBelonging in the school environment may be the most important and relevant factors affecting students' performance in an academic setting.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} School-related stress and an increase in academic expectations may increase school-related stress and in turn negatively affect their academic performance. The absence of social acceptance have been shown to lead lowered interest and engagement because students have difficulty sustaining engagement in environments where they do not feel valued and welcome.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kaplan|first1=Diane|last2=Liu|first2=Ruth|last3=Kaplan|first3=Howard|title=School Related Stress in Early Adolescence and Academic Performance Three Years Later: The Conditional Influence of Self Expectations|journal=Social Psychology of Education|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mental Health]]\n* [[Education]]\n* [[Learning disability]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Educational psychology]]\n", "name_user": "Snoops292", "label": "safe", "comment": "Edited the lead and added cited data to \"Depression\" subsection", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health_in_education"}

There were a few films that featured Singaporean actors and were set in Singapore, including ''[[Saint Jack (film)|Saint Jack]]'', ''[[They Call Her Cleopatra Wong]]'' and ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]''.<ref>[http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20061216053138/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/ac-ca/progs/rc-tr/progs/eccc-ttcc/market/publications/singapour_film_market/film_singapour_e.pdf Singapore Film Market] </ref>\n\nWith the increasing global success and globalization of the Singaporean film industry, the past two decades have seen Singaporean actors like [[Christopher Lee]], [[Tan Kheng Hua]] and [[Fiona Xie]] star in [[Hollywood]] films, Singaporean auteurs such as [[Jack Neo]] direct English-language works and Singaporean films be remade in the United States, China, Japan as well as other markets. The [[Singapore International Film Festival]] has also grown to become one of Asia's largest and most important flim festivals.\n\n==After 1990==\n\n===Early 1990s pioneers===\nThe first fully Singapore funded film came in 1991's ''[[The Medium (1992 film)|Medium Rare]]'', which was based on a real-life local cult killer, Adrian Lim, who was hanged in 1988 for murder.  Although it cost over S$2 million in production, the film performed dismally at the box office.  The film took in merely S$130,000 locally but broke the ice for the next coming Singapore movie, ''[[Bugis Street]]'', which was released in 1995.  ''Bugis Street'' was a gaudy film about the famous sleazy district where [[transvestism|transvestites]] and [[transsexual]]s were found. Both Medium Rare and Bugis Street were directed by Singaporeans. The same year saw the release of ''[[Mee Pok Man]]'', the first full-length film made by an independent Singaporean filmmaker, [[Eric Khoo]], on a tight budget of S$100,000.  Concerning a lonely noodle seller who falls for a [[prostitute]], ''Mee Pok Man'' earned much critical accolade worldwide and encouraged more experimental, independent filmmaking in the nation.\n\n''[[Army Daze]]'', made in 1996, took a humorous look at Singapore's [[national service]], and turned in high profits at the box office.\n\nIn 1997 came another Eric Khoo feature film, ''[[12 Storeys]]'', a highly acclaimed production which was the first Singaporean film to be shown at [[Cannes]].  Interweaving 3 stories about life in the [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] high-rise flats, ''12 Storeys'' was seen as a breakthrough for Singaporean films, combining a coherent plot with Singaporean production crew and actors, such as [[Jack Neo]] and Koh Boon Pin.  The rest of the decade was encouraging for the growing film industry.  [[Glen Goei]]'s ''Forever Fever'' (1998) was picked up by [[Miramax]] for S$4.5 million and re-released in the [[United States|U.S.]] as ''That's the Way I Like It''.  These two years saw the releases of a number of other films, such as ''A Road Less Travelled'' (1997), ''God or Dog'' (1997), ''Tiger's Whip'' (1998) and ''[[The Teenage Textbook Movie]]'' (1998).\n\n===Late 1990s successes===\nHowever, it was the phenomenal success of ''[[Money No Enough]]'' (1998) which eventually catapulted the nation's drive towards movie-making.  Using a local crew of actors drawn from television comedies, this 'heartland' comedy written by Jack Neo used a smattering of [[Singlish]] and [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] to make a realistic, easily identifiable drama about everybody's quest to make a quick buck.  Made with less than S$1 million, it raked in S$5,800,000, making it the most commercially profitable local film to date.  It also demonstrated the viable potential of Singapore's film industry. The next year would be a boom year for local films.  Eight Singaporean feature films were made in 1999 alone, the most notable being ''[[Liang Po Po: The Movie]]'' (starring Jack Neo in a reprisal of his television cross-gender role), ''That One No Enough'', the first directorial effect of Jack Neo, and ''Eating Air'', made by film critic [[Kelvin Tong]] and film editor Jasmine Ng on a budget of S$800,000.  ''Eating Air'' did not break even; ''That One No Enough'' barely did and only ''Liang Po Po: The Movie'' continued the vein of commercial success of ''Money No Enough'', collecting S$3.03 million. \n\n1999 also marked a watershed for Singapore films.  [[Raintree Pictures]], the filmmaking subsidiary of [[MediaCorp|MediaCorp Productions]], was started. Raintree Pictures invested in two regional co-productions, ''Liang Po Po'' and ''[[The Truth About Jane and Sam]]'', which starred Singaporean television lead actress [[Fann Wong]] with [[Taiwan]]ese singer [[Peter Ho]] and [[Hong Kong]] director [[Derek Yee]].  Raintree Pictures would finance a number of local and Hong Kong productions in years to come, and are the producer company of the films of Jack Neo.  Subsequent productions, such as ''[[2000 AD (film)|2000 AD]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Tree (2001 film)|The Tree]]'' (2001), also drew on Hong Kong star power; the company invested in critically acclaimed regional films such as ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002) and ''Infernal Affairs II'' (2003).  Raintree Pictures also produced two English-language local productions, ''[[Chicken Rice War]]'' (2000) and ''[[One Leg Kicking]]'' (2001).\n\nWith the financing of a local production company and the setting up of organisations such as the Singapore Film Commission (SFC, set up in 1998), budding filmmakers, especially independent ones, found it easier to make movies on subsidies and loaned funding.  The advent of [[digital video]] also meant that some novice filmmakers could experiment with cheaper alternatives.  Features like ''Stories about Love'' (2000) and ''Return to Pontianak'' (2001) were both shot on digital videos, even though they were not commercial successes.\n\n===Early 2000s===\nThe success story since the turn of the 21st century must be from local comedian-turned-director Jack Neo.  Financed by Raintree Pictures, he made a number of hits dealing with Singapore's heartland problems in an engaging and deceptively light-hearted fashion.  ''[[I Not Stupid]]'' (2002) was a peek into the ultra-competitive academic lifestyle as seen through three local students who performed poorly in grades; its acerbic social commentary marked another height for Singaporean films. ''[[Homerun (film)|Homerun]]'' (2003) was a remake of the Iranian ''[[Children of Heaven]]'' in a local, pre-independent era context; it won for its young lead [[Megan Zheng]] the first [[Golden Horse Award]] for Best Newcomer.  ''[[The Best Bet]]'' (2004) took a humorous dig at heartlanders' obsessions with lotteries.  Neo averages a film per year and his productions feature local Singaporean (usually television) artistes in filmic roles.  They have been successes locally and abroad, especially in those places with a Chinese-language market, such as Hong Kong.  He has started his own artiste management company, J-Team Productions.\n\n[[Royston Tan]], a young Singapore TV commercial director who has been making award-winning shorts for years, released ''[[15 (film)|15: The Movie]]'', his first feature, in 2003.  An expanded version of an earlier short film he made, this 90-min movie on the fringe and drug-abusing delinquents used bold subject-matter and featured some graphic scenes with non-professional actors.  When the film censorship board passed it with cuts, it prompted a backlash from the director in the form of ''Cut'', an all-singing musical satire ''\u00e0 la'' [[Tsai Ming-liang]] lampooning the system.  This short film was passed uncensored by the board and was seen during the [[Singapore International Film Festival]], but there were open discussions about it during local parliamentary sessions, prompting remarks that the government was \"not amused\" by it.  Royston Tan has since made three more features, ''4:30'' (2005), ''881'' (2007) and ''12 Lotus'' (2008).\n\n===2005 to 2009===\n2005 could be seen as another mini-boom year for Singaporean cinema, with commercially successful fares like [[Kelvin Tong]]'s horror flick ''[[The Maid (2005 film)|The Maid]]'', two Jack-Neo co-directed movies, ''I Do I Do'' and ''One More Chance'', and less mainstream offerings like [[Eric Khoo]]'s critically acclaimed [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] opener ''[[Be with Me]]'', and ''[[Perth (film)|Perth]]'', Djinn's dark take on [[Martin Scorsese|Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.\n\nIn 2006, the independent feature ''[[Becoming Royston]]'' paid homage to the above-mentioned filmmaker.  It was made under new Originasian Pictures. The film went on its festival run in Europe and South Asia and was released in 2007. 2006 also saw the premiere of ''[[Singapore Dreaming]]'' by [https://web.archive.org/web/20081103050039/http://www.colinandyenyen.com/ Woo Yen Yen and Colin Goh], who won the Montblanc New Screenwriters Award at the San Sebastian International Film Festival, the first Singaporeans to do so. The film was also screened at numerous festivals worldwide and, in 2007, became the first Singaporean feature to win the Audience Award for Narrative Feature at the Asian American International Film Festival in New York.\n\nIn 2007, Jack Neo released another film known as ''[[Just Follow Law]]'' which took a dig at bureaucracy in the civil service, as well as the lengthy procedures one had to go through in Singapore to get a permit for various things. This film garnered generally positive reviews and was moderately successful at the box office. However, the success story of the year was Royston Tan's ''[[881 (film)|881]]'', which brought Singapore's seventh month [[getai]] culture to the big screens. While it was intended to be a niche film, it exceeded expectations and became one of the highest-grossing local films of all time. Critics generally gave it positive reviews, and many believe that it was the fact that the film gave younger Singaporean Chinese more insight into their traditional culture that made it a success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} In addition, the use of Hokkien songs, which had been suppressed by the government as part of the [[Speak Mandarin Campaign]], may have contributed to its popularity.\n\nIn 2008, Eric Khoo's [[Tamil language]] social drama ''[[My Magic]]'' became Singapore's first film to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\n===2010 and beyond===\nA wave of young filmmakers, considered the Singaporean new wave, who are educated in local and overseas film schools, begin to dominate the film scene.\n\n''[[Ilo Ilo]]'', the debut feature of director [[Anthony Chen]], premiered at the [[2013 Cannes Film Festival]] as part of the [[Directors' Fortnight]] on 19 May 2013 to very positive reviews.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |first=Stephen |last=Dalton |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ilo-ilo-cannes-review-525336 |title=Ilo Ilo: Cannes Review |accessdate=22 June 2013 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |date=5 May 2013}}</ref> The film was awarded the [[Camera d'Or]] award, thus becoming the first Singaporean [[feature film]] to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival.<ref name=\"today20130527\">{{cite web |first=Genevieve |last=Loh |url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/movies/ilo-ilo-first-spore-film-win-cannes |title=Ilo Ilo is first S\u2019pore film to win at Cannes |accessdate=22 June 2013 |work=Today |date=27 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527025633/http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/movies/ilo-ilo-first-spore-film-win-cannes |archivedate=27 May 2013 }}</ref> It received six nominations at the [[Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards]].,<ref>{{cite news|title=\u2018Ilo Ilo\u2019 earns 6 nominations for the Golden Horse Awards|url=http://sg.movies.yahoo.com/blogs/show-buzz/ilo-ilo-earns-6-nominations-golden-horse-awards-150549059.html|publisher=Yahoo!

There were a few films that featured Singaporean actors and were set in Singapore, including ''[[Saint Jack (film)|Saint Jack]]'', ''[[They Call Her Cleopatra Wong]]'' and ''[[Crazy Rich Asians (film)|Crazy Rich Asians]]''.<ref>[http://webarchive.bac-lac.gc.ca:8080/wayback/20061216053138/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/ac-ca/progs/rc-tr/progs/eccc-ttcc/market/publications/singapour_film_market/film_singapour_e.pdf Singapore Film Market] </ref>\n\nWith the increasing global success and globalization of the Singaporean film industry, the past two decades have seen Singaporean actors like [[Christopher Lee]], [[Tan Kheng Hua]] and [[Fiona Xie]] star in [[Hollywood]] films, Singaporean auteurs such as [[Jack Neo]] direct English-language works and Singaporean films be remade in the United States, China, Japan as well as other markets. The [[Singapore International Film Festival]] has also grown to become one of Asia's largest and most important flim festivals.\n\n==After 1990==\n\n===Early 1990s pioneers===\nThe first fully Singapore funded film came in 1991's ''[[The Medium (1992 film)|Medium Rare]]'', which was based on a real-life local cult killer, Adrian Lim, who was hanged in 1988 for murder.  Although it cost over S$2 million in production, the film performed dismally at the box office.  The film took in merely S$130,000 locally but broke the ice for the next coming Singapore movie, ''[[Bugis Street]]'', which was released in 1995.  ''Bugis Street'' was a gaudy film about the famous sleazy district where [[transvestism|transvestites]] and [[transsexual]]s were found. Both Medium Rare and Bugis Street were directed by Singaporeans. The same year saw the release of ''[[Mee Pok Man]]'', the first full-length film made by an independent Singaporean filmmaker, [[Eric Khoo]], on a tight budget of S$100,000.  Concerning a lonely noodle seller who falls for a [[prostitute]], ''Mee Pok Man'' earned much critical accolade worldwide and encouraged more experimental, independent filmmaking in the nation.\n\n''[[Army Daze]]'', made in 1996, took a humorous look at Singapore's [[national service]], and turned in high profits at the box office.\n\nIn 1997 came another Eric Khoo feature film, ''[[12 Storeys]]'', a highly acclaimed production which was the first Singaporean film to be shown at [[Cannes]].  Interweaving 3 stories about life in the [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]] high-rise flats, ''12 Storeys'' was seen as a breakthrough for Singaporean films, combining a coherent plot with Singaporean production crew and actors, such as [[Jack Neo]] and Koh Boon Pin.  The rest of the decade was encouraging for the growing film industry.  [[Glen Goei]]'s ''Forever Fever'' (1998) was picked up by [[Miramax]] for S$4.5 million and re-released in the [[United States|U.S.]] as ''That's the Way I Like It''.  These two years saw the releases of a number of other films, such as ''A Road Less Travelled'' (1997), ''God or Dog'' (1997), ''Tiger's Whip'' (1998) and ''[[The Teenage Textbook Movie]]'' (1998).\n\n===Late 1990s successes===\nHowever, it was the phenomenal success of ''[[Money No Enough]]'' (1998) which eventually catapulted the nation's drive towards movie-making.  Using a local crew of actors drawn from television comedies, this 'heartland' comedy written by Jack Neo used a smattering of [[Singlish]] and [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] to make a realistic, easily identifiable drama about everybody's quest to make a quick buck.  Made with less than S$1 million, it raked in S$5,800,000, making it the most commercially profitable local film to date.  It also demonstrated the viable potential of Singapore's film industry. The next year would be a boom year for local films.  Eight Singaporean feature films were made in 1999 alone, the most notable being ''[[Liang Po Po: The Movie]]'' (starring Jack Neo in a reprisal of his television cross-gender role), ''That One No Enough'', the first directorial effect of Jack Neo, and ''Eating Air'', made by film critic [[Kelvin Tong]] and film editor Jasmine Ng on a budget of S$800,000.  ''Eating Air'' did not break even; ''That One No Enough'' barely did and only ''Liang Po Po: The Movie'' continued the vein of commercial success of ''Money No Enough'', collecting S$3.03 million. \n{{Life in Singapore}}\n1999 also marked a watershed for Singapore films.  [[Raintree Pictures]], the filmmaking subsidiary of [[MediaCorp|MediaCorp Productions]], was started. Raintree Pictures invested in two regional co-productions, ''Liang Po Po'' and ''[[The Truth About Jane and Sam]]'', which starred Singaporean television lead actress [[Fann Wong]] with [[Taiwan]]ese singer [[Peter Ho]] and [[Hong Kong]] director [[Derek Yee]].  Raintree Pictures would finance a number of local and Hong Kong productions in years to come, and are the producer company of the films of Jack Neo.  Subsequent productions, such as ''[[2000 AD (film)|2000 AD]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Tree (2001 film)|The Tree]]'' (2001), also drew on Hong Kong star power; the company invested in critically acclaimed regional films such as ''[[The Eye (2002 film)|The Eye]]'' (2002) and ''Infernal Affairs II'' (2003).  Raintree Pictures also produced two English-language local productions, ''[[Chicken Rice War]]'' (2000) and ''[[One Leg Kicking]]'' (2001).\n\nWith the financing of a local production company and the setting up of organisations such as the Singapore Film Commission (SFC, set up in 1998), budding filmmakers, especially independent ones, found it easier to make movies on subsidies and loaned funding.  The advent of [[digital video]] also meant that some novice filmmakers could experiment with cheaper alternatives.  Features like ''Stories about Love'' (2000) and ''Return to Pontianak'' (2001) were both shot on digital videos, even though they were not commercial successes.\n\n===Early 2000s===\nThe success story since the turn of the 21st century must be from local comedian-turned-director Jack Neo.  Financed by Raintree Pictures, he made a number of hits dealing with Singapore's heartland problems in an engaging and deceptively light-hearted fashion.  ''[[I Not Stupid]]'' (2002) was a peek into the ultra-competitive academic lifestyle as seen through three local students who performed poorly in grades; its acerbic social commentary marked another height for Singaporean films. ''[[Homerun (film)|Homerun]]'' (2003) was a remake of the Iranian ''[[Children of Heaven]]'' in a local, pre-independent era context; it won for its young lead [[Megan Zheng]] the first [[Golden Horse Award]] for Best Newcomer.  ''[[The Best Bet]]'' (2004) took a humorous dig at heartlanders' obsessions with lotteries.  Neo averages a film per year and his productions feature local Singaporean (usually television) artistes in filmic roles.  They have been successes locally and abroad, especially in those places with a Chinese-language market, such as Hong Kong.  He has started his own artiste management company, J-Team Productions.\n\n[[Royston Tan]], a young Singapore TV commercial director who has been making award-winning shorts for years, released ''[[15 (film)|15: The Movie]]'', his first feature, in 2003.  An expanded version of an earlier short film he made, this 90-min movie on the fringe and drug-abusing delinquents used bold subject-matter and featured some graphic scenes with non-professional actors.

Royston Tan has since made three more features, ''4:30'' (2005), ''881'' (2007) and ''12 Lotus'' (2008).\n\n===2005 to 2009===\n2005 could be seen as another mini-boom year for Singaporean cinema, with commercially successful fares like [[Kelvin Tong]]'s horror flick ''[[The Maid (2005 film)|The Maid]]'', two Jack-Neo co-directed movies, ''I Do I Do'' and ''One More Chance'', and less mainstream offerings like [[Eric Khoo]]'s critically acclaimed [[Cannes Film Festival|Cannes]] opener ''[[Be with Me]]'', and ''[[Perth (film)|Perth]]'', Djinn's dark take on [[Martin Scorsese|Scorsese]]'s ''[[Taxi Driver]]''.\n\nIn 2006, the independent feature ''[[Becoming Royston]]'' paid homage to the above-mentioned filmmaker.
