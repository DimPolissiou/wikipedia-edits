There he would incorperate live singing as well as comedic skits into his act. This success continued when he moved to London in the 2000's where he began peforming on the London cabaret circuit in gay-venues, and legendary drag/cabaret venues, such as The Two Brewers and The Royal Vauxhall Tavern. As his success grew, he became a sensation across the United Kingdom and would regularly tour the UK.\n\nHides started a YouTube channel after [[high-definition video]] uploading became available on the website. Following the creation of his channel, he uploaded some of the videos that he used in live performances and comedy routines. Since Hides created the ''Charlie Hides TV'' YouTube channel in March 2011, he has uploaded over 200 videos.

There's pageant girls, there's comics, there's celebrity impersonators. There's every different type of queen under the sun. That's one of the things that ''Drag Race'' has definitely shown over the course of nine seasons. That there's so many different ways to express yourself using this art form.\n\nYou'd think it's just gay men, but it's got a huge following of women who are watching for the fashion. They're watching for the colourful sense of humour and then they're identifying with us. The contestants are human beings and not just seen as some dancing clowns or as freaks. We are definitely in need of laughter, sunshine, brightness and colour. Drag queens are defiant. We are the counter culture, the opposition party. We are everything that the moral majority and small-minded bigots fear.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39380929/why-rupauls-drag-race-is-more-than-just-a-tv-show | title=Why RuPaul's Drag Race is more than just a TV show | publisher=[[BBC News]] | work=[[Newsbeat]] | date=March 24, 2017 | accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nOn the fourth episode of the show, entitled \"Good Morning Bitches\", Hides was eliminated from the competition. He was placed in the bottom two by the judges, and therefore had to participate in a \"Lip-Sync for Your Life\" to [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[I Wanna Go]]\" against fellow contestant Trinity Taylor. Hides commented on the lip-sync, saying that the self-described \"disaster\" was a result of having a [[Bone fracture|fractured rib]], due to a cheerleading challenge several episodes prior. In the episode's challenge, Hides was critiqued for his performance in the [[talk show]] segment of the episode. The morning after his elimination, Hides uploaded a music video for his new single, \"The Dame\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/tv/article/Charlie-Hides-11071745.php | title=Charlie Hides talks cracked ribs and that disastrous 'Drag Race' lip sync | work=[[Houston Chronicle]] | date=April 14, 2017 | accessdate=April 14, 2017 | author=Guerra, Joey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/television/2017/4/15/last-words-drag-races-charlie-hides | title=Last Words With Drag Race's Charlie Hides | work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | date=April 15, 2017 | accessdate=April 15, 2017 | author=Reynolds, Daniel}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title=Good Morning Bitches | series=[[RuPaul's Drag Race]] | network=[[VH1]] | airdate=April 14, 2017 | season=9}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn December 2015, Hides was accused of using [[blackface]] and [[ethnic stereotype]]s to represent one of his characters, Laquisha Jonz. An activist, Chardine Taylor-Stone, launched a petition on the website [[Change.org]], calling for the [[Royal Vauxhall Tavern]], and other venues, to cancel Hides' performances. Taylor-Stone claimed that the character was \"a racist act based on misogynist stereotypes of black working class women, it is outdated, offensive, shameful and has no place in the [[LGBT community|LGBT Community]]\".

There he would incorperate live singing as well as comedic skits into his act. This success continued when he moved to London in the early half of the new millennium where he began peforming on the London cabaret circuit in gay-venues, and legendary drag/cabaret venues, such as The Two Brewers and The Royal Vauxhall Tavern. As his success grew, he became a sensation across the United Kingdom and would regularly tour the UK.\n\nHides started a YouTube channel after [[high-definition video]] uploading became available on the website. Following the creation of his channel, he uploaded some of the videos that he used in live performances and comedy routines. Since Hides created the ''Charlie Hides TV'' YouTube channel in March 2011, he has uploaded over 200 videos. These include series such as ''Madonna/Lady Gaga Nightmares'' and ''Shit ____ Says''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/CharlieHidesTV|title=Charlie Hides TV|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2019-03-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Hides uploaded a sketch that starred Australian singer and actress [[Kylie Minogue]].

There's pageant girls, there's comics, there's celebrity impersonators. There's every different type of queen under the sun. That's one of the things that ''Drag Race'' has definitely shown over the course of nine seasons. That there's so many different ways to express yourself using this art form.\n\nYou'd think it's just gay men, but it's got a huge following of women who are watching for the fashion. They're watching for the colourful sense of humour and then they're identifying with us. The contestants are human beings and not just seen as some dancing clowns or as freaks. We are definitely in need of laughter, sunshine, brightness and colour. Drag queens are defiant. We are the counter culture, the opposition party. We are everything that the moral majority and small-minded bigots fear.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/39380929/why-rupauls-drag-race-is-more-than-just-a-tv-show | title=Why RuPaul's Drag Race is more than just a TV show | publisher=[[BBC News]] | work=[[Newsbeat]] | date=March 24, 2017 | accessdate=March 24, 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nOn the fourth episode of the show, entitled \"Good Morning Bitches\", Hides was eliminated from the competition. He was placed in the bottom two by the judges, and therefore had to participate in a \"Lip-Sync for Your Life\" to [[Britney Spears]]' \"[[I Wanna Go]]\" against fellow contestant Trinity Taylor. Hides commented on the lip-sync, saying that the self-described \"disaster\" was a result of having a [[Bone fracture|fractured rib]], due to a cheerleading challenge several episodes prior. In the episode's challenge, Hides was critiqued for his performance in the [[talk show]] segment of the episode. The morning after his elimination, Hides uploaded a music video for his new single, \"The Dame\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/tv/article/Charlie-Hides-11071745.php | title=Charlie Hides talks cracked ribs and that disastrous 'Drag Race' lip sync | work=[[Houston Chronicle]] | date=April 14, 2017 | accessdate=April 14, 2017 | author=Guerra, Joey}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.advocate.com/television/2017/4/15/last-words-drag-races-charlie-hides | title=Last Words With Drag Race's Charlie Hides | work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] | date=April 15, 2017 | accessdate=April 15, 2017 | author=Reynolds, Daniel}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode | title=Good Morning Bitches | series=[[RuPaul's Drag Race]] | network=[[VH1]] | airdate=April 14, 2017 | season=9}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\n\nIn December 2015, Hides was accused of using [[blackface]] and [[ethnic stereotype]]s to represent one of his characters, Laquisha Jonz.

He studied physics at the [[Seoul National University]] . In 1979 he received his bachelor's degree there, and in 1981 his master's degree. Afterwards, he started his doctorate studies at [[Boston University]], which he finished in 1985 with a [[Ph.D]]. After that, he got a [[postdoc]] research position at the [[UCSB|University of California in Santa Barbara]], and later another position at the [[Emory University]]. In the year 1988 he became an assistant professor at the physics department of the [[Lehigh University]]. In 1994, he became an associate professor, and in 2000 a full professor.\n\nHe was interested in the dynamics of [[granular]] matter and researched on the granular flow, [[diffusion]] models, [[viscosity]] behavior and [[percolation]], among other subjects.  The void diffusion model, developed by Dr. Hong and a Lehigh colleague, is widely recognized as an effective theoretical model for treating a broad range of dynamical phenomena in granular media.\n\nHis formal treatment of the physics of the popcorn-making process was extremely popular and enjoyed attention from both the physics community and the lay public.

He studied physics at the [[Seoul National University]] . In 1979 he received his bachelor's degree there, and in 1981 his master's degree. Afterwards, he started his doctorate studies at [[Boston University]], which he finished in 1985 with a [[Ph.D]]. After that, he got a [[postdoc]] research position at the [[UCSB|University of California in Santa Barbara]], and later another position at the [[Emory University]]. In the year 1988 he became an assistant professor at the physics department of the [[Lehigh University]]. In 1994, he became an associate professor, and in 2000 a full professor.\n\nHe was interested in the dynamics of [[granular]] matter and researched on the granular flow, [[diffusion]] models, [[viscosity]] behavior and [[percolation]], among other subjects.  The void diffusion model, developed by Dr. Hong and a Lehigh colleague, is widely recognized as an effective theoretical model for treating a broad range of dynamical phenomena in granular media.\n\nHis formal treatment of the physics of the popcorn-making process was extremely popular and enjoyed attention from both the physics community and the lay public. He actively engaged broader audiences by writing popular magazine articles on varied topics ranging from [[science]] to [[philosophy]] to [[religion]].  He had collaborations going with numerous theorists all over the world.\n\nFrom 1995 till 2000 he was editor of the AKPA Newsletter and belonged to the editors board of the KASTN, the Korean American Science and Technology News.\n\nHe died at the age of 46 on July 6, 2002.
