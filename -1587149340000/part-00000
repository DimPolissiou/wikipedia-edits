They play in the [[Campeonato Baiano]], Bahia's state league, and the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]], Brazil's first tier league.\n\nBahia has won the ''Brasileir\u00e3o'' title twice: in the [[1959 Ta\u00e7a Brasil|1959 season]], defeating the [[Santos FC|Santos]]' ''Sant\u00e1sticos'' which contained figures such as [[Gylmar dos Santos Neves|Gilmar]], [[Mauro Ramos|Mauro]], [[Meng\u00e1lvio Pedro Figueir\u00f3|Meng\u00e1lvio]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Wilson Vieira Hon\u00f3rio|Coutinho]], [[Jos\u00e9 Macia|Pepe]] and [[Pel\u00e9]], in the finals and in the [[1988 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|1988 season]] Bahia edged [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]]. Bahia has only appeared in the [[Copa Libertadores]] three times, reaching the quarterfinals in [[1989 Copa Libertadores|1989]], Bahia's best-ever performance. The club has also won their state title a record 46 times.\n\nThe 2000s have seen the club win only four state titles. Bahia was demoted to the ''S\u00e9rie B'' in 2003 and demoted, for the first time ever, to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C|S\u00e9rie C]] in 2005, spending two seasons at the bottom of the Brazilian league system. In 2007, they were promoted back to the second level, and in 2010 the club found itself back in the ''S\u00e9rie A'', after eight seasons. Bahia had played its home games with 66,080 people capacity [[Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova]] since 1951 but after [[Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova#History|a section of the stadium collapsed]] in 2007, the ''Tricolor'' played at the [[Est\u00e1dio de Pitua\u00e7u]]. With the reopening of the Fonte Nova stadium in 2013 as the [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova|Arena Fonte Nova]], a modern arena built for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Bahia resumed playing its matches there. The club's home uniform consists of white shirts with blue shorts and red socks. It has a long-standing rivalry with the [[Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria|Vit\u00f3ria]] and matches between the two sides are known as Ba\u2013Vi.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years and the first national title===\n[[File:Time do Bahia na Ta\u00e7a Brasil.tif|left|thumb|Bahia\u00b4s team, 1959. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\nThe Esporte Clube Bahia was founded in 1931, when players from two clubs decided to merge. The Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica da Bahia and the Clube Bahiano de T\u00eanis had decided to discontinue their football divisions. A few years later Bahia became the most popular team in the Northeast of Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn the club's first year, Bahia won the Torneio Inicio and Bahia State Championship. The first Bahia president was Waldemar Costa, a doctor. Bahia's crest is based on Corinthians'{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Bahia's state flag, created by Raimundo Magalh\u00e3es, was used in place of the S\u00e3o Paulo state flag.\n\nThe team was founded with the motto \"Nasceu para Vencer\" (Born to Win). Bahia won 44 State Championships, 18 more than the Vit\u00f3ria (their rival club), and was the first club to participate in Ta\u00e7a Libertadores da America in 1960.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1963, and in 1968, the club represented the state of Bahia in Ta\u00e7a Brasil (the precursor of the Brazilian Championship), winning the title in 1959 and finishing as runner-up in 1961 and 1963.\n\n===The 1980s and the second national title===\nThe 1980s were the best in Bahia's history. Bahia won their second national title in 1988, finishing 5th in 1986 and 4th in 1990.\n\nIn 1989, Bahia won its second [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|Brazilian Championship]] against the [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] from [[Porto Alegre]] Bahia won the first leg in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] by 2\u20131. The second leg ended in an 0\u20130 tie in [[Porto Alegre]] at the [[Est\u00e1dio Beira-Rio|Beira Rio Stadium]]. After these results Bahia won the ''Brasileir\u00e3o'', their second national title. The championship gave to Bahia the right to play [[Copa Libertadores]] for a third time. It was a shock for the southern press {{Citation needed|reason=at least two links to press coverage needed|date=June 2015}} because Salvador is in the Northeast and the victory was over the Internacional, a team from southern Brazil, the region that has the highest [[Human Development Index]] in the country.\n\n===Dark years===\nIn 1997, Bahia was relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B|S\u00e9rie B]] for the first time in its history after a 0\u20130 draw against the [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]] at the Fonte Nova stadium. In 1999 Bahia was close to being promoted to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|S\u00e9rie A]] again. Bahia had a very good season, but finished in 3rd place, which was not enough to see them promoted.\n\nIn 2000, due to bribery scandals involving clubs such as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and the [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], the team returned to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|Brazilian First Division]], invited by the [[Clube dos 13]], along with the [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]], which was made a scapegoat for the controversy and was nationally victimized by the media (see [[Clube dos Treze#2000 Copa Jo\u00e3o Havelange|Copa Jo\u00e3o Havelange]]).\n\nIn 2002 the bank that had sponsored the team went bankrupt and the Bahia began a descent down the Brazilian football pyramid. After the title of the Northeast Cup in 2001 and 2002, Bahia performed poorly in 2003, and were relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B|S\u00e9rie B]] for the second time in the club's history. In 2004, the team was close to getting promoted to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|S\u00e9rie A]] again, finishing 4th. In order to be promoted, Bahia would have to win the final match against the Brasiliense, but the referee Paulo C\u00e9sar de Oliveira was assigned to that match and many people {{who|date=June 2015}} say he was all but fair on that day. In 2005, the club again competed in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B|S\u00e9rie B]], finishing in 18th place, and was relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C|S\u00e9rie C]] for the first time in the club's history.\n\n===F\u00eanix tricolor (tricolored phoenix)===\nBahia finished 2007 among the first four teams of the Third Division, and were promoted to the Second Division for the 2008 season. The Bahia began strongly, but in the last game of the 3rd stage of the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C|S\u00e9rie C]] against the already-eliminated Fast Club, Bahia needed a win to advance to the final. The victory came in the last minute of the game with a goal scored by Charles. In the final, the team finished the third division in 2nd place, only losing the title in the final round.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This moment is called the \"F\u00eanix Tricolor\" amongst Bahia fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The phoenix represents Bahia rising from the ashes.\n\nDespite playing in the Third Division of Brazilian football in 2007, Bahia had the largest average attendance in Brazil: 40,400 people per match.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} No club in the Third, the Second, or even the First Division was able to match it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} However, this is not unusual for Bahia, having also achieved the biggest average attendance in Brazil in 2004 (Second Division), 1988 (First Division), 1986 (First Division), and 1985 (First Division).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Recent years===\nFrom 2010 to 2014 Bahia remained in the first division. In 2014 they were relegated to the second division again, but came back in 2016. In 2017 they are playing in the first division. After 22 years out of international competition, Bahia returned in 2012 when they qualified for the [[Copa Sul-Americana]]. In addition, they have won the 2012, 2014 and 2015 Bahia State Championship and the Northeast Cup in 2017.\n\nIn February 2018 the intense rivalry between Bahia and Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria drew international attention when ten players (five from each team) were shown the [[penalty card#Red card|red card]] in a State Championship match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43107860|title=Vitoria v Bahia abandoned after 10 red cards and eight yellows|date=18 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\nBahia's colors are blue, red, and white. The blue color pays homage to the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica da Bahia; white, to the Clube Baiano de T\u00eanis; and red for the Bahia state flag. The club's mascot is called ''Super-Homem Tricolor'' (Tricolor Superman) and was inspired by the DC Comics [[Superman|character]]. The mascot was created by the famous cartoonist [[Ziraldo Alves Pinto|Ziraldo]] based on the expression  \"''Esquadr\u00e3o de A\u00e7o''\" (''Steel Squad''), and wears a costume very similar to the original Superman's costume, which shares the team's colors.\n\n==Stadium==\nBahia played at the [[Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova|Fonte Nova stadium]] from its inauguration in 1951 until November 2007.\nDuring the game against the Vila Nova (during Bahia's promotion campaign) a part of the stadium collapsed. Seven people died and more than 30 were injured.\n\nAfter that episode, the state government declared that the stadium would be demolished. [[Arena Fonte Nova|A new stadium]] was built on the site for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nSome notable games at the Fonte Nova:\n\n*Bahia : [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] 2\u20131

They play in the [[Campeonato Baiano]], Bahia's state league, and the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A]], Brazil's first tier league.\n\nBahia has won the ''Brasileir\u00e3o'' title twice: in the [[1959 Ta\u00e7a Brasil|1959 season]], defeating the [[Santos FC|Santos]]' ''Sant\u00e1sticos'' which contained figures such as [[Gylmar dos Santos Neves|Gilmar]], [[Mauro Ramos|Mauro]], [[Meng\u00e1lvio Pedro Figueir\u00f3|Meng\u00e1lvio]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Wilson Vieira Hon\u00f3rio|Coutinho]], [[Jos\u00e9 Macia|Pepe]] and [[Pel\u00e9]], in the finals and in the [[1988 Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|1988 season]] Bahia edged [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]]. Bahia has only appeared in the [[Copa Libertadores]] three times, reaching the quarterfinals in [[1989 Copa Libertadores|1989]], Bahia's best-ever performance. The club has also won their state title a record 46 times.\n\nThe 2000s have seen the club win only four state titles. Bahia was demoted to the ''S\u00e9rie B'' in 2003 and demoted, for the first time ever, to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C|S\u00e9rie C]] in 2005, spending two seasons at the bottom of the Brazilian league system. In 2007, they were promoted back to the second level, and in 2010 the club found itself back in the ''S\u00e9rie A'', after eight seasons. Bahia had played its home games with 66,080 people capacity [[Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova]] since 1951 but after [[Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova#History|a section of the stadium collapsed]] in 2007, the ''Tricolor'' played at the [[Est\u00e1dio de Pitua\u00e7u]]. With the reopening of the Fonte Nova stadium in 2013 as the [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova|Arena Fonte Nova]], a modern arena built for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Bahia resumed playing its matches there. The club's home uniform consists of white shirts with blue shorts and red socks. It has a long-standing rivalry with the [[Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria|Vit\u00f3ria]] and matches between the two sides are known as Ba\u2013Vi.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years and the first national title===\n[[File:Time do Bahia na Ta\u00e7a Brasil.tif|left|thumb|Bahia\u00b4s team, 1959. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]\nThe Esporte Clube Bahia was founded in 1931, when players from two clubs decided to merge. The Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica da Bahia and the Clube Bahiano de T\u00eanis had decided to discontinue their football divisions. A few years later Bahia became the most popular team in the Northeast of Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nIn the club's first year, Bahia won the Torneio Inicio and Bahia State Championship. The first Bahia president was Waldemar Costa, a doctor. Bahia's crest is based on Corinthians'{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}. Bahia's state flag, created by Raimundo Magalh\u00e3es, was used in place of the S\u00e3o Paulo state flag.\n\nThe team was founded with the motto \"Nasceu para Vencer\" (Born to Win). Bahia won 44 State Championships, 18 more than the Vit\u00f3ria (their rival club), and was the first club to participate in Ta\u00e7a Libertadores da America in 1960.\n\nBetween 1959 and 1963, and in 1968, the club represented the state of Bahia in Ta\u00e7a Brasil (the precursor of the Brazilian Championship), winning the title in 1959 and finishing as runner-up in 1961 and 1963.\n\n===The 1980s and the second national title===\nThe 1980s were the best in Bahia's history. Bahia won their second national title in 1988, finishing 5th in 1986 and 4th in 1990.\n\nIn 1989, Bahia won its second [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|Brazilian Championship]] against the [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] from [[Porto Alegre]] Bahia won the first leg in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] by 2\u20131. The second leg ended in an 0\u20130 tie in [[Porto Alegre]] at the [[Est\u00e1dio Beira-Rio|Beira Rio Stadium]]. After these results Bahia won the ''Brasileir\u00e3o'', their second national title. The championship gave to Bahia the right to play [[Copa Libertadores]] for a third time. It was a shock for the southern press {{Citation needed|reason=at least two links to press coverage needed|date=June 2015}} because Salvador is in the Northeast and the victory was over the Internacional, a team from southern Brazil, the region that has the highest [[Human Development Index]] in the country.\n\n===Dark years===\nIn 1997, Bahia was relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B|S\u00e9rie B]] for the first time in its history after a 0\u20130 draw against the [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]] at the Fonte Nova stadium. In 1999 Bahia was close to being promoted to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|S\u00e9rie A]] again. Bahia had a very good season, but finished in 3rd place, which was not enough to see them promoted.\n\nIn 2000, due to bribery scandals involving clubs such as the [[S\u00e3o Paulo FC|S\u00e3o Paulo]] and the [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], the team returned to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|Brazilian First Division]], invited by the [[Clube dos 13]], along with the [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]], which was made a scapegoat for the controversy and was nationally victimized by the media (see [[Clube dos Treze#2000 Copa Jo\u00e3o Havelange|Copa Jo\u00e3o Havelange]]).\n\nIn 2002 the bank that had sponsored the team went bankrupt and the Bahia began a descent down the Brazilian football pyramid. After the title of the Northeast Cup in 2001 and 2002, Bahia performed poorly in 2003, and were relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B|S\u00e9rie B]] for the second time in the club's history. In 2004, the team was close to getting promoted to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A|S\u00e9rie A]] again, finishing 4th. In order to be promoted, Bahia would have to win the final match against the Brasiliense, but the referee Paulo C\u00e9sar de Oliveira was assigned to that match and many people {{who|date=June 2015}} say he was all but fair on that day. In 2005, the club again competed in the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B|S\u00e9rie B]], finishing in 18th place, and was relegated to the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C|S\u00e9rie C]] for the first time in the club's history.\n\n===F\u00eanix tricolor (tricolored phoenix)===\nBahia finished 2007 among the first four teams of the Third Division, and were promoted to the Second Division for the 2008 season. The Bahia began strongly, but in the last game of the 3rd stage of the [[Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie C|S\u00e9rie C]] against the already-eliminated Fast Club, Bahia needed a win to advance to the final. The victory came in the last minute of the game with a goal scored by Charles. In the final, the team finished the third division in 2nd place, only losing the title in the final round.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This moment is called the \"F\u00eanix Tricolor\" amongst Bahia fans.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The phoenix represents Bahia rising from the ashes.\n\nDespite playing in the Third Division of Brazilian football in 2007, Bahia had the largest average attendance in Brazil: 40,400 people per match.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} No club in the Third, the Second, or even the First Division was able to match it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} However, this is not unusual for Bahia, having also achieved the biggest average attendance in Brazil in 2004 (Second Division), 1988 (First Division), 1986 (First Division), and 1985 (First Division).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n===Recent years===\nFrom 2010 to 2014 Bahia remained in the first division. In 2014 they were relegated to the second division again, but came back in 2016. In 2017 they are playing in the first division. After 22 years out of international competition, Bahia returned in 2012 when they qualified for the [[Copa Sul-Americana]]. In addition, they have won the 2012, 2014 and 2015 Bahia State Championship and the Northeast Cup in 2017.\n\nIn February 2018 the intense rivalry between Bahia and Esporte Clube Vit\u00f3ria drew international attention when ten players (five from each team) were shown the [[penalty card#Red card|red card]] in a State Championship match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43107860|title=Vitoria v Bahia abandoned after 10 red cards and eight yellows|date=18 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols==\nBahia's colors are blue, red, and white. The blue color pays homage to the Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Atl\u00e9tica da Bahia; white, to the Clube Baiano de T\u00eanis; and red for the Bahia state flag. The club's mascot is called ''Super-Homem Tricolor'' (Tricolor Superman) and was inspired by the DC Comics [[Superman|character]]. The mascot was created by the famous cartoonist [[Ziraldo Alves Pinto|Ziraldo]] based on the expression  \"''Esquadr\u00e3o de A\u00e7o''\" (''Steel Squad''), and wears a costume very similar to the original Superman's costume, which shares the team's colors.\n\n==Stadium==\nBahia played at the [[Est\u00e1dio Fonte Nova|Fonte Nova stadium]] from its inauguration in 1951 until November 2007.\nDuring the game against the Vila Nova (during Bahia's promotion campaign) a part of the stadium collapsed. Seven people died and more than 30 were injured.\n\nAfter that episode, the state government declared that the stadium would be demolished. [[Arena Fonte Nova|A new stadium]] was built on the site for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].\n\nSome notable games at the Fonte Nova:\n\n*Bahia : [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] 2\u20131

{"title_page": "Ancient Maya art", "text_new": "{{Maya civilization}}\n'''Ancient Mayan art''' refers to the material arts of the Mayan civilization, an eastern and south-eastern Mesamerican culture that took shape in the course of the later Preclassic Period (500 BC to 200 AD). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the Classic Period (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Mayan art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities.  Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.\n\n==Mayan art history== unnecessary information was not backed up and the article was not correct. I am a history teacher from Yale, and while sum information is correct, its unnecessary.\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main|Maya architecture}}\n\n[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] \n[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]\n\nThe layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.<ref>Stierlin 1994</ref> Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.\n\nAmong the various types of structures should be mentioned:\n*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).\n*Courtyards and palaces.\n*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house <ref>Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101</ref> and a possible council house in Copan.\n*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   \n*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].\n \nAmong the structural ensembles are:\n*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;\n*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;\n*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.\n\nIn the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).\n\nThe northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucat\u00e1n) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture<ref>Gendrop 1983</ref> is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucat\u00e1n from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].\n\n==Stone sculpture==\n{{see also|Maya stelae}}\n[[File:Cancuenpanel3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cancuen]], panel 3, seated king with two subordinates. Second half 8th century.]]\n[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] \nThe main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.<ref>Guernsey 2006</ref> The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.\n\n*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.\n*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.<ref>Tate 1992</ref>\n*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.<ref>Stuart and Stuart 2008</ref> King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.\n*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 89</ref>\n*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period<ref>Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192</ref> and may have functioned as altars.\n*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. \n*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.\n*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).\n*'''Stone sculpture in the round''' is especially known from Copan and Tonin\u00e1. It is represented by statuary, such as a seated Copan scribe as well as captive figures and small stelas from Tonin\u00e1; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the twenty maize deities from the fa\u00e7ade of Copan Temple 22;<ref>Schwerin 2011</ref> and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Cop\u00e1n, that were integral parts of architectural design.\n\n==Wood carving==\n[[File:Mirror-Bearer MET DT1254.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Possible mirror bearer; 6th century; wood & red hematite; height: 35.9 cm (14{{fraction|1|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIt is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,<ref>W.R. Coe et al. 1961</ref> with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] with a hieroglyphic text all around it. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.\n\n==Stucco modeling==\n[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]\n[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\nAt least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.\n \nSeveral solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.<ref>newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun</ref> An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.\n\nOften, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.<ref>Doyle and Houston 2012</ref> Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures<ref>V.E. Miller 1991</ref> reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.<ref>see Yadeun 1993:108-115</ref>\n\nPlastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].\n\nUnique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 168</ref> The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.\n\n==Mural painting==\n[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]\n[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]\nAlthough, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucat\u00e1n's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).<ref>Miller 1982; Gann 1900</ref>\n\nThey may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].<ref>M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013</ref> At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.<ref>Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010</ref> Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].<ref>Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015</ref>\n\nWall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[R\u00edo Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),<ref>Stone 1995</ref> usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).\n\nA bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Taj\u00edn]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.<ref>Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009</ref>\n\n==Writing and bookmaking==\n{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}\n[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]\nThe Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2019), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.<ref>Coe and Kerr 1997</ref> Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. \n\nToday, three [[Maya codices|Maya books]], all from the Post-Classic period, are still in existence: the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices. A fourth book, the [[Grolier Codex|Grolier]], is Maya-[[Toltec]] rather than Maya; apart from calendar signs, it has no text. Fragmentary and of very poor workmanship, it shows many anomalies, reason for which its authenticity has long remained in  doubt.<ref>Love 2017</ref> These books are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.\n\nBesides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.\n \nHieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\"/> Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').\n\n==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==\n{{main|Maya ceramics}}\n[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]\n[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]\nUnlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff</ref> The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts<ref>Tozzer 1941: 92</ref> and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.\n\nMade without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]<ref>Just 2012</ref> and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'<ref>Tate 1985</ref>\n  \nVase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.\n\nSculptural ceramic art includes the lids of Early Classic bowls mounted by human or animal figures; some of these bowls, burnished black, are among the most distinguished Mayan works of art ever created. \n\nCeramic sculpture also includes [[censer|incense burners]] and burial urns. Best known are the profusely decorated Classic burners from the kingdom of Palenque, which have the modeled face of a deity or of a king attached to an elongated hollow tube. The deity most frequently depicted, the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]], also adorns large Classic burial urns from the Guatemalan department of El Quich\u00e9.<ref>McCampbell 2010</ref> The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.<ref>Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007</ref> \n\nFinally, figurines, often mold-made, and of an amazing liveliness and realism, constitute a minor but highly informative genre. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines are ocarinas and may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].\n\n==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==\n[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\n[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]\nIt is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.\n\nAmong other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].<ref>Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016</ref> Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.<ref>Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131</ref> Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.<ref>Trik 1963</ref>\n\n==Applied arts and body decoration==\n{{see also|Maya textiles}}\nTextiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.<ref>Looper 2000</ref> They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.<ref>E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005</ref>\n\nWickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 331</ref> must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.<ref>Robicsek 1975</ref>\n\nBody decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.<ref>Houston et al. 2006: 18-25</ref>\n\n==Museum collections==\n[[File:Nationalmuseum f\u00fcr Arch\u00e4ologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda y Etnolog\u00eda]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]\nThere are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections.

Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the Classic Period (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Mayan art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities.  Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.\n\n==Mayan art history==\nFollowing the nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century publications on Maya art and archaeology by [[John Lloyd Stephens|Stephens]], [[Frederick Catherwood|Catherwood]], [[Alfred Maudslay|Maudslay]], [[Teoberto Maler|Maler]] and [[D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Charnay|Charnay]], that for the first time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments. The 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden's 'A Study of Maya Art' ( now over a century ago ) laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography).<ref>Spinden 1975</ref> The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the 'material arts', such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'.<ref>Proskouriakoff 1950</ref> [[George Kubler|Kubler's]] 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), conclude a period of gradual increase of knowledge that was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.\n\nStarting in the early 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms \u2013 first of all Palenque \u2013 came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical interpretation joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff as well as the mythological approach initiated by [[Michael D. Coe|M.D. Coe]], with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in ''The Blood of Kings'', written together with art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|M. Miller]].<ref>Schele and Miller 1986</ref> Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model.<ref>Coe 1973, 1975, 1978, 1982</ref> In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style,<ref>Robicsek and Hales 1981</ref> thereby revealing even more of a hitherto barely known spiritual world.\n\nAs to subsequent developments, important issues in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by [[Karl Taube]].<ref>E.g., Miller and Taube 1993; Taube et al. 2010</ref> New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994</ref> the representation of bodily experience and the senses in Maya art,<ref>Houston et al. 2005</ref> and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\">Stone and Zender 2011</ref> Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing.<ref>Tate 1992, Looper 2003, Simmons Clancy 2009, O'Neil 2012</ref> A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).<ref>Miller and Martin 2004</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n{{main|Maya architecture}}\n\n[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] \n[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]\n\nThe layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.<ref>Stierlin 1994</ref> Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.\n\nAmong the various types of structures should be mentioned:\n*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).\n*Courtyards and palaces.\n*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house <ref>Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101</ref> and a possible council house in Copan.\n*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   \n*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].\n \nAmong the structural ensembles are:\n*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;\n*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;\n*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.\n\nIn the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).\n\nThe northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucat\u00e1n) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture<ref>Gendrop 1983</ref> is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucat\u00e1n from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].\n\n==Stone sculpture==\n{{see also|Maya stelae}}\n[[File:Cancuenpanel3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cancuen]], panel 3, seated king with two subordinates. Second half 8th century.]]\n[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] \nThe main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.<ref>Guernsey 2006</ref> The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.\n\n*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.\n*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.<ref>Tate 1992</ref>\n*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.<ref>Stuart and Stuart 2008</ref> King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.\n*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 89</ref>\n*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period<ref>Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192</ref> and may have functioned as altars.\n*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. \n*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.\n*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).\n*'''Stone sculpture in the round''' is especially known from Copan and Tonin\u00e1. It is represented by statuary, such as a seated Copan scribe as well as captive figures and small stelas from Tonin\u00e1; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the twenty maize deities from the fa\u00e7ade of Copan Temple 22;<ref>Schwerin 2011</ref> and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Cop\u00e1n, that were integral parts of architectural design.\n\n==Wood carving==\n[[File:Mirror-Bearer MET DT1254.jpg|thumb|upright|250px|Possible mirror bearer; 6th century; wood & red hematite; height: 35.9 cm (14{{fraction|1|8}} in.); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York City)]]\nIt is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,<ref>W.R. Coe et al. 1961</ref> with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] with a hieroglyphic text all around it. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.\n\n==Stucco modeling==\n[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]\n[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\nAt least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.\n \nSeveral solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.<ref>newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun</ref> An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.\n\nOften, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.<ref>Doyle and Houston 2012</ref> Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures<ref>V.E. Miller 1991</ref> reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.<ref>see Yadeun 1993:108-115</ref>\n\nPlastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].\n\nUnique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.<ref>Martin and Grube 2000: 168</ref> The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.\n\n==Mural painting==\n[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]\n[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]\nAlthough, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucat\u00e1n's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).<ref>Miller 1982; Gann 1900</ref>\n\nThey may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].<ref>M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013</ref> At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.<ref>Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010</ref> Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].<ref>Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015</ref>\n\nWall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[R\u00edo Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),<ref>Stone 1995</ref> usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).\n\nA bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Taj\u00edn]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.<ref>Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009</ref>\n\n==Writing and bookmaking==\n{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}\n[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]\nThe Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2019), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.<ref>Coe and Kerr 1997</ref> Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. \n\nToday, three [[Maya codices|Maya books]], all from the Post-Classic period, are still in existence: the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices. A fourth book, the [[Grolier Codex|Grolier]], is Maya-[[Toltec]] rather than Maya; apart from calendar signs, it has no text. Fragmentary and of very poor workmanship, it shows many anomalies, reason for which its authenticity has long remained in  doubt.<ref>Love 2017</ref> These books are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.\n\nBesides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.\n \nHieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.<ref name=\"Stone and Zender 2011\"/> Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').\n\n==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==\n{{main|Maya ceramics}}\n[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]\n[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]\nUnlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff</ref> The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts<ref>Tozzer 1941: 92</ref> and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.\n\nMade without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]<ref>Just 2012</ref> and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'<ref>Tate 1985</ref>\n  \nVase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.\n\nSculptural ceramic art includes the lids of Early Classic bowls mounted by human or animal figures; some of these bowls, burnished black, are among the most distinguished Mayan works of art ever created. \n\nCeramic sculpture also includes [[censer|incense burners]] and burial urns. Best known are the profusely decorated Classic burners from the kingdom of Palenque, which have the modeled face of a deity or of a king attached to an elongated hollow tube. The deity most frequently depicted, the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]], also adorns large Classic burial urns from the Guatemalan department of El Quich\u00e9.<ref>McCampbell 2010</ref> The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.<ref>Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007</ref> \n\nFinally, figurines, often mold-made, and of an amazing liveliness and realism, constitute a minor but highly informative genre. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines are ocarinas and may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].\n\n==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==\n[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]\n[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]\nIt is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.\n\nAmong other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].<ref>Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016</ref> Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.<ref>Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131</ref> Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.<ref>Trik 1963</ref>\n\n==Applied arts and body decoration==\n{{see also|Maya textiles}}\nTextiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.<ref>Looper 2000</ref> They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.<ref>E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005</ref>\n\nWickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,<ref>Reents-Budet 1994: 331</ref> must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.<ref>Robicsek 1975</ref>\n\nBody decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.<ref>Houston et al. 2006: 18-25</ref>\n\n==Museum collections==\n[[File:Nationalmuseum f\u00fcr Arch\u00e4ologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueolog\u00eda y Etnolog\u00eda]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]\nThere are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections.

Drivers must give way to pedestrians on the crossing.\n\n== Driving licence ==\n{{main|Driving licence in India}}\nDriving licences may be obtained by any citizen of age 18 or above, subject to certain conditions.  Initially, a provisional licence is issued, which restricts the holder to driving whilst accompanied by a driver who has held a full licence in the category of vehicle they are supervising the learner driver. The provisional licence may be exchanged for a full licence after the holder has passed the driving test. On reaching the age of 50, drivers may apply to have their licences renewed with a medical/fitness certificate. Many foreign driving licences permit one to drive in India for a period of one year.\n\n== Enforcement ==\nSome of the rules of the road should be enforced by the police. Motorists convicted of certain traffic, and certain non-traffic offences may have 'points' added to their licences: some traffic violations, typically warrant three points, and motorists with twelve points face a temporary driving suspension.\n\n== Fatalities ==\n\n[[India]] is generally considered to be one of the most dangerous countries in the world in which to drive.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/8366209/India-to-make-dangerous-drivers-work-as-traffic-police.html |title=India to make dangerous drivers work as traffic police |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |last=Nelson |first=Dean |date=7 March 2011 |accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"reuters\">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/03/india-driving-idUSL4N0SP1W120141103 |title=FEATURE-India plans to step up safety on world's most dangerous roads |work=[[Reuters]] |date=3 November 2014 |accessdate=12 February 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"official\">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/10/india |title=Indian roads officially the most dangerous in the world |last=Ramesh |first=Randeep |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=10 October 2008 |accessdate=10 February 2015}}</ref> In 2007, more than 130,000 people died on the roads in India, though the number should be weighted against the large population of the country.
