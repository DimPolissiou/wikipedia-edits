{"title_page": "1919 Auckland Rugby League season", "text_new": "The 1919 season of the [[Auckland Rugby League]] was its 11th. It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities. The Newton v North Shore match was played as a curtain-raiser to the Ponsonby v Maritime match on Auckland Domain 1. When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = [[George Iles]] 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

It was the first season post [[World War I]] and unsurprisingly it saw a resurgence in playing numbers with 56 teams across the six grades. [[North Shore Albions]] who had previously dropped out of the senior competition again fielded a senior side. As did [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had dropped out during the 1917 season.  In addition a new club was formed, namely [[Marist Saints|Marist Old Boys]]. They were composed of old boys of the Marist Brothers\u2019 schools.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Marist Bros. Old Boys/New Club Formed\n| page =9\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17144\n| date = 1919-04-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190425.2.120.2\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref> The senior club season commenced on the 3rd of May.\n\n[[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] won their third consecutive first grade title, while [[Newton Rangers]] won the Roope Rooster trophy.\n\nAt the end of the season J.B. Cooke stated in a meeting that next season the ball would be rolled into scrums and forwards would have to keep their feet on the ground while the halfback was putting the ball in. These changes were to \u201cbrighten the game\u201d.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Visit of English Team\n| page =4\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17253\n| date = 1919-09-01\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190901.2.9.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\nThe season was also summarised by the league as well. Forty-nine teams were entered across all grades. Sunnyside won the second grade, Manukau won the third grade, City won the fourth and fifty grades, while Ponsonby won the sixth grade. It was stated that the standard of play in the senior club competition was not as good as it would have been due to the fact that 19 of the best club players from Auckland were away for a large part of the season representing New Zealand in Australia.\n\n===Representative Season===\nThe Auckland representative team was only able to play one inter provincial fixture against Hawkes Bay after matches with Canterbury and Wellington were unable to be scheduled due to the busy New Zealand representative schedule. Likewise Ponsonby were unable to schedule a defense of the Thacker Shield for the same reason. An Auckland Junior team was however able to make a trip out to Napier to play Hawkes Bay and they were victorious by 12 points to 5. Auckland played a match in front of an enormous crowd at the Auckland Domain against the touring Australian side but did not fair any better than the New Zealand national side, going down by 32 points to 8.\n\n===Charitable Efforts and League Funds===\nDuring the war most of the revenue gained by Auckland Rugby League was donated to the war efforts meaning they could not make much progress financially towards developing the game and facilities. In 1919 they once again raised 75 pounds to distribute to local charities nominated by the mayor. They also put on a match at the end of the season to raise money for the St. John Ambulance Brigade. Due to the large crowds at some of the matches, including the match with Australia it was anticipated that the league would gain over 1,000 pounds to establish a fund for obtaining a playing ground. This would of course be [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =An Eventful Season/Record Gate Receipts\n| page =10\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17291\n| date = 1919-10-15\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19191015.2.116\n| accessdate = 2020-02-10}}</ref>\n\n===Eden Ramblers No More===\nAt the Auckland Rugby League meeting on April 30 it was announced that the Eden Ramblers club had been disbanded.

In spite of this they still managed to win by 14 points to 9. Also the City team took the field with 6 juniors while Grafton had 2 juniors and played a man short.

\n===Round 10===\nRound 10 featured two rarities.

When matches were normally played at the same venue they all were played at the same time of 3pm on adjacent fields. In the 3rd match due to be played on the Domain the referee, F Thompson failed to turn up and after waiting for 40 minutes the decision was made to abandon the game. It was later revealed that he had been called away on an urgent business matter and had tried to contact the league but been unable to. The Auckland Rugby League accepted his explanation. The round was also significant for another reason. [[Craddock Dufty]] also debuted for Newton and kicked 2 conversions. He was to go on to represent New Zealand 12 times along with touring with the New Zealand Maori side.\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 3-3\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Maritime\n| try1 = A Cadman\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 = [[Bert Avery]]\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain 1\n| attendance =\n| referee = W Murray\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 1:30\n| home = Newton\n| score = 22-0\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = North Shore\n| try1 = [[George Iles]] 3, McSweeney 2, Condon\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 2\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n \n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 12 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = City\n| score = Abandoned\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =A Tight Struggle/Maritime 3, Ponsonby 3/Newton Vanquishes Shore\n| page =8\n| publisher =Auckland Star, Volume L, Issue 166\n| date = 1919-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19190714.2.96\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 =\n| con1 =\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 =\n| stadium = Auckland Domain\n| attendance =\n| referee = F Thompson (did not arrive)\n}}\n\n===Round 4 Postponed Match===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 20 July\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Ponsonby\n| score = 11-2\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Under League Rules/Ponsonby 11, Marist Old Boys 2/A Well Contested Game\n| page = 5\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17218\n| date = 1919-07-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190722.2.26\n| accessdate = 2020-02-12}}</ref>\n| away = Marist\n| try1 = E McGregor, A Cross, S Chatfield\n| con1 = Unknown x 1\n| pen1 =\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Unknown x 1\n| stadium = Victoria Park\n| attendance =\n| referee =\n}}\n\n==Roope Rooster Knockout Competition==\nThe round 1 match between [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] and [[Newton Rangers]] was abandoned towards the end with [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] leading by 12 points to 10 after [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby]] supporters encroached on the field in protest against the referee and refused to move back.

His physicians directed him to be sewed up in a sheet that had for a considerable time been steeped in strong distilled spirits, to recover the natural heat of his benumbed joints. The surgeon having sewed him up very close, and wanting a knife to cut off the thread, made use of a candle that was at hand to burn it off; but the flame from the thread reaching the sheet, the spirits wherewith it was wet immediately taking fire, burnt so vehemently, that no endeavours could extinguish the flame.

His physicians directed him to be sewed up in a sheet that had for a considerable time been steeped in strong distilled spirits, to recover the natural heat of his benumbed joints. The surgeon having sewed him up very close, and wanting a knife to cut off the thread, made use of a candle that was at hand to burn it off; but the flame from the thread reaching the sheet, the spirits wherewith it was wet immediately taking fire, burnt so vehemently, that no endeavours could extinguish the flame.

He spent most of his career in both the United States and France, having [[Multiple citizenship|dual]] [[French nationality law|French]] and [[United States nationality law#Dual citizenship|American]] citizenship.

At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.\n\nBecause of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the [[Mandelbrot set]] in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".<ref name=\"Wolfram\" /> His math and geometry-centered research career included contributions to such fields as [[statistical physics]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], [[anatomy]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[neurology]], [[linguistics]], [[information technology]], [[computer graphics]], [[economics]], [[geology]], [[medicine]], [[physical cosmology]], [[engineering]], [[chaos theory]], [[econophysics]], [[metallurgy]] and the [[social science]]s.<ref>list includes specific sciences mentioned in [[#Hudson|Hudson & Mandelbrot]], the Prelude, p.&nbsp;xvi, and p.&nbsp;26</ref>\n\nToward the end of his career, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of Mathematical Sciences at [[Yale University]], where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive tenure.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Olson | url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_11/mandelbrot.html |title=The Genius of the Unpredictable |publisher=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=November\u2013December 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2014| author-link=Steve Olson (writer) }}</ref> Mandelbrot also held positions at the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], [[Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France]], [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].

He developed several original approaches for modelling financial fluctuations.<ref>{{cite book |author= Rama Cont |title= Mandelbrot, Benoit |journal= Encyclopedia of Quantitative Finance |publisher= Wiley |date= 19 April 2010 |doi= 10.1002/9780470061602.eqf01006 |isbn = 9780470057568|author-link= Rama Cont }}</ref>\nIn his early work, he found that the price changes in [[financial market]]s did not follow a [[Gaussian distribution]], but rather [[Paul L\u00e9vy (mathematician)|L\u00e9vy]] [[stable distributions]] having infinite [[variance]].

Building on previous work by [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Pierre Fatou]], Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the [[Mandelbrot set]] which was introduced by him in 1979. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4qiEBNP4gC&printsec=frontcover ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature''], by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman & Co, 1982; {{isbn|0-7167-1186-9}}</ref> This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"[[Artifact (observational)|program artifacts]]\".\n\n[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking about the [[Mandelbrot set]], during his acceptance speech for the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 2006]]\n\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'' to describe these structures and first published his ideas, and later translated, ''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension''.<ref>''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'', by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman and Co, 1977; {{isbn|0-7167-0473-0}}</ref> According to computer scientist and physicist [[Stephen Wolfram]], the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics \u2026 to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before\".<ref name=Wolfram>Wolfram, Stephen.

No matter how close you look, they never get simpler, much as the section of a rocky coastline you can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space.<ref name=Wolfram />}}\n\nWolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, \"in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesco broccoli are two examples from nature.\"<ref name=Wolfram /> He points out an unexpected conclusion:\n\n{{quote|One might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would have been studied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphic computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like \"the delirious exuberance of the 1960s [[psychedelic art]] with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body\". He also saw himself as a \"would-be Kepler\", after the 17th-century scientist [[Johannes Kepler]], who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.<ref>Ivry, Benjamin.

He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|296}} Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:\n{{quote|The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer \u2026 bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling \u2026 and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|292}}}}\n\nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and [[stock market]] prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: <blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014Mandelbrot, in his introduction to ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''</blockquote>\n[[File:Mandel zoom 08 satellite antenna.jpg|thumb|right|Section of a Mandelbrot set]]\n\nMandelbrot has been called a work of art, and a visionary<ref name=\"RLD\">{{cite web|author=Devaney, Robert L.|authorlink= Robert L.

The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.\n\nMandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient, but not necessary]], resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.<ref>''Galaxy Map Hints at Fractal Universe'', by Amanda Gefter; New Scientist; 25 June 2008</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nMandelbrot's awards include the [[Wolf Prize]] for Physics in 1993, the [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] Prize of the [[European Geophysical Society]] in 2000, the [[Japan Prize]] in 2003,<ref name=jp>[http://www.japanprize.jp/en/laureates_by_year2000.html Laureates of the Japan Prize]. japanprize.jp</ref> and the Einstein Lectureship of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 2006.\n\nThe small asteroid [[27500 Mandelbrot]] was named in his honor.

At Harvard, following the publication of his study of U.S. commodity markets in relation to cotton futures, he taught economics and applied sciences.\n\nBecause of his access to IBM's computers, Mandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovery of the [[Mandelbrot set]] in 1980. He showed how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\".<ref name=\"Wolfram\" /> His math and geometry-centered research career included contributions to such fields as [[statistical physics]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]], [[geomorphology]], [[anatomy]], [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[neurology]], [[linguistics]], [[information technology]], [[computer graphics]], [[economics]], [[geology]], [[medicine]], [[physical cosmology]], [[engineering]], [[chaos theory]], [[econophysics]], [[metallurgy]] and the [[social science]]s.<ref>list includes specific sciences mentioned in [[#Hudson|Hudson & Mandelbrot]], the Prelude, p.&nbsp;xvi, and p.&nbsp;26</ref>\n\nToward the end of his career, he was [[Sterling Professor]] of Mathematical Sciences at [[Yale University]], where he was the oldest professor in Yale's history to receive tenure.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Olson | url=http://archives.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2004_11/mandelbrot.html |title=The Genius of the Unpredictable |publisher=Yale Alumni Magazine |date=November\u2013December 2004 |accessdate=22 July 2014| author-link=Steve Olson (writer) }}</ref> Mandelbrot also held positions at the [[Pacific Northwest National Laboratory]], [[Universit\u00e9 Lille Nord de France]], [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].

Building on previous work by [[Gaston Julia]] and [[Pierre Fatou]], Mandelbrot used a computer to plot images of the Julia sets. While investigating the topology of these Julia sets, he studied the [[Mandelbrot set]] which was introduced by him in 1979. In 1982, Mandelbrot expanded and updated his ideas in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ4qiEBNP4gC&printsec=frontcover ''The Fractal Geometry of Nature''], by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman & Co, 1982; {{isbn|0-7167-1186-9}}</ref> This influential work brought fractals into the mainstream of professional and popular mathematics, as well as silencing critics, who had dismissed fractals as \"[[Artifact (observational)|program artifacts]]\".\n\n[[File:Mandelbrot p1130876.jpg|thumb|right|Mandelbrot speaking about the [[Mandelbrot set]], during his acceptance speech for the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] in 2006]]\n\nIn 1975, Mandelbrot coined the term ''[[fractal]]'' to describe these structures and first published his ideas, and later translated, ''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension''.<ref>''Fractals: Form, Chance and Dimension'', by Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot; W H Freeman and Co, 1977; {{isbn|0-7167-0473-0}}</ref> According to computer scientist and physicist [[Stephen Wolfram]], the book was a \"breakthrough\" for Mandelbrot, who until then would typically \"apply fairly straightforward mathematics \u2026 to areas that had barely seen the light of serious mathematics before\".<ref name=Wolfram>Wolfram, Stephen.

No matter how close you look, they never get simpler, much as the section of a rocky coastline you can see at your feet looks just as jagged as the stretch you can see from space.<ref name=Wolfram />}}\n\nWolfram briefly describes fractals as a form of geometric repetition, \"in which smaller and smaller copies of a pattern are successively nested inside each other, so that the same intricate shapes appear no matter how much you zoom in to the whole. Fern leaves and Romanesco broccoli are two examples from nature.\"<ref name=Wolfram /> He points out an unexpected conclusion:\n\n{{quote|One might have thought that such a simple and fundamental form of regularity would have been studied for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

Using the newly developed IBM computers at his disposal, Mandelbrot was able to create fractal images using graphic computer code, images that an interviewer described as looking like \"the delirious exuberance of the 1960s [[psychedelic art]] with forms hauntingly reminiscent of nature and the human body\". He also saw himself as a \"would-be Kepler\", after the 17th-century scientist [[Johannes Kepler]], who calculated and described the orbits of the planets.<ref>Ivry, Benjamin.

The paper is one of Mandelbrot's first publications on the topic of fractals.<ref>\"Dr. Mandelbrot traced his work on fractals to a question he first encountered as a young researcher: how long is the coast of Britain?\": Benoit Mandelbrot (1967). \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/us/17mandelbrot.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1332064840-/vD0Sjafcl9t9BNghRf8Qw Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot, Novel Mathematician, Dies at 85]\", ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref name=\"Mandelbrot_Science_1967\">{{cite journal| title=How long is the coast of Britain?

He concluded that \"real roughness is often fractal and can be measured.\"<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|296}} Although Mandelbrot coined the term \"fractal\", some of the mathematical objects he presented in ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]'' had been previously described by other mathematicians. Before Mandelbrot, however, they were regarded as isolated curiosities with unnatural and non-intuitive properties. Mandelbrot brought these objects together for the first time and turned them into essential tools for the long-stalled effort to extend the scope of science to explaining non-smooth, \"rough\" objects in the real world. His methods of research were both old and new:\n{{quote|The form of geometry I increasingly favored is the oldest, most concrete, and most inclusive, specifically empowered by the eye and helped by the hand and, today, also by the computer \u2026 bringing an element of unity to the worlds of knowing and feeling \u2026 and, unwittingly, as a bonus, for the purpose of creating beauty.<ref name=Mandelbrot />{{rp|292}}}}\n\nFractals are also found in human pursuits, such as music, painting, architecture, and [[stock market]] prices. Mandelbrot believed that fractals, far from being unnatural, were in many ways more intuitive and natural than the artificially smooth objects of traditional [[Euclidean geometry]]: <blockquote>Clouds are not spheres, mountains are not cones, coastlines are not circles, and bark is not smooth, nor does lightning travel in a straight line.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2014Mandelbrot, in his introduction to ''[[The Fractal Geometry of Nature]]''</blockquote>\n[[File:Mandel zoom 08 satellite antenna.jpg|thumb|right|Section of a Mandelbrot set]]\n\nMandelbrot has been called a work of art, and a visionary<ref name=\"RLD\">{{cite web|author=Devaney, Robert L.|authorlink= Robert L.

The book sparked widespread popular interest in fractals and contributed to chaos theory and other fields of science and mathematics.\n\nMandelbrot also put his ideas to work in cosmology. He offered in 1974 a new explanation of [[Olbers' paradox]] (the \"dark night sky\" riddle), demonstrating the consequences of fractal theory as a [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient, but not necessary]], resolution of the paradox. He postulated that if the [[star]]s in the universe were fractally distributed (for example, like [[Cantor dust]]), it would not be necessary to rely on the [[Big Bang]] theory to explain the paradox. His model would not rule out a Big Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if the Big Bang had not occurred.<ref>''Galaxy Map Hints at Fractal Universe'', by Amanda Gefter; New Scientist; 25 June 2008</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nMandelbrot's awards include the [[Wolf Prize]] for Physics in 1993, the [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] Prize of the [[European Geophysical Society]] in 2000, the [[Japan Prize]] in 2003,<ref name=jp>[http://www.japanprize.jp/en/laureates_by_year2000.html Laureates of the Japan Prize]. japanprize.jp</ref> and the Einstein Lectureship of the [[American Mathematical Society]] in 2006.\n\nThe small asteroid [[27500 Mandelbrot]] was named in his honor.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J.

Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n===Murugan god of fertility & Forming===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

The annual festival involved the construction of \"Osiris Beds\" formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed.<ref>Teeter, Emily (2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt''.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]].

Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.

Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n''Ptah-Seker'' (who resulted from the identification of Creator god [[Ptah]] with [[Seker]]) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming '''Ptah-Seker-Osiris'''. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Murugan god of fertility & Forming===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

The annual festival involved the construction of \"Osiris Beds\" formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed.<ref>Teeter, Emily (2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt''.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

The Stela of Ikhernofret recounts the programme of events of the public elements over the five days of the Festival:\n* ''The First Day, The Procession of [[Wepwawet]]'': A mock battle was enacted during which the enemies of Osiris are defeated. A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]].

Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.
