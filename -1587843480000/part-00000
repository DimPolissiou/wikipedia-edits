The only battle to take place in Charlottesville was the [[Battle of Rio Hill|skirmish at Rio Hill]], an encounter in which [[George Armstrong Custer]] briefly engaged local [[Confederate Home Guard]]<nowiki/>s before retreating. A year later, the Charlottesville Factory, founded c. 1820\u201330, was accidentally burnt during General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s 1865 raid through the Shenandoah Valley, although the mayor had surrendered the city to Generals Custer and Sheridan to keep the town from being burned. The factory had been taken over by the Confederacy and used to manufacture woolen clothing for the soldiers. It caught fire when some coals taken by Union troops to burn the nearby railroad bridge dropped on the floor. The factory was rebuilt immediately and was known as the Woolen Mills until its liquidation in 1962.<ref name=\"MonicaCalif.)1998\">{{cite book\n|author1=Museum of African American Art (Santa Monica, Calif.)\n|author2=Hampton University (Va.)

The stadium hosted large musical events, including concerts by the [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[U2]].\n\n[[John Paul Jones Arena]], which opened in 2006, is the home arena of the Cavalier [[Virginia Cavaliers basketball|basketball]] teams, in addition to serving as a site for concerts and other events. The arena seats 14,593 for basketball. In its first season in the new arena concluded in March 2007, the Virginia men's basketball team tied with [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] for 1st in the ACC. Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball won the ACC outright in the 2013\u201314 season, as well as the [[2014 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|2014 ACC Tournament]]. The team finished the season ranked #3 in the AP poll before losing to [[Tom Izzo]]'s [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Spartans]] by two points in the Sweet Sixteen held in Brooklyn, New York.\n\n[[Lacrosse]] has become a significant part of the Charlottesville sports scene. The Virginia Men's team won their first [[NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Championship]] in 1972; in 2006, they won their fourth National Championship and were the first team to finish undefeated in 17 games (then a record for wins). The team won its fifth National Championship in 2011. Virginia's Women's team has three [[NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship|NCAA Championships]] to its credit, with wins in 1991, 1993, and 2004. The soccer program is also strong; the Men's team shared a national title with Santa Clara in 1989 and won an unprecedented four consecutive NCAA Division I Championships (1991\u20131994). Their coach during that period was [[Bruce Arena]], who later won two MLS titles at D.C. United and coached the U.S. National Team during the 2002 and 2006 World Cups. The Virginia Men's soccer team won the NCAA Championship again in both [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2009]] and [[2014 NCAA Division I Men's Soccer Championship|2014]] under coach [[George Gelnovatch]]. Virginia's [[baseball]] team, has enjoyed a resurgence in recent years, under Head Coach Brian O'Connor, after hosting several regionals and Super Regionals in the post-season, and playing in the 2009, 2011, and [[2014 College World Series]]. They finished as runners-up in the 2014 edition, despite outscoring [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] 17\u201312 in the three-game series. The team then avenged this loss the following year, beating Vanderbilt in 2015 for its first NCAA baseball title.\n\nCharlottesville area high school sports have been prominent throughout the state. Charlottesville is a hotbed for lacrosse in the country, with teams such as [[St. Anne's-Belfield School]], [[The Covenant School (Virginia)|The Covenant School]], [[Tandem Friends School]], [[Charlottesville Catholic School]], [[Charlottesville High School]], [[Western Albemarle High School]] and [[Albemarle High School (Virginia)|Albemarle High School]].

I-64 heads east to [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and west to [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|Interstate 81]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. US 29 heads southwest towards [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and northeast to [[Washington, D.C.]] Other highways serving Charlottesville include [[U.S. Route 250 in Virginia|U.S. Route 250]] and [[Virginia State Route 20]]. US 29 and US 250 are served locally by bypasses around downtown, with business routes passing directly through downtown.\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Cville bus Station (4904743457).jpg|thumb|right|Bus Transit Center in downtown Charlottesville (2013)]]\nCharlottesville is served by [[Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport]], the [[Charlottesville (Amtrak station)|Charlottesville Amtrak Station]], and a [[Greyhound Lines]] intercity bus terminal. Direct bus service to [[New York City]] is also provided by the [[Starlight Express (bus)|Starlight Express]]. [[Charlottesville Area Transit]] provides area bus service, augmented by JAUNT, a regional [[paratransit]] van service. [[University Transit Service]] provides mass transit for students and residents in the vicinity of the University of Virginia.\n\n=====Rail=====\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service, provides service to Charlottesville with three routes: The [[Cardinal (train)|''Cardinal'']] (service between Chicago and New York City via central Virginia and Washington, D.C.), select ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' trains (service between Boston and Roanoke) and the [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']] (service between New York City and New Orleans). The ''Cardinal'' operates three times a week, while the ''Crescent'' and ''Northeast Regional'' both run daily in both directions.\n\nCharlottesville was once a major rail hub, served by both the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) and the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]]. The first train service to Charlottesville began in the early 1850s by the Louisa Railroad Company, which became the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] before becoming the C&O. The Southern Railway started service to Charlottesville around the mid-1860s with a north\u2013south route crossing the C&O east-west tracks. The new depot that sprang up at the crossing of the two tracks was called Union Station. In addition to the new rail line, Southern located a major repair shop that produced competition between the two rail companies and bolstered the local economy. The Queen Charlotte Hotel went up on West Main street along with restaurants for the many new railroad workers.\n\nThe former C&O station on East Water Street was turned into offices in the mid-1990s. [[Charlottesville Union Station]], still a functional depot for Amtrak, is located on West Main street between 7th and 9th streets where the tracks of the former C&O Railway (leased by C&O successor [[CSX]] to [[Buckingham Branch Railroad]]) and Southern (now [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]) lines cross. Amtrak and the city of Charlottesville finished refurbishing the station just after 2000, upgrading the depot and adding a full-service restaurant. The Amtrak Crescent travels on Norfolk Southern's dual north\u2013south tracks. The Amtrak Cardinal runs on the Buckingham Branch east-west single track, which follows [[U.S. Route 250]] from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to a point east of Charlottesville near Cismont. The eastbound Cardinal joins the northbound Norfolk Southern line at [[Orange, Virginia|Orange]], on its way to Washington, D.C.\n\nCharlottesville also had an electric streetcar line, the [[Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway]] (C&A), that operated during the early twentieth century. Streetcar lines existed in Charlottesville since the late 1880s under various names until organized as the C&A in 1903. The C&A operated streetcars until 1935, when the line shut down due to rising costs and decreased ridership.\n\nThere are proposals to extend [[Virginia Railway Express]], the [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line connecting [[Northern Virginia]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], to Charlottesville.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cvillerail.org\n | title= CvilleRail\n | accessdate = February 24, 2008\n}}</ref> Also, the [[Transdominion Express]] steering committee has suggested making Charlottesville a stop on the proposed statewide passenger rail line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdxinfo.org/proposed-route-map/ |title=TransDominion Express Route Map |publisher=The Committee to Advance The TransDominion Express |accessdate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Charlottesville, Virginia}}\nSince the city's early formation, it has been home to numerous notable individuals, from historic figures [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], to literary giants [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Faulkner]], to NFL player [[Ralph Horween]]. In the present day, Charlottesville's Albemarle County is or has been the home of movie stars [[Rob Lowe]], [[Sissy Spacek]], [[Jessica Lange]] and [[Sam Shepard]], novelist [[John Grisham]], the poet [[Rita Dove]], the [[Dave Matthews Band]], and the pop band [[Parachute (band)|Parachute]], as well as multi-billionaires [[John Kluge]] and [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.]] Between 1968 and 1984, Charlottesville was also the home of [[Anna Anderson]], best known for her false claims to be [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] and lone survivor of the 1918 massacre of [[Nicholas II]]'s royal family. \n\nThe city was also home of the Tibetan lama [[Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche]], but he and his family have since moved to California.

The only battle to take place in Charlottesville was the [[Battle of Rio Hill|skirmish at Rio Hill]], an encounter in which [[George Armstrong Custer]] briefly engaged local [[Confederate Home Guard]]<nowiki/>s before retreating. A year later, the Charlottesville Factory, founded c. 1820\u201330, was accidentally burnt during General [[Philip Sheridan]]'s 1865 raid through the Shenandoah Valley, although the mayor had surrendered the city to Generals Custer and Sheridan to keep the town from being burned. The factory had been taken over by the Confederacy and used to manufacture woolen clothing for the soldiers.

I-64 heads east to [[Interstate 95 in Virginia|Interstate 95]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and west to [[Interstate 81 in Virginia|Interstate 81]] in [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]]. US 29 heads southwest towards [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]] and northeast to [[Washington, D.C.]] Other highways serving Charlottesville include [[U.S. Route 250 in Virginia|U.S. Route 250]] and [[Virginia State Route 20]]. US 29 and US 250 are served locally by bypasses around downtown, with business routes passing directly through downtown.\n\n====Public transportation====\n[[File:Cville bus Station (4904743457).jpg|thumb|right|Bus Transit Center in downtown Charlottesville (2013)]]\nCharlottesville is served by [[Charlottesville-Albemarle Airport]], the [[Charlottesville (Amtrak station)|Charlottesville Amtrak Station]], and a [[Greyhound Lines]] intercity bus terminal. Direct bus service to [[New York City]] is also provided by the [[Starlight Express (bus)|Starlight Express]]. [[Charlottesville Area Transit]] provides area bus service, augmented by JAUNT, a regional [[paratransit]] van service. [[University Transit Service]] provides mass transit for students and residents in the vicinity of the University of Virginia.\n\n=====Rail=====\n[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service, provides service to Charlottesville with three routes: The [[Cardinal (train)|''Cardinal'']] (service between Chicago and New York City via central Virginia and Washington, D.C.), select ''[[Northeast Regional]]'' trains (service between Boston and Roanoke) and the [[Crescent (Amtrak)|''Crescent'']] (service between New York City and New Orleans). The ''Cardinal'' operates three times a week, while the ''Crescent'' and ''Northeast Regional'' both run daily in both directions.\n\nCharlottesville was once a major rail hub, served by both the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] (C&O) and the [[Southern Railway (US)|Southern Railway]]. The first train service to Charlottesville began in the early 1850s by the Louisa Railroad Company, which became the [[Virginia Central Railroad]] before becoming the C&O. The Southern Railway started service to Charlottesville around the mid-1860s with a north\u2013south route crossing the C&O east-west tracks. The new depot that sprang up at the crossing of the two tracks was called Union Station. In addition to the new rail line, Southern located a major repair shop that produced competition between the two rail companies and bolstered the local economy. The Queen Charlotte Hotel went up on West Main street along with restaurants for the many new railroad workers.\n\nThe former C&O station on East Water Street was turned into offices in the mid-1990s. [[Charlottesville Union Station]], still a functional depot for Amtrak, is located on West Main street between 7th and 9th streets where the tracks of the former C&O Railway (leased by C&O successor [[CSX]] to [[Buckingham Branch Railroad]]) and Southern (now [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]) lines cross. Amtrak and the city of Charlottesville finished refurbishing the station just after 2000, upgrading the depot and adding a full-service restaurant. The Amtrak Crescent travels on Norfolk Southern's dual north\u2013south tracks. The Amtrak Cardinal runs on the Buckingham Branch east-west single track, which follows [[U.S. Route 250]] from [[Staunton, Virginia|Staunton]] to a point east of Charlottesville near Cismont. The eastbound Cardinal joins the northbound Norfolk Southern line at [[Orange, Virginia|Orange]], on its way to Washington, D.C.\n\nCharlottesville also had an electric streetcar line, the [[Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway]] (C&A), that operated during the early twentieth century. Streetcar lines existed in Charlottesville since the late 1880s under various names until organized as the C&A in 1903. The C&A operated streetcars until 1935, when the line shut down due to rising costs and decreased ridership.\n\nThere are proposals to extend [[Virginia Railway Express]], the [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] line connecting [[Northern Virginia]] to [[Washington, D.C.]], to Charlottesville.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://www.cvillerail.org\n | title= CvilleRail\n | accessdate = February 24, 2008\n}}</ref> Also, the [[Transdominion Express]] steering committee has suggested making Charlottesville a stop on the proposed statewide passenger rail line.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tdxinfo.org/proposed-route-map/ |title=TransDominion Express Route Map |publisher=The Committee to Advance The TransDominion Express |accessdate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Charlottesville, Virginia}}\nSince the city's early formation, it has been home to numerous notable individuals, from historic figures [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[James Monroe]], to literary giants [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William Faulkner]], to NFL player [[Ralph Horween]].

If appropriate responses are not obtained within these times, another NSAID should be tried.<ref>{{cite web |title=Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs|url=https://bnf.nice.org.uk/treatment-summary/non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory-drugs.html|publisher=British National Formulary|access-date=August 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Contraindications==\nNSAIDs may be used with caution by people with the following conditions:<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* [[Irritable bowel syndrome]]<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Persons who are over age 50, and who have a family history of GI (gastrointestinal) problems<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Persons who have had past GI problems from NSAID use<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n\nNSAIDs should usually be avoided by people with the following conditions:<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Peptic ulcer disease|Peptic ulcer]] or stomach bleeding<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Uncontrolled [[hypertension]]<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* [[Kidney disease]]<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* People that suffer with [[inflammatory bowel disease]] (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis)<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Past [[transient ischemic attack]] (excluding [[aspirin]])<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Past [[stroke]] (excluding [[aspirin]])<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Past [[myocardial infarction]] (excluding [[aspirin]])<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* [[Coronary artery disease]] (excluding [[aspirin]])<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Undergoing [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* [[Congestive heart failure]] (excluding low-dose aspirin)<ref name=\"Danelich2015\">{{cite journal |last1=Danelich |first1=IM |last2=Wright |first2=SS |last3=Lose |first3=JM |last4=Tefft |first4=BJ |last5=Cicci |first5=JD |last6=Reed |first6=BN |title=Safety of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs in patients with cardiovascular disease |journal=Pharmacotherapy |date=May 2015 |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=520\u201335 |doi=10.1002/phar.1584 |pmid=25940579}}</ref>\n* In third trimester of pregnancy<ref name=\"BBDNSAIDs\"/>\n* Persons who have undergone [[gastric bypass surgery]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Predictors of endoscopic findings after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass |pmid=17032183 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2006.00770.x |vauthors=Wilson JA, Romagnuolo J, Byrne TK, Morgan K, Wilson FA |journal=Am J Gastroenterol |year=2006 |volume=101 |issue=10 |pages=2194\u20132199|doi-broken-date=2020-03-10 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Long Term Medical Issues associated after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Procedure (RYGBP) |url=http://www.ssmhealth.com/weightloss/documents/infosheet-pcp-longterm-medissues.pdf |work=SSMHealth |access-date=18 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061302/http://www.ssmhealth.com/weightloss/documents/infosheet-pcp-longterm-medissues.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n* Persons who have a history of allergic or allergic-type [[NSAID hypersensitivity reactions]], e.g. [[aspirin-induced asthma]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |title= Classification and practical approach to the diagnosis and management of hypersensitivity to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs |vauthors= Kowalski ML, Asero R, Bavbek S, Blanca M, Blanca-Lopez N, Bochenek G, Brockow K, Campo P, Celik G, Cernadas J, Cortellini G, Gomes E, Ni\u017cankowska-Mogilnicka E, Romano A, Szczeklik A, Testi S, Torres MJ, W\u00f6hrl S, Makowska J |display-authors= 6 |journal= Allergy |year= 2013 |volume= 68 |issue= 10 |pages= 1219\u201332 |doi= 10.1111/all.12260 |pmid= 24117484}}</ref>\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Adverse effects==\nThe widespread use of NSAIDs has meant that the adverse effects of these drugs have become increasingly common.

The mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow. Prostaglandins normally dilate the [[afferent arteriole]]s of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]]. This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR), an indicator of [[renal function|kidney function]]. This is particularly important in kidney failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels. At these elevated levels, angiotensin II also constricts the afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it normally constricts. Since NSAIDs block this prostaglandin-mediated effect of afferent arteriole dilation, particularly in kidney failure, NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased RPF (renal perfusion flow) and GFR.\n\nCommon ADRs associated with altered kidney function include:<ref name=\"isbn0-9757919-2-3\"/>\n* [[Sodium in biology|Sodium]] and fluid retention\n* [[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure)\n\nThese agents may also cause kidney impairment, especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents.

However, the majority are prepared as [[racemic mixture]]s. Typically, only a single [[enantiomer]] is pharmacologically active. For some drugs (typically profens), an [[isomerase]] [[enzyme]] ''in vivo'' converts the inactive enantiomer into the active form, although its activity varies widely in individuals. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma concentration observed in older studies when specific analysis of the active enantiomer was not performed.\n\n[[Ibuprofen]] and [[ketoprofen]] are now available in single-enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. [[Naproxen]] has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.\n\n===Main practical differences===\nNSAIDs within a group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability. There is little difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent doses.<ref name=dean/> Rather, differences among compounds usually relate to dosing regimens (related to the compound's [[elimination half-life]]), route of administration, and tolerability profile.\n\nRegarding adverse effects, selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s have lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref name=dean>{{cite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45590/ |title=Comparing NSAIDs \u2013 PubMed Clinical Q&A |work=NCBI Bookshelf |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |author=Dean L |quote= Summaries of key questions from the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP), Oregon Health & Science University |date=May 2011}}</ref> With the exception of [[naproxen]], nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of having a heart attack.<ref name=dean/> Some data also supports that the partially selective [[nabumetone]] is less likely to cause gastrointestinal events.<ref name=dean/>\n\nA consumer report noted that [[ibuprofen]], naproxen, and [[salsalate]] are less expensive than other NSAIDs, and essentially as effective and safe when used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/Nsaids2.pdf Treating Osteoarthritis and Pain: The Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Comparing Effectiveness, Safety, and Price]\nConsumers Union 2005 {{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nMost nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are weak acids, with a pKa of 3\u20135. They are absorbed well from the [[stomach]] and intestinal mucosa. They are highly protein-bound in plasma (typically >95%), usually to [[human serum albumin|albumin]], so that their [[volume of distribution]] typically approximates to plasma volume. Most NSAIDs are metabolized in the [[liver]] by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically are excreted in the [[urine]], though some drugs are partially excreted in [[bile]]. Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease states, and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage.\n\nIbuprofen and diclofenac have short half-lives (2\u20133 hours). Some NSAIDs (typically oxicams) have very long half-lives (e.g. 20\u201360 hours).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bayer Aspirin ad, NYT, February 19, 1917.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the first advertisements for Bayer Aspirin, published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1917]]\nFrom the era of Greek medicine to the mid-19th century, the discovery of medicinal agents was classed as an [[empirical evidence|empirical]] art; folklore and mythological guidance were combined in deploying the vegetable and mineral products that made up the expansive pharmacopeia of the time.

The mechanism of these kidney ADRs is due to changes in kidney blood flow. Prostaglandins normally dilate the [[afferent arteriole]]s of the [[glomerulus|glomeruli]]. This helps maintain normal glomerular perfusion and [[glomerular filtration rate]] (GFR), an indicator of [[renal function|kidney function]]. This is particularly important in kidney failure where the kidney is trying to maintain renal perfusion pressure by elevated angiotensin II levels. At these elevated levels, angiotensin II also constricts the afferent arteriole into the glomerulus in addition to the efferent arteriole it normally constricts. Since NSAIDs block this prostaglandin-mediated effect of afferent arteriole dilation, particularly in kidney failure, NSAIDs cause unopposed constriction of the afferent arteriole and decreased RPF (renal perfusion flow) and GFR.\n\nCommon ADRs associated with altered kidney function include:<ref name=\"isbn0-9757919-2-3\"/>\n* [[Sodium in biology|Sodium]] and fluid retention\n* [[Hypertension]] (high blood pressure)\n\nThese agents may also cause kidney impairment, especially in combination with other nephrotoxic agents.

Afflicted individuals may be abnormally sensitive to these provocative metabolites or overproduce them and typically are susceptible to a wide range of structurally dissimilar NSAIDs, particularly those that inhibit COX1.

However, the majority are prepared as [[racemic mixture]]s. Typically, only a single [[enantiomer]] is pharmacologically active. For some drugs (typically profens), an [[isomerase]] [[enzyme]] ''in vivo'' converts the inactive enantiomer into the active form, although its activity varies widely in individuals. This phenomenon is likely responsible for the poor correlation between NSAID efficacy and plasma concentration observed in older studies when specific analysis of the active enantiomer was not performed.\n\n[[Ibuprofen]] and [[ketoprofen]] are now available in single-enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. [[Naproxen]] has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.\n\n===Main practical differences===\nNSAIDs within a group tend to have similar characteristics and tolerability. There is little difference in clinical efficacy among the NSAIDs when used at equivalent doses.<ref name=dean/> Rather, differences among compounds usually relate to dosing regimens (related to the compound's [[elimination half-life]]), route of administration, and tolerability profile.\n\nRegarding adverse effects, selective [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s have lower risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.<ref name=dean>{{cite book |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK45590/ |title=Comparing NSAIDs \u2013 PubMed Clinical Q&A |work=NCBI Bookshelf |publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine |author=Dean L |quote= Summaries of key questions from the Drug Effectiveness Review Project (DERP), Oregon Health & Science University |date=May 2011}}</ref> With the exception of [[naproxen]], nonselective NSAIDs increase the risk of having a heart attack.<ref name=dean/> Some data also supports that the partially selective [[nabumetone]] is less likely to cause gastrointestinal events.<ref name=dean/>\n\nA consumer report noted that [[ibuprofen]], naproxen, and [[salsalate]] are less expensive than other NSAIDs, and essentially as effective and safe when used appropriately to treat osteoarthritis and pain.<ref>[http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/Nsaids2.pdf Treating Osteoarthritis and Pain: The Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs Comparing Effectiveness, Safety, and Price]\nConsumers Union 2005 {{dead link|date=July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Pharmacokinetics==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nMost nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are weak acids, with a pKa of 3\u20135. They are absorbed well from the [[stomach]] and intestinal mucosa. They are highly protein-bound in plasma (typically >95%), usually to [[human serum albumin|albumin]], so that their [[volume of distribution]] typically approximates to plasma volume. Most NSAIDs are metabolized in the [[liver]] by oxidation and conjugation to inactive metabolites that typically are excreted in the [[urine]], though some drugs are partially excreted in [[bile]]. Metabolism may be abnormal in certain disease states, and accumulation may occur even with normal dosage.\n\nIbuprofen and diclofenac have short half-lives (2\u20133 hours). Some NSAIDs (typically oxicams) have very long half-lives (e.g. 20\u201360 hours).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bayer Aspirin ad, NYT, February 19, 1917.jpg|thumb|200px|right|One of the first advertisements for Bayer Aspirin, published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1917]]\nFrom the era of Greek medicine to the mid-19th century, the discovery of medicinal agents was classed as an [[empirical evidence|empirical]] art; folklore and mythological guidance were combined in deploying the vegetable and mineral products that made up the expansive pharmacopeia of the time.
