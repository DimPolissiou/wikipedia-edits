She was a [[Victory ship]] design type.  ''Lanier'' was named for [[Lanier County, Georgia]], which was named for poet [[Sidney Lanier]].\n\n== World War II Service ==\n''Lanier'' was laid down 25 June 1944 by the [[California Shipbuilding Corporation]], [[Wilmington, California]], under a [[Maritime Commission]] contract.  She was a VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type and her yard number was TR 8 and her hull number was MCV 39.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://usmm.org/victoryard.html |title= Victory Ships built by the United States Maritime Commission during World War II |accessdate=6 August 2006}}</ref>  She was launched 29 August 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Earl English; acquired by the Navy 22 December 1944; and commissioned the same day at [[Oakland, California]], Comdr.

Loaded with 1,485 soldiers, she got underway 28 March and steamed in convoy with 11 other transports and five merchantmen for the [[Volcano Islands]]. Touching [[Eniwetok]] and [[Saipan]], she reached [[Iwo Jima]] 20 April and discharged men and cargo. She returned to Saipan 22 to 24 April, took on board equipment and 1,442 troops, then sailed to [[Okinawa]] 2 to 6 May. There she landed reinforcements and embarked 66 battle casualties before returning to Saipan 8 to 13 May.

The civilian harbor pilot entered the harbor too fast, turned to avoid a collision with a passenger ferry and ran between a barge and its tug. The collision sunk the barge, injured a civilian and sustained damage to the bow and forward ballast tanks. She was put in dry dock for repairs until 2 June, embarked 1,442 troops, and departed 12 June for the Far East. She sailed via Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and [[Ulithi]] and reached Okinawa 24 July. She operated off Okinawa until 6 August, then carried 798 passengers via Ulithi to [[Guam]], where she arrived the 14th. She embarked over 1,300 occupation troops the following day and sailed as part of [[Task Force 31]] for occupation landings on Japan. She anchored in [[Sagami Wan]] 27 August, and during midwatch 30 August entered [[Tokyo Bay]] to begin landing operations off [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka|Yokosuka]]. Her [[landing craft]] carried troops in the first wave and landed them at [[Yokosuka naval airfield|Yokosuka Airport]] at 0920. Steaming to Saipan 1 to 5 September, ''Lanier'' embarked [[U.S. Marines|marines]] of the [[U.S. 2nd Marine Division|2d Division]] and carried them to [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]], 18 to 23 September.\n\nSailing in [[convoy]] 26 September, ''Lanier'' reached [[Manila Bay]], [[Luzon]], 1 October and joined the [[Operation Magic Carpet (World War II)|\u201cMagic Carpet\u201d]] fleet. She proceeded to Saipan 16 to 21 October, embarked 1,851 homewardbound veterans, and departed the 22d for Seattle, Wash., where she arrived 4 November. On 28 November she departed once more for the southwest Pacific. Reaching [[New Guinea]] 17 December, she embarked 1,598 troops at [[Jayapura|Hollandia]], 532 troops at [[Finschhafen]], and departed 21 December for the west coast. She arrived [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]] 6 January 1946. ''Lanier'' sailed for the east coast 19 January 1946, and reached [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] 4 February.

Specifically, the Origin Suite was composed for this CD as a ''tour de force'' to showcase Waldrop. Most notably the CD received 4 of 5 stars by music critic and author [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]] in the April 2018 edition of ''[[Jazz Journal]]'' from [[London]].<ref name = \"JOURNAL\"> [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]].

They agreed and this time a wider set of music was used though still employing [[Jack Cooper (American musician)|Jack Cooper]] as the primary writer and arranger for the new project.    Another substantial grant ($10,000) was obtained by Waldrop from [[Eastern Washington University]] to doing a CD.\n\nThe ''Origin Suite'' (title work) is inspired by three paintings by artist [[Wifredo Lam]]: ''La Jungla'', ''Nativit\u00e9'', ''Al Final De La Noche''.  Lam's paintings are primitive and earthy in approach and draw on [[Caribbean]] and [[Central Africa|Central African]] themes related to [[Santer\u00eda]] and [[Cuban Vod\u00fa]] culture.\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = Origin Suite I: La Jungla \n| writer1 = [[Jack Cooper (American musician)|Jack Cooper]]/Michael Waldrop (arr.

They agreed and this time a wider set of music was used though still employing [[Jack Cooper (musician)|Jack Cooper]] as the primary writer and arranger for the new project.    Another substantial grant ($10,000) was obtained by Waldrop from [[Eastern Washington University]] to doing a CD.\n\nThe ''Origin Suite'' (title work) is inspired by three paintings by artist [[Wifredo Lam]]: ''La Jungla'', ''Nativit\u00e9'', ''Al Final De La Noche''.
