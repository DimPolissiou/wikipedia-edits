With a population of about 76,655 it is the sixth-largest city in Slovakia. Nitra is also one of the oldest cities in Slovakia; it was the political center of the [[Principality of Nitra]]. Today, it is a seat of a ''[[Regions of Slovakia|kraj]]'' ([[Nitra Region]])  and an ''[[Districts of Slovakia|okres]]'' ([[Nitra District]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first mention of Nitra dates back to the 9th century. The name of the city is derived from the [[Nitra river]]. The name is [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], but the question of its [[History of Proto-Slavic#Pre-Slavic|pre-Slavic]] or [[Slavic people|Slavic]] origin has not been satisfactorily answered. Nitra might be derived from the old Indo-European root ''neit-'', ''nit-'' meaning \"to cut\" or \"to burn\" using a derivation element ''-r-'' (see also [[slash-and-burn]]  agricultural technique).{{sfn|Ondru\u0161|200|p=15}} The same root is still present in the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] verb ''nieti\u0165'' (to make a fire), but also in other Indo-European languages like [[Latin]] ''nitere'' (to burn) or in [[German language|German]] ''schneiden'' (to cut).{{sfn|Ondru\u0161|200|p=14}} Another view to the origin of the name is related to the [[Latin]] ''Novi-iter'' or ''Neui-iter'' meaning \"new territory behind the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]\".{{sfn|Hladk\u00fd|2008|p=78}} The hypothetical Latin name could be adopted by the [[Quadi]] and later by the [[Slavs]].\n\nThe first written records contain also suffix ''-ava'' (Nitrava). Particularly in older literature, the suffix is interpreted as deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''*ahwa'' (water).{{sfn|Z\u00e1vodn\u00fd|2008|p=48}} However, the suffix ''-ava'' can be found also in numerous toponyms with a clearly Slavic origin and without any relationship to rivers. Although, the existence of hydronym Nitrava remains hypothetical{{sfn|Hladk\u00fd|2008|p=79}} and all versions with the suffix are related to a location, not a river. Thus, the form Nitrava can refer to a larger property or territory around the river Nitra.{{sfn|Z\u00e1vodn\u00fd|2008|p=50}} Both forms were probably used concurrently and were recorded already in the 9th century {{sfn|Ondru\u0161|200|p=15}} ([[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]]: \"in loco vocata\nNitraua\", but in 880 \"ecclesie Nitrensis\").\n\nThe name in different languages includes {{lang-la|Nitria}}; {{lang-de|Neutra}} ({{Audio|De-Neutra.ogg|pronunciation}}); {{lang-hu|Nyitra}} and ''{{lang|hu|Nyitria}}''.\n\n==History==\nNitra is the oldest city in Slovakia.\n[[File:Mesto Nitra.jpg|thumb|Nitra from Zobor]]\n\n===Before the 5th century===\nThe oldest archaeological findings in Nitra are dated to around 25,000-30,000 years ago. The locality has been inhabited in all historical periods in the last 5,000-7,000 years.{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=27}} Several European archaeological cultures and groups were named after important archaeological discoveries in Nitra or near surroundings - Nitra culture, Brodzany-Nitra group or Lu\u017eianky group of [[Lengyel culture]].\n\nThe people of Madarovce culture had built the first fortification on [[Nitra Castle|Castle Hill]] by around 1,600 BCE. In the Iron Age, a large [[hillfort]]  was built on Zobor Hill and additional smaller hillforts on the Lupka Hill and in Dra\u017eovce (700-500 BCE).{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=27}} Several Celtic settlements are known from the 5th-1st centuries. The Celts minted silver [[tetradrachm]]s known as coins of Nitra type and probably also built a hillfort in the locality Na V\u0155\u0161ku.{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=27}} In the Roman period (1st-4th centuries CE), the Germanic tribe of [[Quadi]] settled in the area, which is also mentioned as their possible capital (396 CE). The largest Germanic settlement from the migration period in Slovakia was unearthed in Nitra-P\u00e1rovsk\u00e9 H\u00e1je.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=4}}\n\n===5th to 10th centuries===\nThe first [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] arrived to Slovakia at the end of the 5th and early 6th century.{{sfn|Fusek|1994|p=93}} The early Slavs settled mainly in the lowlands near the water flows, the highest density of their settlements is documented just in the area of Nitra.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=11}} As the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] expanded to the territory of Slovakia in the latter half of the [[7th century]] and early [[8th century]], the border between Slavic and Slavo-Avaric territory moved toward Nitra. A biritual cemetery in Nitra-Doln\u00e9 Kr\u0161kany lay on the northern border of mixed settlement area.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012a|p=13}}\n\nThe importance of Nitra for the Slavs began to grow in the 8th century and thereafter it evolved to administrative centre of the wider region.{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=28}} Nitra became the center of the [[Principality of Nitra]]. Three of the eleven extant copies of the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]] contains a reference to a church consecrated for Pribina in his domain called Nitrava. The problem of Pribina's church and the dating of this event was addressed by numerous scholars, most of them have no doubt about reliability of information and associates this event with Nitra.{{sfn|Ivani\u010d|2008|p=68}} In 833, Pribina was ousted by the Moravian prince [[Mojm\u00edr I]] and both regions were united into the early medieval empire of [[Great Moravia]].\n\nIn the 9th century, Nitra was one of the largest agglomeration in Central Europe.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=13}} The agglomeration consisted of fortified centres and more than twenty non-fortified villages.{{sfn|Botek|2014|p=91}} It spread out on a territory exceeding the present town. The Slavs, Slovak ancestors, built a large castle (8.5 hectares) on Castle Hill,{{sfn|Tur\u010dan|2013|p=63}} further important locations Na v\u0155\u0161ku and Martinsk\u00fd Vrch were probably also fortified.{{sfn|\u0160alkovsk\u00fd|2012|p=53}} Other hills, some of them fortified already in prehistoric times, had guarding and refuge function. Surrounding villages were used as an agricultural hinterland for princely retinue and for specialised production (jewellery production, forges, pottery kilns, etc.). More than forty burial sites are documented on 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2004|p=50}} In all burial sites, exclusively inhumation rite (compliant with Christian belief) was practised, instead of cremation typical for earlier Slavs.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012b|p=3}} The known necropolises with military equipment around the perimeter of the agglomeration probably belonged to the settlements guarding access roads to the centre.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2004|p=50}}\n\nThe city reached its height during the reign of [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]]. During his rule, the first known Christian [[Diocese|bishopric]] in Slovakia was established in Nitra in 880 (with [[Wiching]] as the bishop). The question of origin of Monastery of  [[Hippolytus of Rome|St. Hippolytus]] (the oldest [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] Monastery in [[Kingdom of Hungary]]) has not been sufficiently answered yet. Even if findings of ceramics documented a settlement in the location, its character is unclear.{{sfn|Botek|2014|p=50}}{{sfn|Pomfyov\u00e1|2015|p=745}}\n\n===10th to 13th centuries===\nThe development of Nitra was temporarily slowed down after the disintegration of Great Moravia.{{sfn|Chropovsk\u00fd|2002|p=37}} However, Nitra did not follow the fate of other prominent Great Moravian centres ([[Mikul\u010dice Archaeopark|Mikul\u010dice]], [[B\u0159eclav|Pohansko]], [[Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b|Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto-Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161te]]), and until the 13th century it preserved its status as a prestigious centre. According to older assumptions, Nitra should have been occupied by masses of [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] (Hungarian) units, predictably followed by significant destruction of the previous settlements.{{sfn|To\u010d\u00edk|1979||p=74}} However, later archaeological research does not support this theory.{{sfn|Hauliak|2002|p=121}} The extinction horizon (e.g. destruction by fire) is not documented for any known settlement, and the continuity between the graveyards from different periods remained high.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=18}} In the 10th century, the settlement structure was not affected by any observable destruction process or significant change in the ethnic composition.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=122}} The continuity of Slavic settlements and economic infrastructure was preserved.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1993|p=33}} Archaeological evidence pointing to an early presence of Magyars directly in Nitra has not been found yet, except of the warrior grave in Nitra-Mlyn\u00e1rce{{sfn|Hauliak|2002|p=121}}{{sfn|\u0160tefanovi\u010dov\u00e1|p=133}} Paradoxically, their presence is documented north of Nitra ([[\u010cakajovce]]) and from peripheral areas with more rural character, where they joined the majority Slavic population.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=121}} Here, their members were buried together with the Slavs in common graveyards.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=121}}{{sfn|Hanuliak|2004|p=216}} Later, both cultures merged into the common [[Bijelo Brdo culture]], with ethnic-specific attributes fading away.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=121}}\n\nPolitical affiliation of the territory in the 10th and the early 11th century is unclear{{snd}}the influence of Hungarian [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1ds]], Czech [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslids]] and Polish [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]] is being considered. Finally, Nitra became an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary and the seat of several \u00c1rp\u00e1ds princes. The town survived the [[Battle of Mohi|invasion of Mongols]] in 1241. In 1248, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] gave Nitra the privileges of a free royal town. In 1271-1272, Nitra was heavily damaged by the Czech king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottakar II]]. The raids also damaged the bishop's property and therefore, as compensation, Nitra was put under his administration in 1288. The town lost its royal privileges and in the next centuries it was unable to recover mainly because of frequent military conflicts.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1994|p=35}}\n\n===14th to 19th centuries===\nIn the early 14th century, the town and the castle were damaged several times by [[Matthew III Cs\u00e1k]]. In the conflict between the king and oligarchy the bishop of Nitra remained loyal to the king. In 1313, the king confirmed bishopric privileges and extended them for the right to administer not only Nitra, but whole [[Nyitra County|Nitra County]].{{sfn|Ruttkay|p=35}}\n\nThe town became a target of [[Hussite]] attacks in the 15th century, at the time defended by [[Isp\u00e1n]] of Nitra county, [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] and later his son Stibor de [[Beckov]] .<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 31\u201332</ref> After the Hungarian defeat at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526 and subsequent Ottoman advances into the Hungarian territory, Nitra was under threat of Ottoman attacks.  In 1563, the town became the seat of the [[Captaincies of the Kingdom of Hungary#Captaincy of Lower Hungary|Captaincy of Lower Hungary]]. The Turkish forces failed to capture the castle three times, before they conquered it in 1663, when the city became a center of the Litra [[sanjak]], which bounded to [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky|Uyvar]] eyalet. The town was reconquered in 1685.<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 33\u201335</ref> The town was also affected by anti-Habsburg uprisings, from [[Stephen Bocskay]] and [[Gabriel Bethlen]] uprisings in the 17th century to the [[Kuruc]] uprisings from 1703 to 1711, and the town burned down in 1708 as a result of fights.<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 34\u201336</ref> It was renovated in the 18th century in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. As a consequence of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Nitra was awarded an independent self-government for the first time since 1288 and became independent from the [[Diocese of Nitra]] and its bishops.<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", p. 37</ref> Still an agricultural and handicraft town, Nitra started to industrialize. Until World War I, distillery, agricultural machines factory, brewery, dairy and other works were established. The first indirect connection to a railway was a road built in 1850 to the closest station in [[Trnovec nad V\u00e1hom]].<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 39\u201340</ref> The railway arrived to Nitra in 1876, when a connection from [[\u0160urany]] was built. Later, lines were built to [[Topo\u013e\u010dany]], [[Hlohovec]] and [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky]]. As a part of [[Magyarization]], from 1883 to 1919, Nitra was the seat of the Upper Hungarian Teaching Association (FEMKE), a government-sponsored association whose main goal was to apply Magyarization policies on Slovaks<ref>[http://www.kislexikon.hu/felvideki_magyar_kozmuvelodesi_egyesulet.html Kislexikon online encyclopedia: Felvid\u00e9ki Magyar K\u00f6zm\u0171vel\u0151d\u00e9si Egyes\u00fclete]</ref>\n\n===20th to 21st centuries===\nAfter [[World War I]] and in the atmosphere  of postwar chaos and raising anarchy, the Hungarian National Council in Nitra decided to negotiate with the [[Czechoslovak Legions|Czechoslovak Army]], pushing out Hungarian military forces and police from the territory of present Slovakia.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=33}} The Hungarian National Council and the Town Council needed the Czechoslovak Army to restore public order, but hoped that situation was only temporary and formally protested against the \"occupation\" on 10 December 1918.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=33}} However, the town became a part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Nitra continued to be the seat of the Nitra county, until it was dissolved in 1928. In 1933, Nitra played an important role in the Slovak autonomist movement when the Pribina's Celebration (the anniversary of the consecration of the first Christian church) turned to the largest demonstration against [[Czechoslovakism]].\n\nAfter break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Nitra became a part of the [[First Slovak Republic]] and once again a seat of Nitra county until 1945. The period of the First Slovak Republic was tragic for the numerous Jewish population of Nitra, which was first victimized by the anti-Jewish law and then mostly exterminated in German concentration camps (90% of Jewish citizens).{{sfn|Ruttkay|1993|p=43}} The city was liberated by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945, for only three years of restored democracy in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Communist period from 1948 to 1989 was marked by the oppression of the Catholic church, which has traditionally had a strong presence in Nitra. Catholic seminaries, monasteries and other properties were nationalized and converted to museums, schools and offices. This period experienced extensive growth, building of housing projects and annexing of formerly independent villages. After the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989 and [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], Nitra became part of newly established Slovakia and became a seat of the [[Nitra Region]] in 1996.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography===\nNitra lies at an altitude of {{convert|190|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|100.48|km2|sqmi|1}}.<ref name=\"statistics\">{{cite web | title = Municipal Statistics | publisher = Statistical Office of the Slovak republic | date = | url = http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html | accessdate = 2007-05-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427022352/http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}</ref> It is located in the [[Nitra River]] valley in the [[Danubian Lowland]], where the bigger part of the city is located.

Archeological finding indicate that a large fortified castle had already stood here at the time of [[Samo]]'s Empire, in the seventh century. Archaeological findings prove the existence of a church from the ninth century beneath the more recent Gothic St. Emmeram's Cathedral. The construction of the stone castle began during the 9th century during the reign of the Prince of Nitra Sv\u00e4topluk. The castle currently serves as the seat of one of [[Diocese of Nitra|Roman Catholic bishoprics in Slovakia]], which was founded in 880 as the first bishopric of western and eastern Slavs, which continued its existence since then, with the break from the 10th century until around 1110.\n\nThe [[Dra\u017eovce church]] is a remarkable example of the early [[Romanesque architecture]].\n\nThe [[Nitra Synagogue]] was built in 1908-1911 for the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog Jewish community]]. It was designed by Lip\u00f3t (Leopold) Baumhorn (1860\u20131932), the prolific Budapest-based synagogue architect. Located in a narrow lane, the building is an example of Baumhorn's style. A m\u00e9lange of Moorish, Byzantine and Art Nouveau elements, it faces the street with a two-tower fa\u00e7ade. The sanctuary is a domed hall supported by four pillars that also support the women's gallery. After more than a decade of restoration by the municipality of Nitra, the building is now used as a center for cultural activities. The women's gallery houses \"The Fate of Slovak Jews\" \u2013 Slovakia's national Holocaust memorial exhibition. The [[Nitra Synagogue]] serves as a permanent exhibition space for graphic works by the Nitra-born Israeli artist [[Shraga Weil]].<ref>[http://www.slovak-jewish-heritage.org/nitra-synagogue.html Slovak Jewish Heritage], an NGO web page</ref>\n\nThe most powerful medium wave transmitter of Slovakia, running on 1098&nbsp;kHz {{citation needed|date=July 2017}}, was situated in Nitra at [[Velke Kostolany transmitter|Velke Kostolany]] until recently.

[[WP:PLACE#General_guidelines]]#2.The lead and [[WP:ALTNAME#Separate_section_usage]] and don't add alternative English or unofficial foreign names here-->) is a city in western [[Slovakia]], situated at the foot of [[Zobor]] Mountain in the valley of the river [[Nitra (river)|Nitra]]. With a population of about 76,655 it is the sixth-largest city in Slovakia. Nitra is also one of the oldest cities in Slovakia; it was the political center of the [[Principality of Nitra]]. Today, it is a seat of a ''[[Regions of Slovakia|kraj]]'' ([[Nitra Region]])  and an ''[[Districts of Slovakia|okres]]'' ([[Nitra District]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first mention of Nitra dates back to the 9th century. The name of the city is derived from the [[Nitra river]]. The name is [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], but the question of its [[History of Proto-Slavic#Pre-Slavic|pre-Slavic]] or [[Slavic people|Slavic]] origin has not been satisfactorily answered. Nitra might be derived from the old Indo-European root ''neit-'', ''nit-'' meaning \"to cut\" or \"to burn\" using a derivation element ''-r-'' (see also [[slash-and-burn]]  agricultural technique).{{sfn|Ondru\u0161|200|p=15}} The same root is still present in the [[Slovak language|Slovak]] verb ''nieti\u0165'' (to make a fire), but also in other Indo-European languages like [[Latin]] ''nitere'' (to burn) or in [[German language|German]] ''schneiden'' (to cut).{{sfn|Ondru\u0161|200|p=14}} Another view to the origin of the name is related to the [[Latin]] ''Novi-iter'' or ''Neui-iter'' meaning \"new territory behind the [[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]\".{{sfn|Hladk\u00fd|2008|p=78}} The hypothetical Latin name could be adopted by the [[Quadi]] and later by the [[Slavs]].\n\nThe first written records contain also suffix ''-ava'' (Nitrava). Particularly in older literature, the suffix is interpreted as deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic]] root ''*ahwa'' (water).{{sfn|Z\u00e1vodn\u00fd|2008|p=48}} However, the suffix ''-ava'' can be found also in numerous toponyms with a clearly Slavic origin and without any relationship to rivers. Although, the existence of hydronym Nitrava remains hypothetical{{sfn|Hladk\u00fd|2008|p=79}} and all versions with the suffix are related to a location, not a river. Thus, the form Nitrava can refer to a larger property or territory around the river Nitra.{{sfn|Z\u00e1vodn\u00fd|2008|p=50}} Both forms were probably used concurrently and were recorded already in the 9th century {{sfn|Ondru\u0161|200|p=15}} ([[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]]: \"in loco vocata\nNitraua\", but in 880 \"ecclesie Nitrensis\").\n\nThe name in different languages includes {{lang-la|Nitria}}; {{lang-de|Neutra}} ({{Audio|De-Neutra.ogg|pronunciation}}); {{lang-hu|Nyitra}} and ''{{lang|hu|Nyitria}}''.\n\n==History==\nNitra is the oldest city in Slovakia.\n[[File:Mesto Nitra.jpg|thumb|Nitra from Zobor]]\n\n===Before the 5th century===\nThe oldest archaeological findings in Nitra are dated to around 25,000-30,000 years ago. The locality has been inhabited in all historical periods in the last 5,000-7,000 years.{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=27}} Several European archaeological cultures and groups were named after important archaeological discoveries in Nitra or near surroundings - Nitra culture, Brodzany-Nitra group or Lu\u017eianky group of [[Lengyel culture]].\n\nThe people of Madarovce culture had built the first fortification on [[Nitra Castle|Castle Hill]] by around 1,600 BCE. In the Iron Age, a large [[hillfort]]  was built on Zobor Hill and additional smaller hillforts on the Lupka Hill and in Dra\u017eovce (700-500 BCE).{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=27}} Several Celtic settlements are known from the 5th-1st centuries. The Celts minted silver [[tetradrachm]]s known as coins of Nitra type and probably also built a hillfort in the locality Na V\u0155\u0161ku.{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=27}} In the Roman period (1st-4th centuries CE), the Germanic tribe of [[Quadi]] settled in the area, which is also mentioned as their possible capital (396 CE). The largest Germanic settlement from the migration period in Slovakia was unearthed in Nitra-P\u00e1rovsk\u00e9 H\u00e1je.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=4}}\n\n===5th to 10th centuries===\nThe first [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] arrived to Slovakia at the end of the 5th and early 6th century.{{sfn|Fusek|1994|p=93}} The early Slavs settled mainly in the lowlands near the water flows, the highest density of their settlements is documented just in the area of Nitra.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=11}} As the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] expanded to the territory of Slovakia in the latter half of the [[7th century]] and early [[8th century]], the border between Slavic and Slavo-Avaric territory moved toward Nitra. A biritual cemetery in Nitra-Doln\u00e9 Kr\u0161kany lay on the northern border of mixed settlement area.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012a|p=13}}\n\nThe importance of Nitra for the Slavs began to grow in the 8th century and thereafter it evolved to administrative centre of the wider region.{{sfn|Ruttkay|Velik\u00e1|1993|p=28}} Nitra became the center of the [[Principality of Nitra]]. Three of the eleven extant copies of the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]] contains a reference to a church consecrated for Pribina in his domain called Nitrava. The problem of Pribina's church and the dating of this event was addressed by numerous scholars, most of them have no doubt about reliability of information and associates this event with Nitra.{{sfn|Ivani\u010d|2008|p=68}} In 833, Pribina was ousted by the Moravian prince [[Mojm\u00edr I]] and both regions were united into the early medieval empire of [[Great Moravia]].\n\nIn the 9th century, Nitra was one of the largest agglomeration in Central Europe.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=13}} The agglomeration consisted of fortified centres and more than twenty non-fortified villages.{{sfn|Botek|2014|p=91}} It spread out on a territory exceeding the present town. The Slavs, Slovak ancestors, built a large castle (8.5 hectares) on Castle Hill,{{sfn|Tur\u010dan|2013|p=63}} further important locations Na v\u0155\u0161ku and Martinsk\u00fd Vrch were probably also fortified.{{sfn|\u0160alkovsk\u00fd|2012|p=53}} Other hills, some of them fortified already in prehistoric times, had guarding and refuge function. Surrounding villages were used as an agricultural hinterland for princely retinue and for specialised production (jewellery production, forges, pottery kilns, etc.). More than forty burial sites are documented on 20&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2004|p=50}} In all burial sites, exclusively inhumation rite (compliant with Christian belief) was practised, instead of cremation typical for earlier Slavs.{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012b|p=3}} The known necropolises with military equipment around the perimeter of the agglomeration probably belonged to the settlements guarding access roads to the centre.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2004|p=50}}\n\nThe city reached its height during the reign of [[Sv\u00e4topluk I]]. During his rule, the first known Christian [[Diocese|bishopric]] in Slovakia was established in Nitra in 880 (with [[Wiching]] as the bishop). The question of origin of Monastery of  [[Hippolytus of Rome|St. Hippolytus]] (the oldest [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] Monastery in [[Kingdom of Hungary]]) has not been sufficiently answered yet. Even if findings of ceramics documented a settlement in the location, its character is unclear.{{sfn|Botek|2014|p=50}}{{sfn|Pomfyov\u00e1|2015|p=745}}\n\n===10th to 13th centuries===\nThe development of Nitra was temporarily slowed down after the disintegration of Great Moravia.{{sfn|Chropovsk\u00fd|2002|p=37}} However, Nitra did not follow the fate of other prominent Great Moravian centres ([[Mikul\u010dice Archaeopark|Mikul\u010dice]], [[B\u0159eclav|Pohansko]], [[Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161t\u011b|Star\u00e9 M\u011bsto-Uhersk\u00e9 Hradi\u0161te]]), and until the 13th century it preserved its status as a prestigious centre. According to older assumptions, Nitra should have been occupied by masses of [[Magyar tribes|Magyar]] (Hungarian) units, predictably followed by significant destruction of the previous settlements.{{sfn|To\u010d\u00edk|1979||p=74}} However, later archaeological research does not support this theory.{{sfn|Hauliak|2002|p=121}} The extinction horizon (e.g. destruction by fire) is not documented for any known settlement, and the continuity between the graveyards from different periods remained high.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=118}}{{sfn|Ruttkayov\u00e1|Ruttkay|2012|p=18}} In the 10th century, the settlement structure was not affected by any observable destruction process or significant change in the ethnic composition.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=122}} The continuity of Slavic settlements and economic infrastructure was preserved.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1993|p=33}} Archaeological evidence pointing to an early presence of Magyars directly in Nitra has not been found yet, except of the warrior grave in Nitra-Mlyn\u00e1rce{{sfn|Hauliak|2002|p=121}}{{sfn|\u0160tefanovi\u010dov\u00e1|p=133}} Paradoxically, their presence is documented north of Nitra ([[\u010cakajovce]]) and from peripheral areas with more rural character, where they joined the majority Slavic population.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=121}} Here, their members were buried together with the Slavs in common graveyards.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=121}}{{sfn|Hanuliak|2004|p=216}} Later, both cultures merged into the common [[Bijelo Brdo culture]], with ethnic-specific attributes fading away.{{sfn|Hanuliak|2002|p=121}}\n\nPolitical affiliation of the territory in the 10th and the early 11th century is unclear{{snd}}the influence of Hungarian [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1ds]], Czech [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty|P\u0159emyslids]] and Polish [[Piast dynasty|Piasts]] is being considered. Finally, Nitra became an integral part of the Kingdom of Hungary and the seat of several \u00c1rp\u00e1ds princes. The town survived the [[Battle of Mohi|invasion of Mongols]] in 1241. In 1248, [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary|B\u00e9la IV]] gave Nitra the privileges of a free royal town. In 1271-1272, Nitra was heavily damaged by the Czech king [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Ottakar II]]. The raids also damaged the bishop's property and therefore, as compensation, Nitra was put under his administration in 1288. The town lost its royal privileges and in the next centuries it was unable to recover mainly because of frequent military conflicts.{{sfn|Ruttkay|1994|p=35}}\n\n===14th to 19th centuries===\nIn the early 14th century, the town and the castle were damaged several times by [[Matthew III Cs\u00e1k]]. In the conflict between the king and oligarchy the bishop of Nitra remained loyal to the king. In 1313, the king confirmed bishopric privileges and extended them for the right to administer not only Nitra, but whole [[Nyitra County|Nitra County]].{{sfn|Ruttkay|p=35}}\n\nThe town became a target of [[Hussite]] attacks in the 15th century, at the time defended by [[Isp\u00e1n]] of Nitra county, [[Stibor of Stiboricz]] and later his son Stibor de [[Beckov]] .<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 31\u201332</ref> After the Hungarian defeat at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526 and subsequent Ottoman advances into the Hungarian territory, Nitra was under threat of Ottoman attacks.  In 1563, the town became the seat of the [[Captaincies of the Kingdom of Hungary#Captaincy of Lower Hungary|Captaincy of Lower Hungary]]. The Turkish forces failed to capture the castle three times, before they conquered it in 1663, when the city became a center of the Litra [[sanjak]], which bounded to [[Nov\u00e9 Z\u00e1mky|Uyvar]] eyalet. The town was reconquered in 1685.<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 33\u201335</ref> The town was also affected by anti-Habsburg uprisings, from [[Stephen Bocskay]] and [[Gabriel Bethlen]] uprisings in the 17th century to the [[Kuruc]] uprisings from 1703 to 1711, and the town burned down in 1708 as a result of fights.<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", pp. 34\u201336</ref> It was renovated in the 18th century in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. As a consequence of the [[Revolutions of 1848]], Nitra was awarded an independent self-government for the first time since 1288 and became independent from the [[Diocese of Nitra]] and its bishops.<ref>Lacika, \"Nitra and its environs\", p. 37</ref> Still an agricultural and handicraft town, Nitra started to industrialize. Until World War I, distillery, agricultural machines factory, brewery, dairy and other works were established.

As a part of [[Magyarization]], from 1883 to 1919, Nitra was the seat of the Upper Hungarian Teaching Association (FEMKE), a government-sponsored association whose main goal was to apply Magyarization policies on Slovaks<ref>[http://www.kislexikon.hu/felvideki_magyar_kozmuvelodesi_egyesulet.html Kislexikon online encyclopedia: Felvid\u00e9ki Magyar K\u00f6zm\u0171vel\u0151d\u00e9si Egyes\u00fclete]</ref>\n\n===20th to 21st centuries===\nAfter [[World War I]] and in the atmosphere  of postwar chaos and raising anarchy, the Hungarian National Council in Nitra decided to negotiate with the [[Czechoslovak Legions|Czechoslovak Army]], pushing out Hungarian military forces and police from the territory of present Slovakia.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=33}} The Hungarian National Council and the Town Council needed the Czechoslovak Army to restore public order, but hoped that situation was only temporary and formally protested against the \"occupation\" on 10 December 1918.{{sfn|Kamenec|2013|p=33}} However, the town became a part of [[Czechoslovakia]]. Nitra continued to be the seat of the Nitra county, until it was dissolved in 1928. In 1933, Nitra played an important role in the Slovak autonomist movement when the Pribina's Celebration (the anniversary of the consecration of the first Christian church) turned to the largest demonstration against [[Czechoslovakism]].\n\nAfter break-up of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Nitra became a part of the [[First Slovak Republic]] and once again a seat of Nitra county until 1945. The period of the First Slovak Republic was tragic for the numerous Jewish population of Nitra, which was first victimized by the anti-Jewish law and then mostly exterminated in German concentration camps (90% of Jewish citizens).{{sfn|Ruttkay|1993|p=43}} The city was liberated by the Soviet [[Red Army]] in 1945, for only three years of restored democracy in Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe Communist period from 1948 to 1989 was marked by the oppression of the Catholic church, which has traditionally had a strong presence in Nitra. Catholic seminaries, monasteries and other properties were nationalized and converted to museums, schools and offices. This period experienced extensive growth, building of housing projects and annexing of formerly independent villages. After the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989 and [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], Nitra became part of newly established Slovakia and became a seat of the [[Nitra Region]] in 1996.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography===\nNitra lies at an altitude of {{convert|190|m|ft|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] and covers an area of {{convert|100.48|km2|sqmi|1}}.<ref name=\"statistics\">{{cite web | title = Municipal Statistics | publisher = Statistical Office of the Slovak republic | date = | url = http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html | accessdate = 2007-05-03 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070427022352/http://www.statistics.sk/mosmis/eng/run.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-04-27}}</ref> It is located in the [[Nitra River]] valley in the [[Danubian Lowland]], where the bigger part of the city is located.

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

in the U.S. since February 26, 2020.

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The goals of these movements are diverse, but generally aim to decriminalize and destigmatize [[sex work]], and ensure fair treatment before legal and cultural forces on a local and international level for all persons in the [[sex industry]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Svati P.|title=Sex Work and Women's Movements|journal=CREA Publication|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sex work'' refers primarily to [[prostitution]], but also encompasses [[adult video]] performers, [[phone sex]] operators, [[webcam model]]s, dancers in [[strip club]]s, and others who provide sexually-related services. Some extend the use of the term to include \"support personnel\" such as managers, agents, videographers, club [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]], and others. The debate over sex work is often characterized as an issue of [[women's rights|''women's'' rights]], especially by those who argue that prostitution is inherently oppressive and seek to criminalize it or keep it illegal, but in fact, there are also many male and [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] individuals engaged in providing sexual services. Most sex workers do not wish to be branded as criminals and regard laws against prostitution, pornography, and other parts of the sex industry as violating their rights.\n\nSince the use of red umbrellas by sex workers in [[Venice]], Italy, in 2001\u2014as part of the [[49th Venice Biennale]] of Art\u2014a red umbrella has become the foremost internationally recognized symbol for sex worker rights.<ref name=\"nswp red umbrella\">{{cite web |title=Origins of the Red Umbrella as the Symbol of the Sex Worker Rights Movement |url=https://www.nswp.org/ru/timeline/event/origins-the-red-umbrella-the-symbol-the-sex-worker-rights-movement |website=Global Network of Sex Work Projects |accessdate=14 September 2019 |language=ru |date=28 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Swan red umbrella\">{{cite web |author1=Aliya |title=The Red Umbrella: What does it symbolize and why is it used by sex workers? {{!}} SWAN |url=http://www.swannet.org/node/782 |website=www.swannet.org |accessdate=14 September 2019 |date=22 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n===Discrimination and stigmatization===\nIn most countries, even those where sex work is legal, [[sex workers]] of all kinds feel that they are stigmatized and marginalized, and that this prevents them from seeking legal redress for discrimination (for e. g., [[racial discrimination]] by a [[strip club]] owner, dismissal from a teaching position because of involvement in the sex industry), non-payment by a [[Customer|client]], [[assault]], or [[rape]]. Activists also believe that clients of sex workers may also be stigmatized and marginalized, in some cases even more so than sex workers themselves. For instance, in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, it is illegal to buy sexual acts, but not to sell them (the buyer is said to have committed a crime, but not the prostitute).<ref name=\"Prostitution in Sweden\">Prostitution in Sweden|\"The laws on prostitution in Sweden make it illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them.\"</ref>\n\n===Pornography debates===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the main topics in the feminist discourse on women's sexuality were [[pornography]], [[prostitution]], and [[human trafficking]]. This led to the birth of the mobilization for sex worker rights in America. [[Carol Leigh]] is credited with coining the term \"sex work\" in the early 1980s and it was later popularized by a book published in 1989 called ''Sex Work''.<ref name=swaay>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.swaay.org/history.html|work=SWAAY|publisher=SWAAY.org|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2011}}</ref> Around this time, pornography, in particular, was a prominent debate among feminists campaigning for women's rights. The feminists involved in these debates held opposing views on how to eliminate sexual violence against women, and those involved were either classified as \"liberal feminists\" or \"radical feminists\". A third group of feminists is described as \"pro-sex\" or \"[[sex positive feminism]]\", and this view is considered the true feminist defense of pornography.<ref name=McElroy>{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=A Feminist Defense of Pornography|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/mcelroy_17_4.html|work=Free Inquiry Magazine, Vol. 17, No. 4|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Radical feminist====\nThe argument of the radical side rests upon the premise that pornography depicts women as subordinates and perpetrates violence against women.<ref name=flood/> Some of the main anti-porn feminists involved in the debates included Page Mellish, [[Andrea Dworkin]], and [[Catharine MacKinnon]]. Dworkin insisted that the oppression of women occurs through sexual subordination, and that in order for [[gender]] equality to exist, subordination must be eliminated. Thus, she states that pornography and prostitution are incompatible with gender equality.<ref name=flood>{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Against the Male Flood: Censorship, Pornography, and Equity|year=1985}}</ref> Similarly, MacKinnon states that [[pornography]] is an act of sexual violence.<ref name=onlywords>{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Catharine A.|title=Only Words|url=https://archive.org/details/onlywords00mack|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> On the grounds that pornography violated women's [[civil rights]], she and Dworkin proposed a law named the \"Anti-Pornography Civil Rights Ordinance\" that allowed women to seek reparations for damages done by pornography through civil courts. Likewise, Page Mellish, the founder of [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] (FFP), believed that issues facing feminists were rooted in pornography. Mellish allied with conservatives in 1992 to fight for the passing of the \"Pornography Victims' Compensation Act\", which was modeled after Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance.<ref name=sexexposed>{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Lynn|title=Sex Exposed: Sexuality and the Pornography Debate|year=1993|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=USA}}</ref>\n\n====Liberal feminist====\nContrarily, liberal feminists believe that capitalism allows women to freely make whatever choices they desire. As such, some women freely choose to participate in pornography, as they do in other forms of labour. The main thing that these feminists fight for is anti-censorship, regardless of whether they personally agree with pornography or not.<ref name=\"McElroy\" /> On this side of the debate are feminists such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and Lynn Chancer. Rubin argues that anti-pornography laws could negatively harm sexual minorities such as gays/lesbians, sex workers, and feminists because they would create new problems and modes of abuse resulting from the anti-pornography side's use of a limited amount of porn that demonstrates the most extreme cases of violence such as [[sadomasochism]].<ref name=rubin>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Misguided, Dangerous, and Wrong: an Analysis of Anti-pornography Politics}}</ref><ref name=thinkingsex>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality|url=https://archive.org/details/ThinkingSexNotesForARadicalTheoryOfThePoliticsOfSexuality1984}}</ref> Likewise, Chancer argues that it is possible for such imagery to be able to circulate consensually and lawfully while genuine feelings of pleasure are being experienced without women feeling subordinated.<ref name=chancerporn>{{cite journal|last=Chancer|first=Lynn|title=From Pornography to Sadomasochism: Reconciling Feminist Differences|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2000|volume=571|pages=77\u201388|doi=10.1177/0002716200571001006}}</ref> She also states that some of these feminists believe that pornography is negatively affecting women by leading to violence against women when in actuality it is not. Thus, she concludes that radical feminists are looking at pornography as a quick fix to a much larger societal problem.<ref name=defendingpornography>{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Chancer|title=Feminist Offensives: \"Defending Pornography\" and the Splitting of Sex from Sexism|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=February 1996|volume=48|issue=3|pages=739\u2013760|doi=10.2307/1229282|jstor=1229282}}</ref>\n\n====Sex-positive feminist====\nSex-positive feminists believe that no form of sexual expression should be vilified, except that which is not consensual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Barbara|title=Identity politics in the women's movement|year=2001|publisher=NYU Press}}</ref> One of the main advocates of this feminist perspective is [[Carol Queen]]. She argues that radical feminists probably generalize too widely as far as women are concerned, and do not take into consideration more complicated circumstances such as [[sadomasochism]] and [[prostitution]]. Elisa Glick also states that configurations of power within relationships do not prevent women from exercising it and that they can be used to enable women to exercise it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glick|first=Elisa|title=Sex Positive: Feminism, Queer Theory, and the Politics of Transgression|journal=Feminist Review|date=Spring 2000|volume=64|pages=19\u201345|doi=10.1080/014177800338936}}</ref>\n\n====Men on Porn====\nThere is debate on whether the consumption of porn among men is good for their well being, though in a study of over 300 men aged 18 to 73 97% report that they have watched porn, with 94% reporting having done so in the last 6 months and 82% reporting doing so in a manner they would consider \"regularly\".\nMen of all ages report an overall positive experience with porn, though younger men express greater negative than older men- which researchers speculate is because porn skews their perceptions of sex.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Dan J. |last2=Hald |first2=Gert Martin |last3=Kidd |first3=Garry |title=Self-perceived effects of pornography consumption among heterosexual men. |journal=Psychology of Men & Masculinity |date=July 2018 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=469\u2013476 |doi=10.1037/men0000112 |accessdate=21 November 2018|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316802453}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sex Wars\" debate===\nPornography debates provided leeway for the emergence of the \"Sex Wars\" debates, a title assigned by feminist scholars. These debates began in the 1980s and centered upon ways that women were depicted in [[heterosexual]] sexual relations. The main premise of the [[anti-pornography movement]] rests upon the argument that pornography is degrading and [[violent]] towards women. These [[feminists]] also believe that pornography encourages men to behave violently towards women.<ref name=flood /> However, liberal feminists argued that this argument does not take into account the pleasure that women can experience, stating that these arguments could backfire against women and actually subject them to a greater degree of subordination.<ref name=rubin />\n\nThus, the debates started to become centralized on the role of [[dominance and submission|dominance]] within heterosexual relationships and how this dominance is transferred to other areas of women's lives. These theories of male sexuality and female objectification and sexuality are controversial because they framed later debates about [[human trafficking]], in which coerced workers are distinguished from voluntary workers.<ref name=sexwars>{{cite journal|last=Abrams|first=Kathryn|title=Sex Wars Redux: Agency and Coercion in Feminist Legal Theory|journal=Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository|date=January 1995|pages=304\u2013376}}</ref>\n\n====Human trafficking====\nThe human trafficking debate, a prominent discourse in the 21st century, has materialized as a result of the movement. Current debates center on whether the best way to protect women would be through abolition, criminalization, decriminalization, or legalization.\n\n=====Legalization=====\nSex worker advocates who are fighting for legalization or decriminalization of prostitution contend that criminalizing consensual sex acts among adults creates a black market which worsens the problem of forced human trafficking rather than reducing it. They decry the paternalistic attitude of what they disparagingly call \"rescue missions\", law enforcement raids that regard all sex workers as in need of \"saving\" fail to distinguish the minority of sex workers who are coerced from the vast majority who engage in sex work voluntarily.<ref name=urbanjustice>{{cite web|title=Working Group on Sex Work and Human Rights|url=http://esplerp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Urban-Justice-Difference-between.pdf|work=Urban Justice|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, liberal feminists such as [[Ronald Weitzer]] and [[Gayle Rubin]], argue that the definition of sex work as inherently violent has created a \u201cmoral panic\u201d that influences political discourse.<ref name=thinkingsex /><ref name=\"Moral Panic\" /> They contend that this \"panic\" has led to the construction of a trafficking victim who may actually be a [[Migrant sex work|woman migrating for work]]. These feminists argue that this can backfire because it does not protect those women who voluntarily enter into sex work.<ref name=urbanjustice />\n\n=====Criminalization=====\nOpponents of the sex workers' rights movement, such as [[Melissa Farley]] and [[Janice Raymond]], argue that prostitution should be abolished because legalization can increase incidences of human trafficking. The ''New UN Trafficking Protocol'' by Raymond argues that many victims are trafficked to countries in which sex work is legalized or decriminalized, and because they are trafficked under the guise of migrants they are not protected. Raymond also argues that it is impossible to separate the exploitation experienced by local prostitutes from the exploitative experiences of trafficked prostitutes, as they are very similar. Thus, to end sex slavery, the report declares that everyone involved in sex work needs to be criminalized so that the industry can be abolished.<ref name=traffickingprotocol>{{Cite journal | last = Raymond | first = Janice G. | author-link = Janice Raymond | title = The new UN trafficking protocol | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 491\u2013502 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00320-5 | date = September\u2013October 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref> Similarly, Farley argues that engagement in voluntary sex work is a decision made by women in the absence of alternative choices,<ref name=\"Farley, Melissa\" /> and that it therefore cannot accurately be described as a voluntary and freely made choice.\n\n==Legality of prostitution==\nMost activists campaigning for the formation of policies that protect sex workers from violence fall into two main categories: abolitionism or criminalization, and legalization or [[decriminalization]].<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\">Brents, Barbara G. and Hausbeck, Kathryn. \"Violence and Legalized Prostitution in Nevada: Examining Safety, Risk and Prostitution Policy\". ''Journal of Interpersonal Violence''. 2005</ref>\n\n===Abolitionism or criminalization===\nEarly reformers identified the key problem with prostitution as male [[lust]] that lured innocent women into a depraved life as prostitutes.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> Thus, abolitionist proponents believe that prostitution is an exploitative system that is harmful to the women involved.<ref name=\"Prostitution Research\">Farley, Melissa. \"Myths and Facts about Trafficking for Legal and Illegal Prostitution\". Yale Journal of Law and Feminism. May 2006.</ref> Therefore, these [[activists]] believe that in order to prevent violence against women, the customers, pimps, and panderers should be punished so that the entire institution can be demolished.<ref name=\"Hughes, Donna\">Hughes, Donna. \"Legalizing Prostitution Will Not Stop the Harm\". 1999.</ref> Because this policy approach is built upon the idea that women are helpless victims, opponents of this view believe that it is paternalistic and not empowering to women.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/>\n\nA study by [[Melissa Farley]], a well-known supporter of the abolition of prostitution, and colleagues, suggests that violence is an intrinsic part of prostitution in which the chances of experiencing violence increases along with the number of years involved in prostitution. This study also concludes that prostitution tends to be multi-traumatic in all forms.<ref name=\"Nine\">Farley, Melissa et al. \"Prostitution and Trafficking in Nine Countries: An Update on Violence and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder\".</ref>\nFarley and colleagues also used the [[Netherlands]] as an example of a country to support the idea that legalized prostitution can still inflict harm on those involved. They stated that over 90% of the sex workers tend to show symptoms of [[PTSD]]. Therefore, these proponents advocate for abolitionism and criminalization as a method of protecting sex workers.<ref name=\"Nine\"/>\n\nCriminalization proponents believe that the way to protect women from interpersonal violence is to punish both [[sex workers]] and customers for partaking in the buying and selling of sex.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/>\n\n====Support for criminalization====\nMany proponents of abolitionism or criminalization of prostitution commonly use ten reasons based on studies done on the effects of prostitution in countries where it is legalized or decriminalized.<ref name=\"Janice Raymond \">{{cite web |url=http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/ten-reasons.html |title=Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution |first=Janice |last=Raymond |date=2003|accessdate=2013-12-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201080826/http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/ten-reasons.html |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}.</ref>\n\n*Prostitution is a gift to pimps, traffickers, and the sex industry.\n*Prostitution promotes [[sex trafficking]].\n*Prostitution expands the sex industry instead of controlling it.\n*Prostitution increases clandestine, illegal, and street prostitution because many women do not participate in health checks or registration and do not want to be controlled by businessmen.\n*Prostitution increases [[child prostitution]].\n*Prostitution doesn't protect women in prostitution.\n*Prostitution makes it socially acceptable for men to buy sex, and women are viewed as sexual commodities that men are encouraged to partake in.\n*Prostitution does not promote women's health because the condom-use policy is not strictly enforced.\n*Prostitution does not enhance women's choice.\n*Prostitutes do not want the sex industry legalized or decriminalized.<ref name=\"Janice Raymond\" />\n\n===Legalization or decriminalization===\nLegalization or decriminalization proponents, on the other hand, believe that the selling and buying of sex exchange will continue no matter what. Therefore, the only way to effectively prevent violence is to acknowledge this and for government to build policies and laws that deal with the issue through [[regulation]] of the business.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> Legalization/Decriminalization proponents believe that a system that prohibits prostitution creates an [[oppressive]] environment for prostitutes.<ref name=\"Kempadoo, Kamala\">Kempadoo, Kamala. \"Globalizing Sex Workers' Rights\" ''Canadian Women's Studies''. 2003.</ref> Proponents of this view also recommend that policies are built that places restrictions on trafficking and exploitation of sex workers.<ref name=\"Misra, Geetanjali, Mahal, Ajay, Shah, Rima\">Geetanjali, Misra et al. \"Protecting the Rights of Sex Workers: The Indian Experience\". ''Health and Human Rights''. 2000.</ref>\n\n====Support for decriminalization====\n{{main|Decriminalizing sex work}}\nThe legalization of sex work often entails additional restrictions and requirements placed on [[sex workers]] as well as registering with official government offices. Additionally, many activists favor decriminalization over legalization. Decriminalization involves a focus on laws which protect the rights of sex workers, such as those against coercion into or to stay in sex work, while all consensual sexual contact between adult sex workers and adult clients would not be criminalized.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/>\n\nRonald Weitzer, a well-known proponent for the legalization/decriminalization of prostitution, stated that the use of nonscientific evidence about prostitution has contributed to a \"moral panic\" because opponents commonly use the argument that prostitution is inherently violent and unable to be regulated. However, he also claims that other governments have been able to reject this notion and find ways to regulate it and uses Nevada as an example.<ref name=\"Moral Panic\">Weitzer, Ronald. \"The Growing Moral Panic Over Prostitution and Sex Trafficking\".

Therefore, the decriminalization or legalization can be a starting point to addressing these issues.<ref name=\"ProCon\"/>\n\nDecriminalization is supported by academics, human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], UN agencies, such as [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], LGBT organizations such as [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|ILGA]] and [[Lambda Legal]], and anti-trafficking organizations such as the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], [[La Strada International Association|La Strada International]], and the Freedom Network USA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lepp|first=Annalee|last2=Gerasimov|first2=Borislav|date=2019-04-29|title=Editorial: Gains and Challenges in the Global Movement for Sex Workers' Rights|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|volume=0|issue=12|pages=91\u2013107|doi=10.14197/atr.201219121|issn=2287-0113}}</ref>\n\n==Employment==\nDepending on regional law, sex workers' activities may be regulated, controlled, tolerated, or prohibited. For example, [[prostitution]] is illegal in many countries, but it is fully legalized in several jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, [[Germany]], some [[Australian]] states, and several counties in the US state of [[Nevada]].\n\n===Strip club employment issues===\nIn both Canada and the UK, dancers in [[strip clubs]] are [[independent contractors]] who face significant problems that they are unable to rectify because of their inability to challenge employers through organized action.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/><ref name=\"Now\">{{cite web|title=Bylaws on my stripper's body|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189480|work=NOW Magazine|publisher=In Print|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Brigitte Benoit|date=1\u20138 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Lab\">{{cite web|title=Sex Work, the Law and the Labour Movement|url=http://rankandfile.ca/?p=2063|website=RankandFile.ca|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Kaley Kennedy|date=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Entry fees====\nIn the UK, a study was conducted which inquired about dancers\u2019 experiences to get a better understanding to determine whether or not it could be costly for women to work some nights. It stated that often when the [[Strip club|club]] offered promotions with gimmicks, dancers would be required to work without payment. Furthermore, dancers may be required to promote events without pay as part of the house rules. If they tried to complain, the club owners would threaten to dismiss them. Thus, the study suggests that strip club workers in the UK operate under vulnerable conditions without the capacity to organize for better working conditions. Moreover, the study states that dancers are also required to pay their \u201chouse moms\u201d and the DJs, as well as being pressured to buy drinks for their customers and other dancers, which hampers their profit-making ability.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\">Sanders, Teela and Hardy, Kate. \"Devalued, Deskilled, and Diversified: Explaining the Proliferation of the Strip Industry in the UK\" ''The British Journal of Sociology''.</ref>\n\n====House fees====\nThe fees of dancers\u2019 house fees can be large and sometimes they are not waived or lowered when business is slow. Also, clubs may continue to hire women even during bad economic downturns. Therefore, dancers feel that their earning potential is lowered.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/>\n\n====Commission====\nIn addition to house fees and entry fees, many dancers are not paid for their stage shows because they are considered a part of self-advertisement. This is also considered another rule that comes along with their job description. In the UK, the club generally takes thirty percent commission.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/>\n\n====Fines and tips====\nThe final way clubs make money is through [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s and [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s. This study found that there could be a fine for something such as chewing gum or having gum in a bag that ranges from twenty to thirty pounds. The most common fines were chewing gum, using cellular phones on the floor, and tardiness. It goes on to say that some dancers may have to pay to take time off. Dancers also tip people that work in the club such as waitresses and doormen in order to get them to direct customers to them. Other reasons that motivate dancers to tip include tipping security so that the dancers will not be fined and tipping DJs to be called during good song and opportune times.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/>\n\n====Registration process====\nIn the Canadian city of [[Toronto]], workers must be in possession of an adult entertainer license that is only provided following a criminal record check and the submission of a form. Applicants are initially charged about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]$400 and are required to pay an annual C$270 renewal fee. Municipal bylaws govern the standards that workers must abide by to maintain their license.<ref name=\"Lab\" />\n\n====Unlawful or inappropriate customer behavior====\nA survey undertaken by the Toronto city council in 2012 was for the purpose of informing a reconsideration of the regulations around licensing for strip club-based sex workers. The most significant aspect was a reappraisal of the \u201cno touching\u201d rule so that it specified areas of the body to prevent people from being fined in the event of acceptable casual physical contact. Of those sex workers who responded to the survey, 67 percent stated that they had been sexually assaulted or touched without their consent, while they further documented the responses from their employers: 2 percent called the police, 34 percent asked the customer to leave, 22 percent ignored the incident, 4 percent blamed the stripper and 14 percent dismissed the incidents as part of the job.<ref name=\"Now\" /><ref name=\"Lab\" />\n\n===By country===\n\n====Argentina====\nThe Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina (AMMAR) was started by Elena Reynaga, who now heads the South American sex workers' network RedTraSex.<ref>[http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2016/8/feministas-somos-todas/ Feministas somos todas], 11 August 2016, La Diaria, Retrieved 7 November 2016</ref> AMMAR leader Sandra Cabrera was killed for her activism in 2004.<ref name=ammar>[http://www.redtrasex.org/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=568 AMMAR remembered Sandra Cabrera], 6 June 2012, redtrasex.org, Retrieved 3 September 2016</ref>\n\n====India====\nOn March 10, 2014, the All India Network of Sex Workers, an umbrella group of sex worker organizations, campaigned for pension rights. Representative of 90 sex worker organisations across 16 Indian states, the Network presented a letter explaining that sex workers in India are not treated equally in social security terms, stating: \"Sex workers, including their family members, can't access various social entitlements which are offered to citizens in general. We consider sex work like any other occupation belonging to the unorganised sector and we should be brought under the universal pension scheme.\" A spokesperson for the Network also informed the media that sex workers in India retire \"by the age of 40-45 years\", an earlier age than the broader population.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sex workers demand basic rights, inclusion in voters list|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/sex-workers-demand-basic-rights-inclusion-in-voters-list-114030300826_1.html|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=3 March 2014|author=IANS}}</ref>\n\n====Netherlands====\nA study by [[Janice Raymond]] states that there can be many detrimental consequences to legalizing and decriminalizing prostitution. One consequence mentioned was that prostitution can be seen as a suitable and normal option for the poor. Therefore, poor women can be easily exploited when there is a lack of sexual services which does not lead to their empowerment.<ref name=\"Raymond, Janice \">Raymond, Janice. \"Prostitution on Demand: Legalizing the Buyers as Sexual Customers\". ''Violence Against Women''. 2004.</ref> [[Melissa Farley]] supported this idea with an analysis stating that most women do not rationally decide to enter prostitution; rather, the decision is made as a survival choice and that there are certain circumstances can drive women into the field of prostitution, leaving them with a choice that is more along the lines of voluntary [[slavery]]. Thus, it is merely used as a surviving strategy.<ref name=\"Farley, Melissa\">Farley, Melissa. \"Prostitution, Trafficking, and Cultural Amnesia: What We Must Not Know to Keep the Business of Sexual Exploitation Running Smoothly\". ''Yale Journal of Law and Feminism''. 2006</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Raymond states that businesses in the sex industry are able to offer services to any men which has led to more [[gender inequality]] because women have to accept that prostitution is a new norm. She supported this by saying that even [[disabled]] men are able to receive sexual services, and their [[caregivers]] (mostly women) are required to take them to these establishments and assist them in engaging in sexual acts. Another consequence Raymond mentioned was that child prostitution has increased in the [[Netherlands]]. She suggests this is because the Netherlands has created a prostitution-promoting environment through laws concerning children that make it easier for abusers to use children without penalty. She also adds that the distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution could be detrimental because it can be argued that the thought of someone being forced into prostitution can be exciting for some men because it may be a part of clients' fantasies.<ref name=\"Raymond, Janice \" /> Finally, another study states that the legalization or decriminalization can be detrimental because studies that surveyed sex workers where it is legal concluded that violence is accepted as part of the job with the universal experience of [[Sexual abuse|molestation]] and [[abuse]].<ref name=\"Farley, Melissa\" />\n\n====United States====\n\n=====Hawaii=====\nA decision by the House and the Senate in Hawaii is expected in May 2014 after police agreed in March 2014 not to oppose the revision of a law that was implemented in the 1970s, allowing undercover police officers to engage in sexual relations with sex workers during the course of investigations. Following initial protest from supporters of the legislation, all objections were retracted on March 25, 2014. A Honolulu police spokeswoman informed ''TIME'' magazine that, at the time of the court's decision, no reports had been made in regard to the abuse of the exemption by police, while a Hawaiian senator stated to the media: \"I suppose that in retrospect, the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation.\" However, the Pacifica Alliance to Stop Slavery and other advocates affirmed their knowledge of police brutality in this area and explained that the fear of retribution is the main deterrent for sex workers who seek to report offending officers. At a Hawaiian Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, also in March 2014, an attorney testified that his client was raped three times by Hawaiian police before prostitution was cited as the reason for her subsequent arrest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawaii Police Won't Get to Have Sex With Prostitutes Anymore|url=http://time.com/38444/hawaii-police-prostitutes-sex/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=26 March 2014|author=Eliana Dockterman}}</ref>\n\n=====Nevada=====\nBarbara Brents and Kathryn Hausbeck state in their study that the legalization of prostitution in Nevada's brothels allows for improved regulation and protection for both businesses and workers.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> Academic [[Ronald Weitzer]] supports this idea by citing the impact of the numerous safety measures that ensure the safety of the workers.<ref name=\"Weitzer, Ronald\">Weitzer, Ronald. Prostitution: Facts and Fiction. ''Contexts''. 2007.</ref>\n\nBrents and Hausbeck's case study of Nevada's brothels entailed examples of how they believe protection mechanisms were designed to account for the entire process of each individual job\u2014that is the time that a sex worker is with a customer. They started by saying that the negotiation process for sex workers in Nevada requires the use of an intercom during the process so that workers will not betray the business [[owners]] and so that owners can know if the customers are putting the workers at risk. After the price is negotiated, the money is paid and taken out of the room by the sex worker. At that point, the sex workers have the opportunity to let [[security guards]] know if there is anything unsafe or uncomfortable about the situation so that security can be alerted. Another protection mechanism requires security to interrupt the workers after the allotted period of time to demand that the customers either leave or renegotiate the price, so that sex workers are not coerced or forced into providing additional services without a fee. Finally, the study concludes that sex workers are offered protection from one another in brothels because of strictly enforced rules and the relationships that brothels have been able to build with local law enforcement officials.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> According to some legalization supporters, this protection creates an environment that can be empowering for women to work in.<ref name=\"Weitzer, Ronald\"/>\n\nAdditionally, proponents argue that workers must also comply with [[health]] regulations and engage in preventative practices. They state that this compliance leads to a system that becomes mutually advantageous for brothels and sex workers, because a perception of safety by workers is profitable for the brothel.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> In brothels in Nevada, it is a requirement for sex workers to be tested and verified as healthy. Afterwards, they are required to be checked on a periodic basis for certain STIs. [[Condom]] usage is also mandatory and this is advertised by the brothels so that customers know beforehand. Finally, sex workers are able to examine the customers before any services are given to make sure there are no signs of visible STIs. If there are any suspicions, the worker is allowed to refund the customer and refuse service.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/>\n\n==Risks associated with sex work==\n\n===Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)===\nIn countries where sex work is either criminalized or illegal, or both, sex workers face many potential threats of violence. One major threat of violence is the risk that they may contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI) due to their labor and context-dependent barriers that can be either structural (government) or individual (fear) in nature.<ref name=\"Karim, Quarraisha A.\">Karim, Quarraisha A., et al. \"Reducing the Risk of HIV Infection among South African Sex Workers: Socioeconomic and Gender Barriers\". ''American Journal of Public Health''. 1995.</ref> Since street-based violence can be commonplace, this further increases their susceptibility to contracting a disease due to factors such as coercion or rape, as they lack the ability to demand that a condom is used or to refuse service. In addition, the [[World Health Organization]] states that sex workers have been known to be refused health services when seeking out disease prevention and treatment because of the nature of their occupation.<ref name=\"World Health Organization\">World Health Organization. \"Violence against Sex Workers and HIV Prevention\". Information Bulletin Series, 3. 2005.</ref> Furthermore, sex workers are also afraid to seek out health services for problems because of structural barriers that prevent them from knowing about and utilizing services that could teach them better prevention methods.<ref name=\"Kurtz, Steven P., Surratt, Hilary L., Kiley, Marion C., Inciardi, James A.\">Kurtz. Steven P., et al. \"Barriers to Health and Social Services for Street-Based Sex Workers\". ''Journal of Healthcare for the Poor and Undeserved''. 2005.</ref>\n\nA particular example of the disease threats sex workers are faced with can be demonstrated via a study conducted in Cambodia where the rate of HIV has increased. This report studied the prevalence of HIV among a group of indirect sex workers in Cambodia called \"beer promotion girls\", women employed by distributors to promote and sell beers. The study found that they have the highest rate of HIV because they often sell sex as a means of supplementing their salary. This report also found that among indirect sex workers the condom usage rate is lower because they may be getting paid more for sex without condoms. It concluded by explaining how disease prevention campaigns often target direct sex workers, such as those who work in a brothel, and neglect the women in other areas of sex work who are also at risk of contracting STIs.<ref name=\"Cambodia\">Kim, Andrea A., et al. \"High Prevalence of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections among Indirect Sex Workers in Cambodia\". ''Journal of American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association''. December 2005.</ref> Thus, advocates of the legalization/decriminalization of prostitution believe policies need to be designed to target any sex worker who may be in a vulnerable position.<ref name=\"Shannon, Kate, Kerr, Thomas, Allinott, Shari, Chettiar, Jill, Shoveller, Jean, Tyndall, Mark\">Shannon, Kate., et al. \"Social and Structural Violence and Power Relations in Mitigating HIV Risk of Drug-Using Women in Survival Sex Work\".

The report also states that sex workers are even at risk of being harassed, humiliated, and coerced into sex with local [[law enforcement]].<ref name=\"World Health Organization\"/> Although these are some of the common threats that both decriminalizing/legalizing and criminalizing/decriminalizing prostitution hope to address and reduce, another study concludes that the rates of victimization of prostitutes are not nearly as high as some studies claim.<ref name=\"Weitzer\">Weitzer, Ronald. \"The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade\".

It also supports the \"Getting to Zero\" mission, and has found different ways to implement the primary policy initiative, ''Recommendation 200''. This recommendation states that \"Measures be taken in and through the workplace to facilitate access to HIV prevention, treatment, care, and support services for workers, their families, and dependents\".

The goals of these movements are diverse, but generally aim to decriminalize and destigmatize [[sex work]], and ensure fair treatment before legal and cultural forces on a local and international level for all persons in the [[sex industry]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Svati P.|title=Sex Work and Women's Movements|journal=CREA Publication|year=2011}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''sex work'' refers primarily to [[prostitution]], but also encompasses [[adult video]] performers, [[phone sex]] operators, [[webcam model]]s, dancers in [[strip club]]s, and others who provide sexually-related services. Some extend the use of the term to include \"support personnel\" such as managers, agents, videographers, club [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncers]], and others. The debate over sex work is often characterized as an issue of [[women's rights|''women's'' rights]], especially by those who argue that prostitution is inherently oppressive and seek to criminalize it or keep it illegal, but in fact, there are also many male and [[non-binary gender|non-binary]] individuals engaged in providing sexual services. Most sex workers do not wish to be branded as criminals and regard laws against prostitution, pornography, and other parts of the sex industry as violating their rights.\n\nSince the use of red umbrellas by sex workers in [[Venice]], Italy, in 2001\u2014as part of the [[49th Venice Biennale]] of Art\u2014a red umbrella has become the foremost internationally recognized symbol for sex worker rights.<ref name=\"nswp red umbrella\">{{cite web |title=Origins of the Red Umbrella as the Symbol of the Sex Worker Rights Movement |url=https://www.nswp.org/ru/timeline/event/origins-the-red-umbrella-the-symbol-the-sex-worker-rights-movement |website=Global Network of Sex Work Projects |accessdate=14 September 2019 |language=ru |date=28 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"Swan red umbrella\">{{cite web |author1=Aliya |title=The Red Umbrella: What does it symbolize and why is it used by sex workers? {{!}} SWAN |url=http://www.swannet.org/node/782 |website=www.swannet.org |accessdate=14 September 2019 |date=22 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Views==\n===Discrimination and stigmatization===\nIn most countries, even those where sex work is legal, [[sex workers]] of all kinds feel that they are stigmatized and marginalized, and that this prevents them from seeking legal redress for discrimination (for e. g., [[racial discrimination]] by a [[strip club]] owner, dismissal from a teaching position because of involvement in the sex industry), non-payment by a [[Customer|client]], [[assault]], or [[rape]]. Activists also believe that clients of sex workers may also be stigmatized and marginalized, in some cases even more so than sex workers themselves. For instance, in Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, it is illegal to buy sexual acts, but not to sell them (the buyer is said to have committed a crime, but not the prostitute).<ref name=\"Prostitution in Sweden\">Prostitution in Sweden|\"The laws on prostitution in Sweden make it illegal to buy sexual services, but not to sell them.\"</ref>\n\n===Pornography debates===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the main topics in the feminist discourse on women's sexuality were [[pornography]], [[prostitution]], and [[human trafficking]]. This led to the birth of the mobilization for sex worker rights in America. [[Carol Leigh]] is credited with coining the term \"sex work\" in the early 1980s and it was later popularized by a book published in 1989 called ''Sex Work''.<ref name=swaay>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.swaay.org/history.html|work=SWAAY|publisher=SWAAY.org|accessdate=13 March 2014|year=2011}}</ref> Around this time, pornography, in particular, was a prominent debate among feminists campaigning for women's rights. The feminists involved in these debates held opposing views on how to eliminate sexual violence against women, and those involved were either classified as \"liberal feminists\" or \"radical feminists\". A third group of feminists is described as \"pro-sex\" or \"[[sex positive feminism]]\", and this view is considered the true feminist defense of pornography.<ref name=McElroy>{{cite web|last=McElroy|first=Wendy|title=A Feminist Defense of Pornography|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/mcelroy_17_4.html|work=Free Inquiry Magazine, Vol. 17, No. 4|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Radical feminist====\nThe argument of the radical side rests upon the premise that pornography depicts women as subordinates and perpetrates violence against women.<ref name=flood/> Some of the main anti-porn feminists involved in the debates included Page Mellish, [[Andrea Dworkin]], and [[Catharine MacKinnon]]. Dworkin insisted that the oppression of women occurs through sexual subordination, and that in order for [[gender]] equality to exist, subordination must be eliminated. Thus, she states that pornography and prostitution are incompatible with gender equality.<ref name=flood>{{cite book|last=Dworkin|first=Andrea|title=Against the Male Flood: Censorship, Pornography, and Equity|year=1985}}</ref> Similarly, MacKinnon states that [[pornography]] is an act of sexual violence.<ref name=onlywords>{{cite book|last=MacKinnon|first=Catharine A.|title=Only Words|url=https://archive.org/details/onlywords00mack|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> On the grounds that pornography violated women's [[civil rights]], she and Dworkin proposed a law named the \"Anti-Pornography Civil Rights Ordinance\" that allowed women to seek reparations for damages done by pornography through civil courts. Likewise, Page Mellish, the founder of [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] (FFP), believed that issues facing feminists were rooted in pornography. Mellish allied with conservatives in 1992 to fight for the passing of the \"Pornography Victims' Compensation Act\", which was modeled after Dworkin and MacKinnon's ordinance.<ref name=sexexposed>{{cite book|last=Segal|first=Lynn|title=Sex Exposed: Sexuality and the Pornography Debate|year=1993|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=USA}}</ref>\n\n====Liberal feminist====\nContrarily, liberal feminists believe that capitalism allows women to freely make whatever choices they desire. As such, some women freely choose to participate in pornography, as they do in other forms of labour. The main thing that these feminists fight for is anti-censorship, regardless of whether they personally agree with pornography or not.<ref name=\"McElroy\" /> On this side of the debate are feminists such as [[Gayle Rubin]] and Lynn Chancer. Rubin argues that anti-pornography laws could negatively harm sexual minorities such as gays/lesbians, sex workers, and feminists because they would create new problems and modes of abuse resulting from the anti-pornography side's use of a limited amount of porn that demonstrates the most extreme cases of violence such as [[sadomasochism]].<ref name=rubin>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Misguided, Dangerous, and Wrong: an Analysis of Anti-pornography Politics}}</ref><ref name=thinkingsex>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Gayle|title=Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality|url=https://archive.org/details/ThinkingSexNotesForARadicalTheoryOfThePoliticsOfSexuality1984}}</ref> Likewise, Chancer argues that it is possible for such imagery to be able to circulate consensually and lawfully while genuine feelings of pleasure are being experienced without women feeling subordinated.<ref name=chancerporn>{{cite journal|last=Chancer|first=Lynn|title=From Pornography to Sadomasochism: Reconciling Feminist Differences|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=September 2000|volume=571|pages=77\u201388|doi=10.1177/0002716200571001006}}</ref> She also states that some of these feminists believe that pornography is negatively affecting women by leading to violence against women when in actuality it is not. Thus, she concludes that radical feminists are looking at pornography as a quick fix to a much larger societal problem.<ref name=defendingpornography>{{cite journal|last=Lynn|first=Chancer|title=Feminist Offensives: \"Defending Pornography\" and the Splitting of Sex from Sexism|journal=Stanford Law Review|date=February 1996|volume=48|issue=3|pages=739\u2013760|doi=10.2307/1229282|jstor=1229282}}</ref>\n\n====Sex-positive feminist====\nSex-positive feminists believe that no form of sexual expression should be vilified, except that which is not consensual.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=Barbara|title=Identity politics in the women's movement|year=2001|publisher=NYU Press}}</ref> One of the main advocates of this feminist perspective is [[Carol Queen]]. She argues that radical feminists probably generalize too widely as far as women are concerned, and do not take into consideration more complicated circumstances such as [[sadomasochism]] and [[prostitution]]. Elisa Glick also states that configurations of power within relationships do not prevent women from exercising it and that they can be used to enable women to exercise it.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glick|first=Elisa|title=Sex Positive: Feminism, Queer Theory, and the Politics of Transgression|journal=Feminist Review|date=Spring 2000|volume=64|pages=19\u201345|doi=10.1080/014177800338936}}</ref>\n\n====Men on Porn====\nThere is debate on whether the consumption of porn among men is good for their well being, though in a study of over 300 men aged 18 to 73 97% report that they have watched porn, with 94% reporting having done so in the last 6 months and 82% reporting doing so in a manner they would consider \"regularly\".\nMen of all ages report an overall positive experience with porn, though younger men express greater negative than older men- which researchers speculate is because porn skews their perceptions of sex.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Dan J. |last2=Hald |first2=Gert Martin |last3=Kidd |first3=Garry |title=Self-perceived effects of pornography consumption among heterosexual men. |journal=Psychology of Men & Masculinity |date=July 2018 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=469\u2013476 |doi=10.1037/men0000112 |accessdate=21 November 2018|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316802453}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sex Wars\" debate===\nPornography debates provided leeway for the emergence of the \"Sex Wars\" debates, a title assigned by feminist scholars. These debates began in the 1980s and centered upon ways that women were depicted in [[heterosexual]] sexual relations. The main premise of the [[anti-pornography movement]] rests upon the argument that pornography is degrading and [[violent]] towards women. These [[feminists]] also believe that pornography encourages men to behave violently towards women.<ref name=flood /> However, liberal feminists argued that this argument does not take into account the pleasure that women can experience, stating that these arguments could backfire against women and actually subject them to a greater degree of subordination.<ref name=rubin />\n\nThus, the debates started to become centralized on the role of [[dominance and submission|dominance]] within heterosexual relationships and how this dominance is transferred to other areas of women\u2019s lives. These theories of male sexuality and female objectification and sexuality are controversial because they framed later debates about [[human trafficking]], in which coerced workers are distinguished from voluntary workers.<ref name=sexwars>{{cite journal|last=Abrams|first=Kathryn|title=Sex Wars Redux: Agency and Coercion in Feminist Legal Theory|journal=Berkeley Law Scholarship Repository|date=January 1995|pages=304\u2013376}}</ref>\n\n====Human trafficking====\nThe human trafficking debate, a prominent discourse in the 21st century, has materialized as a result of the movement. Current debates center on whether the best way to protect women would be through abolition, criminalization, decriminalization, or legalization.\n\n=====Legalization=====\nSex worker advocates who are fighting for legalization or decriminalization of prostitution contend that criminalizing consensual sex acts among adults creates a black market which worsens the problem of forced human trafficking rather than reducing it. They decry the paternalistic attitude of what they disparagingly call \"rescue missions\", law enforcement raids that regard all sex workers as in need of \"saving\" fail to distinguish the minority of sex workers who are coerced from the vast majority who engage in sex work voluntarily.<ref name=urbanjustice>{{cite web|title=Working Group on Sex Work and Human Rights|url=http://esplerp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Urban-Justice-Difference-between.pdf|work=Urban Justice|accessdate=18 March 2013}}</ref> Furthermore, liberal feminists such as [[Ronald Weitzer]] and [[Gayle Rubin]], argue that the definition of sex work as inherently violent has created a \u201cmoral panic\u201d that influences political discourse.<ref name=thinkingsex /><ref name=\"Moral Panic\" /> They contend that this \"panic\" has led to the construction of a trafficking victim who may actually be a [[Migrant sex work|woman migrating for work]]. These feminists argue that this can backfire because it does not protect those women who voluntarily enter into sex work.<ref name=urbanjustice />\n\n=====Criminalization=====\nOpponents of the sex workers' rights movement, such as [[Melissa Farley]] and [[Janice Raymond]], argue that prostitution should be abolished because legalization can increase incidences of human trafficking. The ''New UN Trafficking Protocol'' by Raymond argues that many victims are trafficked to countries in which sex work is legalized or decriminalized, and because they are trafficked under the guise of migrants they are not protected. Raymond also argues that it is impossible to separate the exploitation experienced by local prostitutes from the exploitative experiences of trafficked prostitutes, as they are very similar. Thus, to end sex slavery, the report declares that everyone involved in sex work needs to be criminalized so that the industry can be abolished.<ref name=traffickingprotocol>{{Cite journal | last = Raymond | first = Janice G. | author-link = Janice Raymond | title = The new UN trafficking protocol | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 5 | pages = 491\u2013502 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-5395(02)00320-5 | date = September\u2013October 2002 | ref = harv }}</ref> Similarly, Farley argues that engagement in voluntary sex work is a decision made by women in the absence of alternative choices,<ref name=\"Farley, Melissa\" /> and that it therefore cannot accurately be described as a voluntary and freely made choice.\n\n==Legality of prostitution==\nMost activists campaigning for the formation of policies that protect sex workers from violence fall into two main categories: abolitionism or criminalization, and legalization or [[decriminalization]].<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\">Brents, Barbara G. and Hausbeck, Kathryn. \"Violence and Legalized Prostitution in Nevada: Examining Safety, Risk and Prostitution Policy\".

Therefore, the only way to effectively prevent violence is to acknowledge this and for government to build policies and laws that deal with the issue through [[regulation]] of the business.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> Legalization/Decriminalization proponents believe that a system that prohibits prostitution creates an [[oppressive]] environment for prostitutes.<ref name=\"Kempadoo, Kamala\">Kempadoo, Kamala. \"Globalizing Sex Workers' Rights\" ''Canadian Women's Studies''. 2003.</ref> Proponents of this view also recommend that policies are built that places restrictions on trafficking and exploitation of sex workers.<ref name=\"Misra, Geetanjali, Mahal, Ajay, Shah, Rima\">Geetanjali, Misra et al. \"Protecting the Rights of Sex Workers: The Indian Experience\". ''Health and Human Rights''. 2000.</ref>\n\n====Support for decriminalization====\n{{main|Decriminalizing sex work}}\nThe legalization of sex work often entails additional restrictions and requirements placed on [[sex workers]] as well as registering with official government offices. Additionally, many activists favor decriminalization over legalization. Decriminalization involves a focus on laws which protect the rights of sex workers, such as those against coercion into or to stay in sex work, while all consensual sexual contact between adult sex workers and adult clients would not be criminalized.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/>\n\nRonald Weitzer, a well-known proponent for the legalization/decriminalization of prostitution, stated that the use of nonscientific evidence about prostitution has contributed to a \"moral panic\" because opponents commonly use the argument that prostitution is inherently violent and unable to be regulated. However, he also claims that other governments have been able to reject this notion and find ways to regulate it and uses Nevada as an example.<ref name=\"Moral Panic\">Weitzer, Ronald. \"The Growing Moral Panic Over Prostitution and Sex Trafficking\".

Therefore, the decriminalization or legalization can be a starting point to addressing these issues.<ref name=\"ProCon\"/>\n\nDecriminalization is supported by academics, human rights organizations, such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], UN agencies, such as [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]], [[World Health Organization|WHO]], and [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], LGBT organizations such as [[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|ILGA]] and [[Lambda Legal]], and anti-trafficking organizations such as the [[Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women]], [[La Strada International Association|La Strada International]], and the Freedom Network USA.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lepp|first=Annalee|last2=Gerasimov|first2=Borislav|date=2019-04-29|title=Editorial: Gains and Challenges in the Global Movement for Sex Workers' Rights|journal=Anti-Trafficking Review|volume=0|issue=12|pages=91\u2013107|doi=10.14197/atr.201219121|issn=2287-0113}}</ref>\n\n==Employment==\nDepending on regional law, sex workers' activities may be regulated, controlled, tolerated, or prohibited. For example, [[prostitution]] is illegal in many countries, but it is fully legalized in several jurisdictions, including the Netherlands, [[Germany]], some [[Australian]] states, and several counties in the US state of [[Nevada]].\n\n===Strip club employment issues===\nIn both Canada and the UK, dancers in [[strip clubs]] are [[independent contractors]] who face significant problems that they are unable to rectify because of their inability to challenge employers through organized action.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/><ref name=\"Now\">{{cite web|title=Bylaws on my stripper's body|url=http://www.nowtoronto.com/news/story.cfm?content=189480|work=NOW Magazine|publisher=In Print|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Brigitte Benoit|date=1\u20138 November 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Lab\">{{cite web|title=Sex Work, the Law and the Labour Movement|url=http://rankandfile.ca/?p=2063|website=RankandFile.ca|accessdate=9 March 2014|author=Kaley Kennedy|date=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Entry fees====\nIn the UK, a study was conducted which inquired about dancers\u2019 experiences to get a better understanding to determine whether or not it could be costly for women to work some nights. It stated that often when the [[Strip club|club]] offered promotions with gimmicks, dancers would be required to work without payment. Furthermore, dancers may be required to promote events without pay as part of the house rules. If they tried to complain, the club owners would threaten to dismiss them. Thus, the study suggests that strip club workers in the UK operate under vulnerable conditions without the capacity to organize for better working conditions. Moreover, the study states that dancers are also required to pay their \u201chouse moms\u201d and the DJs, as well as being pressured to buy drinks for their customers and other dancers, which hampers their profit-making ability.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\">Sanders, Teela and Hardy, Kate. \"Devalued, Deskilled, and Diversified: Explaining the Proliferation of the Strip Industry in the UK\" ''The British Journal of Sociology''.</ref>\n\n====House fees====\nThe fees of dancers\u2019 house fees can be large and sometimes they are not waived or lowered when business is slow. Also, clubs may continue to hire women even during bad economic downturns. Therefore, dancers feel that their earning potential is lowered.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/>\n\n====Commission====\nIn addition to house fees and entry fees, many dancers are not paid for their stage shows because they are considered a part of self-advertisement. This is also considered another rule that comes along with their job description. In the UK, the club generally takes thirty percent commission.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/>\n\n====Fines and tips====\nThe final way clubs make money is through [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s and [[tip (gratuity)|tip]]s. This study found that there could be a fine for something such as chewing gum or having gum in a bag that ranges from twenty to thirty pounds. The most common fines were chewing gum, using cellular phones on the floor, and tardiness. It goes on to say that some dancers may have to pay to take time off. Dancers also tip people that work in the club such as waitresses and doormen in order to get them to direct customers to them. Other reasons that motivate dancers to tip include tipping security so that the dancers will not be fined and tipping DJs to be called during good song and opportune times.<ref name=\"Sanders and Hardy\"/>\n\n====Registration process====\nIn the Canadian city of [[Toronto]], workers must be in possession of an adult entertainer license that is only provided following a criminal record check and the submission of a form. Applicants are initially charged about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]$400 and are required to pay an annual C$270 renewal fee. Municipal bylaws govern the standards that workers must abide by to maintain their license.<ref name=\"Lab\" />\n\n====Unlawful or inappropriate customer behavior====\nA survey undertaken by the Toronto city council in 2012 was for the purpose of informing a reconsideration of the regulations around licensing for strip club-based sex workers. The most significant aspect was a reappraisal of the \u201cno touching\u201d rule so that it specified areas of the body to prevent people from being fined in the event of acceptable casual physical contact. Of those sex workers who responded to the survey, 67 percent stated that they had been sexually assaulted or touched without their consent, while they further documented the responses from their employers: 2 percent called the police, 34 percent asked the customer to leave, 22 percent ignored the incident, 4 percent blamed the stripper and 14 percent dismissed the incidents as part of the job.<ref name=\"Now\" /><ref name=\"Lab\" />\n\n===By country===\n\n====Argentina====\nThe Association of Women Prostitutes of Argentina (AMMAR) was started by Elena Reynaga, who now heads the South American sex workers' network RedTraSex.<ref>[http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2016/8/feministas-somos-todas/ Feministas somos todas], 11 August 2016, La Diaria, Retrieved 7 November 2016</ref> AMMAR leader Sandra Cabrera was killed for her activism in 2004.<ref name=ammar>[http://www.redtrasex.org/spip.php?page=imprimir_articulo&id_article=568 AMMAR remembered Sandra Cabrera], 6 June 2012, redtrasex.org, Retrieved 3 September 2016</ref>\n\n====India====\nOn March 10, 2014, the All India Network of Sex Workers, an umbrella group of sex worker organizations, campaigned for pension rights. Representative of 90 sex worker organisations across 16 Indian states, the Network presented a letter explaining that sex workers in India are not treated equally in social security terms, stating: \"Sex workers, including their family members, can't access various social entitlements which are offered to citizens in general. We consider sex work like any other occupation belonging to the unorganised sector and we should be brought under the universal pension scheme.\" A spokesperson for the Network also informed the media that sex workers in India retire \"by the age of 40-45 years\", an earlier age than the broader population.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sex workers demand basic rights, inclusion in voters list|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/sex-workers-demand-basic-rights-inclusion-in-voters-list-114030300826_1.html|accessdate=14 March 2014|newspaper=Business Standard|date=3 March 2014|author=IANS}}</ref>\n\n====Netherlands====\nA study by [[Janice Raymond]] states that there can be many detrimental consequences to legalizing and decriminalizing prostitution. One consequence mentioned was that prostitution can be seen as a suitable and normal option for the poor. Therefore, poor women can be easily exploited when there is a lack of sexual services which does not lead to their empowerment.<ref name=\"Raymond, Janice \">Raymond, Janice. \"Prostitution on Demand: Legalizing the Buyers as Sexual Customers\". ''Violence Against Women''. 2004.</ref> [[Melissa Farley]] supported this idea with an analysis stating that most women do not rationally decide to enter prostitution; rather, the decision is made as a survival choice and that there are certain circumstances can drive women into the field of prostitution, leaving them with a choice that is more along the lines of voluntary [[slavery]]. Thus, it is merely used as a surviving strategy.<ref name=\"Farley, Melissa\">Farley, Melissa. \"Prostitution, Trafficking, and Cultural Amnesia: What We Must Not Know to Keep the Business of Sexual Exploitation Running Smoothly\". ''Yale Journal of Law and Feminism''. 2006</ref>\n\nFurthermore, Raymond states that businesses in the sex industry are able to offer services to any men which has led to more [[gender inequality]] because women have to accept that prostitution is a new norm. She supported this by saying that even [[disabled]] men are able to receive sexual services, and their [[caregivers]] (mostly women) are required to take them to these establishments and assist them in engaging in sexual acts. Another consequence Raymond mentioned was that child prostitution has increased in the [[Netherlands]]. She suggests this is because the Netherlands has created a prostitution-promoting environment through laws concerning children that make it easier for abusers to use children without penalty. She also adds that the distinction between voluntary and forced prostitution could be detrimental because it can be argued that the thought of someone being forced into prostitution can be exciting for some men because it may be a part of clients' fantasies.<ref name=\"Raymond, Janice \" /> Finally, another study states that the legalization or decriminalization can be detrimental because studies that surveyed sex workers where it is legal concluded that violence is accepted as part of the job with the universal experience of [[Sexual abuse|molestation]] and [[abuse]].<ref name=\"Farley, Melissa\" />\n\n====United States====\n\n=====Hawaii=====\nA decision by the House and the Senate in Hawaii is expected in May 2014 after police agreed in March 2014 not to oppose the revision of a law that was implemented in the 1970s, allowing undercover police officers to engage in sexual relations with sex workers during the course of investigations. Following initial protest from supporters of the legislation, all objections were retracted on March 25, 2014. A Honolulu police spokeswoman informed ''TIME'' magazine that, at the time of the court's decision, no reports had been made in regard to the abuse of the exemption by police, while a Hawaiian senator stated to the media: \"I suppose that in retrospect, the police probably feel somewhat embarrassed about this whole situation.\" However, the Pacifica Alliance to Stop Slavery and other advocates affirmed their knowledge of police brutality in this area and explained that the fear of retribution is the main deterrent for sex workers who seek to report offending officers. At a Hawaiian Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, also in March 2014, an attorney testified that his client was raped three times by Hawaiian police before prostitution was cited as the reason for her subsequent arrest.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hawaii Police Won't Get to Have Sex With Prostitutes Anymore|url=http://time.com/38444/hawaii-police-prostitutes-sex/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=TIME|date=26 March 2014|author=Eliana Dockterman}}</ref>\n\n=====Nevada=====\nBarbara Brents and Kathryn Hausbeck state in their study that the legalization of prostitution in Nevada's brothels allows for improved regulation and protection for both businesses and workers.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> Academic [[Ronald Weitzer]] supports this idea by citing the impact of the numerous safety measures that ensure the safety of the workers.<ref name=\"Weitzer, Ronald\">Weitzer, Ronald. Prostitution: Facts and Fiction. ''Contexts''. 2007.</ref>\n\nBrents and Hausbeck's case study of Nevada's brothels entailed examples of how they believe protection mechanisms were designed to account for the entire process of each individual job\u2014that is the time that a sex worker is with a customer. They started by saying that the negotiation process for sex workers in Nevada requires the use of an intercom during the process so that workers will not betray the business [[owners]] and so that owners can know if the customers are putting the workers at risk. After the price is negotiated, the money is paid and taken out of the room by the sex worker. At that point, the sex workers have the opportunity to let [[security guards]] know if there is anything unsafe or uncomfortable about the situation so that security can be alerted. Another protection mechanism requires security to interrupt the workers after the allotted period of time to demand that the customers either leave or renegotiate the price, so that sex workers are not coerced or forced into providing additional services without a fee. Finally, the study concludes that sex workers are offered protection from one another in brothels because of strictly enforced rules and the relationships that brothels have been able to build with local law enforcement officials.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> According to some legalization supporters, this protection creates an environment that can be empowering for women to work in.<ref name=\"Weitzer, Ronald\"/>\n\nAdditionally, proponents argue that workers must also comply with [[health]] regulations and engage in preventative practices. They state that this compliance leads to a system that becomes mutually advantageous for brothels and sex workers, because a perception of safety by workers is profitable for the brothel.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/> In brothels in Nevada, it is a requirement for sex workers to be tested and verified as healthy. Afterwards, they are required to be checked on a periodic basis for certain STIs. [[Condom]] usage is also mandatory and this is advertised by the brothels so that customers know beforehand. Finally, sex workers are able to examine the customers before any services are given to make sure there are no signs of visible STIs. If there are any suspicions, the worker is allowed to refund the customer and refuse service.<ref name=\"Brents and Hausbeck\"/>\n\n==Risks associated with sex work==\n\n===Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)===\nIn countries where sex work is either criminalized or illegal, or both, sex workers face many potential threats of violence. One major threat of violence is the risk that they may contract a sexually transmitted infection (STI) due to their labor and context-dependent barriers that can be either structural (government) or individual (fear) in nature.<ref name=\"Karim, Quarraisha A.\">Karim, Quarraisha A., et al. \"Reducing the Risk of HIV Infection among South African Sex Workers: Socioeconomic and Gender Barriers\". ''American Journal of Public Health''. 1995.</ref> Since street-based violence can be commonplace, this further increases their susceptibility to contracting a disease due to factors such as coercion or rape, as they lack the ability to demand that a condom is used or to refuse service. In addition, the [[World Health Organization]] states that sex workers have been known to be refused health services when seeking out disease prevention and treatment because of the nature of their occupation.<ref name=\"World Health Organization\">World Health Organization. \"Violence against Sex Workers and HIV Prevention\". Information Bulletin Series, 3. 2005.</ref> Furthermore, sex workers are also afraid to seek out health services for problems because of structural barriers that prevent them from knowing about and utilizing services that could teach them better prevention methods.<ref name=\"Kurtz, Steven P., Surratt, Hilary L., Kiley, Marion C., Inciardi, James A.\">Kurtz. Steven P., et al. \"Barriers to Health and Social Services for Street-Based Sex Workers\". ''Journal of Healthcare for the Poor and Undeserved''. 2005.</ref>\n\nA particular example of the disease threats sex workers are faced with can be demonstrated via a study conducted in Cambodia where the rate of HIV has increased. This report studied the prevalence of HIV among a group of indirect sex workers in Cambodia called \"beer promotion girls\", women employed by distributors to promote and sell beers. The study found that they have the highest rate of HIV because they often sell sex as a means of supplementing their salary. This report also found that among indirect sex workers the condom usage rate is lower because they may be getting paid more for sex without condoms. It concluded by explaining how disease prevention campaigns often target direct sex workers, such as those who work in a brothel, and neglect the women in other areas of sex work who are also at risk of contracting STIs.<ref name=\"Cambodia\">Kim, Andrea A., et al. \"High Prevalence of HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections among Indirect Sex Workers in Cambodia\".

The report also states that sex workers are even at risk of being harassed, humiliated, and coerced into sex with local [[law enforcement]].<ref name=\"World Health Organization\"/> Although these are some of the common threats that both decriminalizing/legalizing and criminalizing/decriminalizing prostitution hope to address and reduce, another study concludes that the rates of victimization of prostitutes are not nearly as high as some studies claim.<ref name=\"Weitzer\">Weitzer, Ronald. \"The Social Construction of Sex Trafficking: Ideology and Institutionalization of a Moral Crusade\".

It is very important for a teacher to be healthy .Because it has been said that a healthy mind can live in a healthy body.\n\n=== [https://www.voiceofteacher.com/ Yoga In School by Teachers] ===\nIf the teacher is healthy only then he can give good education to his students. If a teacher has to be healthy, he should be fully involved in the activities conducted in the morning assembly. Morning assembly conducted in our schools is divided into various activities, it also includes yoga ,workout, PT etc.\n\n=== [[School Games|Schools Game]] ===\nIf the teachers want to remain healthy they should involve in these activities in our schools. In our schools there is a game period according to the class, the teachers<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voiceofteacher.com/|title=voice of teachers {{!}} Dedicated To The Service Of Teaching Community|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> should participate with their students in this period.\n\n=== Eating Habits ===\nA healthy teacher can develop good qualities in his students. The teachers have to pa<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voiceofteacher.com/|title=voice of teachers {{!}} Dedicated To The Service Of Teaching Community|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>y special attention to their eating habits . If the teacher himself eats nutritious food then he will teach his students to eat nutritious food because one person who eats junk food cannot tell the benefits of balanced food to another.\n\n=== Ancient Education System ===\nThe ancient education system also motivates the teacher to lead a simple and healthy life. In the old days, the teachers gave education to their students in the ashrams.Because they wanted to give a good education as well as a healthy life.\n\n=== Education with Technology ===\nNowadays in this age of technology, a teacher should give good education to his students, along with good health .This is possible only if the teacher should be healthy. Then he can give good education<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voiceofteacher.com/|title=voice of teachers {{!}} Dedicated To The Service Of Teaching Community|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> to his students.\n\nTeacher's Wellness We keep talking about how important health, hygiene and overall wellness of a student is and how one must achieve it. The education system ensures that students, from a young age, are instilled with the idea of taking in a proper balanced diet and having a healthy lifestyle. Hence, the students' wellness has found its way into academic textbooks and in the school\u2019s extra curriculum.\n\nTeacher's Wellness Gets reflected on the Students' Wellness\n\nA teacher's wellness gets reflected on the students' wellness. Let us know how.\n\nTeachers are likely to be the first role models any student would have. Students tend to walk on their role model\u2019s footsteps and imitate them. Teachers, who establish a healthy work/life balance, have more energy and serve as healthy lifestyle role models for their students. Healthy children are fast learners.\n\n=== Health and Aware ===\nHealthy and aware teachers promote healthy behaviors and practices among students, who then emulate these behaviors into their own lifestyle and engage in more health-promoting activities. Hence, one sees a simple two step chain with the philosophy, that whatever the teacher or role model does is easily adopted by the students.\n\n== Healthy employees ==\nHealthy employees are a crucial component of a happy and progressive school. A healthy and stress free workplace makes for satisfied and high performing employees. Such school employees are more likely to be happy in their position of work and tend to stay longer. They display good attendance records and take fewer leaves, thus providing the stability and continued development which is very essential for Educational Success.\n\n=== Health of Teachers Beneficial for Schools ===\nIt is very beneficial for schools to carry out workplace wellness programs that cover all school staff.\n\nBy creating a culture of healthy lifestyle - Teachers should be physically active. He eating healthy foods and carries out hygienic practices, wellness programs improve employee morale and increase an individual focusing ability, among many other benefits.\n\n=== Physical Activity into the Classrooms ===\nTeachers have essential duties for good education. They also contribute to both the stability of society and the further development of future generations. Both numbers of teachers, who have a broadly comparable duty profile and qualification level, and their employment structure are relevant to medical care\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nAlthough German law mandates the medical care of persons in the teaching professions by Occupational physicians, this requirement is implemented to varying extents in the different German federal states. Teachers need qualified, Disciplinary occupational health care with the involvement of their treating physicians.\n\nTeachers\u2019 health problems\n\nThe statements made on the subject of teachers\u2019 health are dependent on which diagnostic tools are used and which threshold values are used to classify health issues. In addition, objective data in the form of clinical diagnoses is rarely obtained for this professional group; questionnaires and self-reporting on health are the norm. \n\n== International Studies ==\nThis is also true of international studies. There is considerable variation in figures on the frequency of subjective health problems in teachers. work on the premise that healthy teachers with few or no complaints are a minority in Germany. In Austria, 14% of teachers rate their health as excellent, and 37% as very good. found no illness in 28% of teachers. According to collected information, at least 20% of teachers have severe health problems and therefore very limited work performance. \n\n== screening examinations ==\nHowever, screening examinations have shown that teachers differ from the general population in that they have less marked cardiovascular risk factors such as excess weight, metabolic disorders, and smoking, and behave more health-conscious, particularly regarding sport and physical activity\n\n==References==\n* ''Marathyanchya Itihasachi Sadhane'' \u2013 [[V.K.Rajwade]].\n*Tanaji - The movie. 2020<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manjule, Nagraj Popatrao, film director, screenwriter.

''Senakhaskhel'' means Upasenapati (Sub-commander). In English, ''''Senakhaskhel'''' translates to 'a leader of the sovereign tribe'. A ''Senakhaskhel'' has permission to keep an army. [[Chhatrapati]] gave Jahagir or Watan to Senakhaskhel the salary of an army, called the 'Fauz Saranjam'(Army accouterments). In a time of war, ''Senakhaskhel'' came with his army by order of Chhatrapati.\n\n==References==\n* ''Marathyanchya Itihasachi Sadhane'' \u2013 [[V.K.Rajwade]].\n*Tanaji - The movie. 2020<ref>{{Cite book|last=Manjule, Nagraj Popatrao, film director, screenwriter.

It continued operating overseas services throughout World War II. After the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1946, European and South American services passed to two further state-owned airlines, [[British European Airways]] (BEA) and [[British South American Airways]] (BSAA). BOAC absorbed BSAA in 1949, but BEA continued to operate British domestic and European routes for the next quarter century. A 1971 [[Act of Parliament]] merged BOAC and BEA, effective 31 March 1974, forming today's [[British Airways]].<ref name=flight28sep67>{{citation |title=World Airline Directory |magazine=[[Flight International]] |date=28 September 1967 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201932.html?search=%22British%20Overseas%22 |page=530 |access-date=14 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311050851/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201932.html?search=%22British%20Overseas%22 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===War years===\nOn 24 November 1939, BOAC was created by Act of Parliament to become the British state airline, formed from the merger of [[Imperial Airways]] and [[British Airways Ltd]]. The companies had been operating together since war was declared on 3 September 1939, when their operations were evacuated from the London area to [[Bristol]]. On 1 April 1940, BOAC started operations as a single company. Following the [[Fall of France]] (22 June 1940), BOAC aircraft kept wartime Britain connected with its colonies and the allied world, often under enemy fire, and initially with desperate shortages of long-range aircraft. During the war, the airline was sometimes loosely referred to as 'British Airways', and aircraft and equipment were marked with combinations of that title and/or the [[Speedbird]] symbol and/or the [[Union Flag]].<ref name=flight28sep67/>\n[[File:BOAC Boeing Model 314A Clipper on Lagos Lagoon.jpg|thumb|A BOAC [[Boeing 314 Clipper]] lands on Lagos Lagoon, 1943]]\nBOAC inherited Imperial Airways' [[flying boat]] services to [[British Empire|British colonies]] in Africa and Asia, but with the wartime loss of the route over [[Italy]] and [[France]] to [[Cairo]] these were replaced by the expatriate '[[Horseshoe Route]]', with Cairo as a hub, and [[Sydney]] and [[Durban]] as termini. Linking Britain to the Horseshoe Route taxed the resources of BOAC. Although [[Spain]] denied access, [[Portugal]] welcomed BOAC's civilian aircraft at [[Lisbon]]. However, the [[Mediterranean]] route from Lisbon or [[Gibraltar]] to Egypt via [[Malta]] risked enemy attack, so the long [[West Africa]] route had to be employed (over-water via Lisbon, [[Banjul|Bathurst]], [[Freetown]], [[Lagos]]), then by landplane to [[Khartoum]] on the Horseshoe Route. The [[British Empire|Empire]] routes had contained landplane sectors, but the [[Armstrong Whitworth Ensign]] and [[de Havilland Albatross]] ordered to replace the [[Handley Page HP.42]] 'Heracles' biplanes had proved disappointing, leaving the [[Short Empire]] flying boats as the backbone of the wartime fleet. (Only a handful of these had long range tanks but many were eventually upgraded with larger tankage and operated at overload weights).\n\nThe Empire flying-boats were at their limit on the 1,900-mile Lisbon-Bathurst sector. Refuelling at [[Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]] was permitted by Spain for some Empire flying-boat flights in 1940 and 1941. In 1941 longer range [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Consolidated Catalina]]s, [[Boeing 314]]As (and later converted [[Short Sunderland]]s) were introduced to guarantee non-stop Lisbon to Bathurst sectors (thus eliminating the need to refuel at Las Palmas). BOAC's flying-boat base for Britain was shifted from [[Southampton]] to [[Poole]], [[Dorset]], but many flights used [[Foynes]] in [[\u00c9ire]] (Ireland), reached by shuttle flight from Whitchurch. Use of Foynes reduced the chance of enemy interception or friendly fire incidents over the [[English Channel]]. BOAC had large bases at [[Durban]], [[Asmara]], [[Alexandria]] and a pilots' school at [[Soroti]], [[Uganda]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nExperimental flights had been made across the North Atlantic pre-war by Imperial Airways Empire flying-boats with improved fuel capacity, some using in flight refuelling, culminating in a series of mail/courier flights made by BOAC's ''Clare'' and ''Clyde'' to La Guardia in camouflage during the [[Battle of Britain]]. These were BOAC's first New York services. In 1941, BOAC was tasked with operating a 'Return Ferry Service' from Prestwick to Montreal to reposition [[RAF Ferry Command|ferry pilots]] who had flown American-built bombers from Canada, and they were provided with RAF [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberators]] with a very basic passenger conversion. This was the first sustained North Atlantic landplane service. \nBy September 1944 BOAC had made 1,000 transatlantic crossings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201325.html|title=imperial airways - 1946 - 1325 - Flight Archive|accessdate=7 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001110/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201325.html|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1942, the new hard-surface airport at Lisbon permitted the use of civil registered Liberators to North and West Africa and Egypt.\nArguably, BOAC's most famous wartime route was the '[[Ball-bearing Run]]' from [[Leuchars Station|Leuchars]] to Stockholm ([[Stockholm Bromma Airport|Bromma]]) in [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Sweden]]. Initially flown with [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14]]s and [[Lockheed Hudson]] transports, the unsuitable [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] \"civilianised\" bombers were also used between 9 August and 24 October 1942 (\"Civilianised\" meant that all the armaments and unnecessary guns and turrets had been removed, a legal requirement for operating a commercial civilian service to a neutral country). The much faster civilian registered [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es were introduced by BOAC in 1943. The significance of the ball-bearings is debatable, but these night flights were an important diplomatic gesture of support for neutral Sweden which had two DC-3s shot down on its own service to Britain. Other types used to Sweden included [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|Lockheed Lodestars]], Consolidated Liberators, and the sole [[Curtiss C-46|Curtiss CW-20]] (C-46 prototype) which BOAC had purchased; these types had more payload, and some had the range to avoid the German-controlled [[Skaggerak]] direct route.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nBetween 1939 and 1945 6,000 passengers were transported by BOAC between Stockholm and Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html|title=southern africa - albert hall - jack savage - 1945 - 1929 - Flight Archive|accessdate=7 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709055149/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html|archive-date=9 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Early post-war operations===\n[[File:Avro 685 York G-AGSP BOAC LAP 02.06.53 edited-1.jpg|thumb|BOAC Avro York freighter operating a scheduled service at Heathrow in 1953]]\n[[File:Short Solent at Poole.jpg|thumb|BOAC Short Solent 3 G-AHIN ''Southampton'' served the airline's route from the UK along the Nile to Johannesburg between 1948 and 1950]]\n[[File:BOAC C-4 Argonaut Heathrow 1954.jpg|thumb|BOAC DC-4M-4 Argonaut G-ALHS \"Astra\" at London Airport (Heathrow) in September 1954]]\n[[File:Lockheed L049 C-69C G-AKCE BOAC LHR 12.09.54.jpg|thumb|left|The sole C-69C after civilianisation for BOAC as a Lockheed 049E at [[London Heathrow]] in 1954]]\nAt the end of the war, BOAC's fleet consisted of Lockheed Lodestars, lend-lease [[Douglas DC-3]]s, Liberators, converted Sunderlands, and the first [[Avro Lancastrian]]s, [[Avro York]]s, and [[Handley Page Halifax|Handley Page Haltons]]. The Short Empire, [[Short S.26]] and Boeing 314A flying boats, plus the AW Ensigns, were due to be withdrawn. The Corporation's aircraft, bases and personnel were scattered around the world, and it took a decade to reorganise it into an efficient unit at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]. In 1943, the [[Brabazon Committee]] had laid down a set of civil aircraft transport types for the British aircraft industry to produce, but these were to be several years in coming, and particularly in the case of the tailwheel [[Avro Tudor]], not what BOAC wanted.\n\nSince 1941, the advanced pressurised [[Lockheed Constellation]] had been under development, and in 1946 BOAC was permitted to use dollars to purchase an initial fleet of five for the prestigious North Atlantic route (there were no equivalent British types available). Throughout the whole of BOAC's existence, the argument over buying American or (often delayed) British products continued, and Parliament, the press, British manufacturers and the unions accused BOAC management of only wanting American aircraft. Whilst the major world airlines abandoned flying-boats at the end of WWII, BOAC continued with theirs until 1950, and even introduced the new [[Short Solent]] on the leisurely Nile route to South Africa. In 1948, the unpressurised Yorks were still operating passenger services as far afield as [[Nairobi]] (Kenya), [[Accra]] (Gold Coast, later Ghana), [[Delhi]] and [[Calcutta]] (India), and the type continued to operate freight schedules until late 1957.<ref>Jackson, 1990, p. 379.</ref>\n\nAfter its first six Lockheed 049 Constellations, BOAC had to use some ingenuity to increase its Constellation fleet. In 1947, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] bought five new Lockheed 749 Constellations, and prepared to launch a transatlantic service with assistance and crew-training from Captains O.P. Jones and J.C. Kelly-Rogers of BOAC. The project was abandoned in February 1948, and BOAC were able to buy the almost new 749s without dollar expenditure four months later. This enabled BOAC to serve Australia with Constellations from 1949. A total of 25 Constellations passed through the BOAC fleet, including 12 749As obtained from Capital Airlines in the mid-1950s, with BOAC's older 049s in part exchange.\n\nBOAC was also permitted to spend dollars on six new [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]]s for its key transatlantic routes from October 1949, offering a double-deck non-stop eastbound service from New York City to London Airport (later Heathrow). However, because of the prevailing westerly winds, the westbound flights needed re-fuelling at Shannon and Gander before reaching New York. Another four Stratocruisers were taken over from a frustrated SAS order and seven were bought secondhand in the mid-1950s. The [[Handley Page Hermes]] and [[Canadair North Star|Canadair DC-4M ''Argonaut'']] joined the BOAC fleet between 1949 and 1950, replacing the last of the non-pressurised types on passenger services. When service entry of the [[Bristol Britannia]] was delayed in late 1956, BOAC was permitted to purchase ten new [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs. These long-range aircraft enabled BOAC to operate non-stop westbound flights from London and Manchester to New York and other US East Coast destinations,<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|1998|p=86}}</ref> in competition with DC-7Cs of [[Pan American World Airways]] and Lockheed Super Constellations of [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA). This was the first purchase of aircraft direct from the Douglas Aircraft Company in BOAC's history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Introduction of jets===\n[[File:DH Comet 1 BOAC Heathrow 1953.jpg|thumb|left|BOAC [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]] 1 at Heathrow in 1953]]\n[[File:DH.106 Comet 4 G-APDG BOAC RWY 23.12.63 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|BOAC Comet 4 in 1963.]]\nIn May 1952 BOAC was the first airline to introduce a [[passenger jet]] into airline service. This was the [[de Havilland Comet]] which flew via Nairobi to Johannesburg and via the Far East to Tokyo. All Comet 1 aircraft were grounded in April 1954 after four Comets crashed, the second last being a BOAC aircraft at altitude. Examination of the wreckage recovered from the Mediterranean sea-bed and observation of a sample fuselage in a pressurisation test-tank at Farnborough revealed that the repeated pressurisation / depressurisation cycles of airline operation could cause fatigue cracks in the thin aluminium alloy skin of the Comet leading to the skins ripping away explosively at altitude and disintegration of the aircraft.\n\nLater jet airliners including the revised Comet 4 were designed to be fail-safe: in the event of, for example, a skin-failure due to cracking the damage would be localised and not catastrophic. In October 1958 BOAC operated the first transatlantic jet service with the larger and longer-range Comet 4. In the 1950s turbine powered airliners were developing rapidly, and the Comet and the seriously delayed [[Bristol Britannia]] were soon rendered obsolescent by the flight of the [[Swept wing|swept-wing]] [[Boeing 367-80|Boeing 367\u201380]] (707 prototype) in 1954.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n{{Rail freight\n|title=Revenue Passenger-Kilometres, scheduled flights only, in millions\n|1947|456\n|1950|845\n|1955|1,610\n|1960|3,765\n|1965|7,029\n|1969|9,682\n|1971|11,444\n|source=ICAO Digest of Statistics for 1947\u201355, IATA World Air Transport Statistics 1960\u20131971\n}}\n\nIn 1953 Vickers had started building the swept wing [[Vickers V-1000|VC-7/V-1000]] with [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]] engines, but BOAC short-sightedly decided the Britannia and Comet 4 would be adequate for its purposes, and when the military version of the V-1000 was cancelled in 1955 the 75% complete prototype was scrapped. In October 1956 BOAC ordered 15 [[Boeing 707]]s with Conway engines (briefly the most economical commercial engine option). They entered service in 1960. (The British airworthiness authorities insisted on tail-fin modifications which Boeing made available to all 707 users.)

On 22 April 1970 BOAC received its first 747, but the aircraft did not enter commercial service until 14 April 1971 due to BOAC's inability to settle crewing and pay rates with the [[British Air Line Pilots Association|British Air Line Pilots' Association]]. BOAC's successor British Airways later became the largest Boeing customer outside North America.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Merger with BEA===\n\nThe first attempt at a merger of BOAC with BEA arose in 1953 out of inconclusive attempts between the two airlines to negotiate air rights through the British colony of [[Cyprus]]. The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of the idea as a potential solution to a disagreement between the two airlines as to which should serve the increasingly important oil regions of the [[Middle East]], and he had backing for his proposal from the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time, [[Rab Butler]]. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the idea, and an agreement was reached instead to allow BEA to serve [[Ankara]] in [[Turkey]], and in return to leave all routes east and south of Cyprus to BOAC. Paradoxically, through its effective control of [[Cyprus Airways]], BEA was able to continue to serve destinations ceded to BOAC, including Beirut and Cairo by using Cyprus Airways as its proxy.<ref>Robin Higham, ''Speedbird: The Complete History of BOAC'' (London: IB Tauris, 2013) p.117</ref>\n\nHowever, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, combining BEA and BOAC, was constituted on 1 April 1972.<ref>''Airliner World (Cambrian Airways \u2013 The Welsh Dragon: New routes and turboprops)'', Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, September 2012, p. 71</ref> This event coincided with the establishment of the CAA, the UK's new, unified regulator for the air transport industry.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200681.html |title=Enter the CAA |work=Flight International |date=30 March 1972 |page=439 |accessdate=16 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225093015/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200681.html |archive-date=25 December 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nBOAC would have become one of the first operators of the [[Concorde]], had it not merged to become British Airways.

The aircraft was en route from London to New York when, on approach to an intermediate stop at Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. A number of factors The crash was attributed to a number of factors, including pilot fatigue (the captain was well over his duty limit due to the flight being delayed), the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for landing lights (which may have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall.<ref>{{ASN accident|title= G-ALSA|id= 19541225-0|accessdate= {{date|2010-11-18}}}}</ref>\n* On 21 September 1955, [[Canadair North Star|Canadair Argonaut]] G-ALHL crashed during a storm at [[Tripoli International Airport]] after a flight from London and Rome.

A 1971 [[Act of Parliament]] merged BOAC and BEA, effective 31 March 1974, forming today's [[British Airways]].<ref name=flight28sep67>{{citation |title=World Airline Directory |magazine=[[Flight International]] |date=28 September 1967 |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201932.html?search=%22British%20Overseas%22 |page=530 |access-date=14 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311050851/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1967/1967%20-%201932.html?search=%22British%20Overseas%22 |archive-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===War years===\nOn 24 November 1939, BOAC was created by Act of Parliament to become the British state airline, formed from the merger of [[Imperial Airways]] and [[British Airways Ltd]]. The companies had been operating together since war was declared on 3 September 1939, when their operations were evacuated from the London area to [[Bristol]]. On 1 April 1940, BOAC started operations as a single company. Following the [[Fall of France]] (22 June 1940), BOAC aircraft kept wartime Britain connected with its colonies and the allied world, often under enemy fire, and initially with desperate shortages of long-range aircraft. During the war, the airline was sometimes loosely referred to as 'British Airways', and aircraft and equipment were marked with combinations of that title and/or the [[Speedbird]] symbol and/or the [[Union Flag]].<ref name=flight28sep67/>\n[[File:BOAC Boeing Model 314A Clipper on Lagos Lagoon.jpg|thumb|A BOAC [[Boeing 314 Clipper]] lands on Lagos Lagoon, 1943]]\nBOAC inherited Imperial Airways' [[flying boat]] services to [[British Empire|British colonies]] in Africa and Asia, but with the wartime loss of the route over [[Italy]] and [[France]] to [[Cairo]] these were replaced by the expatriate '[[Horseshoe Route]]', with Cairo as a hub, and [[Sydney]] and [[Durban]] as termini. Linking Britain to the Horseshoe Route taxed the resources of BOAC. Although [[Spain]] denied access, [[Portugal]] welcomed BOAC's civilian aircraft at [[Lisbon]]. However, the [[Mediterranean]] route from Lisbon or [[Gibraltar]] to Egypt via [[Malta]] risked enemy attack, so the long [[West Africa]] route had to be employed (over-water via Lisbon, [[Banjul|Bathurst]], [[Freetown]], [[Lagos]]), then by landplane to [[Khartoum]] on the Horseshoe Route. The [[British Empire|Empire]] routes had contained landplane sectors, but the [[Armstrong Whitworth Ensign]] and [[de Havilland Albatross]] ordered to replace the [[Handley Page HP.42]] 'Heracles' biplanes had proved disappointing, leaving the [[Short Empire]] flying boats as the backbone of the wartime fleet. (Only a handful of these had long range tanks but many were eventually upgraded with larger tankage and operated at overload weights).\n\nThe Empire flying-boats were at their limit on the 1,900-mile Lisbon-Bathurst sector. Refuelling at [[Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]] was permitted by Spain for some Empire flying-boat flights in 1940 and 1941. In 1941 longer range [[Consolidated PBY Catalina|Consolidated Catalina]]s, [[Boeing 314]]As (and later converted [[Short Sunderland]]s) were introduced to guarantee non-stop Lisbon to Bathurst sectors (thus eliminating the need to refuel at Las Palmas). BOAC's flying-boat base for Britain was shifted from [[Southampton]] to [[Poole]], [[Dorset]], but many flights used [[Foynes]] in [[\u00c9ire]] (Ireland), reached by shuttle flight from Whitchurch. Use of Foynes reduced the chance of enemy interception or friendly fire incidents over the [[English Channel]]. BOAC had large bases at [[Durban]], [[Asmara]], [[Alexandria]] and a pilots' school at [[Soroti]], [[Uganda]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nExperimental flights had been made across the North Atlantic pre-war by Imperial Airways Empire flying-boats with improved fuel capacity, some using in flight refuelling, culminating in a series of mail/courier flights made by BOAC's ''Clare'' and ''Clyde'' to La Guardia in camouflage during the [[Battle of Britain]]. These were BOAC's first New York services. In 1941, BOAC was tasked with operating a 'Return Ferry Service' from Prestwick to Montreal to reposition [[RAF Ferry Command|ferry pilots]] who had flown American-built bombers from Canada, and they were provided with RAF [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|Consolidated Liberators]] with a very basic passenger conversion. This was the first sustained North Atlantic landplane service. \nBy September 1944 BOAC had made 1,000 transatlantic crossings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201325.html|title=imperial airways - 1946 - 1325 - Flight Archive|accessdate=7 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221001110/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1946/1946%20-%201325.html|archive-date=21 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn late 1942, the new hard-surface airport at Lisbon permitted the use of civil registered Liberators to North and West Africa and Egypt.\nArguably, BOAC's most famous wartime route was the '[[Ball-bearing Run]]' from [[Leuchars Station|Leuchars]] to Stockholm ([[Stockholm Bromma Airport|Bromma]]) in [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[Sweden]]. Initially flown with [[Lockheed Model 14 Super Electra|Lockheed 14]]s and [[Lockheed Hudson]] transports, the unsuitable [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley]] \"civilianised\" bombers were also used between 9 August and 24 October 1942 (\"Civilianised\" meant that all the armaments and unnecessary guns and turrets had been removed, a legal requirement for operating a commercial civilian service to a neutral country). The much faster civilian registered [[de Havilland Mosquito]]es were introduced by BOAC in 1943. The significance of the ball-bearings is debatable, but these night flights were an important diplomatic gesture of support for neutral Sweden which had two DC-3s shot down on its own service to Britain. Other types used to Sweden included [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|Lockheed Lodestars]], Consolidated Liberators, and the sole [[Curtiss C-46|Curtiss CW-20]] (C-46 prototype) which BOAC had purchased; these types had more payload, and some had the range to avoid the German-controlled [[Skaggerak]] direct route.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nBetween 1939 and 1945 6,000 passengers were transported by BOAC between Stockholm and Great Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html|title=southern africa - albert hall - jack savage - 1945 - 1929 - Flight Archive|accessdate=7 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709055149/https://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1945/1945%20-%201929.html|archive-date=9 July 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Early post-war operations===\n[[File:Avro 685 York G-AGSP BOAC LAP 02.06.53 edited-1.jpg|thumb|BOAC Avro York freighter operating a scheduled service at Heathrow in 1953]]\n[[File:Short Solent at Poole.jpg|thumb|BOAC Short Solent 3 G-AHIN ''Southampton'' served the airline's route from the UK along the Nile to Johannesburg between 1948 and 1950]]\n[[File:BOAC C-4 Argonaut Heathrow 1954.jpg|thumb|BOAC DC-4M-4 Argonaut G-ALHS \"Astra\" at London Airport (Heathrow) in September 1954]]\n[[File:Lockheed L049 C-69C G-AKCE BOAC LHR 12.09.54.jpg|thumb|left|The sole C-69C after civilianisation for BOAC as a Lockheed 049E at [[London Heathrow]] in 1954]]\nAt the end of the war, BOAC's fleet consisted of Lockheed Lodestars, lend-lease [[Douglas DC-3]]s, Liberators, converted Sunderlands, and the first [[Avro Lancastrian]]s, [[Avro York]]s, and [[Handley Page Halifax|Handley Page Haltons]]. The Short Empire, [[Short S.26]] and Boeing 314A flying boats, plus the AW Ensigns, were due to be withdrawn. The Corporation's aircraft, bases and personnel were scattered around the world, and it took a decade to reorganise it into an efficient unit at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]]. In 1943, the [[Brabazon Committee]] had laid down a set of civil aircraft transport types for the British aircraft industry to produce, but these were to be several years in coming, and particularly in the case of the tailwheel [[Avro Tudor]], not what BOAC wanted.\n\nSince 1941, the advanced pressurised [[Lockheed Constellation]] had been under development, and in 1946 BOAC was permitted to use dollars to purchase an initial fleet of five for the prestigious North Atlantic route (there were no equivalent British types available). Throughout the whole of BOAC's existence, the argument over buying American or (often delayed) British products continued, and Parliament, the press, British manufacturers and the unions accused BOAC management of only wanting American aircraft. Whilst the major world airlines abandoned flying-boats at the end of WWII, BOAC continued with theirs until 1950, and even introduced the new [[Short Solent]] on the leisurely Nile route to South Africa. In 1948, the unpressurised Yorks were still operating passenger services as far afield as [[Nairobi]] (Kenya), [[Accra]] (Gold Coast, later Ghana), [[Delhi]] and [[Calcutta]] (India), and the type continued to operate freight schedules until late 1957.<ref>Jackson, 1990, p. 379.</ref>\n\nAfter its first six Lockheed 049 Constellations, BOAC had to use some ingenuity to increase its Constellation fleet. In 1947, Aerl\u00ednte \u00c9ireann in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] bought five new Lockheed 749 Constellations, and prepared to launch a transatlantic service with assistance and crew-training from Captains O.P. Jones and J.C. Kelly-Rogers of BOAC. The project was abandoned in February 1948, and BOAC were able to buy the almost new 749s without dollar expenditure four months later. This enabled BOAC to serve Australia with Constellations from 1949. A total of 25 Constellations passed through the BOAC fleet, including 12 749As obtained from Capital Airlines in the mid-1950s, with BOAC's older 049s in part exchange.\n\nBOAC was also permitted to spend dollars on six new [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]]s for its key transatlantic routes from October 1949, offering a double-deck non-stop eastbound service from New York City to London Airport (later Heathrow). However, because of the prevailing westerly winds, the westbound flights needed re-fuelling at Shannon and Gander before reaching New York. Another four Stratocruisers were taken over from a frustrated SAS order and seven were bought secondhand in the mid-1950s. The [[Handley Page Hermes]] and [[Canadair North Star|Canadair DC-4M ''Argonaut'']] joined the BOAC fleet between 1949 and 1950, replacing the last of the non-pressurised types on passenger services. When service entry of the [[Bristol Britannia]] was delayed in late 1956, BOAC was permitted to purchase ten new [[Douglas DC-7]]Cs. These long-range aircraft enabled BOAC to operate non-stop westbound flights from London and Manchester to New York and other US East Coast destinations,<ref>{{Harvnb|Scholefield|1998|p=86}}</ref> in competition with DC-7Cs of [[Pan American World Airways]] and Lockheed Super Constellations of [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA). This was the first purchase of aircraft direct from the Douglas Aircraft Company in BOAC's history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n===Introduction of jets===\n[[File:DH Comet 1 BOAC Heathrow 1953.jpg|thumb|left|BOAC [[de Havilland Comet|Comet]] 1 at Heathrow in 1953]]\n[[File:DH.106 Comet 4 G-APDG BOAC RWY 23.12.63 edited-2.jpg|thumb|left|BOAC Comet 4 in 1963.]]\nIn May 1952 BOAC was the first airline to introduce a [[passenger jet]] into airline service. This was the [[de Havilland Comet]] which flew via Nairobi to Johannesburg and via the Far East to Tokyo. All Comet 1 aircraft were grounded in April 1954 after four Comets crashed, the second last being a BOAC aircraft at altitude. Examination of the wreckage recovered from the Mediterranean sea-bed and observation of a sample fuselage in a pressurisation test-tank at Farnborough revealed that the repeated pressurisation / depressurisation cycles of airline operation could cause fatigue cracks in the thin aluminium alloy skin of the Comet leading to the skins ripping away explosively at altitude and disintegration of the aircraft.\n\nLater jet airliners including the revised Comet 4 were designed to be fail-safe: in the event of, for example, a skin-failure due to cracking the damage would be localised and not catastrophic. In October 1958 BOAC operated the first transatlantic jet service with the larger and longer-range Comet 4. In the 1950s turbine powered airliners were developing rapidly, and the Comet and the seriously delayed [[Bristol Britannia]] were soon rendered obsolescent by the flight of the [[Swept wing|swept-wing]] [[Boeing 367-80|Boeing 367\u201380]] (707 prototype) in 1954.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n{{Rail freight\n|title=Revenue Passenger-Kilometres, scheduled flights only, in millions\n|1947|456\n|1950|845\n|1955|1,610\n|1960|3,765\n|1965|7,029\n|1969|9,682\n|1971|11,444\n|source=ICAO Digest of Statistics for 1947\u201355, IATA World Air Transport Statistics 1960\u20131971\n}}\n\nIn 1953 Vickers had started building the swept wing [[Vickers V-1000|VC-7/V-1000]] with [[Rolls-Royce Conway]] [[turbofan]] engines, but BOAC short-sightedly decided the Britannia and Comet 4 would be adequate for its purposes, and when the military version of the V-1000 was cancelled in 1955 the 75% complete prototype was scrapped. In October 1956 BOAC ordered 15 [[Boeing 707]]s with Conway engines (briefly the most economical commercial engine option). They entered service in 1960. (The British airworthiness authorities insisted on tail-fin modifications which Boeing made available to all 707 users.)

On 22 April 1970 BOAC received its first 747, but the aircraft did not enter commercial service until 14 April 1971 due to BOAC's inability to settle crewing and pay rates with the [[British Air Line Pilots Association|British Air Line Pilots' Association]].

The Chairman of BOAC, Miles Thomas, was in favour of the idea as a potential solution to a disagreement between the two airlines as to which should serve the increasingly important oil regions of the [[Middle East]], and he had backing for his proposal from the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] at the time, [[Rab Butler]]. However, opposition from the Treasury blocked the idea, and an agreement was reached instead to allow BEA to serve [[Ankara]] in [[Turkey]], and in return to leave all routes east and south of Cyprus to BOAC. Paradoxically, through its effective control of [[Cyprus Airways]], BEA was able to continue to serve destinations ceded to BOAC, including Beirut and Cairo by using Cyprus Airways as its proxy.<ref>Robin Higham, ''Speedbird: The Complete History of BOAC'' (London: IB Tauris, 2013) p.117</ref>\n\nHowever, it was only following the recommendations of the 1969 Edwards Report that a new British Airways Board, combining BEA and BOAC, was constituted on 1 April 1972.<ref>''Airliner World (Cambrian Airways \u2013 The Welsh Dragon: New routes and turboprops)'', Key Publishing, Stamford, UK, September 2012, p. 71</ref> This event coincided with the establishment of the CAA, the UK's new, unified regulator for the air transport industry.<ref>{{Citation |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200681.html |title=Enter the CAA |work=Flight International |date=30 March 1972 |page=439 |accessdate=16 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225093015/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1972/1972%20-%200681.html |archive-date=25 December 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nBOAC would have become one of the first operators of the [[Concorde]], had it not merged to become British Airways.

The first Concorde delivered to British Airways was registered G-BOAC.\n\n==Other BOAC companies==\n\n===BOAC Associated Companies===\nBOAC held shareholdings in a number of other airlines operating in several parts of the [[British Commonwealth]] through a subsidiary, BOAC Associated Companies.

Approaching the English coast, first she lost her port inner engine and the pilot diverted to [[RAF Hawkinge]]. Her starboard inner engine also had to be shut down shortly afterwards. The pilot changed course for Lympne. On landing, the starboard undercarriage failed to lock down, causing the wing to drag on the ground and the aircraft to go through a fence.

All on board survived, but the first officer died of [[heat stroke]] five days later while awaiting rescue.\n* On 26 Oktober 1952, DH Comet 1 G-ALYZ , the first Comet taken into service only the month before, crashed on take off at Ciampino Airport, Rome.There were no casualties and Italian investigators concluded pilot error as cause of this crash.The investigators found scrapes on the run way for over 650 yards, combined with the pilot report of not getting speed up after rotation and referencing the BOAC Comet manual which stated : \"at 80 knots the nose should be raised until the rumble of the nose-wheel ceases. Care should be taken not to over do this and adopt adopt an exaggerated tail down attitude with consequent poor acceleration\".

Pilot fatigue was cited as a contributing cause, and inadequate rescue services were implicitly blamed for some of the fatalities.\n* On 8 April 1954, de Havilland Comet I G-ALYY was operating [[South African Airways Flight 201]] at night when it suffered what was almost certainly an explosive decompression at altitude and crashed into the sea near the island of [[Stromboli]], off the Italian coast near [[Naples]]. The wreckage was never recovered, but all known evidence pointed to a repeat of the recent accident to G-ALYP. The aircraft was operating for South African Airways on charter from BOAC, with an SAA crew.\n* Early on Christmas Day 25 December 1954, at 0330 hours, a BOAC Boeing 377 Stratocruiser G-ALSA [[1954 Prestwick air disaster|crashed on landing at Prestwick]], killing 28 of the 36 passengers and crew on board. The aircraft was en route from London to New York when, on approach to an intermediate stop at Prestwick, it entered a steep descent before levelling out too late and too severely, hitting the ground short of the runway. A number of factors The crash was attributed to a number of factors, including pilot fatigue (the captain was well over his duty limit due to the flight being delayed), the landing lights at Prestwick being out of action due to repair and the First Officer either not hearing a command from the Captain for landing lights (which may have helped judge the low cloud base) or mistakenly hitting the flaps, causing the aircraft to stall.<ref>{{ASN accident|title= G-ALSA|id= 19541225-0|accessdate= {{date|2010-11-18}}}}</ref>\n* On 21 September 1955, [[Canadair North Star|Canadair Argonaut]] G-ALHL crashed during a storm at [[Tripoli International Airport]] after a flight from London and Rome.

Sudanese rebel leader Babiker El Nur, announced as President a week before in a political coup, and his companion Major Farouk Hamadallah, were instructed to leave the aircraft, or the fighter planes would bomb it. El Nur quickly agreed to leave, in order to save the lives of the other passengers. He and Hamadallah were quickly taken off the aircraft to be held at gunpoint. Despite strong British government protests to the Sudan about the outrage, and an appeal to President Numairy for clemency, the men were both executed within a week.<ref>{{cite news|title=A government hijacking|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%201336.html|accessdate=13 November 2011|newspaper=Flight International|date=29 July 1971|page=150|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311052001/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1971/1971%20-%201336.html|archive-date=11 March 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* On 3 August 1971, BOAC Flight 600, operated by a Boeing 747 from Montreal to London, was diverted to [[Denver]], Colorado due to a bomb hoax inspired by a TV film ''Doomsday Flight''.
