It enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \"manual mode\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \"up-shift/downshift\" manner. \n\nThe two common divisions for this type of [[automobile transmission| transmission]] in road cars are the [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electrohydraulic or electromechanical single clutch]] automated manual, most commonly known under trademarked names, like \"F1\" by Ferrari, and \"SMG\" (Sequential manual gearbox) by BMW.<ref>[[https://www.autozine.org/technical_school/gearbox/Gearbox_Manual.html| AutoZine Technical School - Manual Transmission]]</ref><ref>[[https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/manual-vs-automatic-transmission-shift-know-about| MANUAL VS.

A common trade name for this transmission is \"DSG\" (Direct-shift gearbox). Both transmissions use computer-controlled ECU's & [[Transmission control unit|TCU's]], and generally use an electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic shift actuator to operate the electronic clutch and automated shifting process.<ref name=\"zf1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.zf.com/products/en/cars/products_29280.html\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission\n|website=zf.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\nSome automated transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. [[Torque converter|Hydraulically-coupled]] and most [[clutch]] transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \"sport\" mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by up shifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.\n\nModern \"semi-automatic\" transmissions divide into two groups; single-clutch[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmissions]] and [[dual-clutch]] automatics, which house two computer-controlled electronic clutches rather than the one with the single-clutch type. \n\nAutomated manuals facilitate gear changes by dispensing the need to depress a [[clutch]] pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators]] to execute [[gear shift]]s on input from the [[driving|driver]] or by a computer. This removes the need for a [[clutch]] pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronize the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by [[automobile manufacturer]]s to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some [[Semi-automatic transmission#Motorcycles|motorcycles]] also use an automated manual system with conventional gear change, but with an automatically actuated wet or dry single or dual-clutch mechanism, dispensing for the need of a clutch lever, and without the need for manual clutch operation.<ref name=\"ricardo1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering\n|title=Motorcycle Power-train Engineering\n|website=ricardo.com\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:1913-1923 Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F Berline crop.jpg|thumb|Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F gear shift ring (mounted inside steering wheel)]]\nIn 1901, [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e]] developed a method of shifting gears which did not require the use of a [[clutch]] and was activated by a ring mounted within the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\">{{cite web \n|title=The history of the 'paddle shift' \n|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/the-history-of-the-paddle-shift/2922\n|website=lemans.org\n|date=2011-02-21\n|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, automakers began to market cars with some sort of device that would reduce the amount of clutching and de-clutching and shifting required in stop and go driving. Most typically, a [[fluid coupling]] or a [[centrifugal clutch]] replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. Semi-automatic transmissions were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used semi-automatic transmissions with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.\n\nAnother early semi-automatic transmission was the Sinclair S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) [[Sinclair Powerflow|Powerflow]] gearbox. which was applied to Huwood-Hudswell diesel mines locomotives.<ref name=\"dmm1\">{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colleng/4805-01.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering |publisher=Dmm.org.uk |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> It was also applied to some road vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035333/http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archivedate = 2017-09-06 | page = 69 | title=Vulcan-Sinclair Fluidrive Makes Headway | date = 1946-08-16 | journal = The Commercial Motor }}</ref>\n\nImproved semi-automatics appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[Automotive Products]] Manumatic and Newtondrive systems were also known as \"two-pedal transmissions\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. The '''Manumatic''' has a clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operating the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operates a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever is moved, the clutch is disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.<ref>Staton Abbey (ed) ''Practical Automobile Engineering'' Clutch Systems p 193-194</ref> The '''Newtondrive''' system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. These systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Ferrari 640]] race car incorporated, in 1989, an [[Electrohydraulic_manual_transmission|electo-hydraulic]] gear shift mechanism activated by paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\"/><ref name=\"ferrarif1\">{{cite web |title=Ferrari F1-89 |url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |website=ferrari.com |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170637/http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other automated transmissions==\nModern \"Semi-automatic transmissions,\" also known as \"automated manual transmissions\" (AMTs) usually have a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need to change gears at all, operating in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were [[redline|redlining]] the engine. The AMT can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions ([[manumatic]]s such as [[Tiptronic]]) and [[continuous variable transmission]]s (CVTs) (such as [[Lineartronic#Subaru Lineartronic CVT|Lineartronic]]).\n\nAutomated manual transmission (AMT) is a specific type of semi-automatic transmission. It consists of a conventional [[manual transmission]] with an electronically-controlled hydraulic clutch and computerized gear shift control, and the driver can usually override the computer control with a clutchless \"manual\" mode.<ref>[[https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/mission-transmission/]]</ref> It has a lower cost than any other types of automatic transmissions<ref name=\"zf1\" /> \nAn Automated manual transmission can simply and best be described as a standard manual transmission, with an automated clutch, and automated clutch and gear shift control.<ref name=\"x-engineer1\" />\n\nDespite superficial similarity to other automated transmissions, AMTs differ significantly in internal operation and driver's \"feel\" from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard [[automatic transmission]], uses a [[torque converter]] instead of [[clutch]] to manage the link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. An AMT offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts,<ref>{{cite web| first1=Tony | last1=Quiroga | others=Hoey, Patrick M.

In one early mass-production example, [[Ferrari]] offered their [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] model with a clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the [[gear stick]] of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.\n\nIn standard mass-production automobiles today, the gear lever appears similar to manual shifts, except that the gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift into higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In [[Formula One]], the system is adapted to fit onto the [[steering wheel]] in the form of two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts into a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.\n\n[[Hall effect sensor]]s sense the direction of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the [[gear box]] which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a [[central processing unit]]. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors as well as other factors, such as engine rotation, the [[Electronic Stability Control]], [[air conditioner]] and [[dashboard]] instruments.\n\nThe central processing unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the gear-shifting action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a [[Servomechanism|servo]]motor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear [[actuator]], which uses [[brake fluid]] from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.\n\nThe power of the system lies in the fact that electronic equipment can react much faster and more precisely than a human, and takes advantage of the precision of electronic signals to allow a complete clutch operation without the intervention of the driver.\n\nFor the needs of parking, reversing and neutralizing the transmission, the driver must engage both paddles at once; after this has been accomplished, the car will prompt for one of the three options.\n\nThe clutch is really only needed to get the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar disengaged until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like [[powershifting]] require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a [[dual clutch transmission]].\n\nA typical transmission has the following gears: P, R, N, D, M+, M-\n* ''P'' is the parking gear. It locks the transmission.\n* ''R'' is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic cars;\n* ''N'' is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic;\n* ''D'' is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a [[torque converter]] as in a traditional automatic;\n* ''M-'' downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1;\n* ''M+'' up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[Selespeed]] was introduced in 1999 in the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatautopress.com/index.php?method=cartelle&action=zoom&id=20041220314081583da688bf3dbbeee34b924a74271f8bc4|title=Press release 20 January 1999|accessdate=2007-05-08|work=fiatautopress.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327081230/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/welcome.php|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Martin===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Sportshift]]\n\n=== BMW ===\nSteptronic, SMG/SSG.\n\n===Chevrolet===\nFor the 1968 model year, Chevrolet introduced a simplified version of Powerglide marketed under the name \"Torque Drive.\" This unit was basically two-speed [[Powerglide]] without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between Low and High. The quadrant indicator on Torque Drive cars was, Park R N Hi 1st. The driver would start the car in \"1st,\" then move the lever to \"Hi\" when desired.\n\nTorque Drive was only offered on low-horsepower engines for [[Camaro]], [[chevrolet Nova|Nova]], and the 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]. It was available on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the Torque Drive a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making Torque Drive installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears in a way that wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic Torque Drive.\n\n=== Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram ===\n{{main|Vacamatic|Presto-Matic}}\n\nHistorically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer was the 1941 M4/Vacamatic Transmission by [[Chrysler]]. It was an attempt to compete against rivals' [[automatic transmission]]s, though it still had a [[clutch]], it was primarily used to change range. The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between [[engine]] and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nIn normal driving, the clutch was used to select low, high or reverse. Attached to the transmission was an \"underdrive\" with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the \"2nd\" position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the \"3rd\" position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in \"underdrive\" low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6&nbsp;mph (9.7&nbsp;km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would \"shift\" into direct drive.\nThis configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios:\nUnderdrive Low, 3.57/1,\nLow 2.04/1,\nUnderdrive High, 1.75/1,\nHigh, 1/1.\nIn order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner's manual cautioned drivers not to use \"1st or 3rd\" gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the \"clunk\" that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot===\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] produced a number of variants on semi-automatic transmission. The [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.\n\nThe [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] gained an optional centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as \"Trafficlutch\". It did not help with gear changing, but it disengaged automatically when the engine slowed to an idle. A device was fitted to the carburettor to prevent the throttle closing abruptly, and the resultant clutch disengagement and lack of engine braking.\n\nLater, the manufacturer introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate models in the 1970s; the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]] and [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] models had the option of three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a [[torque converter]]. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citro\u00ebn semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.\n\nThe smaller range of cars: [[Citro\u00ebn C1|C1]], [[Citro\u00ebn C2|C2]] and [[Citro\u00ebn C3|C3]] have all been offered with a semi-automatic transmission named [[Sensodrive]]. This is based on a standard 5-speed gearbox with servo-controlled clutch. The operation is automatic, but it also has a manual mode where the driver changes gear manually; although gears are always changed by an electric servo.\n\nAn improved version of Sensodrive is EGS (Electronic Gearbox System), which has six gears.\n\nAn even further improved version is called ETG6 (6 speed Efficient Tronic Gearbox). It has slightly better characteristics compared to EGS and an added \"creep\" function.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ETG6 Gearbox\n|website=Citro\u00ebn UK\n|url=http://www.citroen.co.uk/about-us/technology/driving-assistance/etg6-gearbox/\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref> The ETG6 gearbox is used by the 2013 [[Citro\u00ebn C4 Picasso]]. The gearbox is also utilized by [[PSA Group]]'s other offerings, like the [[Peugeot 208]].\n\n2-tronic, EGC (Electric Gearbox Control) or Piloted Manual in [[Peugeot]].\n\n==={{anchor|Daimatic}} Daihatsu===\nThe 993&nbsp;cc [[Daihatsu]] [[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]] from 1985 until 1991 had the option of a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called \"Daimatic\". This unit is similar to a conventional auto, featuring both a torque converter and a planetary gearset but lacking a full valve body for making decisions regarding shifting. This was left entirely to the driver and as a result could be accelerated from rest in top gear if desired, depending entirely on the torque converter action. The standing quartermile time with two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} occupants and using low gear appropriately was 21.0 sec while using top gear only was 21.5 sec. This unit was also installed in the [[Innocenti Minitre|Innocenti Matic]] of the same time period.\n\n===Ferrari===\nFerrari's first automated manual gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their [[Formula One]] cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the [[Ferrari Mondial]]; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal, and the clutch mechanism was electronically actuated each time the gearshift was moved. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 [[Ferrari F355]]. The most recent version of its single-clutch automated manual was introduced in the [[Ferrari 599 GTO]] which was capable of changing gear in 60 ms. In the [[Ferrari California]] & [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], Ferrari opted to use a [[double-clutch transmission]]. Since then, Ferrari has expanded use of their [[double-clutch transmission]] to all new models.\n\n===Fiat===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 2000s, [[Fiat]] offered their Speedgear transmissions for some of its cars, like the [[Fiat Punto]]. In 2008, a new system came to the market, Dualogic transmission, that equipped a wide range of cars, like the [[Fiat 500]], [[Fiat Bravo]], [[Fiat Punto]], etc. In 2017, Fiat introduced its new generation of semi-automatic transmissions, called GSR (Gear Smart Riding), that was designed to work with their new car models such as the [[Fiat MOBI]] and the [[Fiat Argo]].\n\n===Ford===\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co]]. offered the Semi-Automatic Transmission on the 1970 [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] 6-cylinder model as a lower-cost option to the popular 3-speed C4 [[Cruise-o-Matic]] transmission.  The shift quadrant featured \"P R N Hi 2 1\" and the Maverick owner's manual provides the speeds at which the driver should move the selector between the three forward gears.  Like Chevrolet's Torque-Drive, the Ford Semi-Automatic was essentially the regular automatic without the self-shifting capability.  At $121.00 retail, it was pricey, rarely ordered, and was discontinued the following year.\n\n===General Motors===\nIn 1937, [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the four-speed Automatic Safety Transmission as an option. This was an automatic transmission with automated control and shifting between a pair of ranges, with manual control over high and low ratio pairs of the four. It was not a semi-automatic transmission.  This transmission was replaced by fully automatic [[Hydra-Matic]] for the 1940 model year.\n\nIn 1938, [[Buick]] introduced a five-speed semi-automatic{{citation needed|date=June 2015|reason=Automatic or semi-automatic?}} transmission for the [[Buick Special]].  This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually was replaced by the fully automatic [[Dynaflow]] transmission for 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile History: Drivetrain|url=http://www.motorera.com/history/hist10.htm|website=motera.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Honda / Acura===\n[[Honda]] marketed both cars and motorcycles with the [[Hondamatic]] transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a [[sprag clutch|sprag]] between first and second gears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nOther Honda tradenames iShift & MultiMatic,\n\n===Hudson===\nDrive-Master, 1941-1950.\n\n===Hyundai & Kia===\nSportmatic, [[Sportronic]], HIVEC H-Matic.\n\n===Isuzu===\n{{main|NAVi5}}\n[[Isuzu]] introduced the \"NAVi5\" (New Advanced Vehicle with Intelligence 5-speed) in 1984. Based on a traditional 5-speed manual with a dry clutch, it was controlled by two hydraulic actuators and an electronic computer. The earlier version only had an automatic mode, but a manual mode was later added. It was first available in the [[Isuzu Aska|Aska]] and subsequently the other Isuzu vehicles (for Japanese domestic market only).\n\n===Lincoln-Mercury===\nFor 1942, Ford Motor Company announced a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic.  Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, as well as an electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds.  Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill.  Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.\n\nThe transmission proved to be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, and replaced them with standard manual transmissions.  The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana.  While Ford gave up on semi-automatic transmissions after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' [[Hydra-Matic]] in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, [[Merc-O-Matic]], in 1951.\n\n===Maserati===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Cambiocorsa, DuoSelect, MC-Shift]]\n\n===Mercedes-Benz / Smart===\nMercedes used a system from 1957\u201361 similar to the VW [[Autostick]], called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the [[oil]] supply for the [[torque converter]] was sealed within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil [[cooler (oil)|cooler]]. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzponton.org/valueadded/maintenance/hydrak.htm|title=Mercedes-Benz Ponton Hydrak Automatic Clutch |first=Jeff|last=Miller|website=www.mbzponton.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smart Fortwo]] employs an automated manual transmission designed and manufactured by [[Getrag]] to eliminate the clutch pedal.  The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation used a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\n===NSU===\nThe [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] produced an automated system for the [[rotary engine|rotary-engined]] [[NSU Ro 80]] saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.\n\n===Opel===\n{{main|Easytronic}}\nOpel (Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom) produced a semi-automatic transmission gearbox, the Easytronic gearbox. As with all standard automateds, the Easytronic car has only two pedals (accelerator pedal and brake pedal) but it does have a clutch, though this is inbuilt into the car and is electrohydraulic. The Easytronic can be driven in \"manual mode\" simply by using the paddle shifter selector to change gears if the driver wishes to do so, or alternatively it can be driven in exactly the same way as a fully conventional automatic\u2014however, many Easytronic owners have complained that gear shifts in \"automatic mode\" are jerky; a common complaint with semi-autos based on a conventional manual gearbox. As with conventional, full automatic transmission cars, the Easytronic will \"creep\" forwards when the driver's foot is released from the brake pedal when the car is stationary.\n\n===Packard===\nAlso in 1941, [[Packard]] introduced the Electro-Matic [[clutch]], which was a vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by the position of the accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably due to the fact that the system was somewhat unstable during [[engine]] warm-up. [[Packard]]'s system was used in conjunction with their regular [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] so the H-pattern shifting remained.\n\nEarlier, and by many manufacturers, an arrangement to disengage the clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called \"[[freewheel]]ing\", it was bedeviled by the absence of adequate brakes.\n\n===Plymouth===\nIn 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', to their standard 3-speed manual gearbox. The torque converter allowed the car to remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired.  Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.\n\n===Porsche===\nPorsche has created various automated manual and [[Manumatic]] transmissions, starting with Porsche's \"SportoMatic\" transmission in 1968. This transmission was marketed as an \"Automatic,\" despite it having no fully automatic mode. This automated manual transmission was a conventional four-speed manual gearbox, but with a vaccuum-operated single-disc dry clutch. A torque converter was utilized in place of a flywheel, and shifts and clutch were operated electromechanically whenever the driver moved the gearshift. The next \"automated\" transmission was the Porsche \"Tiptronic\" [[manumatic]] transmission of the 1990s, which was essentially a torque converter automatic transmission, but containing a built-in \"manual\" shift mechanism. The newest automated manual transmission by Porsche is the \"Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe\" (PDK), which literally translates to \"Porsche dual-clutch transmission.\" It has two separate clutches and shafts combined into one housing unit, essentially with one clutch operating the odd gears, and one the clutch the even gears. All this is actuated automatically, and operated through the electrohydraulic actuators of the transmission's computer.<ref name=\"caranddriver3\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15366473/shift-this-a-history-of-porsches-sportomatic-tiptronic-and-pdk-transmissions/\n|title=A History of Porsche\u2019s Sportomatic, Tiptronic, and PDK Transmissions\n|website=Car and Driver\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=Dec 10, 2013\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\n===Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi / Dacia / Infiniti===\nFor the [[Renault Dauphine]], a Ferlec semi-automatic was offered from 1957 until 1963, when the \"fully automatic\" Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available.

The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1968 Volkswagen Beetle (on sale in August 1967), and was made available on the Karmann Ghia during 1968.

These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated by a series of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.\n\nIn the UK though, semi-automatic transmissions have been very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London [[AEC Routemaster]], although the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from [[Self-Changing Gears]] Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided with the development of city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. [[Leyland Bus|Leyland]] manufactured many buses with semi-automatic transmissions, including its [[Leyland Leopard|Leopard]] and [[Leyland Tiger|Tiger]] coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and semi-automatic transmissions lost favour. These days, very few buses with semi-automatic transmissions remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of [[manumatic]] transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.\n\n===Trains===\n====Railcars====\nThe Self-Changing Gears automated gearbox was also fitted to the several thousand diesel railcars built for the British railway system in the late 1950s-early 1960s, which lasted in service until the 1990s-2000s. Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]]. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed of a number of such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated gearbox units mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.\n\n====Locomotives====\nSemi-automatic transmission was also used on many small diesel [[shunting locomotive]]s, such as [[British Rail Class 03]] and [[British Rail Class 04]]. A widely used type was the Wilson-Drewry epicyclic gearbox.\n\nA less common type was the SSS (synchro-self-shifting) Powerflow gearbox.  This gearbox was of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and [[dog clutch]] engagement.  A special feature was that the drive was maintained during upward gearchanges. This system was used on [[Hudswell Clarke|Huwood-Hudswell]] diesel mines locomotives<ref name=\"dmm1\" /> and on the [[British Rail Class D2/7]] and [[British Rail Class D2/12]].\n\n===Motorcycles===\n\nThe first motorcycles with semi-automatic gearboxes were developed and patented in the mid 1960s by the Czechoslovakian [[Jawa Moto|Jawa]] motorcycle company.<ref name=CZ>{{cite web |title=V\u00e1lka mechanik\u016f: Japonci okop\u00edrovali \u010desk\u00fd vyn\u00e1lez! |url=https://epochaplus.cz/valka-mechaniku-japonci-okopirovali-cesky-vynalez/ |website=EpochaPlus|language=cs-CZ|date=20 January 2015|last=Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk|first=Marek|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Honda copied the Jawa semi-automatic clutch for the [[Honda Super Cub|Honda Cub]] step-through motorcycle series and so Jawa sued them in court for patent infringement. Honda settled out of court and Jawa granted them indefinite licence with royalties charged on each Honda motorcycle that used the Jawa system.<ref name=CZ/>\n\nThe first large capacity motorcycle with a semi-automatic gearbox was the 1975 {{cvt|948|cc|abbr=on}} Moto Guzzi Convert (the name was chosen to denote the torque converter which was at the heart of this 110&nbsp;mph motorcycle){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} a fairly heavy motorcycle which despite its weight still handled, and cornered remarkably well, which was thanks to the race-bred frame from the Moto Guzzi Le Mans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHonda also had a range of bikes fitted with a gearbox that mated a torque converter and a two speed gearbox. This style of gearbox still required the rider to manually selected neutral and either of the two gears using the foot gear lever.<ref name=\"cyclemay1976p69\">{{cite journal|title=[[Cycle (magazine)|Cycle magazine]]|date=May 1976|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|p=67\u201373}}</ref> These models were the [[Honda CB750#CB750A Hondamatic|CB750A]], [[Honda CB400T#CB400A Hawk Hondamatic|CB400A]], [[Honda CM400|CM400A]] and [[Honda CM450A|CM450A]]. These bikes were badged and marketed as Hondamatics.\n\nIn addition to the Hondamatic system noted above, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year [[FJR1300]] [[sport-touring]] motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.\n\nHonda began production of the [[Honda VFR1200F|VFR1200F]] on 8 September 2009,<ref name=\"autoblog1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/honda-to-launch-first-ever-dual-clutch-gearbox-for-motorcycles-w/\n|title=Honda to launch first-ever dual clutch gearbox for motorcycles with new VFR\n|website=\n|last=Korzeniewski \n|first=Jeremy\n|date=Sep 9, 2009\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref> which includes an optional [[dual clutch transmission]], the first to be fitted to a motorcycle.\n\nThe [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster]] is available with a clutchless automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with five or six speeds, depending on the model).\n\nSmall capacity [[Types of motorcycles#Scooters, underbones and mopeds|underbone]] or \"step-thru\" types of motorcycles, such as the Honda Super Cub, [[Suzuki FR50]] and [[Suzuki FR80|FR80]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] Townmate, use a semi-automatic gearbox with a \"heel and toe\" foot change in the standard motorcycle position but without the need for conventional clutch operation.\n\nMany modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially \"blips\" the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===ATVs===\nHonda released automated electric shift ATVs starting in model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting is accomplished by pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal and the addition of an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, shift drum, etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been. This electric shift technology was later applied to their complete line of ATVs.\n\n==Types==\n* [[Dual-clutch transmission]]\n* [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission]] (e.g. BMW sequential manual gearbox, SMG)\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Saxomat]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n* [[Shift kit]]\n* [[Shift time]]\n* [[Dual clutch transmission]] (DCT)\n* [[Automatic manual transmission]]\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Honda I-SHIFT]]\n* [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]]\n* [[Automatic transmission]]\n* [[Tiptronic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Semi-automatic transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle transmissions]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power control]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=March 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Transmission types}}\nA '''semi-automatic transmission''' (also known as an '''automated manual'''<ref>[[https://www.caradvice.com.au/278721/transmissions-explained-manual-v-automatic-v-dual-clutch-v-cvt-v-others/]]</ref> <ref name=\"nacfe1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://nacfe.org/technology/automated-manual-transmissions-2/\n|title=Automated Manual Transmissions\n|website=North American Council for Freight Efficiency\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-15 \n}}</ref>, '''clutchless manual'''<ref name=\"autonews1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20010401/SUB/104010719/the-next-shift-the-clutchless-manual\n|title=The next shift: The clutchless manual\n|website=autonews.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>, '''auto-manual'''<ref name=\"x-engineer1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://x-engineer.org/automotive-engineering/drivetrain/transmissions/automated-manual-transmissions-amt/\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)\n|website=x-engineer.org\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>, '''semi-manual'''<ref name=\"thezebra1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/2805/manual-vs-automatic/\n|title=Manual vs. Automatic Transmissions: Who's Winning? - Insurance News\n|website=thezebra.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=April 7, 2016\n|access-date=2020-02-15 \n}}</ref>, '''trigger shift''', '''flappy-paddle''' or '''paddle-shift''' gearbox) is an [[automobile transmission]] that combines [[manual transmission]] and [[automatic transmission]].\n\nSemi-automatic term refers to a single-clutch [[manual transmission]] (with an automated clutch, but requires the driver to shift the gears manually), allowing for convenient driver control of gear selection (in road cars), or a single-clutch [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential transmission]] with electronic operated paddle shifters and an electrohydraulic or electro-pneumatic actuated clutch and dog box gear engagement as used in race cars.<ref>Drivetribe.com \n[https://drivetribe.com/p/sequential-sorrow-1989-ferrari-U9zAMNPcScu0UqBZ4NZGPg?iid=VMEsFpv0Rru6efh8RBsrGA/ SEQUENTIAL SORROW - 1989 FERRARI 640]</ref><ref>Formula1-Dictionary.net [http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/gearbox.html/ Gearbox]</ref> For most of automotive history, conventional automatic transmissions already allowed some control of gear selection using the console or [[Gear stick|shifter]], usually to limit the transmission shifting beyond a certain gear (allowing engine braking on downhills) and/or locking out the use of [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gears when towing.  It enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \"manual mode\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \"up-shift/downshift\" manner. \n\nThe two common divisions for this type of [[automobile transmission| transmission]] in road cars are the [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electrohydraulic or electromechanical single clutch]] automated manual, most commonly known under trademarked names, like \"F1\" by Ferrari, and \"SMG\" (Sequential manual gearbox) by BMW.<ref>[[https://www.autozine.org/technical_school/gearbox/Gearbox_Manual.html| AutoZine Technical School - Manual Transmission]]</ref><ref>[[https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/manual-vs-automatic-transmission-shift-know-about| MANUAL VS.

A common trade name for this transmission is \"DSG\" (Direct-shift gearbox). Both transmissions use computer-controlled ECU's & [[Transmission control unit|TCU's]], and generally use an electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic shift actuator to operate the electronic clutch and automated shifting process.<ref name=\"zf1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.zf.com/products/en/cars/products_29280.html\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission\n|website=zf.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\nSome automated transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. [[Torque converter|Hydraulically-coupled]] and most [[clutch]] transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \"sport\" mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by up shifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.\n\nModern \"semi-automatic\" transmissions divide into two groups; single-clutch[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmissions]] and [[dual-clutch]] automatics, which house two computer-controlled electronic clutches rather than the one with the single-clutch type. \n\nAutomated manuals facilitate gear changes by dispensing the need to depress a [[clutch]] pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators]] to execute [[gear shift]]s on input from the [[driving|driver]] or by a computer. This removes the need for a [[clutch]] pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronize the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by [[automobile manufacturer]]s to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some [[Semi-automatic transmission#Motorcycles|motorcycles]] also use an automated manual system with conventional gear change, but with an automatically actuated wet or dry single or dual-clutch mechanism, dispensing for the need of a clutch lever, and without the need for manual clutch operation.<ref name=\"ricardo1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering\n|title=Motorcycle Power-train Engineering\n|website=ricardo.com\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>\n\nAutomated manual transmission (AMT) is a specific type of semi-automatic transmission. It consists of a conventional [[manual transmission]] with an electronically-controlled hydraulic clutch and computerized gear shift control, and the driver can usually override the computer control with a clutchless \"manual\" mode.<ref>[[https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/mission-transmission/]]</ref> It has a lower cost than any other types of automatic transmissions<ref name=\"zf1\" /> \nAn Automated manual transmission can simply and best be described as a standard manual transmission, with an automated clutch, and automated clutch and gear shift control.<ref name=\"x-engineer1\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:1913-1923 Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F Berline crop.jpg|thumb|Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F gear shift ring (mounted inside steering wheel)]]\nIn 1901, [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e]] developed a method of shifting gears which did not require the use of a [[clutch]] and was activated by a ring mounted within the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\">{{cite web \n|title=The history of the 'paddle shift' \n|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/the-history-of-the-paddle-shift/2922\n|website=lemans.org\n|date=2011-02-21\n|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, automakers began to market cars with some sort of device that would reduce the amount of clutching and de-clutching and shifting required in stop and go driving. Most typically, a [[fluid coupling]] or a [[centrifugal clutch]] replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. Semi-automatic transmissions were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used semi-automatic transmissions with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.\n\nAnother early semi-automatic transmission was the Sinclair S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) [[Sinclair Powerflow|Powerflow]] gearbox. which was applied to Huwood-Hudswell diesel mines locomotives.<ref name=\"dmm1\">{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colleng/4805-01.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering |publisher=Dmm.org.uk |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> It was also applied to some road vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035333/http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archivedate = 2017-09-06 | page = 69 | title=Vulcan-Sinclair Fluidrive Makes Headway | date = 1946-08-16 | journal = The Commercial Motor }}</ref>\n\nImproved semi-automatics appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[Automotive Products]] Manumatic and Newtondrive systems were also known as \"two-pedal transmissions\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. The '''Manumatic''' has a clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operating the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operates a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever is moved, the clutch is disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.<ref>Staton Abbey (ed) ''Practical Automobile Engineering'' Clutch Systems p 193-194</ref> The '''Newtondrive''' system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. These systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Ferrari 640]] race car incorporated, in 1989, an [[Electrohydraulic_manual_transmission|electo-hydraulic]] gear shift mechanism activated by paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\"/><ref name=\"ferrarif1\">{{cite web |title=Ferrari F1-89 |url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |website=ferrari.com |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170637/http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other automated transmissions==\nModern \"Semi-automatic transmissions,\" also known as \"automated manual transmissions\" (AMTs) usually have a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need to change gears at all, operating in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were [[redline|redlining]] the engine. The AMT can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions ([[manumatic]]s such as [[Tiptronic]]) and [[continuous variable transmission]]s (CVTs) (such as [[Lineartronic#Subaru Lineartronic CVT|Lineartronic]]).\n\nDespite superficial similarity to other automated transmissions, AMTs differ significantly in internal operation and driver's \"feel\" from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard [[automatic transmission]], uses a [[torque converter]] instead of [[clutch]] to manage the link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. An AMT offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts,<ref>{{cite web| first1=Tony | last1=Quiroga | others=Hoey, Patrick M.

In one early mass-production example, [[Ferrari]] offered their [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] model with a clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the [[gear stick]] of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.\n\nIn standard mass-production automobiles today, the gear lever appears similar to manual shifts, except that the gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift into higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In [[Formula One]], the system is adapted to fit onto the [[steering wheel]] in the form of two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts into a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.\n\n[[Hall effect sensor]]s sense the direction of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the [[gear box]] which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a [[central processing unit]]. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors as well as other factors, such as engine rotation, the [[Electronic Stability Control]], [[air conditioner]] and [[dashboard]] instruments.\n\nThe central processing unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the gear-shifting action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a [[Servomechanism|servo]]motor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear [[actuator]], which uses [[brake fluid]] from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.\n\nThe power of the system lies in the fact that electronic equipment can react much faster and more precisely than a human, and takes advantage of the precision of electronic signals to allow a complete clutch operation without the intervention of the driver.\n\nFor the needs of parking, reversing and neutralizing the transmission, the driver must engage both paddles at once; after this has been accomplished, the car will prompt for one of the three options.\n\nThe clutch is really only needed to get the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar disengaged until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like [[powershifting]] require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a [[dual clutch transmission]].\n\nA typical transmission has the following gears: P, R, N, D, M+, M-\n* ''P'' is the parking gear. It locks the transmission.\n* ''R'' is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic cars;\n* ''N'' is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic;\n* ''D'' is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a [[torque converter]] as in a traditional automatic;\n* ''M-'' downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1;\n* ''M+'' up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[Selespeed]] was introduced in 1999 in the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatautopress.com/index.php?method=cartelle&action=zoom&id=20041220314081583da688bf3dbbeee34b924a74271f8bc4|title=Press release 20 January 1999|accessdate=2007-05-08|work=fiatautopress.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327081230/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/welcome.php|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Martin===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Sportshift]]\n\n=== BMW ===\nSteptronic, SMG/SSG.\n\n===Chevrolet===\nFor the 1968 model year, Chevrolet introduced a simplified version of Powerglide marketed under the name \"Torque Drive.\" This unit was basically two-speed [[Powerglide]] without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between Low and High. The quadrant indicator on Torque Drive cars was, Park R N Hi 1st. The driver would start the car in \"1st,\" then move the lever to \"Hi\" when desired.\n\nTorque Drive was only offered on low-horsepower engines for [[Camaro]], [[chevrolet Nova|Nova]], and the 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]. It was available on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the Torque Drive a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making Torque Drive installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears in a way that wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic Torque Drive.\n\n=== Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram ===\n{{main|Vacamatic|Presto-Matic}}\n\nHistorically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer was the 1941 M4/Vacamatic Transmission by [[Chrysler]]. It was an attempt to compete against rivals' [[automatic transmission]]s, though it still had a [[clutch]], it was primarily used to change range. The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between [[engine]] and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nIn normal driving, the clutch was used to select low, high or reverse. Attached to the transmission was an \"underdrive\" with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the \"2nd\" position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the \"3rd\" position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in \"underdrive\" low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6&nbsp;mph (9.7&nbsp;km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would \"shift\" into direct drive.\nThis configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios:\nUnderdrive Low, 3.57/1,\nLow 2.04/1,\nUnderdrive High, 1.75/1,\nHigh, 1/1.\nIn order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner's manual cautioned drivers not to use \"1st or 3rd\" gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the \"clunk\" that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot===\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] produced a number of variants on semi-automatic transmission. The [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.\n\nThe [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] gained an optional centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as \"Trafficlutch\". It did not help with gear changing, but it disengaged automatically when the engine slowed to an idle. A device was fitted to the carburettor to prevent the throttle closing abruptly, and the resultant clutch disengagement and lack of engine braking.\n\nLater, the manufacturer introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate models in the 1970s; the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]] and [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] models had the option of three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a [[torque converter]]. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citro\u00ebn semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.\n\nThe smaller range of cars: [[Citro\u00ebn C1|C1]], [[Citro\u00ebn C2|C2]] and [[Citro\u00ebn C3|C3]] have all been offered with a semi-automatic transmission named [[Sensodrive]]. This is based on a standard 5-speed gearbox with servo-controlled clutch. The operation is automatic, but it also has a manual mode where the driver changes gear manually; although gears are always changed by an electric servo.\n\nAn improved version of Sensodrive is EGS (Electronic Gearbox System), which has six gears.\n\nAn even further improved version is called ETG6 (6 speed Efficient Tronic Gearbox). It has slightly better characteristics compared to EGS and an added \"creep\" function.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ETG6 Gearbox\n|website=Citro\u00ebn UK\n|url=http://www.citroen.co.uk/about-us/technology/driving-assistance/etg6-gearbox/\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref> The ETG6 gearbox is used by the 2013 [[Citro\u00ebn C4 Picasso]]. The gearbox is also utilized by [[PSA Group]]'s other offerings, like the [[Peugeot 208]].\n\n2-tronic, EGC (Electric Gearbox Control) or Piloted Manual in [[Peugeot]].\n\n==={{anchor|Daimatic}} Daihatsu===\nThe 993&nbsp;cc [[Daihatsu]] [[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]] from 1985 until 1991 had the option of a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called \"Daimatic\". This unit is similar to a conventional auto, featuring both a torque converter and a planetary gearset but lacking a full valve body for making decisions regarding shifting. This was left entirely to the driver and as a result could be accelerated from rest in top gear if desired, depending entirely on the torque converter action. The standing quartermile time with two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} occupants and using low gear appropriately was 21.0 sec while using top gear only was 21.5 sec. This unit was also installed in the [[Innocenti Minitre|Innocenti Matic]] of the same time period.\n\n===Ferrari===\nFerrari's first automated manual gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their [[Formula One]] cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the [[Ferrari Mondial]]; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal, and the clutch mechanism was electronically actuated each time the gearshift was moved. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 [[Ferrari F355]]. The most recent version of its single-clutch automated manual was introduced in the [[Ferrari 599 GTO]] which was capable of changing gear in 60 ms. In the [[Ferrari California]] & [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], Ferrari opted to use a [[double-clutch transmission]]. Since then, Ferrari has expanded use of their [[double-clutch transmission]] to all new models.\n\n===Fiat===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 2000s, [[Fiat]] offered their Speedgear transmissions for some of its cars, like the [[Fiat Punto]]. In 2008, a new system came to the market, Dualogic transmission, that equipped a wide range of cars, like the [[Fiat 500]], [[Fiat Bravo]], [[Fiat Punto]], etc. In 2017, Fiat introduced its new generation of semi-automatic transmissions, called GSR (Gear Smart Riding), that was designed to work with their new car models such as the [[Fiat MOBI]] and the [[Fiat Argo]].\n\n===Ford===\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co]]. offered the Semi-Automatic Transmission on the 1970 [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] 6-cylinder model as a lower-cost option to the popular 3-speed C4 [[Cruise-o-Matic]] transmission.  The shift quadrant featured \"P R N Hi 2 1\" and the Maverick owner's manual provides the speeds at which the driver should move the selector between the three forward gears.  Like Chevrolet's Torque-Drive, the Ford Semi-Automatic was essentially the regular automatic without the self-shifting capability.  At $121.00 retail, it was pricey, rarely ordered, and was discontinued the following year.\n\n===General Motors===\nIn 1937, [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the four-speed Automatic Safety Transmission as an option. This was an automatic transmission with automated control and shifting between a pair of ranges, with manual control over high and low ratio pairs of the four. It was not a semi-automatic transmission.  This transmission was replaced by fully automatic [[Hydra-Matic]] for the 1940 model year.\n\nIn 1938, [[Buick]] introduced a five-speed semi-automatic{{citation needed|date=June 2015|reason=Automatic or semi-automatic?}} transmission for the [[Buick Special]].  This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually was replaced by the fully automatic [[Dynaflow]] transmission for 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile History: Drivetrain|url=http://www.motorera.com/history/hist10.htm|website=motera.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Honda / Acura===\n[[Honda]] marketed both cars and motorcycles with the [[Hondamatic]] transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a [[sprag clutch|sprag]] between first and second gears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nOther Honda tradenames iShift & MultiMatic,\n\n===Hudson===\nDrive-Master, 1941-1950.\n\n===Hyundai & Kia===\nSportmatic, [[Sportronic]], HIVEC H-Matic.\n\n===Isuzu===\n{{main|NAVi5}}\n[[Isuzu]] introduced the \"NAVi5\" (New Advanced Vehicle with Intelligence 5-speed) in 1984. Based on a traditional 5-speed manual with a dry clutch, it was controlled by two hydraulic actuators and an electronic computer. The earlier version only had an automatic mode, but a manual mode was later added. It was first available in the [[Isuzu Aska|Aska]] and subsequently the other Isuzu vehicles (for Japanese domestic market only).\n\n===Lincoln-Mercury===\nFor 1942, Ford Motor Company announced a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic.  Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, as well as an electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds.  Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill.  Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.\n\nThe transmission proved to be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, and replaced them with standard manual transmissions.  The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana.  While Ford gave up on semi-automatic transmissions after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' [[Hydra-Matic]] in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, [[Merc-O-Matic]], in 1951.\n\n===Maserati===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Cambiocorsa, DuoSelect, MC-Shift]]\n\n===Mercedes-Benz / Smart===\nMercedes used a system from 1957\u201361 similar to the VW [[Autostick]], called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the [[oil]] supply for the [[torque converter]] was sealed within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil [[cooler (oil)|cooler]]. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzponton.org/valueadded/maintenance/hydrak.htm|title=Mercedes-Benz Ponton Hydrak Automatic Clutch |first=Jeff|last=Miller|website=www.mbzponton.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smart Fortwo]] employs an automated manual transmission designed and manufactured by [[Getrag]] to eliminate the clutch pedal.  The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation used a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\n===NSU===\nThe [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] produced an automated system for the [[rotary engine|rotary-engined]] [[NSU Ro 80]] saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.\n\n===Opel===\n{{main|Easytronic}}\nOpel (Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom) produced a semi-automatic transmission gearbox, the Easytronic gearbox. As with all standard automateds, the Easytronic car has only two pedals (accelerator pedal and brake pedal) but it does have a clutch, though this is inbuilt into the car and is electrohydraulic. The Easytronic can be driven in \"manual mode\" simply by using the paddle shifter selector to change gears if the driver wishes to do so, or alternatively it can be driven in exactly the same way as a fully conventional automatic\u2014however, many Easytronic owners have complained that gear shifts in \"automatic mode\" are jerky; a common complaint with semi-autos based on a conventional manual gearbox. As with conventional, full automatic transmission cars, the Easytronic will \"creep\" forwards when the driver's foot is released from the brake pedal when the car is stationary.\n\n===Packard===\nAlso in 1941, [[Packard]] introduced the Electro-Matic [[clutch]], which was a vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by the position of the accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably due to the fact that the system was somewhat unstable during [[engine]] warm-up. [[Packard]]'s system was used in conjunction with their regular [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] so the H-pattern shifting remained.\n\nEarlier, and by many manufacturers, an arrangement to disengage the clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called \"[[freewheel]]ing\", it was bedeviled by the absence of adequate brakes.\n\n===Plymouth===\nIn 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', to their standard 3-speed manual gearbox. The torque converter allowed the car to remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired.  Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.\n\n===Porsche===\nPorsche has created various automated manual and [[Manumatic]] transmissions, starting with Porsche's \"SportoMatic\" transmission in 1968. This transmission was marketed as an \"Automatic,\" despite it having no fully automatic mode. This automated manual transmission was a conventional four-speed manual gearbox, but with a vaccuum-operated single-disc dry clutch. A torque converter was utilized in place of a flywheel, and shifts and clutch were operated electromechanically whenever the driver moved the gearshift. The next \"automated\" transmission was the Porsche \"Tiptronic\" [[manumatic]] transmission of the 1990s, which was essentially a torque converter automatic transmission, but containing a built-in \"manual\" shift mechanism. The newest automated manual transmission by Porsche is the \"Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe\" (PDK), which literally translates to \"Porsche dual-clutch transmission.\" It has two separate clutches and shafts combined into one housing unit, essentially with one clutch operating the odd gears, and one the clutch the even gears. All this is actuated automatically, and operated through the electrohydraulic actuators of the transmission's computer.<ref name=\"caranddriver3\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15366473/shift-this-a-history-of-porsches-sportomatic-tiptronic-and-pdk-transmissions/\n|title=A History of Porsche\u2019s Sportomatic, Tiptronic, and PDK Transmissions\n|website=Car and Driver\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=Dec 10, 2013\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\n===Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi / Dacia / Infiniti===\nFor the [[Renault Dauphine]], a Ferlec semi-automatic was offered from 1957 until 1963, when the \"fully automatic\" Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available.

The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1968 Volkswagen Beetle (on sale in August 1967), and was made available on the Karmann Ghia during 1968.

These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated by a series of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.\n\nIn the UK though, semi-automatic transmissions have been very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London [[AEC Routemaster]], although the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from [[Self-Changing Gears]] Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided with the development of city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. [[Leyland Bus|Leyland]] manufactured many buses with semi-automatic transmissions, including its [[Leyland Leopard|Leopard]] and [[Leyland Tiger|Tiger]] coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and semi-automatic transmissions lost favour. These days, very few buses with semi-automatic transmissions remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of [[manumatic]] transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.\n\n===Trains===\n====Railcars====\nThe Self-Changing Gears automated gearbox was also fitted to the several thousand diesel railcars built for the British railway system in the late 1950s-early 1960s, which lasted in service until the 1990s-2000s. Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]]. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed of a number of such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated gearbox units mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.\n\n====Locomotives====\nSemi-automatic transmission was also used on many small diesel [[shunting locomotive]]s, such as [[British Rail Class 03]] and [[British Rail Class 04]]. A widely used type was the Wilson-Drewry epicyclic gearbox.\n\nA less common type was the SSS (synchro-self-shifting) Powerflow gearbox.  This gearbox was of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and [[dog clutch]] engagement.  A special feature was that the drive was maintained during upward gearchanges. This system was used on [[Hudswell Clarke|Huwood-Hudswell]] diesel mines locomotives<ref name=\"dmm1\" /> and on the [[British Rail Class D2/7]] and [[British Rail Class D2/12]].\n\n===Motorcycles===\n\nThe first motorcycles with semi-automatic gearboxes were developed and patented in the mid 1960s by the Czechoslovakian [[Jawa Moto|Jawa]] motorcycle company.<ref name=CZ>{{cite web |title=V\u00e1lka mechanik\u016f: Japonci okop\u00edrovali \u010desk\u00fd vyn\u00e1lez! |url=https://epochaplus.cz/valka-mechaniku-japonci-okopirovali-cesky-vynalez/ |website=EpochaPlus|language=cs-CZ|date=20 January 2015|last=Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk|first=Marek|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Honda copied the Jawa semi-automatic clutch for the [[Honda Super Cub|Honda Cub]] step-through motorcycle series and so Jawa sued them in court for patent infringement. Honda settled out of court and Jawa granted them indefinite licence with royalties charged on each Honda motorcycle that used the Jawa system.<ref name=CZ/>\n\nThe first large capacity motorcycle with a semi-automatic gearbox was the 1975 {{cvt|948|cc|abbr=on}} Moto Guzzi Convert (the name was chosen to denote the torque converter which was at the heart of this 110&nbsp;mph motorcycle){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} a fairly heavy motorcycle which despite its weight still handled, and cornered remarkably well, which was thanks to the race-bred frame from the Moto Guzzi Le Mans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHonda also had a range of bikes fitted with a gearbox that mated a torque converter and a two speed gearbox. This style of gearbox still required the rider to manually selected neutral and either of the two gears using the foot gear lever.<ref name=\"cyclemay1976p69\">{{cite journal|title=[[Cycle (magazine)|Cycle magazine]]|date=May 1976|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|p=67\u201373}}</ref> These models were the [[Honda CB750#CB750A Hondamatic|CB750A]], [[Honda CB400T#CB400A Hawk Hondamatic|CB400A]], [[Honda CM400|CM400A]] and [[Honda CM450A|CM450A]]. These bikes were badged and marketed as Hondamatics.\n\nIn addition to the Hondamatic system noted above, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year [[FJR1300]] [[sport-touring]] motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.\n\nHonda began production of the [[Honda VFR1200F|VFR1200F]] on 8 September 2009,<ref name=\"autoblog1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/honda-to-launch-first-ever-dual-clutch-gearbox-for-motorcycles-w/\n|title=Honda to launch first-ever dual clutch gearbox for motorcycles with new VFR\n|website=\n|last=Korzeniewski \n|first=Jeremy\n|date=Sep 9, 2009\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref> which includes an optional [[dual clutch transmission]], the first to be fitted to a motorcycle.\n\nThe [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster]] is available with a clutchless automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with five or six speeds, depending on the model).\n\nSmall capacity [[Types of motorcycles#Scooters, underbones and mopeds|underbone]] or \"step-thru\" types of motorcycles, such as the Honda Super Cub, [[Suzuki FR50]] and [[Suzuki FR80|FR80]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] Townmate, use a semi-automatic gearbox with a \"heel and toe\" foot change in the standard motorcycle position but without the need for conventional clutch operation.\n\nMany modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially \"blips\" the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===ATVs===\nHonda released automated electric shift ATVs starting in model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting is accomplished by pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal and the addition of an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, shift drum, etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been. This electric shift technology was later applied to their complete line of ATVs.\n\n==Types==\n* [[Dual-clutch transmission]]\n* [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission]] (e.g. BMW sequential manual gearbox, SMG)\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Saxomat]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n* [[Shift kit]]\n* [[Shift time]]\n* [[Dual clutch transmission]] (DCT)\n* [[Automatic manual transmission]]\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Honda I-SHIFT]]\n* [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]]\n* [[Automatic transmission]]\n* [[Tiptronic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Semi-automatic transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle transmissions]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power control]]\n", "name_user": "Davism0703", "label": "safe", "comment": "Paragraphing and rearranging so it makes sense.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_transmission"}
