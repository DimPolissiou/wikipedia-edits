A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Miletopolis]] in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.\n\nOn 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the '''Diocese of New Westminster'''. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.\n\nOn 1894.07.27, during his tenure, the US [[Territory of Alaska]] was lost in the creation of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska]].\n\nAnother French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the [[Superior General]] of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.\n\n=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===\nIn 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to [[Archdiocese of Vancouver Island]] and in 1904, it was renamed as the [[Archdiocese of Victoria]]. A German-born Bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed Archbishop in 1903 and lead the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.\n\nOn 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver'''<ref name=\"vatican.va\"/> and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of [[Nova Scotia]], was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.\n\n=== The Canadian Bishops ===\nFor just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George\u2019s, [[Newfoundland]], became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.\n\nAugust, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, [[New Brunswick]], becomes the 5th Archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the Archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a Cathedral. He served his community until his death on October 1931.\n\n=== The \"Iron Duke\" years ===\nAugust 1928, a priest from St. John, New Brunswick, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community Archbishop Duke had to deal with the [[Great Depression]] of the [[Dirty Thirties]] and later [[World War II]]. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the Archdiocese earned him the title \u201cIron Duke\u201d. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark\u2019s College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.\n\nDuring his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish [[suffragan]] sees : on 1936.02.22 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nelson|Diocese of Nelson]] was erected and on 1945.12.22 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new diocese helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson\n\nThe bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during the last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.\n\n=== Project Advance years ===\nAuxiliary Bishop [[James Carney (bishop)|James Carney]] became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the Archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.\n\nIt enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope John Paul II]] in August 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/vanc0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada|work=GCatholic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Archdiocesan synod ===\nThe archdiocese concluded a nine-year [[synod#Synods|synod]] in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.\n\nAlthough it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod\u2019s aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the \u201cmaintenance\u201d mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former Archbishop Emeritus [[Adam Exner]], OMI, put it.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop [[Raymond Roussin]] officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.\n\nAccording to the archdiocesan newspaper ''The B.C. Catholic'', the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. \"Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.\"\n\n=== Current Situation ===\nThe archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Renewal Project Brief|url=http://rcav.org/infrastructure-renewal-project-brief/|website=Archdiocese of Vancouver}}</ref> The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Contrasting two B.C.

On the escutcheon it is depicted as casting a net into the ocean referencing [[Matthew 4]]:18-19:<blockquote>''\"As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Miletopolis]] in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.\n\nOn 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the '''Diocese of New Westminster'''. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.\n\nOn 1894.07.27, during his tenure, the US [[Territory of Alaska]] was lost in the creation of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska]].\n\nAnother French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the [[Superior General]] of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.\n\n=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===\nIn 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to [[Archdiocese of Vancouver Island]] and in 1904, it was renamed as the [[Archdiocese of Victoria]]. A German-born Bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed Archbishop in 1903 and lead the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.\n\nOn 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver'''<ref name=\"vatican.va\"/> and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of [[Nova Scotia]], was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.\n\n=== The Canadian Bishops ===\nFor just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George\u2019s, [[Newfoundland]], became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.\n\nAugust, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, [[New Brunswick]], becomes the 5th Archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the Archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a Cathedral. He served his community until his death on October 1931.\n\n=== The \"Iron Duke\" years ===\nAugust 1928, a priest from St. John, New Brunswick, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community Archbishop Duke had to deal with the [[Great Depression]] of the [[Dirty Thirties]] and later [[World War II]]. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the Archdiocese earned him the title \u201cIron Duke\u201d. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark\u2019s College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.\n\nDuring his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish [[suffragan]] sees : on 1936.02.22 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nelson|Diocese of Nelson]] was erected and on 1945.12.22 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new diocese helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson\n\nThe bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during the last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.\n\n=== Project Advance years ===\nAuxiliary Bishop [[James Carney (bishop)|James Carney]] became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the Archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.\n\nIt enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope John Paul II]] in August 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/vanc0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada|work=GCatholic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Archdiocesan synod ===\nThe archdiocese concluded a nine-year [[synod#Synods|synod]] in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.\n\nAlthough it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod\u2019s aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the \u201cmaintenance\u201d mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former Archbishop Emeritus [[Adam Exner]], OMI, put it.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop [[Raymond Roussin]] officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.\n\nAccording to the archdiocesan newspaper ''The B.C. Catholic'', the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. \"Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.\"\n\n=== Current Situation ===\nThe archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Renewal Project Brief|url=http://rcav.org/infrastructure-renewal-project-brief/|website=Archdiocese of Vancouver}}</ref> The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Contrasting two B.C.
