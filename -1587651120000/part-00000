After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations.

Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]]. It ran for 364 performances.

ABC aired the first three episodes of the show's second season that had been taped before his death, each of which was introduced by Katey Sagal.

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

When he became a writer of short stories, he retained this [[Minimalism|minimalistic]] style, focusing on surface elements without explicitly discussing underlying themes. Hemingway believed the deeper meaning of a story should not be evident on the surface, but should shine through implicitly.\n\n== Background ==\nLike other American writers such as [[Mark Twain]], [[Stephen Crane]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[Sinclair Lewis]] and [[Willa Cather]], Hemingway worked as a journalist before becoming a novelist. After graduating from high school he went to work as a cub reporter for ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',<ref name=\"Meyers p23\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=23}}</ref> where he quickly learned that truth often lurks below the surface of a story.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1998 17\">{{Harvnb|Reynolds|1998|p=17}}</ref> He learned about corruption in city politics, and that in hospital emergency rooms and police stations a mask of cynicism was worn \"like armour to shield whatever vulnerabilities remained\".<ref name=\"Reynolds 1998 17\"/> In his pieces he wrote about relevant events, excluding the background. As foreign correspondent for the ''[[Toronto Star]]'', while living in Paris in the early 1920s,  he covered the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u20131922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in more than a dozen articles.

In ''[[A Moveable Feast]]'', his posthumously published memoirs about his years as a young writer in Paris, he explains: \"I omitted the real end [of \"Out of Season\"] which was that the old man hanged himself. This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story.\"<ref name=\"Smith\"/>  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.<!-- expand and add quotation here --><ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nHemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned \"how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"<ref name =\"Baker p117\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}</ref> Baker also notes that the writing style of the \"iceberg theory\" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.<ref name =\"Baker p117\"/>\n\nFor example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in \"[[Big Two-Hearted River]],\" while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself\u2014Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321\u2013322}}</ref>  In his essay \"The Art of the Short Story\", Hemingway is clear about his method: \"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"<ref name=\"HemingwaySS\">{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}</ref> A writer explained how it brings a story ''gravitas'':\n\n{{quote|Hemingway said that only the tip of the iceberg showed in fiction\u2014your reader will see only what is above the water\u2014but the knowledge that you have about your character that never makes it into the story acts as the bulk of the iceberg. And that is what gives your story weight and gravitas.|[[Jenna Blum]] in ''The Author at Work'', 2013<ref name=JennaBlum8>Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 9, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, \"... that is what gives your story weight and gravitas. ... \"</ref>}}\n\nFrom reading [[Rudyard Kipling]] Hemingway absorbed the practice of shortening [[prose]] as much as it could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in \"The Art of the Short Story\": \"You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood.\"<ref name=\"Meyers p114\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=114}}</ref> By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author strengthened the piece of fiction and that the \"quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Meyers p114\"/> His style added to the aesthetic: using \"declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world\" with simple and plain language, Hemingway became \"the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century\" according to biographer Meyers.<ref name=\"Meyers p114\"/>\n\nIn her paper \"Hemingway's Camera Eye\", Zoe Trodd explains that Hemingway uses repetition in prose to build a collage of snapshots to create an entire picture. Of his iceberg theory, she claims, it \"is also a glacier waterfall, infused with movement by his multi-focal aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Trodd\">{{Harvnb|Trodd|2007}}</ref> Furthermore, she believes that Hemingway's iceberg theory \"demanded that the reader feel the ''whole'' story\" and that the reader is meant to \"fill the gaps left by his omissions with their feelings\".<ref name=\"Trodd\"/>\n\nHemingway scholar Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general\u2014not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama. The means of achieving a strong drama is to minimize, or omit, the feelings that produced the fiction he wrote.<ref name =\"Benson\">{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}</ref>\n\nHemingway's iceberg theory highlights the symbolic implications of art. He makes use of physical action to provide an interpretation of the nature of man's existence. It can be convincingly proved that, \"while representing human life through fictional forms, he has consistently set man against the background of his world and universe to examine the human situation from various points of view.\"<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last =Halliday\n  | first =E.M.\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title =Hemingway's Ambiguity: Symbolism and Irony\n  | journal =American Literature\n  | volume =28\n  | issue =1\n  | pages =1\u201322\n  | year =1956\n  | jstor =2922718\n  | doi =10.2307/2922718\n  | publisher =American Literature, Vol. 28, No. 1\n  | ref =harv\n  | postscript =<!--None-->  }}\n</ref>\n\n== Early fiction and short stories ==\nWendolyn Tetlow believes that Hemingway's early fiction such as \"[[Indian Camp]]\" shows his lack of concern for [[Character (arts)|character development]] by simply placing the character in his or her surroundings. However, in \"Indian Camp\" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\nIn other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's \"[[Hills Like White Elephants]]\" does not mention the word \"abortion\", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}</ref> \"Big Two-Hearted River\", Hemingway explains, \"is about a boy ... coming home from the war ... So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war, is omitted.\"<ref name=\"HemingwaySS\"/> Hemingway intentionally left out something in \"Indian Camp\" and \"Big Two-Hearted River\"\u2014two stories he considered to be good.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}</ref>\n\nBaker explains that Hemingway's stories about sports are often about the athletes themselves and that the sport is incidental to the story. Moreover, the story \"[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]\" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night\u2014none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.<ref name=\"Baker 1972 123\u2013125\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123\u2013125}}</ref> Hemingway's story \"Big Two-Hearted River\" is ostensibly about nothing, as is \"A Clean Well Lighted Place\", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.<ref name=\"Baker 1972 123\u2013125\"/>\n\n== Novels ==\nHemingway scholar Jackson Benson further believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a \"distance\" between himself and the character he \"becomes more practiced, it would seem.\" Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as \"the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails,\" as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.<ref name =\"Benson\"/>\n\nBaker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a \"lyric-poetical novel\" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].<ref name= \"Baker1972 pp274-255\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274\u2013275}}</ref> According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major \"shock\"\u2014the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home\u2014to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.<ref name= \"Meyers1985 p445\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}</ref> Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: \"Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}</ref>\n\nHemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: \"In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened.\"<ref name=\"Smith\">qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}</ref> Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to \"strengthen [the] iceberg\".<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.<ref name=\"Baker p338\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}</ref> The prize was awarded to Hemingway \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:\n\n<blockquote>No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abductive reasoning]]\n*[[Case-based reasoning]]\n*[[Casuistry]]\n*[[Concision]]\n*[[Gonzo journalism]]\n*[[I know it when I see it]]\n*[[Purposeful omission]]\n*[[Show, don't tell]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Carlos|authorlink= Carlos Baker |title=Hemingway: The Writer as Artist|url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaywritera00bake|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1972|edition=4th|isbn=0-691-01305-5|ref = CITEREFBaker1972}}\n*{{cite book |title=New Critical Approaches to the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway |editor-first=Jackson |editor-last=Benson |chapter=The Art of the Short Story |author=Ernest Hemingway|year= 1990|publisher=Duke University Press  |isbn= 978-0-8223-1067-9|ref=CITEREFHemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Jackson |year=1989 |title= Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life|journal=American Literature |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013358 |doi= 10.2307/2926824|ref = CITEREFBenson1989 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Ernest Hemingway A to Z: The Essential Reference to the Life and Work |last=Oliver |first=Charles M. |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3467-2 |ref=CITEREFOliver1999 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ernesthemingwayt0000oliv }}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Life Without Consequences|last=Mellow |first=James R. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-395-37777-3 |ref = CITEREFMellow1992}}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Biography|last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-42126-4 |ref = CITEREFMeyers1985}}\n*{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway| title=Ernest Hemingway, The Art of Fiction No. 21| work=The Paris Review| date=Spring 1958| author=George Plimpton| ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Young Hemingway |last=Reynolds|first=Michael S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-31776-5|oclc= |ref = CITEREFReynolds1998}}\n*{{cite book |title=Hemingway's In our time: lyrical dimensions |url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaysinourt0000tetl |url-access=registration |last=Tetlow |first=Wendolyn |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |edition = |publisher=Associated University Presses |location= Cranbury NJ |isbn=0-8387-5219-5 |ref=CITEREFTetlow}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Smith, Paul. |year=1983 |title=Hemingway's Early Manuscripts: The Theory and Practice of Omission |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |publisher=Indiana University Press |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages= 268\u2013288|jstor=3831126 |ref=CITEREFSmith1983 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Ben |year=2003 |title= The Stones of Venice, Time and Remembrance: Calculus and Proust in ''Across the River and into the Trees''|journal=The Hemingway Review|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=20\u201329 |ref=CITEREFStoltzfus2003}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Trodd |first1=Zoe |year=2007 |title= Hemingway's camera eye: The problems of language and an interwar politics of form|journal=The Hemingway Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201321 |doi=10.1353/hem.2007.0012|ref=CITEREFTrodd2007}}\n\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:American literature]]\n[[Category:Ernest Hemingway]]\n[[Category:Literary theory]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:ErnestHemingway.jpg|thumb|Ernest Hemingway as photographed for the 1940 edition of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'']]\nThe '''iceberg theory''' or '''theory of omission''' is a [[writing]] technique coined by American writer [[Ernest Hemingway]].

This was omitted on my new theory that you could omit anything&nbsp;... and the omitted part would strengthen the story.\"<ref name=\"Smith\"/>  In chapter sixteen of ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'' he compares his theory about writing to an iceberg.<!-- expand and add quotation here --><ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nHemingway's biographer [[Carlos Baker]] believed that as a writer of short stories Hemingway learned \"how to get the most from the least, how to prune language and avoid waste motion, how to multiply intensities, and how to tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth.\"<ref name =\"Baker p117\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|p= 117}}</ref> Baker also notes that the writing style of the \"iceberg theory\" suggests that a story's narrative and nuanced complexities, complete with symbolism, operate under the surface of the story itself.<ref name =\"Baker p117\"/>\n\nFor example, Hemingway believed a writer could describe an action, such as Nick Adams fishing in \"[[Big Two-Hearted River]],\" while conveying a ''different'' message about the action itself\u2014Nick Adams concentrating on fishing to the extent that he does not have to think about the unpleasantness of his war experience.<ref>{{Harvnb|Oliver|1999|pp=321\u2013322}}</ref>  In his essay \"The Art of the Short Story\", Hemingway is clear about his method: \"A few things I have found to be true. If you leave out important things or events that you know about, the story is strengthened. If you leave or skip something because you do not know it, the story will be worthless. The test of any story is how very good the stuff that you, not your editors, omit.\"<ref name=\"HemingwaySS\">{{Harvnb|Hemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}</ref> A writer explained how it brings a story ''gravitas'':\n\n{{quote|Hemingway said that only the tip of the iceberg showed in fiction\u2014your reader will see only what is above the water\u2014but the knowledge that you have about your character that never makes it into the story acts as the bulk of the iceberg. And that is what gives your story weight and gravitas.|[[Jenna Blum]] in ''The Author at Work'', 2013<ref name=JennaBlum8>Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 9, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}, \"... that is what gives your story weight and gravitas. ... \"</ref>}}\n\nFrom reading [[Rudyard Kipling]] Hemingway absorbed the practice of shortening [[prose]] as much as it could take. Of the concept of omission, Hemingway wrote in \"The Art of the Short Story\": \"You could omit anything if you knew that you omitted and the omitted part would strengthen the story and make people feel something more than they understood.\"<ref name=\"Meyers p114\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985| p=114}}</ref> By making invisible the structure of the story, he believed the author strengthened the piece of fiction and that the \"quality of a piece could be judged by the quality of the material the author eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Meyers p114\"/> His style added to the aesthetic: using \"declarative sentences and direct representations of the visible world\" with simple and plain language, Hemingway became \"the most influential prose stylist in the twentieth century\" according to biographer Meyers.<ref name=\"Meyers p114\"/>\n\nIn her paper \"Hemingway's Camera Eye\", Zoe Trodd explains that Hemingway uses repetition in prose to build a collage of snapshots to create an entire picture. Of his iceberg theory, she claims, it \"is also a glacier waterfall, infused with movement by his multi-focal aesthetic\".<ref name=\"Trodd\">{{Harvnb|Trodd|2007}}</ref> Furthermore, she believes that Hemingway's iceberg theory \"demanded that the reader feel the ''whole'' story\" and that the reader is meant to \"fill the gaps left by his omissions with their feelings\".<ref name=\"Trodd\"/>\n\nHemingway scholar Jackson Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details to work as framing devices to write about life in general\u2014not only about his life. For example, Benson postulates that Hemingway used his experiences and drew them out further with \"what if\" scenarios: \"what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?\" By separating himself from the characters he created, Hemingway strengthens the drama. The means of achieving a strong drama is to minimize, or omit, the feelings that produced the fiction he wrote.<ref name =\"Benson\">{{Harvnb|Benson|1989}}</ref>\n\nHemingway's iceberg theory highlights the symbolic implications of art. He makes use of physical action to provide an interpretation of the nature of man's existence. It can be convincingly proved that, \"while representing human life through fictional forms, he has consistently set man against the background of his world and universe to examine the human situation from various points of view.\"<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last =Halliday\n  | first =E.M.\n  | author-link =\n  | last2 =\n  | first2 =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title =Hemingway's Ambiguity: Symbolism and Irony\n  | journal =American Literature\n  | volume =28\n  | issue =1\n  | pages =1\u201322\n  | year =1956\n  | jstor =2922718\n  | doi =10.2307/2922718\n  | publisher =American Literature, Vol. 28, No. 1\n  | ref =harv\n  | postscript =<!--None-->  }}\n</ref>\n\n== Early fiction and short stories ==\nWendolyn Tetlow believes that Hemingway's early fiction such as \"[[Indian Camp]]\" shows his lack of concern for [[Character (arts)|character development]] by simply placing the character in his or her surroundings. However, in \"Indian Camp\" the use of descriptive detail such as a screaming woman, men smoking tobacco, and an infected wound build a sense of veracity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tetlow|pp=53\u201355}}</ref>\nIn other words, a story can communicate by [[subtext]]; for instance, Hemingway's \"[[Hills Like White Elephants]]\" does not mention the word \"abortion\", although in the story the male character seems to be attempting to convince his girlfriend to have an abortion.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mellow|1992|p=348}}</ref> \"Big Two-Hearted River\", Hemingway explains, \"is about a boy ... coming home from the war ... So the war, all mention of the war, anything about the war, is omitted.\"<ref name=\"HemingwaySS\"/> Hemingway intentionally left out something in \"Indian Camp\" and \"Big Two-Hearted River\"\u2014two stories he considered to be good.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}</ref>\n\nBaker explains that Hemingway's stories about sports are often about the athletes themselves and that the sport is incidental to the story. Moreover, the story \"[[A Clean Well Lighted Place]]\" which on the surface is about nothing more than men drinking in a cafe late at night, is in fact about that which brings the men to the cafe to drink, and the reasons they seek light in the night\u2014none of which is available in the surface of the plot, but lurks in the iceberg below.<ref name=\"Baker 1972 123\u2013125\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=123\u2013125}}</ref> Hemingway's story \"Big Two-Hearted River\" is ostensibly about nothing, as is \"A Clean Well Lighted Place\", but within nothing lies the crux of the story.<ref name=\"Baker 1972 123\u2013125\"/>\n\n== Novels ==\nBenson believes that the omission Hemingway applies functions as a sort of buffer between himself as the creator of a character and the character. He explains that as an author creates a \"distance\" between himself and the character he \"becomes more practiced, it would seem.\" Benson says in Hemingway's fiction the distance is necessary, and successful in early fiction such as in ''[[The Sun Also Rises]],'' but if he as \"the author does not deliberately create such distance the fiction fails,\" as in the later works such as ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]''.<ref name =\"Benson\"/>\n\nBaker calls Hemingway's ''Across the River and into the Trees'' a \"lyric-poetical novel\" in which each scene has an underlying truth presented via [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].<ref name= \"Baker1972 pp274-255\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972|pp=274\u2013275}}</ref> According to Meyers an example of omission is that Renata, like other heroines in Hemingway's fiction, suffers a major \"shock\"\u2014the murder of her father and the subsequent loss of her home\u2014to which Hemingway alludes only briefly.<ref name= \"Meyers1985 p445\">{{Harvnb|Meyers|1985|p=445}}</ref> Hemingway's pared down narrative forces the reader to solve connections. As Stoltzfus remarks: \"Hemingway walks the reader to the bridge that he must cross alone without the narrator's help.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Stoltzfus|2003}}</ref>\n\nHemingway believed that if context or background had been written about by another, and written about well, then it could be left out of his writing. Of ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'' he explains: \"In writing you are limited to by what has already been done satisfactorily. So I have tried to do something else. First I have tried to eliminate everything unnecessary to conveying experience to the reader so that after he has read something it will become part of his experience and seem actually to have happened.\"<ref name=\"Smith\">qtd in {{Harvnb|Smith|1983}}</ref> Paul Smith, author of ''Hemingway's Early Manuscript: The Theory and Practice of Omission'', believes Hemingway applied the theory of omission in effort to \"strengthen [the] iceberg\".<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nIn October 1954 Hemingway received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He jokingly told the press he believed [[Carl Sandburg]] and [[Isak Dinesen]] deserved the prize more than he, but that the prize money would be welcome.<ref name=\"Baker p338\">{{Harvnb|Baker|1972| p=338}}</ref> The prize was awarded to Hemingway \"for his mastery of the art of narrative, most recently demonstrated in ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]'', and for the influence that he has exerted on contemporary style.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1954/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1954 |year=1954 |work= Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref> A few days after the announcement, Hemingway spoke with a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine correspondent, while on his boat fishing off the coast of Cuba. When asked about the use of symbolism in his work, and particularly in the most recently published ''Old Man and the Sea'', he explained:\n\n<blockquote>No good book has ever been written that has in it symbols arrived at beforehand and stuck in ... That kind of symbol sticks out like raisins in raisin bread. Raisin bread is all right, but plain bread is better. ... I tried to make a real old man, a real boy, a real sea, a real fish and real sharks. But if I made them good and true enough they would mean many things. The hardest thing is to make something really true and sometimes truer than true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,935439-5,00.html|title= An American Storyteller |date=13 December 1954 |work= Time Magazine |publisher=Time, Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-25}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abductive reasoning]]\n*[[Case-based reasoning]]\n*[[Casuistry]]\n*[[Concision]]\n*[[Gonzo journalism]]\n*[[I know it when I see it]]\n*[[Purposeful omission]]\n*[[Show, don't tell]]\n\n== References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources==\n*{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Carlos|authorlink= Carlos Baker |title=Hemingway: The Writer as Artist|url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaywritera00bake|url-access=registration|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1972|edition=4th|isbn=0-691-01305-5|ref = CITEREFBaker1972}}\n*{{cite book |title=New Critical Approaches to the Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway |editor-first=Jackson |editor-last=Benson |chapter=The Art of the Short Story |author=Ernest Hemingway|year= 1990|publisher=Duke University Press  |isbn= 978-0-8223-1067-9|ref=CITEREFHemingway, The Art of the Short Story}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Benson |first1=Jackson |year=1989 |title= Ernest Hemingway: The Life as Fiction and the Fiction as Life|journal=American Literature |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=345\u2013358 |doi= 10.2307/2926824|ref = CITEREFBenson1989 }}\n*{{cite book |title=Ernest Hemingway A to Z: The Essential Reference to the Life and Work |last=Oliver |first=Charles M. |year=1999 |publisher=Checkmark |location=New York |isbn=0-8160-3467-2 |ref=CITEREFOliver1999 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ernesthemingwayt0000oliv }}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Life Without Consequences|last=Mellow |first=James R. |authorlink= |year=1992 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|isbn=0-395-37777-3 |ref = CITEREFMellow1992}}\n*{{cite book |title= Hemingway: A Biography|last=Meyers |first=Jeffrey |authorlink= |year=1985 |publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=0-333-42126-4 |ref = CITEREFMeyers1985}}\n*{{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4825/the-art-of-fiction-no-21-ernest-hemingway| title=Ernest Hemingway, The Art of Fiction No. 21| work=The Paris Review| date=Spring 1958| author=George Plimpton| ref=harv }}\n*{{cite book |title=The Young Hemingway |last=Reynolds|first=Michael S. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Norton |location=New York |isbn=0-393-31776-5|oclc= |ref = CITEREFReynolds1998}}\n*{{cite book |title=Hemingway's In our time: lyrical dimensions |url=https://archive.org/details/hemingwaysinourt0000tetl |url-access=registration |last=Tetlow |first=Wendolyn |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1992 |edition = |publisher=Associated University Presses |location= Cranbury NJ |isbn=0-8387-5219-5 |ref=CITEREFTetlow}}\n*{{cite journal |author=Smith, Paul. |year=1983 |title=Hemingway's Early Manuscripts: The Theory and Practice of Omission |journal=Journal of Modern Literature |publisher=Indiana University Press |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages= 268\u2013288|jstor=3831126 |ref=CITEREFSmith1983 }}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Stoltzfus |first1=Ben |year=2003 |title= The Stones of Venice, Time and Remembrance: Calculus and Proust in ''Across the River and into the Trees''|journal=The Hemingway Review|volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=20\u201329 |ref=CITEREFStoltzfus2003}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Trodd |first1=Zoe |year=2007 |title= Hemingway's camera eye: The problems of language and an interwar politics of form|journal=The Hemingway Review |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=7\u201321 |doi=10.1353/hem.2007.0012|ref=CITEREFTrodd2007}}\n\n\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:American literature]]\n[[Category:Ernest Hemingway]]\n[[Category:Literary theory]]\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eNovels", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iceberg_theory"}

His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended.

In this historical context, PRS comprises three stages equivalent to those subsumed within PRS: thesis (intellectual proposition, problem), antithesis (negation of the proposition, response to thesis), and synthesis (resolution of tension between proposition and reaction, resolution).

As he stood in the circle he had two thoughts: that people would be talking about this in 100 years, and that it would be over when it rained. His body shook as though plugged into an electrical socket, he wrote, and new ideas poured into him. Then it started raining and the experience ended.

In this historical context, PRS comprises three stages equivalent to those subsumed within PRS: thesis (intellectual proposition, problem), antithesis (negation of the proposition, response to thesis), and synthesis (resolution of tension between proposition and reaction, resolution).

Alats might also be known to Arab and Persian Muslims as ''Khalaj''.\n\nLiterature on Alats is very rich; Alats were a subject of study by ''[[Old Book of Tang|Tangshu]]'',  ''[[Jiu Tangshu]]'', ''[[Tang Huiyao]]'', N.Ya.

Tang Huiyao mentioned, right after the [[Ashina tribe]], a tribe named ''Geluozhiya'' (\u845b\u7f85\u679d\u7259) ([[Middle Chinese]] [[Zhengzhang Shangfang|ZS]]: *''k\u0251t\u031a-l\u0251-t\u0361\u0255i\u1d07-\u014b\u02e0a''), whose [[tamga]] is depicted as [[File:AlachinGe-lo-chji27Zuev.gif]].<ref>Zuev Yu.A., ''\"Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms (translation of Chinese composition \"Tanghuiyao\" of the 8th to 10th centuries)\"'', Kazakh SSR Academy of Sciences, Alma-Ata, 1960, pp. 124, 132 (in Russian).</ref>. [[Yury Zuev|Zuev]] amended this to ''Eluozhi'' (supposedly from MC *''a-la-tsie'') and asserted that this is the earliest transmission and certainly ascends to Alagchin (Alachin, Alchin, Alchi). During the Tang period, Chinese chroniclers calqued the ethonym Alat as ''Boma'' \"skewbald horses\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Zuev Yu.A., ''\"Horse Tamgas from Vassal Princedoms\"'', p. 124</ref> and *''Bi-la'', meaning unknown. Elsewhere, Zuev stated that \"Sometimes the tribal name \u66f7\u524c ''Hela'' (< ''\u0263\u0430-l\u00e2t'' < *''alat'' < *''ala-at'' \"skewbald horse\") is written down with hieroglyphs \u8cc0\u8cf4 ''Helai'' (''\u0263\u00e2-l\u00e2i'' < ''alai''), which is equivalent to \u8cc0\u862d ''Helan'' (< ''alan'' ~ ''ala'' \"skewbald, motley, mixed\").<ref>Zuev, Yu. \"Xueyantuo Khaganate and Kimeks: Turkic ethnogeography of the Central Asia in the middle of 7th century\" Shygys, No 1, pp. 11-21, No 2, pp. 3-26 (2004) Oriental Studies Institute, Almaty</ref>\n\nChinese transcribers also preserved many similar titles, individual and tribal names in [[Xianbei]] society, where horse were held in high esteemed: \n# tribal name ''Helan'' (\u8cc0\u862d); \n# individual names: such as Xiongnu Shanyu ''Helaitou'' (\u8cc0\u8cf4\u982d); [[Tuyuhun]] prince ''Helutou'' (\u8cc0\u865c\u982d); [[Xia (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Tiefu Xiongnu]] chief Liuhu's second son ''Eloutou'' (\u95bc\u964b\u982d); Northern Wei general [[Gao Huan]]'s Xianbei name ''Heliuhun'' (\u8cc0\u516d\u6e3e), Aliutou (\u963f\u516d\u982d), Heliutou (\u8cc0\u516d\u982d); \n# the title ''Helazhen'' \u8cc0\u524c\u771f (recorded in [[Book of Qi|Nanqishu]]) of bodyguards (\u4e09\u90ce) serving Northern Wei emperors in the 5th century. \n\nAccording to [[Peter A. Boodberg]] the title Helazhen \"undoubtedly *''atla\u010din'' 'horseman' from Tk. ''atla'' 'to mount a horse'\", thus \"a purely Turkish form in T'o-pa [Tuoba]\".

The Alash leaders in December 1917 proclaimed establishment of Alash Orda, a Kazakh government, aligned with the Russian White Army and fought against the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nIn 1919, when the White forces were losing, Alash Autonomous government began negotiations with the Bolsheviks. In 1919\u201320 Bolsheviks defeated the White Russian forces in the region and occupied Kazakhstan. On August 26, 1920, the new Soviet government disbanded the Alash Autonomy, and established the \"Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\", later the name was changed in 1925 to \"Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\" and changed again in 1936 to \"Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic\". However, the movement for independence continued, and it continued until 1925, when the war for independence was finally extinguished\n\n==Modern demographics==\nThe historical Alats' descendants now live in China, Russia in the Altai, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, eastern section of the Iranian plateau, India, and Afghanistan.\n\nHelan tribesmembers who migrated to China changed their surname to [[He (surname)|H\u00e8]] (trad. \u8cc0; simp. \u8d3a) and would eventually become assimilated into [[Han Chinese]].\n\nAlats are also the  main ethnic component in the Kazakh Junior-Kishi [[Zhuz]] and constitute parts of [[Uzbeks]]. Further west, Alats constitute one [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkish]] tribe, ''Ulayundlu\u011f'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and ''Alayuntluq'' in [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], which means \"with spotted horses\".

In the Causacus, in Armenia and [[Azerbaijan]] are a number of settlements with the name ascending to the Alats; they also are in Uzbekistan and Tatarstan, and in the form ''Kalat'' in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. In Afghanistan, Alats are known as one of the largest Pashtun tribes, the [[Ghilzai]]s; they were pasturing at the Ghazni plateau. In India, Alats are called Ghalzae. In Khorasan, Alats are called Kalat.\n\n==Linguistic distinction==\nPrincipal linguistic work on Alat language ([[Khalaj language|Khalaj]] in modern [[Iran]]) was done by [[Gerhard Doerfer]], who posited a non-[[Oghuz languages|Oguz]] classification based on specific features such as preservation of three vowel lengths, preservation of word-initial ''*h'', and lack of the sound change ''*d > y''. An example of these features is the word ''hadaq'' (\"foot\"), which has preserved the initial ''*h'' and medial ''*d'', versus the Oguz form ''ayaq''. Therefore Alat is an independent language that became distinct very early from the Oguz Turkic languages.<ref>Doerfer 1971</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataturk.com/content/view/55/89/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109062059/http://www.ataturk.com/content/view/55/89/ |archivedate=2008-11-09}}</ref> Because of these distinct features, scholars speculated that the Alat (''Khalaj'') is a descendant of the [[Oghur languages|Ogur]] branch of the Turkic family, but there is no firm scholarly consensus on its affinities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Afghanistan]]\n*[[History of China]]\n*[[History of Kazakhstan]]\n*[[Alash Orda]]\n*[[History of Kyrgyzstan]]\n*[[History of Mongolia]]\n*[[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]\n*[[Oghur languages]]\n*[[Khalaj language]]\n*[[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=klj Khalaj, Turkic]\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/klj Resources in and about the Turkic Khalaj language]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316083/Khalaj-language Khalaj language]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book | last =Doerfer | first =Gerhard | publication-date =1971 | title =Khalaj Materials | publication-place =Bloomington, Indiana | publisher =Indiana University Publications | isbn =0-87750-150-5 | oclc =240052}}\n*{{cite book | author=Doerfer, Gerhard | title=Grammatik des Chaladsch |location=Wiesbaden | publisher=Harrassowitz | year=1998 | isbn=3-447-02865-3}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Doerfer, Gerhard |author2=Tezcan, Semih | title=Folklore-Texte der Chaladsch| location=Wiesbaden| publisher=Harrassowitz| year=1994}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Johanson, Lars |author2=Csat\u00f3, \u00c9va \u00c1gnes | title=The Turkic Languages | location=London | publisher=Routledge | year=1998}}\n\n{{Turkic languages}}\n{{Turkic topics}}\n{{Turkic peoples}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alat (Tribe)}}\n[[Category:Turkic peoples of Asia]]\n", "text_old": "'''Alat''' (a.k.a '''Ala-at''', '''Ala''', '''Alachin''', '''Alagchin''', '''Alchin''', '''Alchi''', '''Ulayundlu\u011f''' (\u0627\u064f\u0648\ufefb\u064a\u064f\u0646\u0652\u062f\u0652\u0644\u064f\u063a\u0652) (''\"[[piebald]] horse\"'', pinto); '''Boma''' \u99c1\u99ac or \u99ee\u99ac \"piebald horse\", '''Helai''' \u8cc0\u8cf4, '''Helan''' \u8cc0\u862d, '''Hela''' \u66f7\u524c, '''Bila''') are one of the salient [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes known from Chinese annals, Bactrian inscriptions,<ref>Sims-Williams (2005).

The Alash leaders in December 1917 proclaimed establishment of Alash Orda, a Kazakh government, aligned with the Russian White Army and fought against the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nIn 1919, when the White forces were losing, Alash Autonomous government began negotiations with the Bolsheviks. In 1919\u201320 Bolsheviks defeated the White Russian forces in the region and occupied Kazakhstan. On August 26, 1920, the new Soviet government disbanded the Alash Autonomy, and established the \"Kyrgyz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\", later the name was changed in 1925 to \"Kazak Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic\" and changed again in 1936 to \"Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic\". However, the movement for independence continued, and it continued until 1925, when the war for independence was finally extinguished\n\n==Modern demographics==\nThe historical Alats' descendants now live in China, Russia in the Altai, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkey, eastern section of the Iranian plateau, India, and Afghanistan.\n\nHelan tribesmembers who migrated to China changed their surname to [[He (surname)|H\u00e8]] (trad. \u8cc0; simp. \u8d3a) and would eventually become assimilated into [[Han Chinese]].\n\nAlats are also the  main ethnic component in the Kazakh Junior-Kishi [[Zhuz]] and constitute parts of [[Uzbeks]]. Further west, Alats constitute one [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkish]] tribe, ''Ulayundlu\u011f'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and ''Alayuntluq'' in [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], which means \"with spotted horses\". Ulanyundlu\u011f's descendants live in Central Turkey.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Ulayundlu\u011f particpiated in the ethnogenesis of [[Azeris]], as Ulayundlu\u011f [[tamga|tamgas]] have been found in historical residences of Azeris in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], and today [[Azerbaijan]].<ref>Ibrahimov, T.

In the Causacus, in Armenia and [[Azerbaijan]] are a number of settlements with the name ascending to the Alats; they also are in Uzbekistan and Tatarstan, and in the form ''Kalat'' in [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]]. In Afghanistan, Alats are known as one of the largest Pashtun tribes, the [[Ghilzai]]s; they were pasturing at the Ghazni plateau. In India, Alats are called Ghalzae. In Khorasan, Alats are called Kalat.\n\n==Linguistic distinction==\nPrincipal linguistic work on Alat language ([[Khalaj language|Khalaj]] in modern [[Iran]]) was done by [[Gerhard Doerfer]], who posited a non-[[Oghuz languages|Oguz]] classification based on specific features such as preservation of three vowel lengths, preservation of word-initial ''*h'', and lack of the sound change ''*d > y''. An example of these features is the word ''hadaq'' (\"foot\"), which has preserved the initial ''*h'' and medial ''*d'', versus the Oguz form ''ayaq''. Therefore Alat is an independent language that became distinct very early from the Oguz Turkic languages.<ref>Doerfer 1971</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataturk.com/content/view/55/89/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109062059/http://www.ataturk.com/content/view/55/89/ |archivedate=2008-11-09}}</ref> Because of these distinct features, scholars speculated that the Alat (''Khalaj'') is a descendant of the [[Oghur languages|Ogur]] branch of the Turkic family, but there is no firm scholarly consensus on its affinities.\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Afghanistan]]\n*[[History of China]]\n*[[History of Kazakhstan]]\n*[[Alash Orda]]\n*[[History of Kyrgyzstan]]\n*[[History of Mongolia]]\n*[[Mountainous Republic of the Northern Caucasus]]\n*[[Oghur languages]]\n*[[Khalaj language]]\n*[[Khalji dynasty|Khalji]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=klj Khalaj, Turkic]\n* [http://www.language-archives.org/language/klj Resources in and about the Turkic Khalaj language]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/316083/Khalaj-language Khalaj language]\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite book | last =Doerfer | first =Gerhard | publication-date =1971 | title =Khalaj Materials | publication-place =Bloomington, Indiana | publisher =Indiana University Publications | isbn =0-87750-150-5 | oclc =240052}}\n*{{cite book | author=Doerfer, Gerhard | title=Grammatik des Chaladsch |location=Wiesbaden | publisher=Harrassowitz | year=1998 | isbn=3-447-02865-3}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Doerfer, Gerhard |author2=Tezcan, Semih | title=Folklore-Texte der Chaladsch| location=Wiesbaden| publisher=Harrassowitz| year=1994}}\n*{{cite book |author1=Johanson, Lars |author2=Csat\u00f3, \u00c9va \u00c1gnes | title=The Turkic Languages | location=London | publisher=Routledge | year=1998}}\n\n{{Turkic languages}}\n{{Turkic topics}}\n{{Turkic peoples}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alat (Tribe)}}\n[[Category:Turkic peoples of Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Erminwin", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAlat as a component tribe", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alat_tribe"}
