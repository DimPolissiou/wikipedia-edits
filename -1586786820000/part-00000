Businesses relying on traditional credit reports to make credit decisions have had limited to no  visibility on the new credit usage behaviors of this growing portion because alternative data is not information that the traditional bureaus capture or tend to report.\n\nUtilities and telecoms firms in several states have started reporting their data to CRAs. [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], a [[consumer credit reporting agency]] based in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]], allows consumers to self-enroll and build a positive credit file based on their timely payments for bills such as rent, utilities, cable, telephone, and insurance that are not automatically reported to the other bureaus.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levisohn |first=Ben |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_16/b4080052299512.htm?chan=search |title=Levisohn, Ben, \"The Credit Rating in Your Shoebox,\" '&#39;Business Week'&#39; |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> [[TransUnion]], [[First American CredCo]], and [[LexisNexis]] have all recently released products involving alternative data.\n\n====Concerns about the use of alternative data in credit files====\nSome concerns about the use of alternative data have been raised over the long-term consequences of fully reporting utility and telecom payments to [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]].<ref>[http://www.consumerfed.org%2Fpdfs%2FRegulatory_Relief_ILCs_Senate_Testimony031506.pdf&ei=AJbKSJDuCpyS8wTXiZygDQ&usg=AFQjCNHSorVNMXkzasdiaAbZD7WEhCMCgw&sig2=4lnNvUTIfEyj0ti_b4dmYw Margot Saunders, Testimony before Congress, 1 Mar 2006]</ref> There are concerns that state and local incentives to not pay bills on time (for example, some states provide heating oil subsidies if payments are missed) may cause deterioration in credit scores over time. There is also concern that people who open accounts with only alternative data will become over-extended. Recent research shows, however, that the inclusion of alternative data does not degrade credit scores over a one-year period.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/pdf/YouScore.pdf Turner, Michael A, Alyssa Lee, et al. ''You Score You Win'', [[Political and Economic Research Council]], p 17, Chart 2.]</ref>\n\n==Alternative data for credit worldwide==\nFully reported non-financial payment data has been included in consumer credit reports in many countries around the world including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Australia, China, Mexico, and Colombia to name a few. Indeed, Colombia has used this data successfully for more than 40 years.\n\nRecently, the World Bank issued a global credit information sharing standard that included a section on alternative data. The World Bank steadfastly endorses the use of fully reported non-financial payment data in credit origination processes and considers it a powerful tool for driving financial inclusion in emerging markets. More recently, in the Financial Inclusion 2020 Roadmap, Accion highlighted the great value of alternative data as an instrument to increase financial inclusion and help achieve their FI2020 objectives.\n\nIn [[Developing country|low-income nations]], alternative data is often the only type of data available for credit scoring. The population is often not formally employed, lacks a credit history, cannot fulfill loan application requirements, and has insufficient capital. Even when these requirements are fulfilled, lending institutions often have very little experience with clients\u2019 economic activity leading to untailored loan products.\n\nElectronically-available alternative data, such as bill payments, mobile telephone bills and [[metadata]], rental payments, and electronic transaction data, could be used to score these individuals and enter millions in low-income countries into a more modern credit ratings system.\n\nAn especially promising option is the full reporting of [[trade credit]] data, such as records from [[Cash and carry (wholesale)|cash and carry]] warehouses.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al.

Reduced credit lines resulting in a new group of consumers in need of liquidity forced this growing consumer segment to seek [[alternative financial services]] providers.  Businesses relying on traditional credit reports to make credit decisions have had limited to no  visibility on the new credit usage behaviors of this growing portion because alternative data is not information that the traditional bureaus capture or tend to report.\n\nUtilities and telecoms firms in several states have started reporting their data to CRAs. [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], a [[consumer credit reporting agency]] based in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]], allows consumers to self-enroll and build a positive credit file based on their timely payments for bills such as rent, utilities, cable, telephone, and insurance that are not automatically reported to the other bureaus.<ref>{{cite web|last=Levisohn |first=Ben |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_16/b4080052299512.htm?chan=search |title=Levisohn, Ben, \"The Credit Rating in Your Shoebox,\" '&#39;Business Week'&#39; |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=2008-04-10 |accessdate=2009-05-02}}</ref> [[TransUnion]], [[First American CredCo]], and [[LexisNexis]] have all recently released products involving alternative data.\n\n====Concerns about the use of alternative data in credit files====\nSome concerns about the use of alternative data have been raised over the long-term consequences of fully reporting utility and telecom payments to [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]].<ref>[http://www.consumerfed.org%2Fpdfs%2FRegulatory_Relief_ILCs_Senate_Testimony031506.pdf&ei=AJbKSJDuCpyS8wTXiZygDQ&usg=AFQjCNHSorVNMXkzasdiaAbZD7WEhCMCgw&sig2=4lnNvUTIfEyj0ti_b4dmYw Margot Saunders, Testimony before Congress, 1 Mar 2006]</ref> There are concerns that state and local incentives to not pay bills on time (for example, some states provide heating oil subsidies if payments are missed) may cause deterioration in credit scores over time. There is also concern that people who open accounts with only alternative data will become over-extended. Recent research shows, however, that the inclusion of alternative data does not degrade credit scores over a one-year period.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/pdf/YouScore.pdf Turner, Michael A, Alyssa Lee, et al. ''You Score You Win'', [[Political and Economic Research Council]], p 17, Chart 2.]</ref>\n\n==Alternative data for credit worldwide==\nFully reported non-financial payment data has been included in consumer credit reports in many countries around the world including the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Australia, China, Mexico, and Colombia to name a few. Indeed, Colombia has used this data successfully for more than 40 years.\n\nRecently, the World Bank issued a global credit information sharing standard that included a section on alternative data. The World Bank steadfastly endorses the use of fully reported non-financial payment data in credit origination processes and considers it a powerful tool for driving financial inclusion in emerging markets. More recently, in the Financial Inclusion 2020 Roadmap, Accion highlighted the great value of alternative data as an instrument to increase financial inclusion and help achieve their FI2020 objectives.\n\nIn [[Developing country|low-income nations]], alternative data is often the only type of data available for credit scoring. The population is often not formally employed, lacks a credit history, cannot fulfill loan application requirements, and has insufficient capital. Even when these requirements are fulfilled, lending institutions often have very little experience with clients\u2019 economic activity leading to untailored loan products.\n\nElectronically-available alternative data, such as bill payments, mobile telephone bills, rental payments, and electronic transaction data, could be used to score these individuals and enter millions in low-income countries into a more modern credit ratings system.\n\nAn especially promising option is the full reporting of [[trade credit]] data, such as records from [[Cash and carry (wholesale)|cash and carry]] warehouses.<ref>[http://www.infopolicy.org/_working/files/downloads/South-Africa-compressed-web.pdf Turner, Michael, Robin Varghese, et al.
