However, Annie is shocked when she realizes that Fridgy keeps a tab on many of her personal things, such as having sex with Jack on the kitchen floor, and finds herself left out of the family's personal time. When she confronts Fridgy about it, it locks the Harrises in the house. They escape, but are taken to the ConVee headquarters where Janine wants them to be the family of the future. Annie gives a speech about making an effort and the family agree with her. Janine threatens to kill them, but the Harrises have the appliances fight one another and they escape the exploding base. The family dig up their old busted refrigerator and \"enjoy\" their family time together. \n| LineColor       = #F7D90A\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Sister, Wife\n| DirectedBy      = Chuck Sheetz\n| WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Julie Thacker Scully & Amy Poehler|t=Andrew Lee|tfirst=y}}\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|22}}\n| ProdCode        = 1LAZ06\n| Viewers         = 1.07<ref name=\"1.06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-sunday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-22-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Sunday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.22.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 24, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 24, 2020}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Jack and Annie decide to spend their anniversary by shopping at the home improvement store and take Kimberly with them, though they continuously fail to remember that she is with them.

It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.\n\nThe film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], and [[Alice Krige]] in supporting roles.\n\nIt was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].\n\nThe film's title was inspired by the line, \"Bring me my Chariot of fire!\", from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|\"Jerusalem\"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.<ref>Dans, Peter E.

He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]), a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano.\n\n[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.\n\nWhen they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice.<!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning \"a Semite\", \"a different god\" etc-->\n\nWhen Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying \"I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure.\"\n\nThe two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and Henry Stallard ([[Daniel Gerroll]]).\n\nWhile boarding the boat to France for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic Committee, because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nA solution is found thanks to Liddell's teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], offers to give his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. Liddell's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.\n\nLiddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with \"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.\"\n\nAbrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.\n\nBefore Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now, far longer, 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support, quoting 1 Samuel 2:30 \"He that honors Me I will honor\".

Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based \"Lindsay\" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle \u2013 this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.<ref name=rw /> The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.<ref>Chapman, pp. 275, 295.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]\nAnother scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-record-idUKL276510720071027|title=Student runs away with \"Chariots of Fire\" record|date=2007-10-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-05-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland\u2013France international athletic meeting.

In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final. In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}</ref>\n\nAbrahams' fianc\u00e9e is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.\n\n===1924 Olympics===\n{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,<ref name=hudson/> and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.<ref>Murray, Feg. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+24%2C+1924&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&pqatl=google \"DID YOU KNOW THAT ...\"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, \"Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday\".</ref>\n\nThe decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.\n\nThe film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.\n\nThe film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charley Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting \"beaten out of sight\" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.\n\nEric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |accessdate=28 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAbrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.<ref name=aubrey />\n\n====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====\nIn the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called \"Tom Watson\"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900\u20131994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history.

Pinafore]]'', \"Three Little Maids from School Are We\" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', \"With Catlike Tread\" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', \"The Soldiers of Our Queen\" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and \"There Lived a King\" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.\n\nThe film also incorporates a major traditional work: \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England.

It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.\n\nThe film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], and [[Alice Krige]] in supporting roles.\n\nIt was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].\n\nThe film's title was inspired by the line, \"Bring me my Chariot of fire!\", from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|\"Jerusalem\"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.<ref>Dans, Peter E.

He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]), a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano.\n\n[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.\n\nWhen they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice.<!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning \"a Semite\", \"a different god\" etc-->\n\nWhen Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to return eventually to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying \"I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure.\"\n\nThe two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and Henry Stallard ([[Daniel Gerroll]]).\n\nWhile boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic Committee, because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nA solution is found thanks to Liddell's teammate Lindsay, who, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], offers to give his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. Liddell's religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.\n\nLiddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with \"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.\"\n\nAbrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.\n\nBefore Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now, far longer, 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support, quoting 1 Samuel 2:30 \"He that honors Me I will honor\". Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.\n\nThe British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.\n\n== Cast {{anchor|Main cast}} ==\n* [[Ben Cross]] as [[Harold Abrahams]], a Jewish student at Cambridge University\n* [[Ian Charleson]] as [[Eric Liddell]], the son of Scottish missionaries to China\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Aubrey Montague]], a runner and friend of Harold Abrahams\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Lord Andrew Lindsay, a Cambridge student runner partially based on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|David Burghley]] and [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]]\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Sam Mussabini]], Abrahams's running coach\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at Cambridge University\n* [[Lindsay Anderson]] as Master of [[Caius College]] at Cambridge University\n* [[Cheryl Campbell]] as Jennie Liddell, Eric's devout sister (Janet Lillian \"Jenny\" Liddell)\n* [[Alice Krige]] as [[Sybil Gordon]], Abrahams' fianc\u00e9e (his actual fianc\u00e9e was [[Sybil Evers]])\n* [[Struan Rodger]] as Sandy McGrath, Liddell's friend and running coach\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as [[F.

B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.<ref name=aubrey>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com</ref> Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.\n\nThe character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based \"Lindsay\" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle \u2013 this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.<ref name=rw /> The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.<ref>Chapman, pp. 275, 295.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]\nAnother scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-record-idUKL276510720071027|title=Student runs away with \"Chariots of Fire\" record|date=2007-10-27|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-05-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland\u2013France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=[https://archive.org/details/godsjoyfulrunner0000rams/page/54 54]|isbn=0-88270-624-1|url=https://archive.org/details/godsjoyfulrunner0000rams/page/54}}</ref> Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |work=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.\n\nAbrahams and Liddell did race against each other once, but not quite as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge. In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final. In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}</ref>\n\nAbrahams' fianc\u00e9e is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work.

However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.\n\n===1924 Olympics===\n{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,<ref name=hudson/> and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.<ref>Murray, Feg. [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/361517352.html?dids=361517352:361517352&FMT=CITE&FMTS=CITE:AI&type=historic&date=Jun+24%2C+1924&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=DID+YOU+KNOW+THAT--&pqatl=google \"DID YOU KNOW THAT ...\"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, \"Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday\".</ref>\n\nThe decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.\n\nThe film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.\n\nThe film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charley Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting \"beaten out of sight\" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.\n\nEric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |accessdate=28 April 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAbrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.<ref name=aubrey />\n\n====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====\nIn the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called \"Tom Watson\"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900\u20131994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.\n\nJackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: \"It says in the Old Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.'

Hudson and Puttnam had known each other since the 1960s, when Puttnam was an advertising executive and Hudson was making films for ad agencies. In 1977, Hudson had also been [[second-unit]] director on the Puttnam-produced film ''[[Midnight Express (film)|Midnight Express]]''.<ref name=round>Round, Simon.

Hudson and producer [[David Puttnam]] did months of fruitless searching for the perfect actor to play Eric Liddell. They then saw Scottish stage actor [[Ian Charleson]] performing the role of Pierre in the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s production of ''[[Piaf (play)|Piaf]]'', and knew immediately they had found their man.

One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of \"Hymne\", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Op\u00e9ra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.\n\nFive lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: \"He is an Englishman\" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', \"Three Little Maids from School Are We\" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', \"With Catlike Tread\" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', \"The Soldiers of Our Queen\" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and \"There Lived a King\" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.\n\nThe film also incorporates a major traditional work: \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams.

With this, Grande became the only artist since the Beatles to have multiple songs on the top 3 spots on the Hot 100. Additionally, all of the songs from the album charted within the top 50 as well. This time around, Grande opted to work with friends, such as frequent contributors [[Victoria Mon\u00e9t]], [[Max Martin]], [[Ilya Salmanzadeh|Ilya]] and [[Tommy Brown (record producer)|Tommy Brown]].

After a failed attempt by Jacob to get Alma to change her own past, she finally learns that Jacob purposefully drove himself and Farnaz off the road rather than it being a murder. Jacob decides to possess his past self in an effort to change the past and promises to meet Alma at a pyramid in Mexico when the timelines realign. In the present, Sam and Camila attempt to convince Alma that she's schizophrenic and needs help and that Jacob was also crazy. However, Alma breaks up with Sam and spends the night at the pyramid in Mexico waiting for Jacob, joined by Becca whose marriage to Reed fell apart. Jacob fails to appear by morning, causing Alma to begin to doubt herself. After Becca leaves and the sun rises over the pyramid, Alma stares in shock at something.\n |LineColor       = 1A4150\n}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nOn March 6, 2018, it was announced that Amazon had given the production a straight-to-series order for one season.

The bridge carried [[U.S. Route 35]] over the [[Ohio River]], connecting [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], and [[Gallipolis, Ohio]].\n\nOn December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge collapsed under the weight of rush-hour traffic, resulting in the deaths of 46 people. Two of the victims were never found. Investigation of the wreckage pointed to the cause of the collapse being the failure of a single [[eyebar]] in a suspension chain, due to a small defect {{Convert|0.1|in|mm}} deep. Analysis showed that the bridge was carrying much heavier loads than it had originally been designed for and had been poorly maintained. The collapsed bridge was replaced by the [[Silver Bridge#Silver Memorial Bridge|Silver Memorial Bridge]], which was completed in 1969.\n\n==History of eyebar-chain bridge construction==\nAt the time of the Silver Bridge construction, eyebar bridges had been built for about 100 years. Such bridges had usually been constructed from redundant bar links, using rows of four to six bars, sometimes using several such chains in parallel. An example can be seen in the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. The chain eyebars are redundant in two dimensions. This is an early suspension bridge still in service. Other bridges of similar design include the earlier road bridge over the [[Menai Strait]] built by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1826; the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge]] in [[Budapest]], built in 1839\u20131849, destroyed in the closing days of [[World War II]] by retreating Germans in 1945, and rebuilt identically by 1949, with redundant chains and hangers; and the [[Three Sisters (Pittsburgh)|Three Sisters]], self-anchored suspension bridges of similar design and construction period (from 1924 to 1928) in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Silver Bridge structure==\n\n===Low redundancy, high strength===\nThe eyebars in the Silver Bridge were not redundant, as links were composed of only two bars each, of high-strength steel (more than twice the tensile strength of common mild steel), rather than a thick stack of thinner bars of modest material strength \"combed\" together, as is usual for redundancy. With only two bars, the failure of one could impose excessive loading on the second, causing total failure&nbsp;&mdash; which would be unlikely if more bars were used. While a low-redundancy chain can be engineered to the design requirements, the safety is completely dependent upon correct, high-quality manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance.\n\nIn comparison, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], with wire-cable suspension, was designed with an excess strength factor of six. Wire cables have extremely high levels of redundancy, with the failure of a single wire strand almost unnoticeable. During the Brooklyn Bridge's construction it was discovered that some rejected steel wire had been used. To compensate for the rejected steel wire already in the cables, 150 more good steel wires per cable were added to bring the total up to 5,434 redundant strands. The designer's son, Washington Roebling,  decided the safety factor may have been reduced, but was far more than sufficient.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Talbot |first=Jim |date=June 2011 |title=The Brooklyn Bridge: First Steel-Wire Suspension Bridge |url=http://msc.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/2011/06/2011v06_brooklyn_bridge.pdf |magazine=Modern Steel Construction |location=Chicago |publisher=[[American Institute of Steel Construction]] |accessdate=2018-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Rocker towers===\nThe towers were \"rocker\" towers (a design common in Europe), which allowed the bridge to respond to various live loads by a slight tipping of the supporting towers, which were parted at the deck level, rather than passing the suspension chain over a lubricated or tipping saddle, or by stressing the towers in bending.

The bridge carried [[U.S. Route 35]] over the [[Ohio River]], connecting [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], and [[Gallipolis, Ohio]].\n\nOn December 15, 1967, the Silver Bridge collapsed under the weight of rush-hour traffic, resulting in the deaths of 46 people. Two of the victims were never found. Investigation of the wreckage pointed to the cause of the collapse being the failure of a single [[eyebar]] in a suspension chain, due to a small defect {{Convert|0.1|in|mm}} deep. Analysis showed that the bridge was carrying much heavier loads than it had originally been designed for and had been poorly maintained. The collapsed bridge was replaced by the [[Silver Bridge#Silver Memorial Bridge|Silver Memorial Bridge]], which was completed in 1969.\n\n==History of eyebar-chain bridge construction==\nAt the time of the Silver Bridge construction, eyebar bridges had been built for about 100 years. Such bridges had usually been constructed from redundant bar links, using rows of four to six bars, sometimes using several such chains in parallel. An example can be seen in the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]. The chain eyebars are redundant in two dimensions. This is an early suspension bridge still in service. Other bridges of similar design include the earlier road bridge over the [[Menai Strait]] built by [[Thomas Telford]] in 1826; the [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Chain Bridge]] in [[Budapest]], built in 1839\u20131849, destroyed in the closing days of [[World War II]] by retreating Germans in 1945, and rebuilt identically by 1949, with redundant chains and hangers; and the [[Three Sisters (Pittsburgh)|Three Sisters]], self-anchored suspension bridges of similar design and construction period (from 1924 to 1928) in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Silver Bridge structure==\n\n===Low redundancy, high strength===\nThe eyebars in the Silver Bridge were not redundant, as links were composed of only two bars each, of high-strength steel (more than twice the tensile strength of common mild steel), rather than a thick stack of thinner bars of modest material strength \"combed\" together, as is usual for redundancy. With only two bars, the failure of one could impose excessive loading on the second, causing total failure&nbsp;&mdash; which would be unlikely if more bars were used. While a low-redundancy chain can be engineered to the design requirements, the safety is completely dependent upon correct, high-quality manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance.\n\nIn comparison, the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], with wire-cable suspension, was designed with an excess strength factor of six. Wire cables have extremely high levels of redundancy, with the failure of a single wire strand almost unnoticeable. During the Brooklyn Bridge's construction it was discovered that some rejected steel wire had been used. To compensate for the rejected steel wire already in the cables, 150 more good steel wires per cable were added to bring the total up to 5,434 redundant strands. The designer's son, Washington Roebling,  decided the safety factor may have been reduced, but was far more than sufficient.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Talbot |first=Jim |date=June 2011 |title=The Brooklyn Bridge: First Steel-Wire Suspension Bridge |url=http://msc.aisc.org/globalassets/modern-steel/archives/2011/06/2011v06_brooklyn_bridge.pdf |magazine=Modern Steel Construction |location=Chicago |publisher=[[American Institute of Steel Construction]] |accessdate=2018-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Rocker towers===\nThe towers were \"rocker\" towers (a design common in Europe), which allowed the bridge to respond to various live loads by a slight tipping of the supporting towers, which were parted at the deck level, rather than passing the suspension chain over a lubricated or tipping saddle, or by stressing the towers in bending.  The towers required the chain on both sides for their support; failure of any one link on either side, in any of the three chain spans, would result in the complete failure of the entire bridge.\n\n==Design loads==\nAt the time of the bridge construction, a typical family automobile was the [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Model T]], with a weight of about {{convert|1,500|lb|kg}}. The maximum permitted truck gross weight was about {{convert|20,000|lb|t|0|abbr=off}}. By contrast, at the time of the collapse, a typical family automobile weighed about {{convert|4,000|lb|kg}} and the large truck limit was {{convert|60,000|lb|t}} or more.  Bumper-to-bumper traffic jams on the bridge were also much more common, occurring several times a day, five days each week, thus causing more stress to the bridge elements.\n\n==Wreckage analysis==\nThe bridge failure was due to a defect in a single link, eye-bar 330, on the north of the Ohio subsidiary chain, the first link below the top of the Ohio tower. A small crack was formed through [[Fretting|fretting wear]] at the bearing, and grew through internal corrosion, a problem known as [[stress corrosion cracking]]. The crack was only about {{convert|0.1|in|mm}} deep when it went critical, and it broke in a brittle fashion.  Growth of the crack was probably exacerbated by [[residual stress]] in the eyebar created during manufacture.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\nWhen the lower side of the eyebar failed, all the load was transferred to the other side of the eyebar, which then failed by [[Ductility|ductile overload]]. The joint was then held together only by three eyebars, and another slipped off the pin at the center of the bearing, so the chain was completely severed. Collapse of the entire structure was inevitable since all parts of a suspension bridge are in equilibrium with one another. Witnesses afterward estimated that it took only about a minute for the whole bridge to fall.\n\nThe damage to the link would have been difficult to see during inspection of the bridge:\n\n<blockquote>Inspection prior to construction would not have been able to notice the tiny crack ... the only way to detect the fracture would have been to disassemble the eye-bar.

He was a founding member of Filipino rock bands Hijo, [[Bamboo (band)|Bamboo]], [[Introvoys]], Passage and [[Kapatid (band)|Kapatid]].\n\n==Professional background==\n===Introvoys (1987-1991, 2001)===\n{{main|Introvoys}}\nIntrovoys was formed in 1986 by 3rd-G Cristobal, Paco Arespacochaga, and Jonathan Buencamino. Their first album was a \"diamond in the rough\". After two singles, Dyna Records, which was the band's label, was ready to drop them like a hot potato. However, fate had a different plan. \"However Which way\" which was the band's third single shot all the way to No. 1 in Metro Manila in just 2 weeks. After a month, the song became the country's No. 1 song thus paving the way for a national tour for the Introvoys. Culled from the same album are certified No. 1 singles such as \"Calling All Nations\", \"Maynila\" and \"Lullabye\", among many others. Their second album sealed Introvoys' status in the mainstream. Born from this album were songs that are now classified as standard hits. These songs are \"Will I Survive\", \"Di Na Ko Aasa Pa\", \"Binibini\" and \"Are You Happy\". Eventually, the album shot to quadruple platinum status earning the Introvoys the tagged \"the No. 1 Band in the Land!\". In 1994, they released the album ''Line to Heaven'' which has melodies that are catchy and pop-inflected, some of which are imbedded in rock-styled arrangements. The carrier single was written after Arespacochaga suffered a terrible tragedy, the loss of his parents in a car accident. He left the band in 1996 rejoined in 2000. Ira Cruz, who had played with Introvoys from 1987 to 1991, joined Passage and Kapatid. In 2001, Ira rejoined Introvoys for the short-lived reunion run.\n\n===Kapatid (2002-2003)===\n{{main|Kapatid (band)}}\nKapatid ''(English: Siblings; Brother/ Sister)'' came together through an informal gathering of friends with diverse musical talents in other bands. The original lineup included Karl Roy of Advent Call and P.O.T.; Marinito \"J-hoon\" Balbuena of Kjwan; Ira Cruz previously of Passage; Azarcon; and Chico Molina.\nIn 2002, the band went on to release their debut album \"Edsa 524\". The album contains the singles \"Pagbabalik Ng Kwago\", \"I like it like this\", and \"Visions\". The band split apart rather quickly, with a couple of members leaving for other bands under less than amicable circumstances. Roy later stated of the breakup, \"There was lots of talk about brotherhood and respect and the joy of playing music together. Unfortunately, things didn\u2019t turn that way. The band split apart rather quickly, as a couple of members left for another band, under less amicable circumstances. First, Ira left, and then Nathan followed, and the two eventually hooked up with Bamboo.\"\n\n=== Bamboo (2003-2011) ===\n{{main|Bamboo (band)}}\nIn 2003, after living in Los Angeles following the Rivermaya tour in America, Ma\u00f1alac returned to the Philippines.  Azarcon introduced Ma\u00f1alac to Cruz and Vic Mercado (drums) and together, they formed ''Bamboo''.\n\nIn January 2011, News had been circulating that Bamboo has allegedly disbanded. DJ KC Montero of Wave 89.1 confirmed the breakup on Wave's The KC Show and via Twitter.\n\nMontero clarified that all the members of the band \"have decided to move on,\" and that he does not know why they called it quits. The group has not released an official statement on the issue, according to ABS-CBNNews.com.\n\nBamboo's lead vocalist Francisco \"Bamboo\" Ma\u00f1alac finally confirmed the breakup of his band in an official statement posted before midnight of January 11 on the group's website.\n\n==== As the Music Plays ====\n{{main|As the Music Plays}}\nIn February 2004, Bamboo released their debut album, ''[[As the Music Plays]]''. The album was certified Double Platinum by the Philippine Association of the Record Industry (PARI). A double-disc repackaged edition was released in 2005.\n\n[[File:Ira Cruz (Guitars) (3693626256).jpg|thumb|Ira Cruz on a live gig with ''Bamboo'']]\n\nThe first single from the album, \"Noypi\" (a slang term meaning \"Filipino\"), was a rock anthem that captivated the hearts of the youth and sparked patriotism in the Philippines. The album contains ten tracks, with three in Tagalog, namely: \"Noypi\", \"Hudas\", and \"Masaya\". The initial release of the album used a white cover, while a second black-cover release later in the year contained six bonus tracks and three video clips of \"Noypi\", \"Masaya\", and \"Mr. Clay\".\n\nThe album was honored at the AWIT Awards, NU Rock Awards, and [[MTV Pilipinas Music Awards]].

Mercado was additionally honored as Best Drummer, while Ma\u00f1alac was recognized as Best Vocalist.\n\n==== \"Noypi\" ====\n\nRumors circulating the Pinoy rock scene were rampantly claiming that (karl)Roy wrote \"Noypi\" (originally as a reggae song) and that Azarcon stole the song from him. The truth about the recording was offered in a 2008 interview with Karl Roy, presented in ''Rogue Magazine''.\nNathan had originally written the megahit rock anthem \"Noypi\" for Kapatid, but Karl didn't like it. \"It takes a while for me to like a song,\" Karl explains, and to this day, he regrets not paying enough attention to what Nathan was doing.\n\nThe album was honored at the AWIT Awards, NU Rock Awards, and [[MTV Pilipinas Music Awards]].

The album was certified Platinum by PARI.\n\nThe song \"Much Has Been Said\" received the award for Best Ballad of the Year, while the song \"Hallelujah\" was honored with the 2006 Awit Award for People's Choice as Favorite Song and Best Rock Recording. The song \"Hallelujah\" was released prior to the actual release of the album, becoming an instant hit and winning the 2006 Awit Award for People's Choice as Favorite Song and Best Rock Recording.\n\nIn addition to rock, the band incorporated a variety of styles including rap or scat-style singing, as well as a gospel music theme on the song \"Alpha Beta Omega\". In 2006, the band was honored at the MTV Pilipinas Music Awards for Best Cinematography in a Video for the song \"Much Has Been Said\".\n\n==== We Stand Alone Together ====\n{{main|We Stand Alone Together}}\nIn 2007, Bamboo released their third album, ''We Stand Alone Together''. The album is a double disc recording package of revived cover songs.  The album also includes a cover of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s \"Englishman In New York\", presented as a [[hidden track]].\n\nAmong the cover songs included on the album are Buklod's \"[[Tatsulok (song)|Tatsulok]]\" and Anak Bayan's \"Probinsyana\" from Anak Bayan, [[Pearl Jam]]'s \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\", and [[Paul Simon]]'s \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\".

Born from this album were songs that are now classified as standard hits. These songs are \"Will I Survive\", \"Di Na Ko Aasa Pa\", \"Binibini\" and \"Are You Happy\". Eventually, the album shot to quadruple platinum status earning the Introvoys the tagged \"the No. 1 Band in the Land!\". In 1994, they released the album ''Line to Heaven'' which has melodies that are catchy and pop-inflected, some of which are imbedded in rock-styled arrangements. The carrier single was written after Arespacochaga suffered a terrible tragedy, the loss of his parents in a car accident. He left the band in 1996 rejoined in 2000. Ira Cruz, who had played with Introvoys from 1987 to 1991, joined Passage and Kapatid. In 2001, Ira rejoined Introvoys for the short-lived reunion run.\n\n===Kapatid (2002-2003)===\n{{main|Kapatid (band)}}\nKapatid ''(English: Siblings; Brother/ Sister)'' came together through an informal gathering of friends with diverse musical talents in other bands. The original lineup included Karl Roy of Advent Call and P.O.T.; Marinito \"J-hoon\" Balbuena of Kjwan; Ira Cruz previously of Passage; Azarcon; and Chico Molina.\nIn 2002, the band went on to release their debut album \"Edsa 524\". The album contains the singles \"Pagbabalik Ng Kwago\", \"I like it like this\", and \"Visions\". The band split apart rather quickly, with a couple of members leaving for other bands under less than amicable circumstances. Roy later stated of the breakup, \"There was lots of talk about brotherhood and respect and the joy of playing music together. Unfortunately, things didn\u2019t turn that way. The band split apart rather quickly, as a couple of members left for another band, under less amicable circumstances. First, Ira left, and then Nathan followed, and the two eventually hooked up with Bamboo.\"\n\n=== Bamboo (2003-2011) ===\n{{main|Bamboo (band)}}\nIn 2003, after living in Los Angeles following the Rivermaya tour in America, Ma\u00f1alac returned to the Philippines.  Azarcon introduced Ma\u00f1alac to Cruz and Vic Mercado (drums) and together, they formed ''Bamboo''.\n\nIn January 2011, News had been circulating that Bamboo has allegedly disbanded. DJ KC Montero of Wave 89.1 confirmed the breakup on Wave's The KC Show and via Twitter.\n\nMontero clarified that all the members of the band \"have decided to move on,\" and that he does not know why they called it quits. The group has not released an official statement on the issue, according to ABS-CBNNews.com.\n\nBamboo's lead vocalist Francisco \"Bamboo\" Ma\u00f1alac finally confirmed the breakup of his band in an official statement posted before midnight of January 11 on the group's website.\n\n==== As the Music Plays ====\n{{main|As the Music Plays}}\nIn February 2004, Bamboo released their debut album, ''[[As the Music Plays]]''.

The album contains ten tracks, with three in Tagalog, namely: \"Noypi\", \"Hudas\", and \"Masaya\". The initial release of the album used a white cover, while a second black-cover release later in the year contained six bonus tracks and three video clips of \"Noypi\", \"Masaya\", and \"Mr. Clay\".\n\nThe album was honored at the AWIT Awards, NU Rock Awards, and [[MTV Pilipinas Music Awards]].

Mercado was additionally honored as Best Drummer, while Ma\u00f1alac was recognized as Best Vocalist.\n\n==== \"Noypi\" ====\n\nRumors circulating the Pinoy rock scene were rampantly claiming that (karl)Roy wrote \"Noypi\" (originally as a reggae song) and that Azarcon stole the song from him. The truth about the recording was offered in a 2008 interview with Karl Roy, presented in ''Rogue Magazine''.\nNathan had originally written the megahit rock anthem \"Noypi\" for Kapatid, but Karl didn't like it. \"It takes a while for me to like a song,\" Karl explains, and to this day, he regrets not paying enough attention to what Nathan was doing.\n\nThe album was honored at the AWIT Awards, NU Rock Awards, and [[MTV Pilipinas Music Awards]].

The album was certified Platinum by PARI.\n\nThe song \"Much Has Been Said\" received the award for Best Ballad of the Year, while the song \"Hallelujah\" was honored with the 2006 Awit Award for People's Choice as Favorite Song and Best Rock Recording. The song \"Hallelujah\" was released prior to the actual release of the album, becoming an instant hit and winning the 2006 Awit Award for People's Choice as Favorite Song and Best Rock Recording.\n\nIn addition to rock, the band incorporated a variety of styles including rap or scat-style singing, as well as a gospel music theme on the song \"Alpha Beta Omega\". In 2006, the band was honored at the MTV Pilipinas Music Awards for Best Cinematography in a Video for the song \"Much Has Been Said\".\n\n==== We Stand Alone Together ====\n{{main|We Stand Alone Together}}\nIn 2007, Bamboo released their third album, ''We Stand Alone Together''. The album is a double disc recording package of revived cover songs.  The album also includes a cover of [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s \"Englishman In New York\", presented as a [[hidden track]].\n\nAmong the cover songs included on the album are Buklod's \"Tatsulok\" and Anak Bayan's \"Probinsyana\" from Anak Bayan, [[Pearl Jam]]'s \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\", and [[Paul Simon]]'s \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover\". It also includes bonus tracks like unplugged versions of their hit songs from previous albums such as \"Mr. Clay\", \"These Days\", and \"Hallelujah\". \"Tatsulok\" and \"Probinsyana\" were released as singles and became hits on local radio.\n\nIn 2008, the Awit Awards honored \"Tatsulok\" with the awards for Best Performance by a Group Recording Artist and Best Rock Song. \"Probinsyana\" received the awards for Best Musical Arrangement, Best Engineered Recording, and Music Video of the Year.

In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970). The planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.<ref>(Rice, 1999)</ref> Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical ''Jeeves'' with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics.<ref>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York</ref> ''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Jeeves - Review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/21/by-jeeves-review |accessdate=29 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996).\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:Evita at the Adelphi.jpg|thumb|''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]].

''[[The Guardian]]''. 24 September 2003.</ref>\n\nAlthough composed in 1965, ''The Likes of Us'' was not publicly performed until 2005, when a production was staged at Lloyd Webber's [[Sydmonton Festival]]. In 2008, amateur rights were released by the National Operatic and Dramatic Association (NODA) in association with the Really Useful Group. The first amateur performance was by a children's theatre group in Cornwall called \"Kidz R Us\". Stylistically, ''The Likes of Us'' is fashioned after the Broadway musical of the 1940s and 1950s; it opens with a traditional overture comprising a medley of tunes from the show, and the score reflects some of Lloyd Webber's early influences, particularly [[Richard Rodgers]], [[Frederick Loewe]], and [[Lionel Bart]]. In this respect, it is markedly different from the composer's later work, which tends to be either predominantly or wholly [[through-composed]], and closer in form to opera than to the Broadway musical.\n\nIn the summer of 1967, Alan Doggett, a family friend of the Lloyd Webbers who had assisted on ''The Likes of Us'' and who was the music teacher at the [[Colet Court]] school in London, commissioned Lloyd Webber and Rice to write a piece for the school's choir.<ref name=chandler/><ref name=ellis/><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_g-DDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA564|title=The Oxford Handbook of the British Musical|first1=Robert|last1=Gordon|first2=Olaf|last2=Jubin|date=21 November 2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780199988754}}</ref> Doggett requested a \"pop cantata\" along the lines of [[Herbert Chappell]]'s ''The Daniel Jazz'' (1963) and [[Michael Hurd (composer)|Michael Hurd]]'s ''Jonah-Man Jazz'' (1966), both of which had been published by [[Novello & Co|Novello]] and were based on the [[Old Testament]].<ref name=chandler/> The request for the new piece came with a 100-[[guinea (coin)|guinea]] advance from Novello.<ref name=chandler/> This resulted in ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]'', a retelling of the biblical story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], in which Lloyd Webber and Rice humorously pastiched a number of pop-music styles such as Elvis-style rock'n'roll, [[Calypso music|Calypso]] and [[country music]]. ''Joseph'' began life as a short [[cantata]] that gained some recognition on its second staging with a favourable review in ''[[The Times]]''. For its subsequent performances, Rice and Lloyd Webber revised the show and added new songs to expand it to a more substantial length. Continued expansion eventually culminated in a 1972 stage musical and then a two-hour-long production being staged in the West End in 1973 on the back of the success of ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Robert Bradley |url=http://www.springfieldcontemporarytheatre.org/blog/andrew-lloyd-webber-and-jesus-christ-superstar |title=Andrew Lloyd Webber and \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" |work=Springfield Contemporary Theatre |date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Rice and Lloyd Webber wrote a song for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] called \"Try It and See\", which was not selected. With rewritten lyrics it became \"King Herod's Song\" in their third musical, ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (1970). The planned follow-up to ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' was a musical comedy based on the [[Jeeves and Wooster]] novels by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. Tim Rice was uncertain about this venture, partly because of his concern that he might not be able to do justice to the novels that he and Lloyd Webber so admired.<ref>(Rice, 1999)</ref> Rice backed out of the project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical ''Jeeves'' with [[Alan Ayckbourn]], who provided the book and lyrics.<ref>Andrew Lloyd Webber: His Life and Works \u2013 Walsh, Michael (1989, revised and expanded, 1997). p. 82, Abrams: New York</ref> ''Jeeves'' failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a run of only 38 performances in the West End in 1975.<ref>{{cite news |title=By Jeeves - Review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/21/by-jeeves-review |accessdate=29 June 2019 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled ''[[By Jeeves]]'' (1996).\n\n===Mid-1970s===\n[[File:Evita at the Adelphi.jpg|thumb|''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'' at the West End's [[Adelphi Theatre]].

The two riffs share very similar notes and the order of the notes played. Lloyd Webber's pipe organ riff from \"Phantom of the Opera\" plays D, C#, C, B, A#, then ascending A#, B, C, C#, D.

For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. After immense material and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.\n\nThe war began in 264 BC with the Romans gaining a foothold on Sicily at [[Battle of Messana|Messana]] (modern [[Messina]]). The Romans then pressed [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the only significant independent power on the island, into allying with them and laid siege to Carthage's main base at [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. A large Carthaginian army attempted to lift the siege in 262 BC, but was heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battle of Akragas]]. The Romans then built a navy to challenge Carthage's, and using novel tactics inflicted several defeats. A Carthaginian base on [[Corsica]] was seized, but an attack on [[Sardinia]] was repulsed; the base on Corsica was then lost. Taking advantage of their naval victories the Romans launched an invasion of North Africa, which the Carthaginians intercepted. At the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]] the Carthaginians were again beaten; this was possibly the [[largest naval battle in history]] by the number of combatants involved. The invasion initially went well and in 255 BC the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]]; the proposed terms were so harsh they fought on, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|defeating the invaders]]. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians opposed it at the [[Battle of Cape Hermaeum]] off Africa; the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, losing 384 ships and 100,000 men.\n\nThe war continued, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, adding 220 new ships. The Carthaginians attacked and recaptured Akragas in 255 BC, but not believing they could hold the city, they razed and abandoned it. The Romans captured Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) in 254 BC. The next year they lost another 150 ships to a storm while returning from raiding the North African coast. In 251 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated in a [[ Battle of Panormus|battle outside the walls]]. Slowly the Romans had occupied most of Sicily; in 249 BC they besieged the last two Carthaginian strongholds{{snd}}in the extreme west. They also launched a surprise attack on the Carthaginian fleet, which was defeated at the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Carthaginians followed up their victory and another 120 Roman warships, and 800 transports, were lost at the [[ Battle of Phintias]]. After several years of stalemate, the Romans rebuilt their fleet again in 244 BC and effectively [[blockade]]d the Carthaginian garrisons. Carthage assembled a fleet which attempted to relieve them, but it was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|Aegates Islands]] in 241 BC, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to negotiate for peace. \n\nThe [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was agreed. By its terms Carthage paid large [[War reparations|reparations]] and [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily was annexed]] as a [[Roman province]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The immense effort of building 1,000 galleys during the war laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years. The end of the war sparked a major but unsuccessful [[Mercenary War|revolt]] within the Carthaginian Empire. The unresolved strategic competition between Rome and Carthage would lead to the eruption of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nSince 2010, eleven bronze warship [[Naval ram|rams]] have been found by archaeologists in the sea off the west coast of Sicily, along with ten bronze helmets and hundreds of [[amphorae]].{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Pragg|2013}}{{sfn|Murray|2019|}} The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a large number of fragments, have since been recovered.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=12, 26, 31\u201332}} It is believed the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=39}} The archaeologists involved stated that the location of artefacts so far discovered supports Polybius's account of where the [[Battle of the Aegates]] took place.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=35\u201336}} Based on the dimensions of the recovered rams, the archaeologists who have studied them believe they all came from [[trireme]]s, contrary to Polybius's account of all of the warships involved being [[Hellenistic-era warships#Hellenistic-era warships|quinqueremes]].{{sfn|Murray|2019|}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=39\u201342}} However, they believe that the many amphorae identified confirm the accuracy of other aspects of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=46}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, terrestrial archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Carthage-1958-PortsPuniques.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour photograph of an urban area by the sea with a water-filled, torus-shaped inlet.|{{center|A photograph of the remains of the naval base of the city of Carthage.

Relationships were good, with strong commercial links. During the Pyrrhic War of 280\u2013275 BC, against a king of [[Epirus]] who alternately fought Rome in Italy and Carthage on Sicily, Carthage provided [[materiel]] to the Romans and on at least one occasion used its navy to ferry a Roman force.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=94, 160, 163, 164\u2013165}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nIn 288 BC, the [[Mamertines]], a group of Italian mercenaries, previously hired by Syracuse, occupied the city of Messana (modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=165}} Hard-pressed by Syracuse, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians acted first, pressing [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], king of Syracuse, into taking no further action and convincing the Mamertines to accept a Carthaginian garrison in Messana. According to Polybius, a considerable debate took place in Rome as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for assistance, which could easily lead to war with Carthage. The Romans had not previously displayed any interest in Sicily and did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors. However, many saw strategic and monetary advantages in gaining a foothold in Sicily. It was recognised that this step may lead to ill-feeling from Carthage, but war was considered far from inevitable. The deadlocked [[Roman Senate]] put the matter before the popular assembly, which decided to accept the Mamertines' request.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=42\u201345}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=150}}\n\n[[Appius Claudius Caudex]] was appointed commander of a military expedition with orders to cross to Messana.{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=479}}{{sfn|Warmington|1993|pp=168\u2013169}} Carthage was unperturbed. Their experience over the previous two centuries of warfare on Sicily was that decisive action was impossible; military efforts petered out after heavy losses and huge expense. Meanwhile, Carthaginian leaders expected that their overwhelming maritime superiority would allow the war to be kept at a distance, and even for them to continue to prosper.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} This would allow them to recruit and pay an army that would operate in the open against the Romans, while their strongly fortified cities could be supplied by sea and provide a defensive base from which to operate.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=171}}\n\n=== Armies ===\n{{main|Roman army of the mid-Republic|Military of Carthage}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaires|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nMost male Roman citizens were eligible for military service, most would serve as infantry with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} Most of the Carthaginian infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]], usually forming two or three lines.{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Two thousand [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] were recruited from the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}\n\n==Sicily 264 \u2013 256 BC==\n{{Main|Battle of Messana|Battle of Agrigentum}}\n[[File:Sicilia - prima guerra punica.svg|thumb|alt=A relief map of Sicily showing the main cities at the time of the First Punic War|{{center|Sicily, the main theater of the war}}]]\n\nMuch of the war was to be fought on, or in the waters near, Sicily. Away from the coasts its hilly and rugged terrain made manoeuvring large forces difficult and favoured the defence over the offence. Land operations were largely confined to [[Raid (military)|raid]]s, [[siege]]s and [[interdiction]]; in 23 years of war on Sicily there were only two full-scale pitched battles. Garrison duty and land [[blockade]]s were the most common operations for both armies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}}\n\nAfter a lengthy delay,{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=72}} the land war in Sicily began with the Romans landing at Messana in 264 BC. Despite the Carthaginian naval advantage, the Roman landing was virtually unopposed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=48\u201349}} Two legions commanded by Claudius [[Battle of Messana|disembarked at Messana]], where the Mamertines had expelled the Carthaginian garrison commanded by [[Hanno, Messana garrison commander|Hanno]] (no relation to [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]]) and were besieged by both the Carthaginians and the Syracusans.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=52}} The sources are unclear as to why, but first the Syracusans, and then the Carthaginians withdrew from the siege. The Romans marched south and in turn besieged Syracuse, but they had neither a strong enough force, nor the secure supply lines to prosecute a successful siege, and soon withdrew.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as [[Roman consul|consuls]], to each lead an army. In 263 BC both were sent to Sicily with a force of 40,000.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=74}} After a brief siege, with no Carthaginian assistance anticipated, Syracuse made peace with the Romans; it became a Roman ally, paid an indemnity of 100 [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver{{#tag:ref|100 talents was approximately {{convert|2.6|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} and, perhaps most importantly, agreed to help supply the Roman army in Sicily.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=71}} Following the defection of Syracuse, several other small Carthaginian dependencies switched to the Romans.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=171}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=72\u201373}} [[Agrigento|Akragas]] (Agrigentum in Latin; modern Agrigento), a port city halfway along the south coast of Sicily, was chosen by the Carthaginians as their strategic centre. The Romans marched on it in 262 BC and besieged it.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Romans had an inadequate supply system, partly because the Carthaginian naval supremacy prevented them from shipped supplies by sea, and they were not in any case accustomed to feeding an army as large as 40,000 men. At harvest time most of the army was dispersed over a wide area to harvest the crops and to forage.

The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on a captured blockade runner with especially good qualities.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding, and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there to use as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After achieving this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum and Drepana.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}} The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Instead, it ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate Gesco.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end: Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartagin\u00e9s-2.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=Image of both sides of a coin: one depicting a bearded man's head; the other a mounted elephant|{{center|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237\u2013227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] (who was associated with [[Hercules]]/[[Heracles]]).

Eventually [[Mercenary War|they rebelled]] and were joined by many disgruntled local groups. They were put down with great difficulty and considerable savagery. Rome took advantage of the chaos to seize Corsica and Sardinia, in defiance of the terms of their treaty.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}} Carthage, seeking to make up for the recent territorial losses and to gain a source of silver to pay the large indemnity owed to Rome, turned its attention to [[Iberia]] (modern Spain); in 237 BC, the Carthaginians, led by Hamilcar Barca, began a [[Carthaginian Iberia#Expansion into Iberia|series of campaigns]] to expand their control over the [[peninsula]]. Though Hamilcar was killed in 229 BC, the offensive continued with the Carthaginians extending their power towards the [[Ebro valley]] and founding [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] in 228 BC.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\nFor Rome, the end of the First Punic War marked the start of its expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Sicily would become important to Rome as [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|a source of grain]].{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}} [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] was granted nominal independence and ally status for the lifetime of Hiero II.{{sfn|Allen|Myers|1890|p=111}} Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built more than 1,000 galleys during the war, and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=128\u2013129, 357, 359\u2013360}}\n\nThe question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and when Carthage besieged

For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. After immense material and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.\n\nThe war began in 264 BC with the Romans gaining a foothold on Sicily at [[Battle of Messana|Messana]] (modern [[Messina]]). The Romans then pressed [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the only significant independent power on the island, into allying with them and laid siege to Carthage's main base at [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. A large Carthaginian army attempted to lift the siege in 262 BC, but was heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battle of Akragas]]. The Romans then built a navy to challenge Carthage's, and using novel tactics inflicted several defeats. A Carthaginian base on [[Corsica]] was seized, but an attack on [[Sardinia]] was repulsed; the base on Corsica was then lost. Taking advantage of their naval victories the Romans launched an invasion of North Africa, which the Carthaginians intercepted. At the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]] the Carthaginians were again beaten; this was possibly the [[largest naval battle in history]] by the number of combatants involved. The invasion initially went well and in 255 BC the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]]; the proposed terms were so harsh they fought on, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|defeating the invaders]]. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians opposed it at the [[Battle of Cape Hermaeum]] off Africa; the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, losing 384 ships and 100,000 men.\n\nThe war continued, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, adding 220 new ships. The Carthaginians attacked and recaptured Akragas in 255 BC, but not believing they could hold the city, they razed and abandoned it. The Romans captured Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) in 254 BC. The next year they lost another 150 ships to a storm while returning from raiding the North African coast. In 251 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated in a [[ Battle of Panormus|battle outside the walls]]. Slowly the Romans had occupied most of Sicily; in 249 BC they besieged the last two Carthaginian strongholds{{snd}}in the extreme west. They also launched a surprise attack on the Carthaginian fleet, which was defeated at the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Carthaginians followed up their victory and another 120 Roman warships, and 800 transports, were lost at the [[ Battle of Phintias]]. After several years of stalemate, the Romans rebuilt their fleet again in 244 BC and effectively [[blockade]]d the Carthaginian garrisons. Carthage assembled a fleet which attempted to relieve them, but it was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|Aegates Islands]] in 241 BC, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to negotiate for peace. \n\nThe [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was agreed. By its terms Carthage paid large [[War reparations|reparations]] and [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily was annexed]] as a [[Roman province]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The immense effort of building 1,000 galleys during the war laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years. The end of the war sparked a major but unsuccessful [[Mercenary War|revolt]] within the Carthaginian Empire. The unresolved strategic competition between Rome and Carthage would lead to the eruption of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nSince 2010, eleven bronze warship [[Naval ram|rams]] have been found by archaeologists in the sea off the west coast of Sicily, along with ten bronze helmets and hundreds of [[amphorae]].{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Pragg|2013}}{{sfn|Murray|2019|}} The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a large number of fragments, have since been recovered.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=12, 26, 31\u201332}} It is believed the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=39}} The archaeologists involved stated that the location of artefacts so far discovered supports Polybius's account of where the [[Battle of the Aegates]] took place.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=35\u201336}} Based on the dimensions of the recovered rams, the archaeologists who have studied them believe they all came from [[trireme]]s, contrary to Polybius's account of all of the warships involved being [[Hellenistic-era warships#Hellenistic-era warships|quinqueremes]].{{sfn|Murray|2019|}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=39\u201342}} However, they believe that the many amphorae identified confirm the accuracy of other aspects of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=46}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, terrestrial archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Carthage-1958-PortsPuniques.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour photograph of an urban area by the sea with a water-filled, torus-shaped inlet.|{{center|A photograph of the remains of the naval base of the city of Carthage.

During the Pyrrhic War of 280\u2013275 BC, against a king of [[Epirus]] who alternately fought Rome in Italy and Carthage on Sicily, Carthage provided [[materiel]] to the Romans and on at least one occasion used its navy to ferry a Roman force.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=94, 160, 163, 164\u2013165}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nIn 288 BC, the [[Mamertines]], a group of Italian mercenaries, previously hired by Syracuse, occupied the city of Messana (modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=165}} Hard-pressed by Syracuse, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians acted first, pressing [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], king of Syracuse, into taking no further action and convincing the Mamertines to accept a Carthaginian garrison in Messana. According to Polybius, a considerable debate took place in Rome as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for assistance, which could easily lead to war with Carthage. The Romans had not previously displayed any interest in Sicily and did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors. However, many saw strategic and monetary advantages in gaining a foothold in Sicily. It was recognised that this step may lead to ill-feeling from Carthage, but war was considered far from inevitable. The deadlocked [[Roman Senate]] put the matter before the popular assembly, which decided to accept the Mamertines' request.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=42\u201345}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=150}}\n\n[[Appius Claudius Caudex]] was appointed commander of a military expedition with orders to cross to Messana.{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=479}}{{sfn|Warmington|1993|pp=168\u2013169}} Carthage was unperturbed.

A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order.

In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} Most of the Carthaginian infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]], usually forming two or three lines.{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Two thousand [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] were recruited from the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}\n\n==Sicily 264 \u2013 256 BC==\n{{Main|Battle of Messana|Battle of Agrigentum}}\n[[File:Sicilia - prima guerra punica.svg|thumb|alt=A relief map of Sicily showing the main cities at the time of the First Punic War|{{center|Sicily, the main theater of the war}}]]\n\nMuch of the war was to be fought on, or in the waters near, Sicily. Away from the coasts its hilly and rugged terrain made manoeuvring large forces difficult and favoured the defence over the offence. Land operations were largely confined to [[Raid (military)|raid]]s, [[siege]]s and [[interdiction]]; in 23 years of war on Sicily there were only two full-scale pitched battles. Garrison duty and land [[blockade]]s were the most common operations for both armies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}}\n\nAfter a lengthy delay,{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=72}} the land war in Sicily began with the Romans landing at Messana in 264 BC. Despite the Carthaginian naval advantage, the Roman landing was virtually unopposed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=48\u201349}} Two legions commanded by Claudius [[Battle of Messana|disembarked at Messana]], where the Mamertines had expelled the Carthaginian garrison commanded by [[Hanno, Messana garrison commander|Hanno]] (no relation to [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]]) and were besieged by both the Carthaginians and the Syracusans.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=52}} The sources are unclear as to why, but first the Syracusans, and then the Carthaginians withdrew from the siege. The Romans marched south and in turn besieged Syracuse, but they had neither a strong enough force, nor the secure supply lines to prosecute a successful siege, and soon withdrew.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as [[Roman consul|consuls]], to each lead an army. In 263 BC both were sent to Sicily with a force of 40,000.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=74}} After a brief siege, with no Carthaginian assistance anticipated, Syracuse made peace with the Romans; it became a Roman ally, paid an indemnity of 100 [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver{{#tag:ref|100 talents was approximately {{convert|2.6|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} and, perhaps most importantly, agreed to help supply the Roman army in Sicily.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=71}} Following the defection of Syracuse, several other small Carthaginian dependencies switched to the Romans.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=171}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=72\u201373}} [[Agrigento|Akragas]] (Agrigentum in Latin; modern Agrigento), a port city halfway along the south coast of Sicily, was chosen by the Carthaginians as their strategic centre. The Romans marched on it in 262 BC and besieged it.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Romans had an inadequate supply system, partly because the Carthaginian naval supremacy prevented them from shipped supplies by sea, and they were not in any case accustomed to feeding an army as large as 40,000 men. At harvest time most of the army was dispersed over a wide area to harvest the crops and to forage. The Carthaginians, commanded by [[Hannibal Gisco]], sortied in force, taking the Romans by surprise and penetrating their camp; the Romans rallied and routed the Carthaginians; after this experience both sides were more guarded.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=77}}\n\n[[Image:Romanadvance (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=a map of Sicily showing Rome and Carthage's territories, movements and the main military clashes 260\u2013256 BC|Continued Roman advance 260\u2013256 BC{{col begin}}\n{{legend|#8E2A76|Roman territory or advances (arrows)}} {{legend|#D2FDC5|Syracusan territory}}{{legend|#808080|Carthaginian territory}}{{col end}}]]\n\nMeanwhile, Carthage had recruited an army, which assembled in Africa and was shipped to Sicily.

The Romans, under both consuls{{snd}}[[Lucius Postumius Megellus (consul 262 BC)|Lucius Postumius Megellus]] and [[Quintus Mamilius Vitulus]]{{snd}} pursued, capturing the Carthaginians' elephants and [[Train (military)|baggage train]]. That night the Carthaginian garrison escaped while the Romans were distracted. The next day the Romans seized the city and its inhabitants, selling 25,000 of them into slavery.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=179\u2013180}}\n\nAfter this success for the Romans, the war became fragmented for several years, with minor successes for each side, but no clear focus. In part this was because the Romans diverted many of their resources to an ultimately fruitless campaign against Corsica and Sardinia, and then into the equally fruitless expedition to Africa.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=65}} After taking Akragas the Romans advanced westward to besiege [[Mytistraton]] for seven months, without success.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} In 259 BC they advanced toward [[Termini Imerese|Thermae]] on the north coast. After a quarrel, the Roman troops and their allies set up separate camps.

To counter this, the Romans introduced the [[corvus (weapon)|''corvus'']], a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}} This allowed Roman legionaries acting as marines to [[Naval boarding|board enemy ships]] and capture them, rather than employing the previously [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|traditional tactic]] of [[ramming]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}\n\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nAll warships were equipped with rams, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline.

The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by Hannibal Gisco, the general who had commanded the garrison of Akragas, and was based at Panormus, some {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Lipari. When Hannibal heard of the Romans' move he despatched 20 ships under [[Boodes]] to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Boodes' ships attacked and Scipio's inexperienced men offered little resistance. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the Consul himself was taken prisoner.
