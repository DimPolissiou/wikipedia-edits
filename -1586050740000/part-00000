A cathedral school had existed since around 1103. By the 16th century however, it had declined, and in 1509, a new school was founded by [[John Colet]], Dean of St Paul's Cathedral, on a plot of land to the north of the Cathedral.\n\n[[File:Statue of John Colet.jpg|left|thumb|Statue of John Colet]]\n\nThe eldest son of Sir Henry Colet, a member of the [[Mercers' Company]] and twice [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]], he inherited a substantial fortune and used a great part of it for the endowment of his school, having no family of his own; his 21 brothers and sisters all died in childhood and he was a celibate priest. He described himself in the statutes of the school as \"desyring nothing more thanne Educacion and bringing upp chyldren in good Maners and litterature.\"<ref name=\"SPS 8363\">{{cite web |url=http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=8363 |title=STATUTA PAULIN\u00c6 SCHOL\u00c6 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516025146/http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=8363 |archivedate=16 May 2008  }}</ref>\n[[File:St Paul's School plaque London.jpg|thumb|City of London [[Blue plaques|blue plaque]]]]\nOriginally, the school provided education for 153 children of \"all nacions and countries indifferently\", primarily in literature and etiquette. The number [[153 (number)|153]] has long been associated with the [[miraculous draught of fishes]] recorded in [[Gospel of John|St John's Gospel]], and for several generations Foundation Scholars have been given the option of wearing an emblem of a silver fish. St Paul's was the largest school in England at its foundation, and its High Master had a salary of 13 shillings and sixpence weekly, which was double that of the contemporary Head Master of [[Eton College]].  The scholars were not required to make any payment, although they were required to be literate and had to pay for their own wax candles, which at that time were an expensive commodity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n[[File:St Paul's School, London; the facade.

Cole]] Colet was an outspoken critic of the powerful and worldly Church of his day, a friend of [[Erasmus]] and Sir [[Thomas More]]. Erasmus wrote textbooks for the school and St Paul's was the first English school to teach Greek, reflecting the humanist interests of the founder. Colet distrusted the Church as a managing body for his school, declaring that he \"found the least corruption\" in married laymen.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Medieval Panorama|last = Coulton|first = George|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1938|isbn = |location = |pages = 659}}</ref> For this reason, Colet assigned the management of the School and its revenues to the [[Mercers' Company]], the premier livery company in the City of London, with which his father had been associated. In 1876 the company was legally established as trustee of the Colet estate, and the management of the school was assigned to a Board of Governors consisting of the Master, Wardens and nine members of the company, together with three representatives from each of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London. The Mercers' Company still forms the major part of the School's governing body, and it continues to administer Colet's trust.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOne of St Paul's early headmasters was [[Richard Mulcaster]], famous for writing two influential treatises on education (Positions, in 1581,<ref name=\"Mulcaster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/positions-txt.html |title=Positions wherein... |accessdate=27 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927134327/http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/positions-txt.html |archivedate=27 September 2006 }}</ref> and Elementarie in 1582).

St Paul's was one of only nine schools considered by the Clarendon Commission, and one of only two schools which was not predominantly attended by boarders (the other day school was [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors']]).\n\nAccording to [[Charles Dickens, Jr.]], writing in 1879<ref>[[Charles Dickens, Jr.]], ''Dickens's Dictionary of London'' (1879)</ref>\n{{quote|St Paul\u2019s School (founded 1512 by John Colet, DD, Dean of St Paul\u2019s), St Paul\u2019s-churchyard \u2014 There are 153 scholars on the foundation, who are entitled to entire exemption from school fees. Vacancies are filled up at the commencement of each term according to the results of a competitive examination. Candidates must be between 12 and 14 years of age. Capitation scholars pay \u00a320 a year. The governors of this school are appointed by the Mercers' Company and the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London. The school [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibitions]] [i.e. scholarships] are determined as to number and value by the governors from time to time, and the school prizes are of considerable importance. The following are the university exhibitions. To the University of Cambridge there are the following exhibitions: Five exhibitions at Trinity, founded by Mr Perry in 1696, of the value of \u00a310 a year; two exhibitions at St John\u2019s, founded by Dr Gower in 1711, of the value of \u00a310 a year, for the sons of clergymen.

His arms were ''Sable on a chevron Argent between three Hinds trippant Argent three Annulets Sable'', and they were originally used by his great-grandfather, Richard Colet.  As Dean of St Paul's, he was entitled to [[Impalement in heraldry|impale]] them with the arms of the Deanery, and the school has often used them in this form also.  In 2002, the school obtained its own grant of arms from the [[College of Arms]] consisting of the arms of Dean Colet surrounded by a gold bordure, upon which the crossed swords of the Dean of St Paul's are repeated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Apposition===\nApposition is a traditional ceremony at St Paul's and was originally a way of allowing the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|Mercers Company]] to assess teaching staff and the High Master, with the option of dismissing or reappointing them. The assessment takes the form of a third-party 'apposer', often a leading academic, judging the quality of teaching through scrutinising lectures given by boys in their final year. Today it is primarily a prize giving event, where prizes are awarded to senior boys who have excelled in particular subjects. The Apposition Dinner is held in the Mercer's Hall in London every year around May.\n\nConsequences of apposition have led to the dismissal of previous High Masters including Thomas Freeman, for lack of learning (although more probably for holding the incorrect religious views) in 1559. In 1748, High Master Charles was removed as he had allegedly threatened to \"pull the Surmaster by the nose and kick him about the school.\"\n\nSince it was re-introduced in 1969,<ref>Mead, A.H. (1990). ''A Miraculous Draught of Fishes: a history of St Paul's School'', p.126. {{ISBN|0-907383-05-X}}.</ref> the ceremony today takes place in May and is purely ceremonial, incorporating prize giving for boys in the final two years of the school.\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:St Paul's School, Hammersmith.jpg|left|thumb|St Paul's, Hammersmith, c. 1900]]\n\nThe original school, which stood in St Paul's Churchyard, was destroyed with the Cathedral in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/greatfire.htm |title=The Great Fire of London, 1666 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |last=Jokinen |first=Anniina |date=26 October 2001 |publisher=Luminarium }}</ref> The school was twice rebuilt, first in 1670, and again in Cheapside in 1822; but towards the end of the 19th century, as London expanded and residents moved away from the City of London and its environs, it was decided that the school should move to larger premises.\n\nIn 1884 a new building designed by the architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] rose to dominate the countryside of [[Hammersmith]]. The terracotta for the Hammersmith school was made by the famous [[Gibbs and Canning Limited]] of [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]. At this time the street numbering was changed locally and so the school address, whether by accident or design, became 153 Hammersmith Road.<ref>{{coord|51|29|34|N|0|12|55|W|region:GB_type:landmark}}</ref>  The preparatory school, [[St Paul's Juniors|Colet Court]], was soon afterwards housed in new premises in a similar style on the opposite side of the road.\n[[File:Boat Race St Paul's.jpg|thumb|View of St. Paul's from Chiswick]]\nIn September 1939 the school was evacuated to Easthampstead Park, near Crowthorne in Berkshire, where, under the then High Master, [[Walter Oakeshott|W. F. Oakeshott]], it became solely a boarding school for the period of the war. Playing fields and some other facilities were borrowed from nearby [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], but the boys and the teachers from the two schools remained entirely separate.\n\nIn the meantime, the London buildings became the headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|Home Forces]] in July 1940<ref>Newbold, p. 245</ref> and the headquarters of the [[21st Army Group|XXI Army Group]] under the command of General, later Field-Marshal, [[Bernard Montgomery]], himself an Old Pauline, in July 1943. There the XXI army part of the military side of the invasion of Europe was planned, including the [[D-Day]] landings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldpaulinelodge.org.uk/School.htm |title= A brief history of the St Paul's School |accessdate=27 April 2008 |last=Mead |first=Hugh |date=4 May 2006 }}; Dwight Eisenhower, Crusade in Europe, London 1949, p. 267ff</ref> The map that he used is still present in the modern day site of the school in the Montgomery Room. The school recovered its buildings in September 1945, and resumed life essentially as a day school, although it retains a small number of boarders to this day.\n[[Image:St Paul's School Front Entrance.jpg|left|thumb|The former front entrance of St Paul's School]]\nBy 1961 it had become evident that the old school buildings were unsuited to modern educational needs. By good fortune, the opportunity then came to rebuild the School on a 45-acre (182,000 m\u00b2) riverside site at [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], adjacent to [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. This land had previously been the site of reservoirs which were filled in with earth excavated during the construction of the [[Victoria line]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akt-uk.com/projects/st%20paul%20s%20school%20|title=St Paul's School|last=|first=|date=|website=AKT II|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> The sports pitches took a long time to settle, and competitive matches were not played regularly at the Barnes site until summer 1979.\n\nThe fifth School buildings were opened in September 1968, to designs by architects Feilden and Mawson. The new site also includes the preparatory school, St Paul's Juniors (formerly Colet Court), whose pupils account for roughly one half of the senior school's intake each year.  The Waterhouse building on Hammersmith Road was demolished amid protests to allow building of flats, apart from the gates and the peripheral walls, the High Master's House, and a toolhut, though the Colet Court building also survives.\n\n[[File:Main Buildings - 60s CLASP.jpg|thumb|Main Buildings \u2013 60s CLASP]]The 1968 buildings include a 25m, 6 lane swimming pool shared with St Paul's Juniors. Extensive sports facilities notably include a [[fencing]] salle, six rugby [[fives]] courts, three [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts and a [[Racquets (sport)|Racquets]] court.  The location next to the [[River Thames]] meant that a rowing boathouse was included in the plans, which itself included both an indoor training tank and housing to accommodate a boatman, whose primary job was to build and maintain the boats. A striking and deliberate omission from the new buildings was any provision for a school hall capable of holding all masters and boys simultaneously, and although the main sports hall is large enough to accommodate the entire school, the difficulty in setting up enough chairs means that the hall is used to house the entire school only twice per year. There were originally two boarding houses in the 1968 buildings (School House and High House) accommodating up to 120 boarders, but the number of boarders has steadily declined since then and is now only 20. One of the boarding houses (School House) has been demolished to make way for a new music building, which houses the [[Wathen Hall]]. The other (High House, renamed School House) is in the process of being demolished, with boarders relocated to the recently renovated Colet House. The only building which remained from the previous Water Board landowners became the music department for St Paul's Juniors.\n\nThe original buildings were built using a modular system of interlocking concrete slabs, known as the [[Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme|CLASP]] system.  This allowed for relatively quick and cheap construction, and allowed for the fact that much of the site was formed from reservoir land which was still settling. The whole complex is now in need of replacement; the only existing buildings likely to remain are the Music school, incorporating the Wathen Hall from 1999 and the Rackets Court.\n\n==2009\u2013present day==\nThe boys' school numbered 856 boys in 2009, the 500th year of its foundation. A rebuilding of the school at its present site is planned, to be completed over a 25-year period. {{citation needed|reason=given as 30 years elsewhere in article|date=April 2018}} While former High Master, [[George Martin Stephen]], announced an aspiration for the school to be needs-blind within 25 years \u2013 \u00a3250 million will need to be raised to accomplish this.\n\nThe school day lasts from 8.35 a.m. to 4.15 p.m. and consists of 8 periods, including a one-and-three-quarter-hour lunch break during which pupils are encouraged to participate in sporting or extracurricular activities such as music, debating or computing. Pupils of all ages are not allowed to leave the school premises without permission at any time during the day.\n\nThe school still maintains a boarding house. There are strong boarding house traditions including the annual bonfire and two hours of compulsory study known as \"prep\" every evening. Newer traditions include the sponsored all night five-a-side football tournament, a \"charity sponging\" event. However, the charity sponging did not take place in 2010 due to, as some boarders claim, complaints from a boarding student who had been \"sponged\" particularly often and the future of the traditional event is unclear.\n\nThe school has recently opened its Science wing. The wing is a four-storey building finished in February 2013, built to give university standard of work spaces and labs. The school now has its own [[scanning electron microscope]] along with the new science building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/st-pauls/news/academic-news/how-the-electron-microscope-is-changing-the-world|title=How the Electron Microscope is Changing the World|website=St Paul\u2019s School|language=en|access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> It has a floor dedicated to each branch of science, e.g. biology, physics and chemistry. The bottom floor is a careers and university section to for the older students. Tables with computers and spaces for students or staff to use as desks are available on all floors.\n\nA large number of music concerts, art exhibitions and plays take place each year, and pupils regularly receive national recognition for their achievements. The school also has a strong sports department; St Paul's was a founding member of the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871 and was pre-eminent in public school boxing, its first team failing to win only two boxing matches against first team boxers from other schools over a period of 25 years; however, boxing was discontinued as a school sport in the 1960s. More recently, the school teams were runners-up in the rugby U15 [[Daily Mail Cup]] in 2005 and in 2007. The school has a strong record in rugby. In 1979, the 1st XV of St Paul's, nicknamed the 'Invincibles' went twelve matches undefeated.<ref name=\"stpaulsschool.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/sport/rugby|title=Rugby \u2013 St Paul\u2019s School|website=St Paul\u2019s School}}</ref> Big rivals for the school are RGS Guildford, King's College School, Dulwich College, St John's Leatherhead, Merchant Taylors', Wellington and Eton.<ref name=\"stpaulsschool.org.uk\"/>\n\n===Operation Winthorpe===\nSt Paul's has a poor record of recent press appearances, partially as a consequence of being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for historic crimes of paedophilia  that it was given its own operational name, Operation Winthorpe. The school has entirely reviewed and majorly revised their safeguarding procedures since.\nA major independent report published in January 2020, revealed 80 complaints against 32 members of staff over a period of six decades, mainly from the 1960s to the 1990s. There were 28 recommendations on how current practice could be improved. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Weale |first1=Sally |title=Review reveals scale of abuse scandal at London private school |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/review-reveals-scale-of-abuse-scandal-at-london-private-school |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Sports facilities===\nThe school has numerous sports facilities, and sport plays a major part in the everyday lives of the boys. There is a large sports hall, gymnasium, dojo, fencing salle, 25m swimming pool, 6 fives courts, a rackets court, three squash courts, a fitness centre, a 100m sprint straight, ten tennis courts and a multi use games area (MUGA). There is also a large boathouse and the school has extensive playing fields which consist of 11 football or rugby pitches during the winter months, or seven cricket pitches during the summer months.\n\n===Renewal campaign===\n[[File:St_Paul's_School_courtyard.jpg|alt=|thumb|On the left, the new science block is visible; in the centre is the first phase of the new general teaching block (GTB) building; on the right is visible the old half-demolished GTB and the former main entrance.]]\nThe renewal campaign is the project to rebuild the entire school campus, frequently known as the Masterplan.\n\nThe majority of the current buildings date from the 1960s, and the [[Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme|CLASP]] technology used in the construction of the buildings has a limited lifespan.

Colet distrusted the Church as a managing body for his school, declaring that he \"found the least corruption\" in married laymen.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Medieval Panorama|last = Coulton|first = George|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1938|isbn = |location = |pages = 659}}</ref> For this reason, Colet assigned the management of the School and its revenues to the [[Mercers' Company]], the premier livery company in the City of London, with which his father had been associated. In 1876 the company was legally established as trustee of the Colet estate, and the management of the school was assigned to a Board of Governors consisting of the Master, Wardens and nine members of the company, together with three representatives from each of the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge and London. The Mercers' Company still forms the major part of the School's governing body, and it continues to administer Colet's trust.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOne of St Paul's early headmasters was [[Richard Mulcaster]], famous for writing two influential treatises on education (Positions, in 1581,<ref name=\"Mulcaster\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/positions-txt.html |title=Positions wherein... |accessdate=27 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927134327/http://www.ucs.mun.ca/~wbarker/positions-txt.html |archivedate=27 September 2006 }}</ref> and Elementarie in 1582). His description in Positions of \"footeball\" as a refereed team sport is the earliest reference to organised modern football. For this description and his enthusiasm for the sport he is considered the father of modern football.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Shakespeare's World|last = Francis|first = Azra|publisher = AuthorHouse|year = 2013|isbn = 9781491819494|location = |pages = 255}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1861 and 1864, the [[Clarendon Commission]] (a [[Royal Commission]]) investigated the public school system in England and its report formed the basis of the [[Public Schools Act 1868]]. St Paul's was one of only nine schools considered by the Clarendon Commission, and one of only two schools which was not predominantly attended by boarders (the other day school was [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors']]).\n\nAccording to [[Charles Dickens, Jr.]], writing in 1879<ref>[[Charles Dickens, Jr.]], ''Dickens's Dictionary of London'' (1879)</ref>\n{{quote|St Paul\u2019s School (founded 1512 by John Colet, DD, Dean of St Paul\u2019s), St Paul\u2019s-churchyard \u2014 There are 153 scholars on the foundation, who are entitled to entire exemption from school fees. Vacancies are filled up at the commencement of each term according to the results of a competitive examination. Candidates must be between 12 and 14 years of age. Capitation scholars pay \u00a320 a year. The governors of this school are appointed by the Mercers' Company and the Universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and London. The school [[Exhibition (scholarship)|exhibitions]] [i.e. scholarships] are determined as to number and value by the governors from time to time, and the school prizes are of considerable importance. The following are the university exhibitions. To the University of Cambridge there are the following exhibitions: Five exhibitions at Trinity, founded by Mr Perry in 1696, of the value of \u00a310 a year; two exhibitions at St John\u2019s, founded by Dr Gower in 1711, of the value of \u00a310 a year, for the sons of clergymen. An exhibition, founded by Mr Stock in 1780 at Corpus Christi, of the yearly value of \u00a330, given to a scholar recommended by the high master. Four exhibitions, in the same college, value \u00a310 a year each, founded by Mr George Sykes in 1766, consolidated now in one exhibition, value \u00a336 a year.}}By comparison, in 2016 the Daily Telegraph reported  that families earning up to \u00a3120,000 were being offered bursaries after the headmaster declared that the school had become \"unaffordable.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/17/st-pauls-school-offering-bursaries-for-children-of-parents-who-e/|title=St Paul's School offering bursaries for children of parents who earn \u00a3120k a year|work=Daily Telegraph|date=17 September 2016|accessdate=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1886 and 1895, St Paul's boys won 173 entrance awards at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], which was 26 more than any other school.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Over many years its record of Open Awards at Oxford and Cambridge in all subjects has been equal, or superior, to that of any other school of comparable size.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===School coat of arms===\nLike many ancient educational foundations, St Paul's School traditionally used the arms of its founder, [[John Colet]]. His arms were ''Sable on a chevron Argent between three Hinds trippant Argent three Annulets Sable'', and they were originally used by his great-grandfather, Richard Colet.  As Dean of St Paul's, he was entitled to [[Impalement in heraldry|impale]] them with the arms of the Deanery, and the school has often used them in this form also.  In 2002, the school obtained its own grant of arms from the [[College of Arms]] consisting of the arms of Dean Colet surrounded by a gold bordure, upon which the crossed swords of the Dean of St Paul's are repeated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Apposition===\nApposition is a traditional ceremony at St Paul's and was originally a way of allowing the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers|Mercers Company]] to assess teaching staff and the High Master, with the option of dismissing or reappointing them. The assessment takes the form of a third-party 'apposer', often a leading academic, judging the quality of teaching through scrutinising lectures given by boys in their final year. Today it is primarily a prize giving event, where prizes are awarded to senior boys who have excelled in particular subjects. The Apposition Dinner is held in the Mercer's Hall in London every year around May.\n\nConsequences of apposition have led to the dismissal of previous High Masters including Thomas Freeman, for lack of learning (although more probably for holding the incorrect religious views) in 1559. In 1748, High Master Charles was removed as he had allegedly threatened to \"pull the Surmaster by the nose and kick him about the school.\"\n\nSince it was re-introduced in 1969,<ref>Mead, A.H. (1990). ''A Miraculous Draught of Fishes: a history of St Paul's School'', p.126. {{ISBN|0-907383-05-X}}.</ref> the ceremony today takes place in May and is purely ceremonial, incorporating prize giving for boys in the final two years of the school.\n\n==Buildings==\n[[File:St Paul's School, Hammersmith.jpg|left|thumb|St Paul's, Hammersmith, c. 1900]]\n\nThe original school, which stood in St Paul's Churchyard, was destroyed with the Cathedral in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luminarium.org/encyclopedia/greatfire.htm |title=The Great Fire of London, 1666 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |last=Jokinen |first=Anniina |date=26 October 2001 |publisher=Luminarium }}</ref> The school was twice rebuilt, first in 1670, and again in Cheapside in 1822; but towards the end of the 19th century, as London expanded and residents moved away from the City of London and its environs, it was decided that the school should move to larger premises.\n\nIn 1884 a new building designed by the architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] rose to dominate the countryside of [[Hammersmith]]. The terracotta for the Hammersmith school was made by the famous [[Gibbs and Canning Limited]] of [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]. At this time the street numbering was changed locally and so the school address, whether by accident or design, became 153 Hammersmith Road.<ref>{{coord|51|29|34|N|0|12|55|W|region:GB_type:landmark}}</ref>  The preparatory school, [[St Paul's Juniors|Colet Court]], was soon afterwards housed in new premises in a similar style on the opposite side of the road.\n[[File:Boat Race St Paul's.jpg|thumb|View of St. Paul's from Chiswick]]\nIn September 1939 the school was evacuated to Easthampstead Park, near Crowthorne in Berkshire, where, under the then High Master, [[Walter Oakeshott|W. F. Oakeshott]], it became solely a boarding school for the period of the war. Playing fields and some other facilities were borrowed from nearby [[Wellington College, Berkshire|Wellington College]], but the boys and the teachers from the two schools remained entirely separate.\n\nIn the meantime, the London buildings became the headquarters of the [[Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces|Home Forces]] in July 1940<ref>Newbold, p. 245</ref> and the headquarters of the [[21st Army Group|XXI Army Group]] under the command of General, later Field-Marshal, [[Bernard Montgomery]], himself an Old Pauline, in July 1943. There the XXI army part of the military side of the invasion of Europe was planned, including the [[D-Day]] landings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldpaulinelodge.org.uk/School.htm |title= A brief history of the St Paul's School |accessdate=27 April 2008 |last=Mead |first=Hugh |date=4 May 2006 }}; Dwight Eisenhower, Crusade in Europe, London 1949, p. 267ff</ref> The map that he used is still present in the modern day site of the school in the Montgomery Room. The school recovered its buildings in September 1945, and resumed life essentially as a day school, although it retains a small number of boarders to this day.\n[[Image:St Paul's School Front Entrance.jpg|left|thumb|The former front entrance of St Paul's School]]\nBy 1961 it had become evident that the old school buildings were unsuited to modern educational needs. By good fortune, the opportunity then came to rebuild the School on a 45-acre (182,000 m\u00b2) riverside site at [[Barnes, London|Barnes]], adjacent to [[Hammersmith Bridge]]. This land had previously been the site of reservoirs which were filled in with earth excavated during the construction of the [[Victoria line]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.akt-uk.com/projects/st%20paul%20s%20school%20|title=St Paul's School|last=|first=|date=|website=AKT II|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref> The sports pitches took a long time to settle, and competitive matches were not played regularly at the Barnes site until summer 1979.\n\nThe fifth School buildings were opened in September 1968, to designs by architects Feilden and Mawson. The new site also includes the preparatory school, St Paul's Juniors (formerly Colet Court), whose pupils account for roughly one half of the senior school's intake each year.  The Waterhouse building on Hammersmith Road was demolished amid protests to allow building of flats, apart from the gates and the peripheral walls, the High Master's House, and a toolhut, though the Colet Court building also survives.\n\n[[File:Main Buildings - 60s CLASP.jpg|thumb|Main Buildings \u2013 60s CLASP]]The 1968 buildings include a 25m, 6 lane swimming pool shared with St Paul's Juniors. Extensive sports facilities notably include a [[fencing]] salle, six rugby [[fives]] courts, three [[Squash (sport)|squash]] courts and a [[Racquets (sport)|Racquets]] court.  The location next to the [[River Thames]] meant that a rowing boathouse was included in the plans, which itself included both an indoor training tank and housing to accommodate a boatman, whose primary job was to build and maintain the boats. A striking and deliberate omission from the new buildings was any provision for a school hall capable of holding all masters and boys simultaneously, and although the main sports hall is large enough to accommodate the entire school, the difficulty in setting up enough chairs means that the hall is used to house the entire school only twice per year. There were originally two boarding houses in the 1968 buildings (School House and High House) accommodating up to 120 boarders, but the number of boarders has steadily declined since then and is now only 20. One of the boarding houses (School House) has been demolished to make way for a new music building, which houses the [[Wathen Hall]]. The other (High House, renamed School House) is in the process of being demolished, with boarders relocated to the recently renovated Colet House. The only building which remained from the previous Water Board landowners became the music department for St Paul's Juniors.\n\nThe original buildings were built using a modular system of interlocking concrete slabs, known as the [[Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme|CLASP]] system.  This allowed for relatively quick and cheap construction, and allowed for the fact that much of the site was formed from reservoir land which was still settling. The whole complex is now in need of replacement; the only existing buildings likely to remain are the Music school, incorporating the Wathen Hall from 1999 and the Rackets Court.\n\n==2009\u2013present day==\nThe boys' school numbered 856 boys in 2009, the 500th year of its foundation. A rebuilding of the school at its present site is planned, to be completed over a 25-year period. {{citation needed|reason=given as 30 years elsewhere in article|date=April 2018}} While former High Master, [[George Martin Stephen]], announced an aspiration for the school to be needs-blind within 25 years \u2013 \u00a3250 million will need to be raised to accomplish this.\n\nThe school day lasts from 8.35 a.m. to 4.15 p.m. and consists of 8 periods, including a one-and-three-quarter-hour lunch break during which pupils are encouraged to participate in sporting or extracurricular activities such as music, debating or computing. Pupils of all ages are not allowed to leave the school premises without permission at any time during the day.\n\nThe school still maintains a boarding house. There are strong boarding house traditions including the annual bonfire and two hours of compulsory study known as \"prep\" every evening. Newer traditions include the sponsored all night five-a-side football tournament, a \"charity sponging\" event. However, the charity sponging did not take place in 2010 due to, as some boarders claim, complaints from a boarding student who had been \"sponged\" particularly often and the future of the traditional event is unclear.\n\nThe school has recently opened its Science wing. The wing is a four-storey building finished in February 2013, built to give university standard of work spaces and labs. The school now has its own [[scanning electron microscope]] along with the new science building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/st-pauls/news/academic-news/how-the-electron-microscope-is-changing-the-world|title=How the Electron Microscope is Changing the World|website=St Paul\u2019s School|language=en|access-date=2019-03-12}}</ref> It has a floor dedicated to each branch of science, e.g. biology, physics and chemistry. The bottom floor is a careers and university section to for the older students. Tables with computers and spaces for students or staff to use as desks are available on all floors.\n\nA large number of music concerts, art exhibitions and plays take place each year, and pupils regularly receive national recognition for their achievements. The school also has a strong sports department; St Paul's was a founding member of the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 1871 and was pre-eminent in public school boxing, its first team failing to win only two boxing matches against first team boxers from other schools over a period of 25 years; however, boxing was discontinued as a school sport in the 1960s. More recently, the school teams were runners-up in the rugby U15 [[Daily Mail Cup]] in 2005 and in 2007. The school has a strong record in rugby. In 1979, the 1st XV of St Paul's, nicknamed the 'Invincibles' went twelve matches undefeated.<ref name=\"stpaulsschool.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/sport/rugby|title=Rugby \u2013 St Paul\u2019s School|website=St Paul\u2019s School}}</ref> Big rivals for the school are RGS Guildford, King's College School, Dulwich College, St John's Leatherhead, Merchant Taylors', Wellington and Eton.<ref name=\"stpaulsschool.org.uk\"/>\n\n===Operation Winthorpe===\nSt Paul's has a poor record of recent press appearances, partially as a consequence of being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for historic crimes of paedophilia  that it was given its own operational name, Operation Winthorpe. The school has entirely reviewed and majorly revised their safeguarding procedures since.\nA major independent report published in January 2020, revealed 80 complaints against 32 members of staff over a period of six decades, mainly from the 1960s to the 1990s. There were 28 recommendations on how current practice could be improved. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Weale |first1=Sally |title=Review reveals scale of abuse scandal at London private school |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/13/review-reveals-scale-of-abuse-scandal-at-london-private-school |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Sports facilities===\nThe school has numerous sports facilities, and sport plays a major part in the everyday lives of the boys. There is a large sports hall, gymnasium, dojo, fencing salle, 25m swimming pool, 6 fives courts, a rackets court, three squash courts, a fitness centre, a 100m sprint straight, ten tennis courts and a multi use games area (MUGA). There is also a large boathouse and the school has extensive playing fields which consist of 11 football or rugby pitches during the winter months, or seven cricket pitches during the summer months.\n\n===Renewal campaign===\n[[File:St_Paul's_School_courtyard.jpg|alt=|thumb|On the left, the new science block is visible; in the centre is the first phase of the new general teaching block (GTB) building; on the right is visible the old half-demolished GTB and the former main entrance.]]\nThe renewal campaign is the project to rebuild the entire school campus, frequently known as the Masterplan.\n\nThe majority of the current buildings date from the 1960s, and the [[Consortium of Local Authorities Special Programme|CLASP]] technology used in the construction of the buildings has a limited lifespan. Even though over the last few years various buildings (such as the Wathen Hall Music School, Rackets Court and Milton Building) have been added on the campus wherever space was available, the dated buildings represent approximately three quarters of the school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=17060 |title=Background \u2013 Masterplan |accessdate= | publisher=St Paul's School |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023132409/http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=17060 |archivedate=23 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nLocal planning restrictions combined with a lack of available surplus land mean that St Paul's is faced with progressively replacing obsolete buildings with new ones located in the same general area. The plan should eventually result in a large building footprint area increase as well as increasing the amount of staff housing. The number of car parking spaces will be reduced, but there will be much more available room for bicycles.\n\nIn 2007, [[Nicholas Hare Architects]] were appointed to produce detailed designs for the first set of new buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=18196 |title=Architect Announced |accessdate=27 April 2008 |publisher=St Paul's School |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025091415/http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/page.aspx?id=18196 |archivedate=25 October 2007 }}</ref> Late in 2009, [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond Council]] granted St Paul's detailed planning permission, and building started in 2011<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/renewal-campaign |title=Renewal campaign \u2013 St Paul's School |accessdate=12 April 2011 |publisher=St Paul's School |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317105539/http://www.stpaulsschool.org.uk/renewal-campaign |archivedate=17 March 2011  }}</ref>\nThe new science block and courtyard building was completed in 2012 and won a [[Civic Trust Award]] in 2013 and a RIBA London Award in 2015. Two years later, the new Drama Centre and Samuel Pepys Theatre was completed. This building was also designed by [[Nicholas Hare Architects]]. \n\n[[Walters & Cohen|Walters & Cohen Architects]] were appointed to design a new teaching building for the school in 2012. The building, which is arranged in an L-shape in order to connect to buildings on either side on all levels, and enclose the central green courtyard known as Founder\u2019s Court, was completed in 2019. At more than 9,000m\u00b2, it comprises classrooms, the Kayton Library \u2013 named after Desmond Kayton,  an [[List of Old Paulines|Old Pauline]] who fought in World War II \u2013 as well as a dining hall, kitchen, administrative offices, a chapel, hall and social spaces, including a generous multi-purpose Atrium. Elegant vertical piers set out an irregular rhythm and form an integral part of the building's energy efficiency, providing natural ventilation, solar shading and noise attenuation. \n\n==Sporting Successes==\n===Rugby===\nIn 2007, St Paul's recorded their most notable result in the sport when they reached the final of the U15 Daily Mail Cup, the premier rugby union tournament for British secondary schools. The team was coached by Richard Girvan, who is the present-day Surmaster. St Paul's lost the game played at [[Twickenham Stadium]] 20-15 to Lymm High School.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wandsworthguardian.co.uk/sport/1288453.st_pauls_ready_for_twickenham_final/|title=St Paul's ready for Twickenham final |publisher=Wandsworth Guardian}}</ref>\n\n===Rowing===\nThe St Paul's School Boat Club (SPSBC) has won the [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]] at [[Henley Royal Regatta]] six times.\n\nIn 2018 the SPSBC 1st VIII were named \"the best schoolboy crew ever\" at [https://www.hrr.co.uk/inside-lines-sunday-8th-july-2018 Henley Royal Regatta] after a season of unprecedented success. The crew won the 'triple crown' of schoolboy rowing with record breaking wins in the [[Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup#Record times|Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup]] and the [[Schools' Head of the River Race|School's Head of the River]], plus victory at the [[National School's Regatta]] in the [[The National Schools Regatta#Queen Mother Challenge Cup (Ch.8+)|Queen Mother's Challenge Cup]]; they also won the Men's Youth Eights at [[Head of the Charles]] in a record time and recorded the fastest time in history by any schoolboy crew over 2k of 5:36.59 at [[Marlow Regatta]].

Unlike the boys', the girls' school remains in its original position, although it has expanded and constructed new buildings and facilities alongside the old. In 1881, a boys' preparatory school was founded which in 1892 became Colet Court, and in 2016 [[St Paul's Juniors]]. St Paul's Juniors is now on the same site as the main school and most of its pupils are expected to pass into St Paul's School when they reach the age of 13.

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\" with two parents and two siblings - one brother and one sister.\n\nIn his own words:  \n\n''{{quote|\"I used to sneak the banjo out of its case and play it. I would get yelled at because that was about the worst thing I did. I was a very well behaved child from an affluent, upper-middle-class family.

His family also owned a lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him.\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Themes and genres===\n\nMunly's own music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of the musical process. <ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\">{{cite news |last1=Baranauskas |first1=Sarah |title=DBUK |url=http://marqueemag.com/2019/07/dbuk/ |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Marquee Magazine |date=July 1, 2019 |ref=DBUK Marquee}}</ref>\n\nHe also admits that he can be \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation. \n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist. [...] If you're a male and you're from Boulder and you have a guitar, people automatically want to compare you to all that singer-songwriter crap. The papers are like, `Hmmm, the guy warming up?

Until they actually hear me, that is.\"'' - Interview with [[Westword]] (1995) <ref name=\"A Munly Man\">{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Brad |title=A Munly Man |url=https://www.westword.com/music/a-munly-man-5055649 |accessdate=26 March 2020 |work=Westword |date=October 18, 1995 |ref=A Munly Man}}</ref>}} \n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\n===Slim Cessna's Auto Club===\n\nMunly joined Slim Cessna's Auto Club between 1998 and 1999 after being friends with Slim Cessna for a few years. This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments. The members were: Munly ([[vocals]], [[banjo]], [[guitar]]), Elin Palmer ([[violin]], [[nyckelharpa]], string arrangements), Frieda Stalheim (violin), Rebecca Vera ([[cello]]), Paul Bradley ([[upright bass]]), and Jeff Linsenmaier ([[drums]]). <ref name=\"MM Info\">{{cite web |title=Info |url=https://www.munlymunly.com/info.html |website=munly munly |accessdate=24 March 2020 |ref=MM Info}}</ref> Some members of the band have also contributed backing vocals, though it is not known exactly who.\n\nTheir only album, ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004), has received much critical acclaim.

His real name is Jayson Thompson, but decided to take on his mother's maiden name of 'Munly' instead. He has played a significant role in the development of the \"Denver Sound\", music that mixes elements of [[country music|country]], [[Gothic rock|gothic]], [[Folk music|folk]] and [[gospel music|gospel]]. He is a current member of [[Slim Cessna's Auto Club]], Munly & The Lupercalians, and Denver Broncos UK (DBUK). He was the leader of Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots from 2000 to 2006. \n\n==Early life==\n\n===Childhood & upbringing ===\n\nMunly was born and raised [[Quebec, Canada|Quebec, Canada]] in a \"stereotypical Catholic family\" with two parents and two siblings - one brother and one sister.\n\nIn his own words:  \n\n''{{quote|\"I used to sneak the banjo out of its case and play it.

His family also owned a lakeside summer retreat in Ellsworth, Ohio.\n\n===Interest in hockey===\n\nTaking interest in [[ice hockey]] as a young man in Canada, Munly grew up a [[Montreal Canadiens]] fan.\n\nHe played hockey as a child in Canada and the U.S. before a related injury side-lined him.\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from a hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos. His father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Themes and genres===\n\nMunly's own music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\n===Songwriting===\n\nMunly is the chief songwriter for both his solo endeavors and side projects. It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of the musical process. <ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\">{{cite news |last1=Baranauskas |first1=Sarah |title=DBUK |url=http://marqueemag.com/2019/07/dbuk/ |accessdate=4 April 2020 |work=Marquee Magazine |date=July 1, 2019 |ref=DBUK Marquee}}</ref>\n\nHe also admits that he can be \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation. \n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist, but has worked with several musicians that are featured performers on his albums. However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002.

This was during the time that Munly was recording ''Galvanized Yankee'' in New York. Part of the reason he agreed to join was that he liked how the band was operated by existing members. Since then, he has been the band's primary songwriter and shares frontman/vocalist duties with Cessna. ''Always Say Please and Thank You'' (2000) is the first SCAC album that Munly appears on. <ref name=\"Munly Splendid\">{{cite news |last1=McCallon |first1=Brett |title=Jay Munly: The Unsold Self |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020806205555/http://www.splendidezine.com/features/munly/ |accessdate=27 March 2020 |work=Splendid E-Zine |publisher=Wayback Machine |date=July 7, 2002 |ref=Munly Splendid}}</ref>\n\nThe song \"SCAC 101\" on ''Cipher'' (2008) is about how Munly came to join the band.\n\n===Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots===\n\nMunly and The Lee Lewis Harlots were active from 2000 to 2006. They were a six-piece [[alternative country]] band with mostly stringed instruments.
