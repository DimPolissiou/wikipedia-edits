Lovell, ''A Scandalous Life'', p. 1.</ref> daughter of [[Henry Digby (admiral)|Admiral Henry Digby]] and Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke. Jane's father seized the Spanish treasure ship ''Santa Br\u00edgida'' in the [[action of 16 October 1799]] and his share of the [[prize money]] established the family fortune. Holkham Hall was the family seat of her maternal grandfather [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke]] and in 1815 her father inherited and settled in [[Minterne Magna|Minterne House and estate]], [[Dorset]].\n\n=== Marriages, scandal, and affairs ===\nConsidered promiscuous for her times, Digby was first married to [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Edward Law, 2nd Baron Ellenborough]] (later Earl of Ellenborough), who became Governor General of India, on 15 October 1824. They had one son, Arthur Dudley Law (15 February 1828 \u2013 1 February 1830), who died in infancy.\n\nAfter successive affairs with her maternal cousin Colonel George Anson and [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]], she was divorced from Lord Ellenborough in 1830 by an act of Parliament. This caused considerable scandal at the time. Digby had two children with Felix; Mathilde \"Didi\" (born 12 November 1829 [[Basel]], Switzerland and raised by Felix's sister) and Felix (born December 1830 Paris, France) who died just a few weeks after his birth. The affair with Felix ended shortly after the death of their son.\n\nShe then moved on to Germany and became the lover of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. In Munich, she met Baron Karl von Venningen (6 January 1806 \u2013 10 June 1874). They married in November 1833 and had a son, Heribert (27 January 1833 [[Palermo]], Italy \u2013 1885 [[Munich]], Germany), and a daughter, Bertha (4 September 1834 [[Mannheim]], Germany \u2013 22 September 1907).\n\nIn 1838, Digby found a new lover in the Greek Count Spyridon Theotokis (born 1805). Venningen found out and challenged Theotokis to a duel, in which the latter was wounded. Venningen generously released Digby from their marriage and took care of their children.

Lovell, ''A Scandalous Life'', p. 1.</ref> daughter of [[Henry Digby (admiral)|Admiral Henry Digby]] and Lady Jane Elizabeth Coke. Jane's father seized the Spanish treasure ship ''Santa Br\u00edgida'' in the [[action of 16 October 1799]] and his share of the [[prize money]] established the family fortune. Holkham Hall was the family seat of her maternal grandfather [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke]] and in 1815 her father inherited and settled in [[Minterne Magna|Minterne House and estate]], [[Dorset]].\n\n=== Marriages, scandal, and affairs ===\nConsidered promiscuous for her times, Digby was first married to [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Edward Law, 2nd Baron Ellenborough]] (later Earl of Ellenborough), who became Governor General of India, on 15 October 1824. They had one son, Arthur Dudley Law (15 February 1828 \u2013 1 February 1830), who died in infancy.\n\nAfter successive affairs with her maternal cousin Colonel George Anson and [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]], she was divorced from Lord Ellenborough in 1830 by an act of Parliament. This caused considerable scandal at the time. Digby had two children with Felix; Mathilde \"Didi\" (born 12 November 1829 [[Basel]], Switzerland and raised by Felix's sister) and Felix (born December 1830 Paris, France) who died just a few weeks after his birth. The affair with Felix ended shortly after the death of their son.\n\nShe then moved on to Germany and became the lover of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. In Munich, she met Baron Karl von Venningen (6 January 1806 \u2013 10 June 1874). They married in November 1833 and had a son, Heribert (27 January 1833 [[Palermo]], Italy \u2013 1885 [[Munich]], Germany), and a daughter, Bertha (4 September 1834 [[Mannheim]], Germany \u2013 22 September 1907).\n\nIn 1838, Digby found a new lover in the Greek Count Spyridon Theotokis (born 1805). Venningen found out and challenged Theotokis to a duel, in which the latter was wounded. Venningen generously released Digby from their marriage and took care of their children. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. \n\nThough she was not legally divorced from Venningen until 1842, Digby converted to the Greek Orthodox faith and married Theotokis in [[Marseille]], France in 1841. The couple moved to Greece with their son Leonidas (21 March 1840 [[Paris]], France \u2013 1846 [[Athens]], Greece). In 1846, after their son's fatal fall off a balcony, Theotokis and Digby divorced. Greece's King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] became her next lover.\n\nSubsequently came an affair with a hero of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the Thessalian general [[Christodoulos Chatzipetros]],<ref>[ \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2: \u00ab\u0397 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u00bb (1834\u20131934), \u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb. 46 \u2013 47, \u03b3\u0384 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7, \u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, 1983.]</ref> acting as 'queen' of his army, living in caves, riding horses and hunting in the mountains.

On [[November 2]], [[1885]] king [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan I]] declared war to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] and on the same day, the Royal Serbian Army started an attack on the Bulgarian Army in an attempt to quickly reach [[Sofia]] and capture Bulgaria in a situation where Serbia will be able to dictate all terms after the war including territorial changes. King Milan I thought that Bulgaria was too busy preparing a war with the [[Ottoman Empire]], that the western borders would be mainly undefended. Before the attack, the Danube Division of Ni\u0161 Army was taking positions around [[Pirot]] and preparing the action towards Caribrod.\n[[File:Bulgarian unification and Serbo-Bulgarian War.png|thumb|Map of the Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n== Battle ==\nThe Serbian attack started on November 2 when the Royal Serbian Army launched an attack with 3-4 hours of late in for directions towards Sofia and on every direction, there was a single division. The Danube Division was tasked to enter Bulgarian territory, capture Caribrod, come to line [[Kalotina]] \u2013 [[Vishan, Sofia Province|Vishan]] and to take the Dragoman pass. In that way the Danube Division will be able to support the \u0160umadija Division on right side.\n\nEntering into Bulgarian territory Serbian units had great fire resistance from Bulgarian side. Forces of the Danube Division were divided in two columns. Division's right column was composed of 7th Serbian Infantry Regiment that attacked from [[Sre\u0107kovac]] to [[\u017delju\u0161a]] and continuing to Caribrod. Cavalry Brigade (composed of three battalions of 9th Serbian Infantry Regiment) and 19th Guard Battalion with one artillery battery, composing division's left column, passed state border, reached villages [[Viso\u010dki Odorovci|Odorovci]] and [[\u010ciniglavci]], passed Caribrod and attack finished on line [[Stanyantsi]] \u2013 [[Berende Izvor|Izvor]]. Drina Division was left in reserve until the success on [[Sukovo]] Bridge.  \n\nAll Serbian divisions very soon after the start of attack made contact with Bulgarians. Morava Division was stopped about two hours by [[Opalchentsi]] detachment with 60 fighters after passing the border near Daschen pass. Later division stayed on [[Ruj Mountain]] where stayed during night because of fog without any greater success. \u0160umadija Division was stopped by small battalion of captain Andrei Bukureshtliev (4th Plevne Infantry Regiment) on road between [[Planinica|Planinci]] and [[Banjski Dol]]. Danube Division only had approximate success to the planned one. Caribrod Detachment resisted to Danube Division near Caribrod for a bit of time and at 16:30 Serbs captured Caribrod but they couldn't continue to the planned line Kalotina\u2013Vishan. Right column stopped its attack in [[Lukavica]] village where forces stayed during the night. Cavalry Brigade awaited the 19th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery to be sent to their positions. Cavalry Brigade launched attack on 14:00 and on night came to the [[Smilovci]] village where it was waited by bad fortified detachment of Bahchevanov (one infantry battalion, one cavalry squadron and 4 cannons).

On [[November 2]], [[1885]] king [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan I]] declared war to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] and on the same day, the Royal Serbian Army started an attack on the Bulgarian Army in an attempt to quickly reach [[Sofia]] and capture Bulgaria in a situation where Serbia will be able to dictate all terms after the war including territorial changes. King Milan I thought that Bulgaria was too busy preparing a war with the [[Ottoman Empire]], that the western borders would be mainly undefended. Before the attack, the Danube Division of Ni\u0161 Army was taking positions around [[Pirot]] and preparing the action towards Caribrod.\n[[File:Bulgarian unification and Serbo-Bulgarian War.png|thumb|Map of the Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n== Battle ==\nThe Serbian attack started on November 2 when the Royal Serbian Army launched an attack with 3-4 hours of late in for directions towards Sofia and on every direction, there was a single division. The Danube Division was tasked to enter Bulgarian territory, capture Caribrod, come to line [[Kalotina]] \u2013 [[Vishan, Sofia Province|Vishan]] and to take the Dragoman pass. In that way the Danube Division will be able to support the \u0160umadija Division on right side.\n\nEntering into Bulgarian territory Serbian units had great fire resistance from Bulgarian side. Forces of the Danube Division were divided in two columns. Division's right column was composed of 7th Serbian Infantry Regiment that attacked from [[Sre\u0107kovac]] to [[\u017delju\u0161a]] and continuing to Caribrod. Cavalry Brigade (composed of three battalions of 9th Serbian Infantry Regiment) and 19th Guard Battalion with one artillery battery, composing division's left column, passed state border, reached villages [[Viso\u010dki Odorovci|Odorovci]] and [[\u010ciniglavci]], passed Caribrod and attack finished on line [[Stanyantsi]] \u2013 [[Berende Izvor|Izvor]]. Drina Division was left in reserve until the success on [[Sukovo]] Bridge.  \n\nAll Serbian divisions very soon after the start of attack made contact with Bulgarians. Morava Division was stopped about two hours by [[Opalchentsi]] detachment with 60 fighters after passing the border near Daschen pass. Later division stayed on [[Ruj Mountain]] where stayed during night because of fog without any greater success. \u0160umadija Division was stopped by small battalion of captain Andrei Bukureshtliev (4th Plevne Infantry Regiment) on road between [[Planinica|Planinci]] and [[Banjski Dol]]. Danube Division only had approximate success to the planned one. Caribrod Detachment resisted to Danube Division near Caribrod for a bit of time and at 16:30 Serbs captured Caribrod but they couldn't continue to the planned line Kalotina\u2013Vishan. Right column stopped its attack in [[Lukavica]] village where forces stayed during the night. Cavalry Brigade awaited the 19th Infantry Regiment and an artillery battery to be sent to their positions. Cavalry Brigade launched attack on 14:00 and on night came to the [[Smilovci]] village where it was waited by bad fortified detachment of Bahchevanov (one infantry battalion, one cavalry squadron and 4 cannons). In the night that detachment together with Caribrod Detachment retreated to Stanyantsi village.\n\nThe battle was concluded without any major Bulgarian casualties and also without great territorial success as the Royal Serbian Army was only able to advance 5 kilometres into Bulgarian territory.\n\n== Sources ==\n* [http://www.slovo.bg/showwork.php3?AuID=101&WorkID=4482&Level=3 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0442\u043e\u043c 1, \u041a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430 \u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u2013 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0438 \u043c\u0438\u0440\u044a\u0442, I. \u041d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044a\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435]\n\n[[Category:Serbo-Bulgarian War]]\n", "name_user": "PeePooPeePoo69", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Battle_of_Caribrod"}
