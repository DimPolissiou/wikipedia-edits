The kunsthalle-style institution typically presents four exhibitions each year, along with concerts, performances, screenings, readings, and lectures\u2014all of which are free and open to the public. \u201cThe Ren\u201d also produces publications in conjunction with many of its exhibitions.\n==History==\n===Early Years===\nThe Renaissance Society was founded in the wake of the [[Armory Show]] of 1913 at the Art Institute, which had travelled to Chicago after its contentious time in New York. Then called the International Exhibition of Modern, the show was met with outrage and incomprehension in New York, leading to a similarly fervent uproar when it traveled to Chicago. In the aftermath, it was clear that the city, and the American populace as a whole, were generally opposed to the post-impressionist, cubist, and futurist art that was presented.\n\nThe Society was founded shortly after in 1915. Member and secretary of the University of Chicago Board of Trustees, James Spencer Dickerson, felt it would be a nice to have particular portrait of poet Robert Browning in Harper Library, but there was no fund for such an acquisition. Consequently, he proposed an organization called \u201cFriends of Art of the University of Chicago\u201d which could provide said funding.<ref name=\"first history\">{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=14}}</ref> On April 20, 1915, ten professors of the university convened at the Quadrangle Club in an exploratory meeting; and subsequently, a larger meeting was held on June 3 in Harper Assembly Hall of Cobb Hall to garner broader support for this organization.<ref name=\"first history\" /> There, \u201ca committee of five [\u2026] chaired by J. Laurence Laughlin, professor and head of the Department of Political Economy, was appointed to consider the organization of the art society and draft a constitution.\u201d<ref name=\"first history\" /> The president of the University approved and worked to assist in the establishment of the society. However, it was not until April 24, 1916 that the next formal meeting was held in the Classics Building.<ref name=\"first history\" /> Twelve women and fourteen men voted to accept the constitution that was drafted by the committee. They then elected a president and an all-male executive committee. A further three women were added as vice presidents to rectify the gender imbalance.\n\nThe constitution ensured that the society would not become a collecting museum by stipulating that \u201call acquisitions of The Society, except money, shall become the property of the University of Chicago.\u201d<ref name=\"first history\" /> The document stated the mission:\n:It shall be the aim of The Society to provide at the University such material means and personal influences as will contribute to the cultivation of the arts, and the enrichment of the life of the community.\nThe society would organize exhibitions, encourage gifts of art to the university, sponsor lectures on the arts, issue publications, and use other such means to accomplish its mission. Programming elements were open to the public (as is still the case now) in order to enrich the life of the community and the university.\n\n===Art in the First Decade===\nThe impetus behind the cultural renaissance in Chicago was the desire to improve society. For wealthy patrons, this aspiration drove philanthropy and the establishment of Chicago\u2019s most preeminent cultural and educational institutions. Similarly, the academics of The Renaissance Society wished to use their scholarly status to lead their community. Rather than take upon the duty of art education as non-professionals, they turned outward in the name of public service. The pervasive sense of idealism that underlies the Society undoubtedly excluded educating its community about modernism in its first decade of programming. The original tenets included a sense of morality to \u201cuplift humanity, a prescription that honored the art of the past, particularly that of the Renaissance, as well as the rigid aesthetic dictates of academic realism.\u201d<ref name=\"first history16\">{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=16}}</ref> To the academics, the modernists were radical in promoting self-expression in art-making rather. Thus, the Society attacked the artists of the early twentieth century avant-garde, \u201cbringing to the University some of the most beautiful things in the world.\u201d<ref name=\"first history16\" />\n\n===The Transition===\nIn 1927, Agnes C. Gale was elected president\u2014the first woman and non-academic to hold this post. In the first of a five annual exhibitions of modern French paintings, Gale included pieces by [[Henri Matisse]], [[Pablo Picasso]], and [[Paul Gauguin]], who were originally maligned by the Armory Show. The shows proved popular, marked by a jump in membership during Gale\u2019s brief tenure. The Renaissance Society recruited the important photographer [[Eva Watson-Sch\u00fctze]] in the late 1920s to be president of the organization. She was elected in 1929 to become the Society\u2019s first full-time staff person as exhibition director. Sch\u00fctze made clear her progressive intent: \u201cPart of the program of The Renaissance Society is to stimulate study of the art of the present time, the new renaissance.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=22}}</ref>\n\n===The 1930s===\nThroughout the 1920s, modernism was scarce in the city. Only a handful of exhibitions and few commercial galleries displayed avant-garde works. In the dearth of progressive leadership, The Arts Club, under the direction of Rue Winterbotham Carpenter, became the Midwest center for the examination of twentieth century art. Sch\u00fctze knew Carpenter and The Renaissance Society began to exchange programs with The Arts Club. In the 1930-31 season, the Club brought [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]] to Chicago to screen his film ''Le Ballet Mecanique'' and subsequently lent it to the Society.\n\nUnder Sch\u00fctze, The Renaissance Society expanded its curatorial programming into other art forms. The 1930 exhibition of modern American architecture was a pioneering example of a visual art institution investigating this art form. And In 1933, two film series were presented on campus: \u201cMovies of Today and Yesterday\u201d included D.W. Griffith\u2019s ''Birth of a Nation'' and ''The Brahms Symphony'', and \u201cforeign talking motion pictures\u201d included four works by French director [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]]. The Society\u2019s events also explored dance and music.\n\nIn the last years of Sch\u00fctze\u2019s leadership, curtailed by her failing health, the Society introduced Chicago\u2019s audience to avant-garde art that was seldom or never before seen before in the United States. Among the most groundbreaking exhibitions at The Renaissance Society, a solo show presenting Alexander Calder\u2019s early mobiles was his first in the country. However, it was James Johnson Sweeney who presented the Society\u2019s boldest curatorial statements in his exhibition ''A Selection of Works by Twentieth-Century Artists''. Non-representational works by seminal abstractionists\u2014[[Jean Arp]], [[Constantin Brancusi]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Jean Helion]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Joan Mir\u00f3]], [[Piet Mondrian]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]\u2014were included in the comprehensive catalog of which much material had never before been exhibited in the country. Building on the founding principles of the Society, Sch\u00fctze initated a publishing program to expand the Society\u2019s role as \u201can independent, experimental laboratory for search of legitimate meaning in art.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of The Renaissance Society: The First Seventy-Five Years |date=1994 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=33}}</ref>\n\nIn her ultimate act as president of the Society, Sch\u00fctze organized the 1936 exhibition of L\u00e9ger, which she believed to be the institution's crowning achievement. The massive undertaking almost did not happen. In a feat of miscommunication, L\u00e9ger had sent a costly, unauthorized, and uninsured shipment of works with collect on delivery to the Society in March 1935.<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=28}}</ref> Though Sweeney had met with L\u00e9ger in Paris the summer prior and explained that Sch\u00fctze had decided to hold a show for him, the exhibition date had not been set. Eva Watson Sch\u00fctze died before the plans were complete. Eventually, the show would open at The Renaissance Society and then travel to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and the [[Milwaukee Art Institute]], before L\u00e9ger was regarded as one of the most important abstractionists of his generation. Included in the exhibition was The City\u2014widely regarded as a revolutionary work from his mature period.\n\nAfter Sch\u00fctze\u2019s tenure, the Renaissance Society continued to pioneer groundbreaking exhibitions in her footsteps. In the 1936-37 season, ''Paintings and Sculpture by American Negro Artists'' became the Society\u2019s first show to prominently feature African American artists. The next season, they showcased works by refugees from Europe in ''Paintings by [[Josef Albers]] and E. Misztrik de Monda''. In 1939, [[Laszlo Moholy-Nagy]], who had just moved to Chicago to direct The New Bauhaus (renamed the School of Design in Chicago, and then eventually the [[IIT Institute of Design]]), exhibited for the first time in America in the month-long show ''Paintings by Laszlo Moholy-Nagy''. A decade later, another great [[Bauhaus]] figure, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, who was then teaching at the Illinois Institute of Technology, was shown in an architecture exhibition at the Society. The following year, he personally installed an exhibition of ''Theo van Doesburg: Paintings, Drawings, Photographs, and Architectural Drawings''.\n\n===The War Years through the 60s===\nThe war years proved to be a prolific period for the Society. From 1941 to 1962, artist Francis Strain Beisel was director of the Renaissance Society, which became the \u201cpreeminent site for exhibitions in the Chicago area in the 1940s and 1950s.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=60}}</ref>  In 1939, the Society held the ''Exhibition of Hand-Woven Textiles'' produced by the Federal Art Project of Milwaukee; in 1940, ''Book Illustrations by Modern American Artists''; and three exhibitions in 1941: ''Fifteen American Sculptors and Contemporary American Lithographers'', the conceptually pioneering show of ''American Humor: Cartoons from the Late Nineteenth Century to the Present'', and ''Works by Chicago Artists Loaned by Chicago Collectors''. In October 1944, a second exhibition of African-American artists was held, organized out of the Hampton Institute and featured several artists then serving in the military. A significant show during this period was ''War Art'', which opened April 12, 1942. Locally organized, the exhibition particularly drew upon the School of Design\u2019s interest in practical art that responded to the present emergency.\n\nAfter the war, the Society did not exhibit New York artists who emerged in the late 1940s; instead, it showed [[Ben Shahn]] and [[I. Rice Pereira]]. The Society even ignored [[Pollock]] and [[de Kooning]] (who were already recognized as innovators) in its 1955 ''Eleven Pioneers of the Twentieth Century'', opting instead to include [[William Glackens]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Robert Henri]], [[John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. It was not until 1964 that [[Richard Lippold]] finally became the first New York artist to have a post-war solo exhibition at the Renaissance Society.\n\nLectures often accompanied exhibitions. Most notably in 1957, [[Marc Chagall]] gave his only American lecture. That same year, [[Leonard Bernstein]], in his newly minted stardom, did not appear at his talk until the very last moment to a large crowd. The Society invited [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\u2014who was incredibly expensive\u2014and Arnold Schoenberg among many others.\n\n===Conceptual Art===\n[[File:Renaissance Society.jpg.jpg|alt=exhibition at the Renaissance Society|thumb|308x308px|Felix Gonzalez-Torrez Exhibition at the Renaissance Society]]\n\tSusanne Ghez assumed role of Director in 1974. During her tenure, the Renaissance Society shifted its focus to \u201cConceptual Art.\u201d Beginning with its exhibition [[Joseph Kosuth]] in early 1976, the Society engaged in a discussion with contemporary art that rejected \u201ctraditional pictorial and sculptural definitions.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=106}}</ref>  In 1978, [[Lawrence Weiner]]\u2019s eponymous show contrasted Kosuth\u2019s approach by using language itself as material. Other artists exhibited during this period include Daniel Buren and John Knight.\n\nExhibitions at the Renaissance Society in the 90s shifted from the larger institutional critique that dominated the 70s and 80s to more inward contemplation through site-specificity. In 1990, both [[Michael Asher]] and [[Niele Toroni]] exhibited in solo shows. The following year, [[Jessica Stockholder]]Jessica Stockholder opened the season with ''Skin Toned Garden Mapping''. Some significant artists who showed at the Renaissance Society in the 1990s include [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]] (1994), [[Kara Walker]] (1997), [[Kerry James Marshall ]](1998), and [[Raymond Pettibon]] (1998).\n\nThe Renaissance Society inaugurated the 21st century with ''[[Thomas Hirschhorn]]: World Airport''. In 2008, ''Black Is, Black Ain\u2019t'' explored a shift in the rhetoric of race and identity, exhibiting 26 black and non-black artists. After 40 years as Executive Director and Chief Curator of the Renaissance Society, Ghez ended her tenure in 2013 her final show ''[[William Pope.L]]: Forlesen''. Pope.L\u2019s new installation explored the demarcation of differences politically, economically, socially, and culturally. This show underscored Ghez\u2019s commitment to refocusing the Society around Sch\u00fctze\u2019s mission in becoming a laboratory for new art and ideas. Under her leadership the Renaissance Society developed an international distinction for its ground-breaking curatorial programming.\n\n===Today at the Ren===\nSolveig \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 assumed Ghez\u2019s position as Director of the Society in 2013. Previously at Bergen Kunsthall Norway, \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 has since overseen the curatorial efforts at the Society. With a renewed focus on commissioning new works, allowing artists to a have a space where they are able to create works not possible in more traditional art spaces, the Renaissance Society has been programming exhibitions, lectures, performances, and other formats.\n\nIn 2015, the Society celebrated its centennial. Matthias Poledna removed the overhead truss grid that had defined the gallery space, giving future artists more spatial freedom than in previous decades.\n\nHamza Walker was Associate Curator and Director of Education from 1994 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissancesociety.org/news/18/hamza-walker-appointed-executive-director-of-laxart/|title=Hamza Walker Appointed Executive Director of LAXART - News - The Renaissance Society|first=The Renaissance|last=Society|website=www.renaissancesociety.org}}</ref> He has been called by [[The New York Times]] one of the \"seven most influential curators in the country\", as well as \"one of the museum world's most talented essayists.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=The Curators: Discerning and Influential|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/arts/the-curators-discerning-and-influential.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 May 2001}}</ref>  Walker won the [[Ordway Prize]] in 2010, in recognition of his innovative curatorial work and his wide-ranging thinking and writing about contemporary art.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ise|first=Claudine|title=HAMZA WALKER WINS $100,000 ORDWAY PRIZE|url=http://badatsports.com/2010/hamza-walker-wins-100000-ordway-prize/|work=Bad at Sports|publisher=Bad at Sports|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, the Renaissance Society announced a $1 million gift from the Mansueto Foundation in support of its publications program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagobusiness.com/nonprofits-philanthropy/hyde-park-museum-gets-its-biggest-gift-ever-morningstar-founder|title=Hyde Park museum gets its biggest gift ever, from Morningstar founder|date=31 January 2019|website=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref> This gift secures the institution's publishing activities for 10 years and marks the largest single commitment in its history.\n\nIn April 2020 it was announced that [[Myriam Ben Salah]] would become the next executive director and chief curator of the Renaissance Society.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://renaissancesociety.org/news/46/announcing-myriam-ben-salah-as-executive-director-and-chief-curator/|title=ANNOUNCING MYRIAM BEN SALAH AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF CURATOR|work=Renaissance Society|access-date=2020-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Separation from the University==\n\tHaving been established by professors as a part of the University of Chicago community, the Renaissance Society has always had its roots in the academic community. Formally, the institution is The Renaissance Society \u2018at\u2019 the University of Chicago, highlighting its unique autonomy as a separate entity. In 1974, after operating under deficit debts financed by the University, the Renaissance Society was cut off financially. The University erased its debt and let the Society remain in the space rent-free; however, all financial help and benefits were rescinded. As a result, the Society became an independent non-collecting museum located on the campus.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.renaissancesociety.org/}}\n\n{{UChicago}}\n{{Museums in Chicago}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Renaissance Society, The}}\n[[Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago]]\n[[Category:University museums in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1915]]\n[[Category:1915 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the Philadelphia-based Academic Society|The Renaissance Society of America}}\n{{Infobox museum\n| name = The Renaissance Society at the University of Chicago\n| logo = \n| image = Renaissance Society.jpg\n| imagesize = 300\n| map_type = \n| map_caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|41.7892|-87.6010|display=inline}}\n| former_name = \n| established = 1915\n| dissolved = \n| location = 5811 S.

A significant show during this period was ''War Art'', which opened April 12, 1942. Locally organized, the exhibition particularly drew upon the School of Design\u2019s interest in practical art that responded to the present emergency.\n\nAfter the war, the Society did not exhibit New York artists who emerged in the late 1940s; instead, it showed [[Ben Shahn]] and [[I. Rice Pereira]]. The Society even ignored [[Pollock]] and [[de Kooning]] (who were already recognized as innovators) in its 1955 ''Eleven Pioneers of the Twentieth Century'', opting instead to include [[William Glackens]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Robert Henri]], [[John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. It was not until 1964 that [[Richard Lippold]] finally became the first New York artist to have a post-war solo exhibition at the Renaissance Society.\n\nLectures often accompanied exhibitions. Most notably in 1957, [[Marc Chagall]] gave his only American lecture. That same year, [[Leonard Bernstein]], in his newly minted stardom, did not appear at his talk until the very last moment to a large crowd. The Society invited [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]\u2014who was incredibly expensive\u2014and Arnold Schoenberg among many others.\n\n===Conceptual Art===\n[[File:Renaissance Society.jpg.jpg|alt=exhibition at the Renaissance Society|thumb|308x308px|Felix Gonzalez-Torrez Exhibition at the Renaissance Society]]\n\tSusanne Ghez assumed role of Director in 1974. During her tenure, the Renaissance Society shifted its focus to \u201cConceptual Art.\u201d Beginning with its exhibition [[Joseph Kosuth]] in early 1976, the Society engaged in a discussion with contemporary art that rejected \u201ctraditional pictorial and sculptural definitions.\u201d<ref>{{cite book |title=Centennial: A History of The Renaissance Society, 1915-2015 |date=2015 |publisher=The Renaissance Society |pages=106}}</ref>  In 1978, [[Lawrence Weiner]]\u2019s eponymous show contrasted Kosuth\u2019s approach by using language itself as material. Other artists exhibited during this period include Daniel Buren and John Knight.\n\nExhibitions at the Renaissance Society in the 90s shifted from the larger institutional critique that dominated the 70s and 80s to more inward contemplation through site-specificity. In 1990, both [[Michael Asher]] and [[Niele Toroni]] exhibited in solo shows. The following year, Jessica Stockholder opened the season with ''Skin Toned Garden Mapping''. Some significant artists who showed at the Renaissance Society in the 1990s include [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]] (1994), [[Kara Walker]] (1997), [[Kerry James Marshall ]](1998), and [[Raymond Pettibon]] (1998).\n\nThe Renaissance Society inaugurated the 21st century with ''[[Thomas Hirschhorn]]: World Airport''. In 2008, ''Black Is, Black Ain\u2019t'' explored a shift in the rhetoric of race and identity, exhibiting 26 black and non-black artists. After 40 years as Executive Director and Chief Curator of the Renaissance Society, Ghez ended her tenure in 2013 her final show ''[[William Pope.L]]: Forlesen''. Pope.L\u2019s new installation explored the demarcation of differences politically, economically, socially, and culturally. This show underscored Ghez\u2019s commitment to refocusing the Society around Sch\u00fctze\u2019s mission in becoming a laboratory for new art and ideas. Under her leadership the Renaissance Society developed an international distinction for its ground-breaking curatorial programming.\n\n===Today at the Ren===\nSolveig \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 assumed Ghez\u2019s position as Director of the Society in 2013. Previously at Bergen Kunsthall Norway, \u00d8vsteb\u00f8 has since overseen the curatorial efforts at the Society. With a renewed focus on commissioning new works, allowing artists to a have a space where they are able to create works not possible in more traditional art spaces, the Renaissance Society has been programming exhibitions, lectures, performances, and other formats.\n\nIn 2015, the Society celebrated its centennial. Matthias Poledna removed the overhead truss grid that had defined the gallery space, giving future artists more spatial freedom than in previous decades.\n\nHamza Walker was Associate Curator and Director of Education from 1994 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissancesociety.org/news/18/hamza-walker-appointed-executive-director-of-laxart/|title=Hamza Walker Appointed Executive Director of LAXART - News - The Renaissance Society|first=The Renaissance|last=Society|website=www.renaissancesociety.org}}</ref> He has been called by [[The New York Times]] one of the \"seven most influential curators in the country\", as well as \"one of the museum world's most talented essayists.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Gates|first=Anita|title=The Curators: Discerning and Influential|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/02/arts/the-curators-discerning-and-influential.html?pagewanted=2&src=pm|accessdate=17 July 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 May 2001}}</ref>  Walker won the [[Ordway Prize]] in 2010, in recognition of his innovative curatorial work and his wide-ranging thinking and writing about contemporary art.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ise|first=Claudine|title=HAMZA WALKER WINS $100,000 ORDWAY PRIZE|url=http://badatsports.com/2010/hamza-walker-wins-100000-ordway-prize/|work=Bad at Sports|publisher=Bad at Sports|accessdate=17 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, the Renaissance Society announced a $1 million gift from the Mansueto Foundation in support of its publications program.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagobusiness.com/nonprofits-philanthropy/hyde-park-museum-gets-its-biggest-gift-ever-morningstar-founder|title=Hyde Park museum gets its biggest gift ever, from Morningstar founder|date=31 January 2019|website=Crain's Chicago Business}}</ref> This gift secures the institution's publishing activities for 10 years and marks the largest single commitment in its history.\n\nIn April 2020 it was announced that [[Myriam Ben Salah]] would become the next executive director and chief curator of the Renaissance Society.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=https://renaissancesociety.org/news/46/announcing-myriam-ben-salah-as-executive-director-and-chief-curator/|title=ANNOUNCING MYRIAM BEN SALAH AS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF CURATOR|work=Renaissance Society|access-date=2020-04-22|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Separation from the University==\n\tHaving been established by professors as a part of the University of Chicago community, the Renaissance Society has always had its roots in the academic community. Formally, the institution is The Renaissance Society \u2018at\u2019 the University of Chicago, highlighting its unique autonomy as a separate entity. In 1974, after operating under deficit debts financed by the University, the Renaissance Society was cut off financially. The University erased its debt and let the Society remain in the space rent-free; however, all financial help and benefits were rescinded. As a result, the Society became an independent non-collecting museum located on the campus.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{official website|http://www.renaissancesociety.org/}}\n\n{{UChicago}}\n{{Museums in Chicago}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Renaissance Society, The}}\n[[Category:Contemporary art galleries in the United States]]\n[[Category:University of Chicago]]\n[[Category:University museums in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Art museums and galleries in Chicago]]\n[[Category:Art museums established in 1915]]\n[[Category:1915 establishments in Illinois]]\n", "name_user": "Ucartist", "label": "safe", "comment": "Linked page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_Society"}

Almost the full cast of ''DS9'' portrays human characters, without their alien costumes.\n\nThe stress of [[Dominion War|the war]] is getting to Benjamin Sisko and his dream-like visions recur during a visit from his father. Inside Sisko's mind, reality and fantasy mix into a vision set in mid-20th century New York City. The episode was novelized by [[Steven Barnes]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/farbeyondstars0000barn|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: Far Beyond the Stars|first=Steven|last=Barnes|authorlink=Steven Barnes|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=1998|isbn=978-0671024307|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nDistraught by the death of a close friend in the [[Dominion War]], Captain [[Benjamin Sisko]] speaks with his father about leaving [[Starfleet]], but as the two talk, Sisko is distracted by a vision of a man dressed in 20th-century clothes. When Sisko's visions become more frequent and pervasive, [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] examines him, and finds similar brain activity to a prior episode of visions Sisko experienced (in the episode \"[[Rapture (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rapture]]\").\n\nSuddenly, Sisko is taken over by his vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s [[New York City]]. Russell writes for the science fiction magazine ''Incredible Tales'' and most of the people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. He runs into his coworker Albert Macklin ([[Colm Meaney]]/[[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|O'Brien]]) and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff ([[Armin Shimerman]]/[[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]]) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]/[[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K. C. Hunter ([[Nana Visitor]]/[[Kira Nerys|Kira]]) and Julius Eaton ([[Alexander Siddig]]/[[Julian Bashir|Bashir)]] banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse ([[J. G. Hertzler]]/[[Martok]]) arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay \"sleep late\" that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell objects, realizing that he will be excluded too, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.\n\nLeaving the office that night, a gust of wind takes Russell's drawing, which lands at the feet of two police officers, Burt Ryan ([[Marc Alaimo]]/[[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]) and Kevin Mulkahey ([[Jeffrey Combs]]/Weyoun). The officers hassle and question Russell but let him go with a \"warning\". Russell then encounters a preacher ([[Brock Peters]]/[[Joseph Sisko]]) who seems to be speaking directly to him, imploring him to \"write those words\" in the name of \"the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]]\". He goes home and begins to write.\n\nSome time later, he finishes his story, \"Deep Space Nine\", about a black captain of a space station. He shows it to his girlfriend Cassie ([[Penny Johnson Jerald]]/[[Kasidy Yates]]), who instead wants the two of them to buy the diner where she works, doubting his ability to earn a good living as a writer. A local hustler, Jimmy ([[Cirroc Lofton]]/[[Jake Sisko]]), laughs at his idea of \"colored people on the Moon\". At the magazine, the entire staff loves his story, especially Pabst's new secretary Darlene Kursky ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]/[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]]). Pabst refuses to print it and Russell refuses to change his story.\n\nInstead of rewriting the story for Pabst, Russell decides to write six sequels to his story, angering Pabst, until Macklin devises a compromise: Russell's story will be a dream. Russell insists the dreamer also be black, to which Pabst consents. While Russell and Cassie are out celebrating, they hear gunshots and find that Jimmy has been shot and killed by Officers Ryan and Mulkahey, ostensibly for trying to break into a car. When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.\n\nWeeks later, on his first day back at the office, Benny is excited to see his story in print. Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs the writers that the whole month's run of the magazine has been pulped; the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision and wonders if somewhere, far beyond the stars, Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nZicree's original pitch for the episode featured [[Jake Sisko]] as the main character, and did not deal directly with racial issues. Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]], and the O'Brien character on [[Isaac Asimov]].{{sfn|Nazzaro|1998|pages=42\u201346}} This story was combined with ideas that story editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] had written for a script called \"Cold and Distant Stars\", a very early draft for the Season Three two-part episode \"[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]\". The story, suggested by Wolfe, featured Sisko as a contemporary homeless man who believes he is a star base captain, but who is diagnosed as schizophrenic and drugged to suppress his visions. At that time, producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] had rejected the hallucinatory element in favor of a time-travel story, because it felt too much like a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=196}}{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} Researcher Allen Kwan wrote that the episode may have originally featured a more positive ending, where instead of showing Benny being institutionalized, it would show him on a set, producing an episode of ''Deep Space Nine''. Supposedly, that ending was not used for fears of breaking the continuity of the franchise.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Allen|date=February 1, 2007|title=Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59-70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229190619/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2020|access-date=29 February 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nA large amount of work was put into making their version of New York City as authentic to reality as possible. The production crew included several references to past Star Trek series and episodes- as well as to Deep Space Nine itself. Inside the office, memos from Pabst can be seen. For instance, one is addressed to Rossoff, complaining to him that \"no one would believe that a cheerleader could kill vampires\", a reference to Shimmerman's work on [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nBrooks, who both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel, went to great lengths to ensure period authenticity, even during post-production. Brooks went to the music spotting session, and had long discussions about things such as what music Russel would dance to, and the style of the scoring. Inequality was also portrayed through design; the ambulance which carries Benny was portrayed as dirty and outdated because, as Brooks notes \"that's what they would have sent\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n=== Filming and makeup ===\n[[File:QTXP 20121019 Destination Star Trek London MG 2144.jpg|alt=Avery Brooks|left|thumb|Avery Brooks both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel]]The episode was directed by Avery Brooks, who also played Sisko/Russel. He was chosen by the production staff because they wanted a director who had experienced racism.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} The scene where Russel collapses and has a breakdown was perhaps more realistic then most fans had realized. Once the assistant director called cut, Brooks did not stop. Brooks was so into the part that, as Lou Race remarked, even if he had stayed for half an hour, Brooks would have \"kept on\".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=|title=What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|date=May 13, 2019|people=|first=|type=Motion picture|language=|publisher=[[Shout! Factory]]|location=|time=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|format=|ref=|id=|oclc=|quote=|medium=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the few examples of [[Special effect|special effects]] in the episode was the shot where Russell's drawing of the station falls out of his hand, and lands near the foot of a racist police officer. The drawing was attached to a helium balloon which was connected to some [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] on a fishing line. Then, it had to be \"yanked\" towards the foot of the police officer, while making sure it would land in the right direction for the camera.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nMakeup was unusually easy for this episode; since most characters appeared as human, only minimal makeup was required. Shimmerman said that wearing a mask had been his mechanism for support, it recused him from being nervous about how he looked on camera. Appearing without one, then, was a \"very bizarre\" experience. Even though J.G Hertzler (Martok/Ritterhouse) had never appeared on ''Deep Space Nine'' out of makeup, he enjoyed the role. Hertzler has a drawing hobby, so when Ritterhouse was seen drawing in the episode, Hertzler was really drawing the cast.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[The A.V.

Parallels, Kwan claimed, can be drawn from Pabst, the racist magazine editor, to the producers of the Star Trek franchise. Kwan maintains that, like Pabst, the franchise as a whole tends to ignore actual diversity, instead opting to portray a future with only a single cultural and racial norm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{cite magazine|url=http://titanmagazines.com/t/star-trek/us/40/|title=Going Far Beyond the Stars|first=Joe|last=Nazzaro|work=[[Star Trek Magazine]]|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|location=[[London]]|date=June 1998|pages=42\u201346|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Space-Nine-Companion-Star/dp/0671501062|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=2000|doi=|edition=1st|isbn=978-0671501068|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine#Far Beyond the Stars .5B6.13.5D|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0708538}}\n* {{tv.com episode|star-trek-deep-space-nine/far-beyond-the-stars-20963}}\n{{Memoryalpha|Far Beyond the Stars (episode)|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* [http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars \"Far Beyond the Stars\"] at [http://memory-beta.wikia.com Memory Beta]\n{{StarTrek.com link|DS9|71932|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n\n{{Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|6}}\n\n[[Category:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 6) episodes]]\n[[Category:1998 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1953]]\n[[Category:Works about writers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2013}}\n{{Infobox television episode\n| title = Far Beyond the Stars\n| image =\n| caption =\n| series = [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]\n| season = 6\n| episode = 13\n| production = 538\n| airdate = {{Start date|1998|02|11}}\n| story = [[Marc Scott Zicree]]\n| teleplay = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Ira Steven Behr]]\n* [[Hans Beimler (screenwriter)|Hans Beimler]]\n}}\n| director = [[Avery Brooks]]\n| photographer = Jonathan West\n| music = [[Dennis McCarthy (composer)|Dennis McCarthy]]\n| guests = \n* [[Brock Peters]] as Preacher / [[Joseph Sisko]]\n* [[Jeffrey Combs]] as Kevin Mulkahey / Weyoun\n* [[Marc Alaimo]] as Burt Ryan / [[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]\n* [[J.

When Sisko's visions become more frequent and pervasive, [[Julian Bashir|Dr. Bashir]] examines him, and finds similar brain activity to a prior episode of visions Sisko experienced (in the episode \"[[Rapture (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Rapture]]\").\n\nSuddenly, Sisko is taken over by his vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s [[New York City]]. Russell writes for the science fiction magazine ''Incredible Tales'' and most of the people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. He runs into his coworker Albert Macklin ([[Colm Meaney]]/[[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|O'Brien]]) and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff ([[Armin Shimerman]]/[[Quark (Star Trek)|Quark]]) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst ([[Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois]]/[[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K. C. Hunter ([[Nana Visitor]]/[[Kira Nerys|Kira]]) and Julius Eaton ([[Alexander Siddig]]/[[Julian Bashir|Bashir)]] banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse ([[J. G. Hertzler]]/[[Martok]]) arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay \"sleep late\" that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell objects, realizing that he will be excluded too, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.\n\nLeaving the office that night, a gust of wind takes Russell's drawing, which lands at the feet of two police officers, Burt Ryan ([[Marc Alaimo]]/[[Dukat (Star Trek)|Dukat]]) and Kevin Mulkahey ([[Jeffrey Combs]]/Weyoun). The officers hassle and question Russell but let him go with a \"warning\". Russell then encounters a preacher ([[Brock Peters]]/[[Joseph Sisko]]) who seems to be speaking directly to him, imploring him to \"write those words\" in the name of \"the [[Prophets (Star Trek)|Prophets]]\". He goes home and begins to write.\n\nSome time later, he finishes his story, \"Deep Space Nine\", about a black captain of a space station. He shows it to his girlfriend Cassie ([[Penny Johnson Jerald]]/[[Kasidy Yates]]), who instead wants the two of them to buy the diner where she works, doubting his ability to earn a good living as a writer. A local hustler, Jimmy ([[Cirroc Lofton]]/[[Jake Sisko]]), laughs at his idea of \"colored people on the Moon\". At the magazine, the entire staff loves his story, especially Pabst's new secretary Darlene Kursky ([[Terry Farrell (actress)|Terry Farrell]]/[[Jadzia Dax|Dax]]). Pabst refuses to print it and Russell refuses to change his story.\n\nInstead of rewriting the story for Pabst, Russell decides to write six sequels to his story, angering Pabst, until Macklin devises a compromise: Russell's story will be a dream. Russell insists the dreamer also be black, to which Pabst consents. While Russell and Cassie are out celebrating, they hear gunshots and find that Jimmy has been shot and killed by Officers Ryan and Mulkahey, ostensibly for trying to break into a car. When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.\n\nWeeks later, on his first day back at the office, Benny is excited to see his story in print. Pabst arrives empty-handed and informs the writers that the whole month's run of the magazine has been pulped; the owner wouldn't publish a story featuring a black hero. Pabst tells Benny he is being forced to fire him as well. Benny breaks down; he screams that they cannot destroy his ideas and the future he envisions is real. He collapses to the floor sobbing and is taken away by an ambulance. As he falls unconscious, he looks through the window and, rather than the city, sees stars streaking past. The preacher sits by him and tells him that he is both the dreamer and the dream. Sisko wakes up back on the station. He is deeply moved by his vision and wonders if somewhere, far beyond the stars, Benny Russell is dreaming of Deep Space Nine.\n\n== Production ==\n=== Conception ===\nZicree's original pitch for the episode featured [[Jake Sisko]] as the main character, and did not deal directly with racial issues. Zicree originally patterned the Bashir/Kira characters on [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]], and the O'Brien character on [[Isaac Asimov]].{{sfn|Nazzaro|1998|pages=42\u201346}} This story was combined with ideas that story editor [[Robert Hewitt Wolfe]] had written for a script called \"Cold and Distant Stars\", a very early draft for the Season Three two-part episode \"[[Past Tense (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Past Tense]]\". The story, suggested by Wolfe, featured Sisko as a contemporary homeless man who believes he is a star base captain, but who is diagnosed as schizophrenic and drugged to suppress his visions. At that time, producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] had rejected the hallucinatory element in favor of a time-travel story, because it felt too much like a \"gimmick\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=196}}{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} Researcher Allen Kwan wrote that the episode may have originally featured a more positive ending, where instead of showing Benny being institutionalized, it would show him on a set, producing an episode of ''Deep Space Nine''. Supposedly, that ending was not used for fears of breaking the continuity of the franchise.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kwan|first=Allen|date=February 1, 2007|title=Seeking New Civilizations: Race Normativity in the Star Trek Franchise|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=[[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=59-70|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200229190619/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ad46/28ef202599e8f92911b35c476709eedb8533.pdf|archive-date=29 February 2020|access-date=29 February 2020|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Design ===\nA large amount of work was put into making their version of New York City as authentic to reality as possible. The production crew included several references to past Star Trek series and episodes- as well as to Deep Space Nine itself. Inside the office, memos from Pabst can be seen. For instance, one is addressed to Rossoff, complaining to him that \"no one would believe that a cheerleader could kill vampires\", a reference to Shimmerman's work on [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]].{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nBrooks, who both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel, went to great lengths to ensure period authenticity, even during post-production. Brooks went to the music spotting session, and had long discussions about things such as what music Russel would dance to, and the style of the scoring. Inequality was also portrayed through design; the ambulance which carries Benny was portrayed as dirty and outdated because, as Brooks notes \"that's what they would have sent\".{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n=== Filming and makeup ===\n[[File:QTXP 20121019 Destination Star Trek London MG 2144.jpg|alt=Avery Brooks|left|thumb|Avery Brooks both directed the episode and played Sisko/Russel]]The episode was directed by Avery Brooks, who also played Sisko/Russel. He was chosen by the production staff because they wanted a director who had experienced racism.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}} The scene where Russel collapses and has a breakdown was perhaps more realistic then most fans had realized. Once the assistant director called cut, Brooks did not stop. Brooks was so into the part that, as Lou Race remarked, even if he had stayed for half an hour, Brooks would have \"kept on\".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=|title=What We Left Behind: Looking Back at Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|date=May 13, 2019|people=|first=|type=Motion picture|language=|publisher=[[Shout!

The drawing was attached to a helium balloon which was connected to some [[Monofilament fishing line|monofilament]] on a fishing line. Then, it had to be \"yanked\" towards the foot of the police officer, while making sure it would land in the right direction for the camera.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\nMakeup was unusually easy for this episode; since most characters appeared as human, only minimal makeup was required. Shimmerman said that wearing a mask had been his mechanism for support, it recused him from being nervous about how he looked on camera. Appearing without one, then, was a \"very bizarre\" experience. Even though J.G Hertzler (Martok/Ritterhouse) had never appeared on ''Deep Space Nine'' out of makeup, he enjoyed the role. Hertzler had a drawing hobby, so when Ritterhouse was seen drawing in the episode, Hertzler was really drawing the cast.{{sfn|Erdmann|Block|2000|page=534-537}}\n\n== Reception ==\n[[The A.V. Club]]'s Zach Handlen said that by escaping the \"trap\" of cloaking its concerns in \"pure symbol\" that some other ''Star Trek'' episodes fall into, the episode ends up creating something unique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tv.avclub.com/star-trek-deep-space-nine-far-beyond-the-stars-1798178688|title=Star Trek: Deep Space Nine: \"Far Beyond The Stars\"|last=Handlen|first=Zack|date=November 14, 2013|website=[[The A.V Club]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200214181324/https://tv.avclub.com/star-trek-deep-space-nine-far-beyond-the-stars-1798178688|archive-date=February 14, 2020|access-date=February 14, 2020}}</ref> [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'']] ranked \"Far Beyond the Stars\" 4th out of the 50 top episodes of all ''Star Trek'' in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/features/best-star-trek-episodes/|title=The 50 best Star Trek episodes ever|date=2016-07-27|website=Empire|language=en|access-date=2019-07-02}}</ref> At that time, there were roughly 726 episodes and a dozen films released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tomsguide.com/us/star-trek-binge-watching-guide,review-3635.html|title=How to Binge Watch 726 Star Trek Episodes (and 12 Movies)|last=Honorof|first=Marshall|date=May 17, 2016|website=Tom's Guide|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=July 2, 2016}}</ref> A 2015 [[binge-watching]] guide for ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' by [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] recommended not skipping this \"essential\" episode.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/binge-guide-star-trek-ds9/|title=WIRED Binge-Watching Guide: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|date=2015-05-13|work=Wired|access-date=2019-07-23|issn=1059-1028}}</ref> In 2019, ''Den of Geek'' included this among the top 12 best morality plays of the ''Star Trek'' franchise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/go/278483|title=Star Trek's 12 Best Morality Plays|website=Den of Geek|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Chicago Tribune]] praised the episode, and claimed it would \"shatter whatever remnants of that opposition [to Avery Brook's casting which still] linger\".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Allan|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49606499/the-chicago-tribunes-review-of-star/|title=Back to the future|date=February 10, 1998|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=April 26, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426170845/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49606499/the-chicago-tribunes-review-of-star/|archive-date=April 26, 2020|page=59|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] agreed, and said that fans will consider this the \"most remarkable episode in the history of ''Deep Space Nine''.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Norman|first=Tony|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49685463/the-pittsburgh-post-gazettes-review-of/|title='Deep Space Nine' episode boldly faces racism|date=February 14, 1998|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|access-date=April 27, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200427165442/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49685463/the-pittsburgh-post-gazettes-review-of/|archive-date=April 27, 2020|page=29|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Academic ===\nIn a paper published by the [[Bulletin of Science, Technology & Society]], Allen Kwan argued that while the episode should be \"given credit\" for portraying racism more directly than any other episode, the ending in which Russell is institutionalized weakens the moral of the story. Parallels, Kwan claimed, can be drawn from Pabst, the racist magazine editor, to the producers of the Star Trek franchise. Kwan maintains that, like Pabst, the franchise as a whole tends to ignore actual diversity, instead opting to portray a future with only a single cultural and racial norm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n\n* {{cite magazine|url=http://titanmagazines.com/t/star-trek/us/40/|title=Going Far Beyond the Stars|first=Joe|last=Nazzaro|work=[[Star Trek Magazine]]|publisher=[[Titan Magazines]]|location=[[London]]|date=June 1998|pages=42\u201346|ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Space-Nine-Companion-Star/dp/0671501062|last1=Erdmann|first1=Terry|last2=Block|first2=Paula|title=The Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Companion|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=[[New York City]]|year=2000|doi=|edition=1st|isbn=978-0671501068|ref=harv}}\n\n{{Refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote|Star Trek: Deep Space Nine#Far Beyond the Stars .5B6.13.5D|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* {{IMDb episode|0708538}}\n* {{tv.com episode|star-trek-deep-space-nine/far-beyond-the-stars-20963}}\n{{Memoryalpha|Far Beyond the Stars (episode)|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n* [http://memory-beta.wikia.com/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars \"Far Beyond the Stars\"] at [http://memory-beta.wikia.com Memory Beta]\n{{StarTrek.com link|DS9|71932|\"Far Beyond the Stars\"}}\n\n{{Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episodes|6}}\n\n[[Category:Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (season 6) episodes]]\n[[Category:1998 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Fiction set in 1953]]\n[[Category:Works about writers]]\n", "name_user": "TheAwesomeHwyh", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFilming and makeup:ce", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars"}

The diameter of the virus is between 70 and 80&nbsp;nm by [[negative stain]]ing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe other name of this virus may include duck adenovirus 1 (DAdV-1), EDS '76 virus (EDSV) and adenovirus 127 (AV-127).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/egg_drop_syndrome.pdf|title=Egg Drop Syndrome 1976|vauthors=Spickler, Rovid A|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Species Affected==\nThe natural host of ''[[Duck atadenovirus A]]'' are wild and/or domestic waterfowls such as ducks and geese. However, the virus can also infect other bird species through contaminated vaccines,<ref name=\":1\" /> and contaminated drinking water by droppings.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMoreover, the virus become apparent and more susceptible in chickens of all ages and breeds, especially broilers and brown egg layers.

The virus is often latent until the chicks reach maturity. Thereafter, the matured chickens begin to excrete virus and transmit through the eggs and droppings.\n\nThe virus is also transmitted horizontally between chickens. Mainly, it is seen in commercial egg layers whereby contaminated egg trays are often reused. The virus can survive both inside the eggs and on the eggshell. The virus can migrate from the eggshell to the tray and back to the other eggs placed in the same tray. Contaminated water supply with droppings and litters of the natural host contributes to the horizontal spread as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInsect transmission is possible yet proven.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Egg Drop Syndrome|last=OIE Report|date=2006|citeseerx = 10.1.1.180.4622}}</ref>\n\n==Sign & Symptoms==\nThe first sign of EDS '76 is usually the loss of colour pigment in the eggs, followed by the production of thin-shelled, soft-shelled and even shell-less eggs. The thin-shelled and shell-less eggs are so fragile and thus may get eaten by the chickens and get disregarded as litters. The shells may also be rough or chalky. Watery egg whites and a reduction in egg size may also happen as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Van Eck JH, Vertommen M, Van den HP, etal|date=1977|title=Recent studies on the role of adenovirus in the problem of dropped egg production and production of soft shelled and shell-less eggs.|url=|journal=In Proc.

The diameter of the virus is between 70 and 80&nbsp;nm by [[negative stain]]ing.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe other name of this virus may include duck adenovirus 1 (DAdV-1), EDS '76 virus (EDSV) and adenovirus 127 (AV-127).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/egg_drop_syndrome.pdf|title=Egg Drop Syndrome 1976|vauthors=Spickler, Rovid A|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Species Affected==\nThe natural host of ''[[Duck atadenovirus A]]'' are wild and/or domestic waterfowls such as ducks and geese. However, the virus can also infect other bird species through contaminated vaccines,<ref name=\":1\" /> and contaminated drinking water by droppings.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nMoreover, the virus become apparent and more susceptible in chickens of all ages and breeds, especially broilers and brown egg layers.

The virus is often latent until the chicks reach maturity. Thereafter, the matured chickens begin to excrete virus and transmit through the eggs and droppings.\n\nThe virus is also transmitted horizontally between chickens. Mainly, it is seen in commercial egg layers whereby contaminated egg trays are often reused. The virus can survive both inside the eggs and on the eggshell. The virus can migrate from the eggshell to the tray and back to the other eggs placed in the same tray. Contaminated water supply with droppings and litters of the natural host contributes to the horizontal spread as well.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nInsect transmission is possible yet proven.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Egg Drop Syndrome|last=OIE Report|date=2006|citeseerx = 10.1.1.180.4622}}</ref>\n\n==Sign & Symptoms==\nThe first sign of EDS '76 is usually the loss of colour pigment in the eggs, followed by the production of thin-shelled, soft-shelled and even shell-less eggs. The thin-shelled and shell-less eggs are so fragile and thus may get eaten by the chickens and get disregarded as litters. The shells may also be rough or chalky.
