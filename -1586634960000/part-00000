According to [[Herodotus]] (''Histories''&nbsp;2.2) Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I]] wanted to determine the oldest nation and establish the world's [[Proto-Human language|original language]]. For this purpose, he ordered two children to be reared by a shepherd, forbidding him to let them hear a single word, and charging him to report the children's first utterance. After two years, the shepherd reported that on entering their chamber, the children came up to him, extending their hands, calling ''bekos''. Upon enquiry, the pharaoh discovered that this was the Phrygian word for 'wheat bread', after which the Egyptians conceded that the Phrygian nation was older than theirs. The word ''bekos'' is also attested several times in Palaeo-Phrygian inscriptions on funerary stelae. It may be cognate to the English ''bake'' (PIE *''b\u02b0eh\u2083g-'').<ref>The etymology is defended in O. Panagl & B. Kowal, \"Zur etymologischen Darstellung von Restsprachen\", in: A. Bammesberger (ed.), ''Das etymologische W\u00f6rterbuch'', Regensburg 1983, pp. 186\u2013187. It is contested in Benjamin W. Fortson, ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction''. Blackwell, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4051-0316-7}}, p. 409.</ref> [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]] (both also influenced Phrygian morphology), Galatian and Greek (which also exhibits a high amount of isoglosses with Phrygian) all influenced Phrygian vocabulary.<ref name=\"Brixhe pp. 165\u2013178\"/><ref>Woodard, Roger D. ''The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor''. Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-521-68496-X}}, pp. 69\u201381.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Clement of Alexandria]], the Phrygian word ''bedu'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03ad\u03b4\u03c5}}) meaning 'water'  (PIE *''wed-'') appeared in [[Orphic]] ritual.<ref>Clement. ''Stromata'', 5.8.46\u201347.</ref>\n\nThe Greek theonym [[Zeus]] appears in Phrygian with the stem ''Ti-'' (genitive ''Tios'' = Greek ''Dios'', from earlier ''*Diwos''; the nominative is unattested); perhaps with the general meaning 'god, deity'. It is possible that ''tiveya'' means 'goddess'. The shift of ''*d'' to ''t'' in Phrygian and the loss of ''*w'' before ''o'' appears to be regular. [[Stephanus Byzantius]] records that according to [[Demosthenes]], Zeus was known as ''Tios'' in [[Bithynia]].<ref>On Phrygian ''ti-'' see Heubeck 1987, Lubotsky 1989a, Lubotsky 1998c, Brixhe 1997: 42ff.

According to [[Herodotus]] (''Histories''&nbsp;2.2) Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I]] wanted to determine the oldest nation and establish the world's [[Proto-Human language|original language]]. For this purpose, he ordered two children to be reared by a shepherd, forbidding him to let them hear a single word, and charging him to report the children's first utterance. After two years, the shepherd reported that on entering their chamber, the children came up to him, extending their hands, calling ''bekos''. Upon enquiry, the pharaoh discovered that this was the Phrygian word for 'wheat bread', after which the Egyptians conceded that the Phrygian nation was older than theirs. The word ''bekos'' is also attested several times in Palaeo-Phrygian inscriptions on funerary stelae. It may be cognate to the English ''bake'' (PIE *''b\u02b0eh\u2083g-'').<ref>The etymology is defended in O. Panagl & B. Kowal, \"Zur etymologischen Darstellung von Restsprachen\", in: A. Bammesberger (ed.), ''Das etymologische W\u00f6rterbuch'', Regensburg 1983, pp. 186\u2013187. It is contested in Benjamin W. Fortson, ''Indo-European Language and Culture: An Introduction''. Blackwell, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4051-0316-7}}, p. 409.</ref> [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]] (both also influenced Phrygian morphology), Galatian and Greek (which also exhibits a high amount of isoglosses with Phrygian) all influenced Phrygian vocabulary.<ref name=\"Brixhe pp. 165\u2013178\"/><ref>Woodard, Roger D. ''The Ancient Languages of Asia Minor''. Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-521-68496-X}}, pp. 69\u201381.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Clement of Alexandria]], the Phrygian word ''bedu'' ({{lang|grc|\u03b2\u03ad\u03b4\u03c5}}) meaning 'water'  (PIE *''wed-'') appeared in [[Orphic]] ritual.<ref>Clement. ''Stromata'', 5.8.46\u201347.</ref>\n\nThe Greek theonym [[Zeus]] appears in Phrygian with the stem ''Ti-'' (genitive ''Tios'' = Greek ''Dios'', from earlier ''*Diwos''; the nominative is unattested); perhaps with the general meaning 'god, deity'. It is possible that ''tiveya'' means 'goddess'. The shift of ''*d'' to ''t'' in Phrygian and the loss of ''*w'' before ''o'' appears to be regular. [[Stephanus Byzantius]] records that according to [[Demosthenes]], Zeus was known as ''Tios'' in [[Bithynia]].<ref>On Phrygian ''ti-'' see Heubeck 1987, Lubotsky 1989a, Lubotsky 1998c, Brixhe 1997: 42ff.

Witczak 1992-3: 265ff. assumes a Bithynian origin for the Phrygian god.</ref>\n\nAnother possible theonym is ''bago-'' (cf. Old Persian ''baga-'', [[Proto-Slavic]] ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/bog\u044a|*bog\u044a]]'' \"god\"), attested as the accusative singular ''bag\u0323un'' in G-136.<ref>However also read as ''bapun''; \"Un tr\u00e8s court retour vertical prolonge le trait horizontal du \u0393. S'il n'\u00e9tait accidentel nous aurions [...] un p assez semblable \u00e0 celui de G-135.\" Brixhe and Lejeune 1987: 125.</ref> Lejeune identified the term as ''*b\u02b0agom'', in the meaning 'a gift, dedication' (PIE ''*b\u02b0ag-'' 'to apportion, give a share'). But [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] mentions a ''Bagaios, Phrygian Zeus'' ({{lang|grc|\u0392\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 \u0396\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03a6\u03c1\u03cd\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}) and interprets the name as {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u1fc6\u03c1 \u1f11\u03ac\u03c9\u03bd}} 'giver of good things'.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Paleo-Balkan languages]]\n* [[Ancient Macedonian language]]\n* [[Thracian language]]\n* [[Dacian language#Anatolia]]\n* [[Greek language]]\n* [[Graeco-Phrygian]]\n* [[Alphabets of Asia Minor]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Further reading===\n*Brixhe, Claude. \"Du pal\u00e9o- au n\u00e9o-phrygien\".
