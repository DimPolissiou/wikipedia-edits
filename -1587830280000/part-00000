{"title_page": "Miami Dolphins", "text_new": "{{short description|National Football League franchise in Miami, Florida}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date = November 1998}}\n\nThe '''Miami Dolphins''' are a pre school level of play  [[American football]] team based in the [[Miami metropolitan area]]. The Dolphins compete in the [[National Football League|Little men\u2019s league]]  (LML) as a member of the Little men\u2019s league (LME) [[AFC East|East]] division. The Dolphins play their home games at any near by preschools , located in the northern suburb of [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four LME East teams, they are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the [[American Football League|Little men\u2019s league]] (LML).\n\nThe Dolphins were founded by attorney-politician [[Joe Robbie]] and actor-comedian [[Danny Thomas]]. They began play in the AFL in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the [[Miami Seahawks]], who played in the [[All-America Football Conference]] in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]]. For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|Saint Andrew's School]], a private boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. In the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]], the Dolphins joined the NFL.\n\nThe team made its first [[Super Bowl]] appearance in [[Super Bowl VI]], losing to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 24\u20133. [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|The following year]], the Dolphins completed the NFL's only [[perfect season]], culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular season games, and all three of their playoff games, including [[Super Bowl VII]]. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect [[National Football League regular season|regular season]]. The next year, the Dolphins won [[Super Bowl VIII]], becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in [[Super Bowl XVII]] and [[Super Bowl XIX]], losing both games.\n\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by [[Don Shula]], the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback [[Dan Marino]] became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the [[1999 Miami Dolphins season|1999 season]].\n\nIn [[2008 Miami Dolphins season|2008]], the Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to win their division and make a playoff appearance following a [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|league-worst 1\u201315 season]]. That same season, the Dolphins upset the 16\u20130 [[2008 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] on the road during Week 3, handing the Patriots' their first regular season loss since December 10, 2006, in which coincidentally, they were also beaten by the Dolphins.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Miami Dolphins|List of Miami Dolphins seasons}}\nThe Miami Dolphins joined the [[American Football League]] (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer [[Joseph Robbie]] and actor [[Danny Thomas]] in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie.<ref name=\"nd650721\">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Nevada Daily Mail]] |title=Football League Trying Dixie Expansion |page=10 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XEMrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WtQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2822,3612744&dq=dixie+football-league&hl=en |date=July 21, 1965 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in [[St. Pete Beach]] with practices in August at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida|Gulfport]].<ref>Armistead, Tom \"On the Departing Dolphins: Observations and Conclusions\" (August 4, 1966), ''Evening Independent''</ref>\n\nThe Dolphins had a combined 15\u201339\u20132 record in their first four seasons under head coach [[George Wilson (football coach)|George Wilson]], before [[Don Shula]] was hired as head coach. Shula was a [[Paul Brown]] disciple who had been lured from the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], after losing [[Super Bowl III]] two seasons earlier to the AFL's [[New York Jets]], and finishing 8\u20135\u20131 the following season. Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged with the NFL]] in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the [[AFC East]] division in the NFL's new [[American Football Conference]].\n\nFor the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL with a strong running game and defense, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999. They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete [[perfect season]] in NFL history by finishing with a 14\u20130 regular season record in [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]] and winning the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl that year]]. It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row. The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times, and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback [[Dan Marino]], who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s. After winning every game against the division rival [[Buffalo Bills]] in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a [[Bills\u2013Dolphins rivalry|competitive rivalry]] in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when [[Jim Kelly]] emerged as the quarterback for the Bills. The Dolphins have also maintained a [[Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry|strong rivalry]] with the [[New York Jets]] throughout much of their history.\n\nFollowing the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of [[Tom Brady]] and the [[New England Patriots]], the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s, including a [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|1\u201315 season in 2007]] that was the worst in franchise history. They only made the playoffs three times in that decade and were unable to find a consistent quarterback to replace Marino, shuffling 13 quarterbacks and five head coaches. However, the Dolphins have been competitive against the Patriots despite their decline, with notable wins coming in 2004, 2008, 2014, [[Miracle in Miami|2018]], and 2019. They also are the last team in the AFC East to win the division championship aside from the Patriots, doing so in 2008. While quarterback [[Ryan Tannehill]] provided some stability at the position throughout most of the 2010s, the team has nonetheless been mediocre, only having made the playoffs once during the decade.\n\n===Super Bowls===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Super Bowl\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1971|| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Don Shula]] || [[Super Bowl VI|VI]] || [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] || [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] || 3\u201324 (L) || 10\u20133\u20131\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1972|| [[Super Bowl VII|VII]] || [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] || [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] || 14\u20137 (W) || 17\u20130\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1973|| [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]] || [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] || [[1973 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] || 24\u20137 (W) || 15\u20132\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1982|| [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]] || [[Pasadena, California]] || [[1982 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] || 17\u201327 (L) || 7\u20132{{efn|Strike Shortened year}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1984|| [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]] || [[Stanford, California]] || [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] || 16\u201338 (L) || 14\u20132\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"\n| colspan=\"6\"|'''Total Super Bowls Record:'''\n| colspan=\"1\"|'''2\u20133'''\n|}\n\n===AFC Championships===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1971|| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Don Shula]] || [[Miami]] || [[Baltimore Colts]] || 21\u20130 || 12\u20134\u20131\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1972|| [[Pittsburgh]] || [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] || 21\u201317 || 17\u20130\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1973|| rowspan=\"3\" | Miami|| [[Oakland Raiders]] || 27\u201310 || 15\u20132\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1982|| [[New York Jets]] || 14\u20130 || 10\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1984|| Pittsburgh Steelers || 45\u201328 || 16\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"\n| colspan=\"4\"|'''Total AFC Championships won:'''\n| colspan=\"2\"|'''5'''\n|}\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=August 2017}}\nThe Dolphins share intense rivalries with their three [[AFC East]] opponents, but also have had historical or occasional rivalries with other teams such as their cross-state rivals [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], their former divisional rivals [[Indianapolis Colts]], the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers]], [[Las Vegas Raiders|Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders]], and to a lesser extent, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Are the Miami Dolphins' Biggest Non-AFC East Rivals?|url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/423679-who-are-the-miami-dolphins-biggest-non-afc-east-rivals|first=Thomas|last=Galicia|website=Bleacher Report|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n\n====Buffalo Bills====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Dolphins rivalry}}\nThe Dolphins and the [[Buffalo Bills]] have a long-standing rivalry, as there are stark characteristic differences between the cities of Miami and Buffalo, especially in climate and culture. The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when [[Jim Kelly]] became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff match-ups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins great [[Dan Marino]], the Bills-Dolphins rivalry has faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably [[Dan Carpenter]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], and [[Charles Clay (American football)|Charles Clay]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\nThe Dolphins dominated the [[New England Patriots]] during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a game now known as the [[Snowplow Game]]. Fortunes changed when [[Tom Brady]] became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and since then, the Patriots have virtually dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East. Miami did pose more of a challenge to the Brady-led Patriots in the 2000s, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that decade. Notable wins over New England by the Dolphins include the [[Miracle in Miami]], which involved a dramatic last-minute game-winning touchdown that paralleled \"The Night that Courage Wore Orange\", where in [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|2004]], the Dolphins, at 2\u201311, upset the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots 28\u201329, and handed them the second of their 2 losses that season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Miracle in Miami: Dolphins Stun Patriots with Last-Second Touchdown|url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/dolphins-stun-patriots-miracle-in-miami-nfl-week-14/|location=Boston|publisher=[[WBZ-TV]]|date=December 9, 2018|access-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref> The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when [[Nick Saban]], [[Bill Belichick]]'s former Browns defensive coordinator was hired as their new head coach and when Saban nearly signed quarterback [[Drew Brees]], as well as in 2008, when the two teams battled for the AFC East division title. Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|14\u20130 in 1972]] and New England going [[2007 New England Patriots season|16\u20130 in 2007]], but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl.\n\n====New York Jets====\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry}}\nThe [[New York Jets]] are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals. Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' usual cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include [[Dan Marino]]'s [[Clock Play|fake spike]], [[Vinny Testaverde]] leading the Jets to a [[Monday Night Miracle (American football)|notable comeback on Monday Night Football]], and former Jets quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title. The two teams have also played in the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982 AFC Championship]], with Miami winning to face the [[1982 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVII]].\n\n===Other===\n\n====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====\n{{main|Buccaneers\u2013Dolphins rivalry}}\nSince the founding of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in 1976, the Dolphins and Buccaneers have shared a mellow in-state rivalry and were the only two teams in Florida until the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the NFL in 1995.\n\n====Other AFC rivals====\n{{see also|The Sea of Hands|Epic in Miami}}\nThe Dolphins have also had history against other AFC teams. When the [[Baltimore Colts]] were inserted into the AFC East following the AFL/NFL merger, they sparked a heated rivalry with the Dolphins, as a controversy involving the hiring of former Colts coach [[Don Shula]] forced Miami to forfeit a first-round draft pick. The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to [[Super Bowl VI]], which the Dolphins lost to the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|moved to Indianapolis]], but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the [[AFC South]] as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL's divisions.\n\nThe Dolphins also share historic rivalries with the [[Las Vegas Raiders]], [[Los Angeles Chargers]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:NFL Jets at Dolphins-Sun Life Stadium-2012-09-24.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard Rock Stadium]] in 2012.]]\nThe Dolphins originally played all home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami. They moved to the new Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1986 season. From 1993 to 2011, the Dolphins shared the stadium with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Florida Marlins]]. The venue has had multiple [[naming rights]] deals since [[1996 NFL season|1996]], carrying the names Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, New Miami Stadium and, as of August 2016, [[Hard Rock Stadium]]. The facility is located in [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]], a suburb of Miami located approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of downtown Miami. The Miami Dolphins share Hard Rock Stadium with the [[NCAA]] [[Miami Hurricanes]]. The 2015\u20132016 season was the first season in the newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. The Dolphins spent more than two years and over $400 million on a major overhaul to Hard Rock Stadium. Every seat was replaced and the lower level seats were moved closer to the field. There are roughly 10,000 fewer seats.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fans Excited About $425 Million Renovation To Sun Life Stadium|url = http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/08/10/fans-excited-about-425-million-renovation-to-sun-life-stadium/|accessdate = August 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\n{{main|Miami Dolphins Training Facility}}\n[[St. Pete Beach|St. Petersburg Beach]] hosted the Dolphins' first training camp in 1966.

At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. These uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes.\n\nAn update was given to the logo in 1997 \u2013 the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Highlights |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |publisher=Miami Dolphins |date=June 3, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604213955/http://miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |archivedate=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=November 25, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The uniforms remained the same, however a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added.\n\nOn very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against [[Washington Redskins|Washington]], a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' match pitting the 2\u201311 Dolphins against the 12\u20131 defending champion [[New England Patriots]]. The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \"[[2004 New England Patriots season#Week 15: at Miami Dolphins|The Night That Courage Wore Orange]]\".<ref>{{cite AV media|people=rebellionmx|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFY4A6wXIU|date=October 12, 2009|title=The Night Courage Wore Orange. Dec. 20, 2004.|medium=YouTube|language=English}}</ref> The orange jerseys were used for a 2009 Monday night win against the [[New York Jets]]. However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the jerseys would not be worn again until a 2016 Thursday night defeat in Cincinnati, although that set featured orange pants as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] initiative.\n\nIn 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes.\n\nThe Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28\u20130 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in [[Gillette Stadium|Foxboro]]. The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo.\n\n====Stylized swimming dolphin (2013\u2013present)====\nA radically new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the [[2013 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Miami Dolphins confirm they have new logo|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000154510/article/miami-dolphins-confirm-they-have-new-logo|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pugh|first=Jesse|title=Dee Confirms Logo Evolution|url=http://assets.dolphinsdigital.com/blog/2013/dee-confirms-logo-evolution?_ga=1.187286123.2147278759.1470620679|publisher=The Finsiders|date=March 29, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Florio |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/27/dolphins-confirm-new-logo/|title=Dolphins confirm new logo|publisher=NBC Sports|work=Pro Football Talk|date=March 27, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The new logo features a stylized [[aqua (color)|aqua]] dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy.\n\nNavy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers, however the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look, however navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kent|first=Andy|title=Marino: New Logo Is About Tradition|url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/news/article-1/Marino-New-Logo-Is-About-Tradition/833326b3-201f-4a3d-b0f0-533f362082eb|publisher=Miami Dolphins|date=April 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609041118/http://www.miamidolphins.com/news/article-1/Marino-New-Logo-Is-About-Tradition/833326b3-201f-4a3d-b0f0-533f362082eb|archive-date=June 9, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article209324319.html |title=Miami Dolphins tweak their uniforms |last=Salguero |first=Armando |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=April 19, 2018 |access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Throwback uniforms====\nIn 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 [[Miracle in Miami]] play against the Patriots.\n\n===Fight song===\nThe song was written and composed by Lee Ofman. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17\u20130 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in [[Super Bowl VII]]. The following season, Miami posted an equally-impressive 15\u20132 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by [[T-Pain]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]] featuring [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] on August 7, 2009 which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Todd |title=Dolphins Become Death of Autotune |url=https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/Dolphins-Fight-Song-Goes-Autotune-52679517.html |website=NBC 6 South Florida |accessdate=November 28, 2019 |date=August 7, 2009}}</ref> The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \"[[Fins (song)|Fins]]\" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song. The Dolphins shorthand nickname, \"The Fins,\" has been recognized and used by the team.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n===Cheerleaders===\n{{main|Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders}}\n[[File:Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|right|Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders in performance]]\nThe team's [[cheerleader]]s are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/cheerleaders/cheerleaders_menu.asp|title=Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders|work=Miami Dolphins|accessdate=August 24, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819003625/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/cheerleaders/cheerleaders_menu.asp|archivedate=August 19, 2009}}</ref> The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites. (The name referred to the co-sponsor, Starbrite Car Polish.) The cheerleaders' founding choreographer was [[June Taylor]], famed colleague of [[Jackie Gleason]], who led the squad until her retirement in 1990.\n\n===Special Teams/Volunteer Program===\nIn April 2010, the Dolphins started the first Volunteer Program in the NFL. Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques. Since its inception, Special Teams has given over 100,000 community services hours to the South Florida and Mexico community.\n\n===Mascots===\n\n====T.D.====\n{{main|T. D. (mascot)}}\n(\"The Dolphin\")\nOn Friday, April 18, 1997, the first \"official\" mascot of the Miami Dolphins was introduced. The 7-foot mascot made his public debut on April 19 at Pro Player Stadium during the team's draft day party. The team then made a \"Name the Mascot\" contest that drew over 13,000 entries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997.\n\n====Dolfan Denny====\n[[Dolfan Denny|Denny Sym]] cheered on the Miami Dolphins for 33 years as a one-man sideline show, leading Miami crowds in cheers and chants in his glittering coral (orange) and aqua hat from the Dolphins\u2019 first game in 1966 until 2000.

He would jump in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs and the 1970s due to stress. In ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', Snowflake, a live dolphin who does special behaviors after the Dolphins score a touchdown, was the basis of the film after he is kidnapped as part of a revenge plot against Dan Marino.\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{main|List of Miami Dolphins broadcasters}}\nIn August 2010, the team launched its own regional TV \"network\".

The Dolphins compete in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) as a member club of the league's [[American Football Conference]] (AFC) [[AFC East|East]] division. The Dolphins play their home games at [[Hard Rock Stadium]], located in the northern suburb of [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, they are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL).\n\nThe Dolphins were founded by attorney-politician [[Joe Robbie]] and actor-comedian [[Danny Thomas]]. They began play in the AFL in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the [[Miami Seahawks]], who played in the [[All-America Football Conference]] in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the [[Baltimore Colts (1947\u201350)|Baltimore Colts]]. For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|Saint Andrew's School]], a private boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. In the 1970 [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]], the Dolphins joined the NFL.\n\nThe team made its first [[Super Bowl]] appearance in [[Super Bowl VI]], losing to the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 24\u20133. [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|The following year]], the Dolphins completed the NFL's only [[perfect season]], culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular season games, and all three of their playoff games, including [[Super Bowl VII]]. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect [[National Football League regular season|regular season]]. The next year, the Dolphins won [[Super Bowl VIII]], becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in [[Super Bowl XVII]] and [[Super Bowl XIX]], losing both games.\n\nFor most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by [[Don Shula]], the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback [[Dan Marino]] became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the [[1999 Miami Dolphins season|1999 season]].\n\nIn [[2008 Miami Dolphins season|2008]], the Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to win their division and make a playoff appearance following a [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|league-worst 1\u201315 season]]. That same season, the Dolphins upset the 16\u20130 [[2008 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] on the road during Week 3, handing the Patriots' their first regular season loss since December 10, 2006, in which coincidentally, they were also beaten by the Dolphins.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Miami Dolphins|List of Miami Dolphins seasons}}\nThe Miami Dolphins joined the [[American Football League]] (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer [[Joseph Robbie]] and actor [[Danny Thomas]] in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie.<ref name=\"nd650721\">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |work=[[The Nevada Daily Mail]] |title=Football League Trying Dixie Expansion |page=10 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XEMrAAAAIBAJ&sjid=WtQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2822,3612744&dq=dixie+football-league&hl=en |date=July 21, 1965 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}</ref> During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in [[St. Pete Beach]] with practices in August at [[Boca Ciega High School]] in [[Gulfport, Florida|Gulfport]].<ref>Armistead, Tom \"On the Departing Dolphins: Observations and Conclusions\" (August 4, 1966), ''Evening Independent''</ref>\n\nThe Dolphins had a combined 15\u201339\u20132 record in their first four seasons under head coach [[George Wilson (football coach)|George Wilson]], before [[Don Shula]] was hired as head coach. Shula was a [[Paul Brown]] disciple who had been lured from the [[History of the Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]], after losing [[Super Bowl III]] two seasons earlier to the AFL's [[New York Jets]], and finishing 8\u20135\u20131 the following season. Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged with the NFL]] in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the [[AFC East]] division in the NFL's new [[American Football Conference]].\n\nFor the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL with a strong running game and defense, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999. They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete [[perfect season]] in NFL history by finishing with a 14\u20130 regular season record in [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|1972]] and winning the [[Super Bowl VII|Super Bowl that year]]. It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row. The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times, and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback [[Dan Marino]], who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s. After winning every game against the division rival [[Buffalo Bills]] in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a [[Bills\u2013Dolphins rivalry|competitive rivalry]] in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when [[Jim Kelly]] emerged as the quarterback for the Bills. The Dolphins have also maintained a [[Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry|strong rivalry]] with the [[New York Jets]] throughout much of their history.\n\nFollowing the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of [[Tom Brady]] and the [[New England Patriots]], the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s, including a [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|1\u201315 season in 2007]] that was the worst in franchise history. They only made the playoffs three times in that decade and were unable to find a consistent quarterback to replace Marino, shuffling 13 quarterbacks and five head coaches. However, the Dolphins have been competitive against the Patriots despite their decline, with notable wins coming in 2004, 2008, 2014, [[Miracle in Miami|2018]], and 2019. They also are the last team in the AFC East to win the division championship aside from the Patriots, doing so in 2008. While quarterback [[Ryan Tannehill]] provided some stability at the position throughout most of the 2010s, the team has nonetheless been mediocre, only having made the playoffs once during the decade.\n\n===Super Bowls===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Super Bowl\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1971|| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Don Shula]] || [[Super Bowl VI|VI]] || [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] || [[1971 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] || 3\u201324 (L) || 10\u20133\u20131\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1972|| [[Super Bowl VII|VII]] || [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, California]] || [[1972 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] || 14\u20137 (W) || 17\u20130\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1973|| [[Super Bowl VIII|VIII]] || [[Houston|Houston, Texas]] || [[1973 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] || 24\u20137 (W) || 15\u20132\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1982|| [[Super Bowl XVII|XVII]] || [[Pasadena, California]] || [[1982 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] || 17\u201327 (L) || 7\u20132{{efn|Strike Shortened year}}\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1984|| [[Super Bowl XIX|XIX]] || [[Stanford, California]] || [[1984 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] || 16\u201338 (L) || 14\u20132\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"\n| colspan=\"6\"|'''Total Super Bowls Record:'''\n| colspan=\"1\"|'''2\u20133'''\n|}\n\n===AFC Championships===\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Year\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Coach\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Location\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Opponent\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Score\n! style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"|Record\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1971|| rowspan=\"5\" | [[Don Shula]] || [[Miami]] || [[Baltimore Colts]] || 21\u20130 || 12\u20134\u20131\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1972|| [[Pittsburgh]] || [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] || 21\u201317 || 17\u20130\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1973|| rowspan=\"3\" | Miami|| [[Oakland Raiders]] || 27\u201310 || 15\u20132\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1982|| [[New York Jets]] || 14\u20130 || 10\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 1984|| Pittsburgh Steelers || 45\u201328 || 16\u20133\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; {{NFLAltPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins}};\"\n| colspan=\"4\"|'''Total AFC Championships won:'''\n| colspan=\"2\"|'''5'''\n|}\n\n==Rivalries==\n{{Expand section|1=examples and additional citations|date=August 2017}}\nThe Dolphins share intense rivalries with their three [[AFC East]] opponents, but also have had historical or occasional rivalries with other teams such as their cross-state rivals [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], their former divisional rivals [[Indianapolis Colts]], the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Los Angeles Chargers|San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers]], [[Las Vegas Raiders|Oakland/Los Angeles/Las Vegas Raiders]], and to a lesser extent, the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Are the Miami Dolphins' Biggest Non-AFC East Rivals?|url = http://bleacherreport.com/articles/423679-who-are-the-miami-dolphins-biggest-non-afc-east-rivals|first=Thomas|last=Galicia|website=Bleacher Report|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n\n====Buffalo Bills====\n{{main|Bills\u2013Dolphins rivalry}}\nThe Dolphins and the [[Buffalo Bills]] have a long-standing rivalry, as there are stark characteristic differences between the cities of Miami and Buffalo, especially in climate and culture. The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when [[Jim Kelly]] became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff match-ups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins great [[Dan Marino]], the Bills-Dolphins rivalry has faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably [[Dan Carpenter]], [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]], and [[Charles Clay (American football)|Charles Clay]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Patriots rivalry}}\nThe Dolphins dominated the [[New England Patriots]] during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a game now known as the [[Snowplow Game]]. Fortunes changed when [[Tom Brady]] became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and since then, the Patriots have virtually dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East. Miami did pose more of a challenge to the Brady-led Patriots in the 2000s, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that decade. Notable wins over New England by the Dolphins include the [[Miracle in Miami]], which involved a dramatic last-minute game-winning touchdown that paralleled \"The Night that Courage Wore Orange\", where in [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|2004]], the Dolphins, at 2\u201311, upset the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots 28\u201329, and handed them the second of their 2 losses that season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Miracle in Miami: Dolphins Stun Patriots with Last-Second Touchdown|url=https://boston.cbslocal.com/2018/12/09/dolphins-stun-patriots-miracle-in-miami-nfl-week-14/|location=Boston|publisher=[[WBZ-TV]]|date=December 9, 2018|access-date=December 9, 2018}}</ref> The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when [[Nick Saban]], [[Bill Belichick]]'s former Browns defensive coordinator was hired as their new head coach and when Saban nearly signed quarterback [[Drew Brees]], as well as in 2008, when the two teams battled for the AFC East division title. Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|14\u20130 in 1972]] and New England going [[2007 New England Patriots season|16\u20130 in 2007]], but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl.\n\n====New York Jets====\n{{main|Dolphins\u2013Jets rivalry}}\nThe [[New York Jets]] are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals. Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' usual cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include [[Dan Marino]]'s [[Clock Play|fake spike]], [[Vinny Testaverde]] leading the Jets to a [[Monday Night Miracle (American football)|notable comeback on Monday Night Football]], and former Jets quarterback [[Chad Pennington]] signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title. The two teams have also played in the [[1982\u201383 NFL playoffs|1982 AFC Championship]], with Miami winning to face the [[1982 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVII]].\n\n===Other===\n\n====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====\n{{main|Buccaneers\u2013Dolphins rivalry}}\nSince the founding of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in 1976, the Dolphins and Buccaneers have shared a mellow in-state rivalry and were the only two teams in Florida until the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the NFL in 1995.\n\n====Other AFC rivals====\n{{see also|The Sea of Hands|Epic in Miami}}\nThe Dolphins have also had history against other AFC teams. When the [[Baltimore Colts]] were inserted into the AFC East following the AFL/NFL merger, they sparked a heated rivalry with the Dolphins, as a controversy involving the hiring of former Colts coach [[Don Shula]] forced Miami to forfeit a first-round draft pick. The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to [[Super Bowl VI]], which the Dolphins lost to the [[Dallas Cowboys]]. The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|moved to Indianapolis]], but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the [[AFC South]] as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL's divisions.\n\nThe Dolphins also share historic rivalries with the [[Las Vegas Raiders]], [[Los Angeles Chargers]], and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era.\n\n==Facilities==\n\n===Stadiums===\n[[File:NFL Jets at Dolphins-Sun Life Stadium-2012-09-24.JPG|thumb|right|[[Hard Rock Stadium]] in 2012.]]\nThe Dolphins originally played all home games in the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] in Miami. They moved to the new Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1986 season. From 1993 to 2011, the Dolphins shared the stadium with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Florida Marlins]]. The venue has had multiple [[naming rights]] deals since [[1996 NFL season|1996]], carrying the names Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, New Miami Stadium and, as of August 2016, [[Hard Rock Stadium]]. The facility is located in [[Miami Gardens, Florida|Miami Gardens]], a suburb of Miami located approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} north of downtown Miami. The Miami Dolphins share Hard Rock Stadium with the [[NCAA]] [[Miami Hurricanes]]. The 2015\u20132016 season was the first season in the newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. The Dolphins spent more than two years and over $400 million on a major overhaul to Hard Rock Stadium. Every seat was replaced and the lower level seats were moved closer to the field. There are roughly 10,000 fewer seats.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fans Excited About $425 Million Renovation To Sun Life Stadium|url = http://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/08/10/fans-excited-about-425-million-renovation-to-sun-life-stadium/|accessdate = August 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Training===\n{{main|Miami Dolphins Training Facility}}\n[[St. Pete Beach|St. Petersburg Beach]] hosted the Dolphins' first training camp in 1966. [[Saint Andrew's School (Boca Raton, Florida)|St. Andrew's School]] in [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] hosted training camp in the late 1960s. The Dolphins subsequently trained in Miami Gardens at Biscayne College, later renamed [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]], from 1970 until 1993.\n\nIn 1993, the Dolphins opened the Miami Dolphins Training Facility at [[Nova Southeastern University]] in [[Davie, Florida|Davie]]. In 2006, the facility added a domed field which allows the team to practice during thunderstorms which are common in the area during the summer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asati.com/projects/miami%20dolphins.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103091227/http://asati.com/projects/miami%20dolphins.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 3, 2007|title=ASATI|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Franchise information==\n\n===Logos and uniforms===\n\n====Leaping dolphin (1966\u20132012)====\n[[File:Miami Dolphins wordmark 1997-2012.png|thumb|left|150px|Miami Dolphins wordmark logo (1997\u20132012)]]\nThe Dolphins logo and uniforms remained fairly consistent from the team's founding through 2012. The team's colors were originally [[Aqua (color)|aqua]] and [[coral (color)|coral]], with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team's original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. These uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes.\n\nAn update was given to the logo in 1997 \u2013 the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Highlights |url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |publisher=Miami Dolphins |date=June 3, 2002 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020604213955/http://miamidolphins.com/history/historicalhighlights/historicalhighlights12.asp |archivedate=June 4, 2002 |accessdate=November 25, 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The uniforms remained the same, however a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added.\n\nOn very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against [[Washington Redskins|Washington]], a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' match pitting the 2\u201311 Dolphins against the 12\u20131 defending champion [[New England Patriots]]. The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \"[[2004 New England Patriots season#Week 15: at Miami Dolphins|The Night That Courage Wore Orange]]\".<ref>{{cite AV media|people=rebellionmx|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riFY4A6wXIU|date=October 12, 2009|title=The Night Courage Wore Orange. Dec. 20, 2004.|medium=YouTube|language=English}}</ref> The orange jerseys were used for a 2009 Monday night win against the [[New York Jets]]. However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the jerseys would not be worn again until a 2016 Thursday night defeat in Cincinnati, although that set featured orange pants as part of the [[NFL Color Rush]] initiative.\n\nIn 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes.\n\nThe Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28\u20130 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in [[Gillette Stadium|Foxboro]]. The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo.\n\n====Stylized swimming dolphin (2013\u2013present)====\nA radically new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the [[2013 NFL Draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sessler|first=Marc|title=Miami Dolphins confirm they have new logo|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000154510/article/miami-dolphins-confirm-they-have-new-logo|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=March 27, 2013|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Pugh|first=Jesse|title=Dee Confirms Logo Evolution|url=http://assets.dolphinsdigital.com/blog/2013/dee-confirms-logo-evolution?_ga=1.187286123.2147278759.1470620679|publisher=The Finsiders|date=March 29, 2013|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Florio |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/03/27/dolphins-confirm-new-logo/|title=Dolphins confirm new logo|publisher=NBC Sports|work=Pro Football Talk|date=March 27, 2013 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}</ref> The new logo features a stylized [[aqua (color)|aqua]] dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy.\n\nNavy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers, however the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look, however navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kent|first=Andy|title=Marino: New Logo Is About Tradition|url=http://www.miamidolphins.com/news/article-1/Marino-New-Logo-Is-About-Tradition/833326b3-201f-4a3d-b0f0-533f362082eb|publisher=Miami Dolphins|date=April 25, 2013|accessdate=November 25, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180609041118/http://www.miamidolphins.com/news/article-1/Marino-New-Logo-Is-About-Tradition/833326b3-201f-4a3d-b0f0-533f362082eb|archive-date=June 9, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/spt-columns-blogs/armando-salguero/article209324319.html |title=Miami Dolphins tweak their uniforms |last=Salguero |first=Armando |newspaper=Miami Herald |date=April 19, 2018 |access-date=April 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Throwback uniforms====\nIn 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 [[Miracle in Miami]] play against the Patriots.\n\n===Fight song===\nThe song was written and composed by Lee Ofman. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17\u20130 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in [[Super Bowl VII]]. The following season, Miami posted an equally-impressive 15\u20132 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in [[Super Bowl VIII]]. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by [[T-Pain]] and [[Jimmy Buffett]] featuring [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] on August 7, 2009 which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wright |first1=Todd |title=Dolphins Become Death of Autotune |url=https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/sports/Dolphins-Fight-Song-Goes-Autotune-52679517.html |website=NBC 6 South Florida |accessdate=November 28, 2019 |date=August 7, 2009}}</ref> The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \"[[Fins (song)|Fins]]\" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song.

Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques. Since its inception, Special Teams has given over 100,000 community services hours to the South Florida and Mexico community.\n\n===Mascots===\n\n====T.D.====\n{{main|T. D.

The team then made a \"Name the Mascot\" contest that drew over 13,000 entries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997.\n\n====Dolfan Denny====\n[[Dolfan Denny|Denny Sym]] cheered on the Miami Dolphins for 33 years as a one-man sideline show, leading Miami crowds in cheers and chants in his glittering coral (orange) and aqua hat from the Dolphins\u2019 first game in 1966 until 2000.

Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs and the 1970s due to stress. In ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'', Snowflake, a live dolphin who does special behaviors after the Dolphins score a touchdown, was the basis of the film after he is kidnapped as part of a revenge plot against Dan Marino.\n\n==Radio and television==\n{{main|List of Miami Dolphins broadcasters}}\nIn August 2010, the team launched its own regional TV \"network\".

A Gujarati origin for scripts of [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a [[South Sulawesi script]], probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of [[coda consonant marker]]s in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have [[coda consonant]]s, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. \n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letter forms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters. Found by pupils of [[Rizal Elementary School]] on [[Ticao Island]] in Monreal town, [[Masbate]], which had scraped the mud off their shoes and slippers on two irregular shaped [[limestone]] tablets before entering their classroom, they are now housed at a section of the [[National Museum of the Philippines]], which weighs 30 kilos, is 11 centimeters thick, 54&nbsp;cm long and 44&nbsp;cm wide while the other is 6&nbsp;cm thick, 20&nbsp;cm long and 18&nbsp;cm wide.<ref name=\"INQPHmuddied\">[http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/616407/muddied-stones-reveal-ancient-scripts Muddied stones reveal ancient scripts]</ref><ref name=\"ELIZAGAticao\">[http://heritage.elizaga.net/explorations/borrinaga/ticao-stones.pdf Romancing the Ticao Stones: Preliminary Transcription, Decipherment, Translation, and Some Notes]</ref>\n\n=== Two styles of writing ===\n\n[[File:DoctrinaChristianaEspanolaYTagala8-9.jpg|thumb|Pages of the ''Doctrina Christiana'', [[First book of the Spanish Philippines|an early Christian book]] in Spanish and Tagalog (1593)]]\n\n==== Virama Kudlit \"style\" ====\n\nThe original writing method was particularly difficult for the Spanish priests who were translating books into the vernaculars. Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Philippine passport (2016 edition) Baybayin.jpg|thumb|250px|Philippine passport (2016 edition) showing the Baybayin script]]\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the \"National Writing System Act\" (House Bill 1022<ref>{{cite web| url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB01022.pdf|title=House Bill 1022|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|17th Philippine House of Representatives]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=4 July 2016}}</ref>/Senate Bill 433<ref>{{cite web| url=https://senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-433|title=Senate Bill 433|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|17th Philippine Senate]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=19 July 2016}}</ref>).

These signs (which may be presented vertically like Indic dandas, or slanted like forward slashes) are unified across Philippines scripts and were encoded by Unicode in the [[Hanunoo alphabet|Hanun\u00f3o script]] block.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ch17.pdf#G26723|title=Chapter 17: Indonesia and Oceania, Philippine Scripts|publisher=Unicode Consortium|date=March 2020}}</ref> Space separation of words was historically not used on traditional supports, but is common today.\n\n=== Example sentences ===\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170c\u170b\u1705\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u1708\u1704\u1714\u1703\u1703\u1702\u1708\u170f\u1700\u1708\u1714\u1735 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u170b\u1704\u1714 \u1709\u1703\u1711\u1712\u1708\u1711\u1713\u1708\u1714\u1736}}\n*: ''Yamang \u2018di nagkakaunawaan, ay mag-pakahinahon.''\n*: Remain calm in disagreements.\n* {{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u1704\u1714\u1706\u1708\u1712\u170b\u1714 \u1700\u170c\u1714 \u1707\u1712 \u170a\u1712\u1707\u1713\u1736}}\n*: ''Magtanim ay 'di bir\u00f2.''\n*: Planting is not a joke.\n*\u1700\u1705\u1714 \u1703\u170a\u1706\u1700\u1708\u1714 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u1709\u1704\u1714\u1700\u1710 \u1708\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u170c\u1708\u1714\n\nAng k''abataan ang pag-asa ng bayan''\n\n<small>The youth is the hope of the country</small>\n\n<br />\n\n*{{Script|Tglg|\u170b\u170b\u1711\u170e\u1712\u1708\u1714 \u1703\u1712\u1706 \u1711\u1705\u1714\u1704\u1705\u1714 \u1710 \u1709\u1713\u170b\u1713\u1706\u1712 \u1700\u1705\u1714 \u170a\u1713\u1711\u1713\u1703\u1714 \u1703\u1713\u1736}}\n*:''M\u00e1mahalin kit\u00e1 hangg\u00e1ng sa pumut\u00ed ang buh\u00f3k ko.''\n*: I will love you until my hair turns white.\n\n=== Collation ===\n* In the ''[[Doctrina Christiana]]'', the letters of Baybayin were collated (without any connection with other similar script, except sorting vowels before consonants) as:\n*: '''A, U/O, I/E;

A Gujarati origin for scripts of [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a [[South Sulawesi script]], probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of [[coda consonant marker]]s in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have [[coda consonant]]s, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n===Early Sources===\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\n====Abecedaries====\nThe best known evidence of where this Indic script we call today as Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nFrom these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. \n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\nThe shapes of the baybayin characters bear a slight resemblance to the ancient Kavi script of Java, Indonesia, which fell into disuse in the 15th century. However, as mentioned earlier in the Spanish accounts, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]].\n\nThis theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\nThe characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\nBut other sources say that the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\n[[File:Baybayin sample.svg|thumb|Baybayin calligraphy of the Tagalog people]]\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letter forms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Gawad Lakandula.png|thumb|150px|The insignia of the [[Order of Lakandula]] contains an inscription with Baybayin characters represents the name ''[[Lakandula]]'', read counterclockwise from the top.]]\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the \"National Writing System Act\" (House Bill 1022<ref>{{cite web| url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB01022.pdf|title=House Bill 1022|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|17th Philippine House of Representatives]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=4 July 2016}}</ref>/Senate Bill 433<ref>{{cite web| url=https://senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-433|title=Senate Bill 433|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|17th Philippine Senate]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=19 July 2016}}</ref>).

She was educated at [[Keele University]] and the [[University of Essex]]. Inspired to get involved in politics by Conservative Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], she was initially involved with the [[Referendum Party]] before switching allegiance to the Conservatives. She worked for the public-relations consultancy firm [[Weber Shandwick]] for several years, as part of which she lobbied for the tobacco and alcohol industries. Intending to switch to a political career, she unsuccessfully contested [[Nottingham North (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham North]] at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]].

Following Cameron's resignation, Patel backed [[Theresa May]] as Conservative leader; May subsequently appointed Patel [[Secretary of State for International Development]]. In 2017 she was involved in a political scandal involving unauthorised meetings with the [[Government of Israel]], ending her tenure as International Development Secretary.

Why hasn't this point been pressed home during negotiations?\" Some sections of the media reported her comments as a suggestion that Britain should exploit Ireland's fear of damage to its economy and food shortages to advance its position with the EU.
