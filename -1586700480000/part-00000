A [[Big Bad Wolf]] blows down the first two pigs' houses, made of [[straw]] and [[Branch|sticks]] respectively, but is unable to destroy the third pig's house, made of [[brick]]s. Printed versions date back to the 1840s, but the story itself is thought to be much older. The phrases used in the story, and the various [[moral]]s drawn from it, have become embedded in [[Western culture]].

The first little pig builds a house of [[straw]], but a wolf blows it down and devours him. The second little pig builds a house of [[Branch|sticks]], which the wolf also blows down, and the second little pig is also devoured. Each exchange between wolf and pig features ringing proverbial phrases, namely: \n\n{{poemquote|\"Little pig, little pig, let me come in.\"\n\"No, no, by the hair on my chinny chin chin.\"\n\"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in.\"<ref name=Jacobs>{{cite book | title = English Fairy Tales | first = Joseph| last = Jacobs | publisher = Oxford University | year = 1890| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_-EOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA69 | pages = 69}}</ref>}}\n\nThe third little pig builds a house of [[brick]]s, which the wolf fails to blow down. He then attempts to trick the pig out of the house by asking to meet him at various places, but he is outwitted each time. Finally, the wolf resolves to come down the [[chimney]], whereupon the pig catches the wolf in a [[Cookware and bakeware|pot]] of boiling water, slams the lid on, then cooks and eats him.\n\n==Other versions==\nIn some versions, the first and second little pigs are not eaten by the wolf after he demolishes their homes, but instead run to their brother's/sister's house, and after the wolf goes down the chimney he either dies like in the original, or runs away and never returns to eat the three little pigs, who all survive in either case.\n\nThe story uses the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], expressed in this case as a \"contrasting three\", as the third pig's brick house turns out to be the only one which is adequate to withstand the wolf.<ref>{{cite book|title = [[The Seven Basic Plots|The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories]] | first = Christopher | last= Booker | publisher = Continuum International Publishing Group | year = 2005 | pages = 230\u2013231 | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=tujDvUEpY10C&pg=PA230 | chapter = The Rule of Three}}</ref>\nVariations of the tale appeared in ''[[Uncle Remus]]: His Songs and Sayings'' in 1881. The story also made an appearance in ''[[Nights with Uncle Remus]]'' in 1883, both by [[Joel Chandler Harris]], in which the pigs were replaced by [[Brer Rabbit]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Green Fairy Book]]'', published in 1892, but did not cite his source. In contrast to Jacobs's version, which left the pigs nameless, Lang's retelling cast the pigs as Browny, Whitey, and Blacky. It also set itself apart by exploring each pig's character and detailing interaction between them. The antagonist of this version is a fox, not a wolf. The pigs' houses are made either of mud, cabbage, or brick. Blacky, the third pig, rescues his brother and sister from the fox's den after the fox has been defeated.\n\n==Later adaptations==\n\n===Disney cartoon===\n{{Main|The Three Little Pigs (film)}}\nThe most well-known version of the story {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} is the award-winning 1933 ''[[Silly Symphonies|Silly Symphony]]'' cartoon, which was produced by [[Walt Disney]]. The production cast the title characters as ''Fifer Pig'', ''Fiddler Pig'', and ''Practical Pig''. The first two are depicted as both frivolous and arrogant. The story has been somewhat softened. The first two pigs still get their houses blown down, but escape from the wolf. Also, the wolf is not boiled to death but simply burns his behind and runs away. Three sequels soon followed in 1934, 1936 and 1939 respectively as a result of the short film's popularity.\n\nFifer Pig, Fiddler Pig, Practical Pig and the Big Bad Wolf appeared in the 2001 series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse]]'' in many episodes, and again in ''[[Mickey's Magical Christmas: Snowed in at the House of Mouse]]''. The three pigs can be seen in [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]] as greetable characters.<ref name=Waldman>{{cite journal|title=In search of the real three little pigs - different versions of the story 'The Three Little Pigs' |magazine=Washington Monthly |date=November 1996 |first=Steven |last=Waldman |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120524134443/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_/ai_18855823 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-24 }}</ref>\n\n===Warner Brothers and MGM versions===\nIn 1943, there was a [[Merrie Melodies]] version, ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'', which was a serious musical treatment, plus the usual [[Friz Freleng]] visual humor. It parodies both the Disney version, and ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' itself.\n\nOther versions of the tale were also made. One was an [[MGM]] [[Tex Avery]] cartoon named ''[[Blitz Wolf]]'', a 1942 wartime version with the Wolf as a Nazi. Another animated spoof was a 1952 [[Warner Brothers]] cartoon called ''[[The Turn-Tale Wolf]]'', directed by Robert McKimson. This cartoon tells the story from the wolf's point of view and makes the pigs out to be the villains. Another Warner Brothers spoof was [[Friz Freleng]]'s ''[[The Three Little Bops]]'' (1957), which depicts the three little pigs as jazz musicians who refuse to let the wolf join their band and their \"houses\" as the nightclubs they play at, each named accordingly.\n\n===Subsequent retellings===\nOne of [[Uncle Remus]]' stories, \"The Story of the Pigs\" (alt. title: \"Brer Wolf and the Pigs\"), found in ''Nights with Uncle Remus'' (1883), is a re-telling of the story, with the following differences:\n* There are five pigs in this version: Big Pig, Little Pig, Speckle Pig, Blunt and Runt.\n* Blunt is the only male; all the rest are females.\n* Big Pig builds a brush house, Little Pig builds a stick house, Speckle Pig builds a mud house, Blunt builds a plank house and Runt builds a stone house.   \n* The Wolf's verse goes: ''\"If you'll open the door and let me in, I'll warm my hands and go home again.\"''\n\nIn 1953, [[Al \"Jazzbo\" Collins]] narrated a jazz version of The Three Little Pigs on a Brunswick Records 78 r.p.m. record album titled \"steve allen's grimm fairy tales for hip kids\" with piano blues accompaniment by Lou Stein. Also in 1953, Tex Avery did a [[Droopy]] cartoon, \"The Three Little Pups\". In it, the wolf is a [[Southern American English|Southern-accented]] dog catcher (voiced by [[Daws Butler]]) trying to catch Droopy and his brothers, Snoopy and Loopy, to put in the dog pound. Though successfully blowing the first two houses down, he meets his match when he fails to blow down Droopy's house of bricks. The dog catcher makes several failed attempts to destroy the house and catch the pups. His last failed attempt ends with him \"going into television\" where he is playing a cowboy on the TV show the pups were watching.\n\nIn 1985, the story was re-told as the first episode of Season Four of ''[[Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre]]'', with [[Billy Crystal]] as artistic \"Larry Pig\" (the smart third pig), [[Jeff Goldblum]] as henpecked \"Buck Wolf\", [[Stephen Furst]] as capitalistic \"Peter Pig\" (the first pig), [[Fred Willard]] as [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] \"Paul Pig\" (the second pig), [[Doris Roberts]] as \"Mother Pig\" and [[Valerie Perrine]] as love interest \"Tina Pig\". In this version, all three pigs buy their building materials from the same junk salesman ([[Larry Hankin]]). \n\nThe 1989 parody ''[[The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs!]]'' is presented as a first-person narrative by the wolf, who portrays the entire incident as a misunderstanding; he had gone to the pigs to borrow some sugar, had destroyed their houses in a sneezing fit, ate the first two pigs to not waste food (since they'd died in the house collapse anyway), and was caught attacking the third pig's house after the pig had continually insulted him.<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\nThe 1992 [[Green Jell\u00f6]] song, ''[[Three Little Pigs (song)|Three Little Pigs]]'' (and its [[claymation]] music video) sets the story in [[Los Angeles]]. The wolf drives a [[Harley Davidson]] motorcycle, the first little pig is an aspiring [[guitarist]], the second is a [[cannabis smoking]], [[dumpster diving]] [[Evangelism|evangelist]] and the third holds a [[Master of Architecture]] degree from [[Harvard University]]. In the end, with all three pigs barricaded in the brick house, the third pig calls [[9-1-1]]. [[John Rambo]] is dispatched to the scene, and kills the wolf with a [[machine gun]].\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''[[The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig]]'' inverts the cast and makes a few changes to the plot: the wolves build a brick house, then a concrete house, then a steel house, and finally a house of flowers. The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List_of_Shrek_characters#Three_Little_Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List_of_Shrek_characters#The_Big_Bad_Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story. The musical was specially written for the band [[K3 (band)|K3]], who play the three little pigs, Pirky, Parky and Porky ({{lang-nl|Knirri, Knarri and Knorri}}).<ref name=\"DiscogsK3\">{{cite web |title=De 3 Biggetjes* - Studio 100 Cd-Collectie 3/10 - Het Beste Van De 3 Biggetjes ! |url=https://www.discogs.com/De-3-Biggetjes-Studio-100-Cd-Collectie-310-Het-Beste-Van-De-3-Biggetjes-/release/2858284 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"BOLK3\">{{cite web |title=bol.com {{!}} De 3 Biggetjes, Various {{!}} CD (album) {{!}} Muziek |url=https://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-3-biggetjes/1000004003213480/ |publisher=[[bol.com]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Peter Lund]] let the three little pigs live together in a village in the musical ''[[Grimm (musical)|Grimm]]'' with [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and other fairy tale characters.\n\nIn 2019, Simon Hood published a contemporary version of the story where the three little pig characters were both [[male]] and [[female]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sooperbooks.com/story/the-three-little-pigs-story/|title=Story Of The Three Little Pigs (Free) {{!}} SooperBooks\u00a9 [2019 Award-winners]|website=Sooper Books|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> Both the [[language]] and the [[Illustration|illustrations]] modernised the story, while the plot itself remained close to traditional versions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{Commons category|Three little pigs}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2oKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=pig&f=false The nursery rhymes of England By James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps], pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[books.google.com]]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/nurseryrhymesofe00hall#page/37/mode/1up The Story of the Three Little Pigs] in The nursery rhymes of England, by Halliwell, pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[Archive.org]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219171434/http://www.shol.com/agita/pigpsych.htm The Three Little Pigs: Pleasure principle versus reality principle], from: ''[[The Uses of Enchantment|The Uses of Enchantment, The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales]]'', by Bruno Bettelheim, Vintage Books, NY, 1975\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0124.html 19th century versions of the Three Little Pigs story]\n* {{librivox book|title=The Three Little Pigs|author=L.

The pig is unable to blow the houses down, destroying them by other means, but eventually gives up his wicked ways when he smells the scent of the flower house, and becomes friends with the wolves.\n\nIn one [[Shining Time Station]] episode, ''Schemer's Alone'', Midge Smoot reads a version of this story to Schemer who paid her an [[IOU]] instead of real money, despite the fact that he's tricking his friends.\n\n[[List_of_Shrek_characters#Three_Little_Pigs|The three pigs]] and the [[List_of_Shrek_characters#The_Big_Bad_Wolf|wolf]] appear in the four [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' films]], and the specials ''[[Shrek the Halls]]'' and ''[[Scared Shrekless]]''.\n\nIn 2003, the [[Belgium|Flemish]] company [[Studio 100]] created a musical called ''Three Little Pigs'' ({{lang-nl|De 3 Biggetjes}}), which follows the three daughters of the pig with the house of stone with new original songs, introducing a completely new story loosely based on the original story. The musical was specially written for the band [[K3 (band)|K3]], who play the three little pigs, Pirky, Parky and Porky ({{lang-nl|Knirri, Knarri and Knorri}}).<ref name=\"DiscogsK3\">{{cite web |title=De 3 Biggetjes* - Studio 100 Cd-Collectie 3/10 - Het Beste Van De 3 Biggetjes ! |url=https://www.discogs.com/De-3-Biggetjes-Studio-100-Cd-Collectie-310-Het-Beste-Van-De-3-Biggetjes-/release/2858284 |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"BOLK3\">{{cite web |title=bol.com {{!}} De 3 Biggetjes, Various {{!}} CD (album) {{!}} Muziek |url=https://www.bol.com/nl/p/de-3-biggetjes/1000004003213480/ |publisher=[[bol.com]] |accessdate=2018-11-21 |language=nl-NL}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, [[Peter Lund]] let the three little pigs live together in a village in the musical ''[[Grimm (musical)|Grimm]]'' with [[Little Red Riding Hood]] and other fairy tale characters.\n\nIn 2019, Simon Hood published a contemporary version of the story where the three little pig characters were both [[male]] and [[female]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sooperbooks.com/story/the-three-little-pigs-story/|title=Story Of The Three Little Pigs (Free) {{!}} SooperBooks\u00a9 [2019 Award-winners]|website=Sooper Books|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> Both the [[language]] and the [[Illustration|illustrations]] modernised the story, while the plot itself remained close to traditional versions.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource}}\n{{Commons category|Three little pigs}}\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=z2oKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA37#v=onepage&q=pig&f=false The nursery rhymes of England By James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps], pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[books.google.com]]\n* [https://archive.org/stream/nurseryrhymesofe00hall#page/37/mode/1up The Story of the Three Little Pigs] in The nursery rhymes of England, by Halliwell, pp.&nbsp;37\u201341 on [[Archive.org]]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081219171434/http://www.shol.com/agita/pigpsych.htm The Three Little Pigs: Pleasure principle versus reality principle], from: ''[[The Uses of Enchantment|The Uses of Enchantment, The Meaning and Importance of Fairy Tales]]'', by Bruno Bettelheim, Vintage Books, NY, 1975\n* [http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0124.html 19th century versions of the Three Little Pigs story]\n* {{librivox book|title=The Three Little Pigs|author=L.

He also spent several seasons in the minor leagues, mainly playing in the [[American Hockey League]].\n\n==Playing career==\nStanley was signed as an undrafted free agent by the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in 1981. After closing out his junior career with the [[Saskatoon Blades]], he turned pro in 1982. After two solid seasons in the minors, he made his NHL debut in [[1983\u201384 NHL season|1983\u201384]], appearing in 23 games down the stretch for the Flyers (and scoring his first NHL goal) along with all three of the team's playoff games. However, his career would undergo a setback the following season, as he suffered career-threatening injuries in a car accident while playing for the [[Hershey Bears]], Philadelphia's [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, and missed most of the year.\n\nHowever, Stanley would battle back, and established himself as a full-time member of the Flyers after being called up again midway through the [[1985\u201386 NHL season|1985\u201386]] season. Blessed with limited natural talent, Stanley was able to stick in the NHL as a useful utility player primarily due to his size and grit, along with his versatility. While his natural position was on the blueline, he would see much of his NHL action as a forward where his size and toughness allowed him to serve as an enforcer. He appeared in 33 games for the Flyers in [[1986\u201387 NHL season|1986\u201387]], and dressed in 13 playoff games as Philadelphia reached the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals before losing to the [[Edmonton Oilers]].\n\nFor the [[1987\u201388 NHL season|1987\u201388]] season, Stanley was dealt to the [[Vancouver Canucks]]. In Vancouver, he received a chance to play more regularly, and responded with his best NHL season, recording 2 goals and 9 points in 57 games along with 151 penalty minutes. He would set a career high with 3 goals in [[1988\u201389 NHL season|1988\u201389]], although injuries limited him to just 20 games. After seeing action in just 23 games in the [[1989\u201390 NHL season|1989\u201390]] campaign, he retired.\n\nStanley finished his NHL career with 8 goals and 17 assists for 25 points in 189 games, along with 408 penalty minutes.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Stanley would become a hunting guide, specializing in ducks and waterfowl, and he currently operates a hunting lodge outside of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].

All three lawyers were originally court-appointed, but after the initial hearings Sayenko requested to be represented by his father, because his appointed lawyer apparently graduated from law school only two months earlier.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The request was granted, which significantly delayed the proceedings as Sayenko's father familiarized himself with the evidence. Igor Sayenko became the most prominent figure on the defense, giving numerous interviews and taking a lead role in court proceedings.\n\nHanzha's attorneys based their defense on the fact that he never participated in the murder spree, and was involved only with a single incident four months before the killings began, in which two men were robbed in the nearby town of [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]]. Hanzha admitted his guilt, hoping for leniency in sentencing.<ref name=\"poleznaya\"/>\n \nThe defense strategy for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including the leader of the arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators, but never the actual moment of discovery.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The legal team also denied that the people in the murder videos were the suspects.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', Igor Sayenko claimed that a fourth suspect named Danila Kozlov was initially charged with the murders.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in an interview that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents, and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders, and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he \"did not murder anyone,\" and that when her attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge \"asked him to sit down.\"<ref name=\"credit\">{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=12946|title=Justice on credit: The case of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs |publisher=Dnepropetrovsk City News|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIgor Sayenko continued to speculate on the influence of the families of the \"real killers\", claiming that he conducted an interview with an escaped victim who wanted his identity kept secret for fear for his life. This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired.<ref name=\"credit\"/> Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. \"But now these details are being covered up\", Sayenko said in court. \"The investigators claim that this did not happen. But there are people, officers in the [[Ukrainian police|Militsiya]], who on July 19, 2007 received reports that those three were arrested. [\u2026] But, alas, it turned out that the persons arrested had powerful parents. So the information was quickly suppressed, and instead my son and two of his friends were railroaded. I also believe that the girl arrested on that day has since left the country and is now in Germany.\"<ref name=\"kiev1\"/>\n\nThe defense team also claimed the prosecution withheld from the court information that exonerated their clients. Igor Sayenko claimed the police interviewed witnesses and recovered evidence from two additional murders. The suspects had a strong alibi for the time of these murders, so all information on these crimes was removed from the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |title=I'm 100% Convinced that my Son did not Murder Anyone! |language=Russian |access-date=2008-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103133523/http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |archive-date=2009-01-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n \nSayenko's defense claimed that he had a \"psychological dependence\" on Suprunyuk, whom they called the ringleader. They claimed that Suprunyuk repeatedly threatened Sayenko, and that Sayenko feared for his life. Sayenko testified in court that he was in constant fear of Suprunyuk since the 7th grade.<ref name=\"mycity\"/>\n\nThe strategy of the defense team received some support from the victims' families, who were reportedly dissatisfied with the slow-moving legal process and an alleged cover-up by the investigators. Some victims' relatives told the media they planned to begin an independent organization to monitor the court proceedings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sayenko from Dnepropetrovsk innocent? |url=http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |language=Russian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231085023/http://ric.ua/index.php?newsid=27170 |archivedate=2008-12-31 }}</ref> The authorities in Ukraine strongly denied that a fourth person was involved in the killings who could still be at large, and said that rumors of similar crimes taking place since the arrest of the three suspects are unfounded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|title=Murders continue after arrest of Dnepropetrovsk maniacs|language=Russian|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070701151420/http://stb.ua/newsv.php?item.4387|archivedate=2007-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Murder videos and photographs ===\nThe suspects' mobile phones and personal computers contained multiple video recordings of the murders. A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48\u2011year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video.<ref name=\"blik video\"/> The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.\n\nThe suspects were also found in possession of multiple photographs showing them attending funerals of the victims. They can be seen smiling and \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipping off]]\" the coffins and gravestones.

He had recently been forced into retirement due to a [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in his throat. The treatment left him unable to speak for some time, but Yatzenko was unhappy with being unable to work and continued to find odd jobs around the village. He took on small construction work, repaired cars, wove baskets and cooked for his family. He was beginning to regain his voice at the time he was murdered. Yatzenko was married and had two sons and one grandchild. He also looked after his disabled mother.\n\nAt around 14:30 on the day of the murder, he called his wife to say he was going to fill his motorcycle and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned [[Dnipro (motorcycle)|Dnepr]] bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe fact that Yatzenko's murder was captured on video was unknown to the public until a court session on 29 October 2008. The unedited video of the murder was shown as part of a large presentation by the prosecution, causing shock in the gallery. The court agreed with the prosecution that the video was genuine, that it showed Suprunyuk attacking the victim, and that Sayenko was the man behind the camera.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko was leaked to a [[shock site]] based in the [[United States]] and dated 4 December 2008.

The yellow plastic bag conceals the hammer used in the attack. A longer version of the Yatzenko murder video was obtained by the Chilean [[television|TV]] documentary series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}''.]]\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the [[Chile]]an television channel [[Red Televisiva Megavisi\u00f3n|MEGA]] broadcast a documentary about the case. It was titled ''{{lang|es|Los man\u00edacos del martillo}}'' (''The Hammer Maniacs'') and ran for 1 hour and 25 minutes as part of the investigative series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}'' (''Here, Live''). Journalist Michele Canale flew to Dnipropetrovsk and interviewed a range of people involved in the case.\n\nThe parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk maintained the innocence of their children, while detectives involved in the case gave their recollections, and repeated the lack of confirmation for the theory that the murder videos had been shot as [[snuff film]]s for sale overseas. Lidia Mikrenischeva, an elderly woman who survived a hammer attack and helped to identify the killers in court, was also interviewed. She recalled being struck on the head from behind and falling to the ground, but her life was saved when the dogs accompanying her barked loudly and scared off the attackers. Natalia Ilchenko, the mother of the first known victim Ekaterina Ilchenko, recalled finding her daughter unrecognizable after the hammer attack, and commented that the killers should not be compared to animals because they killed for fun.\n\nThe documentary was notable for showing a wide range of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Sayenko and Suprunyuk are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their [[Daewoo Lanos]] taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what they are going to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through [[binoculars]] for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director [[Jorge Olgu\u00edn (director)|Jorge Olgu\u00edn]], who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.\n\nThe documentary also showed a video recording of Sayenko's confession, in which he admits that robbery was a motive for some of the killings. A video of Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after an alleged beating by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison, but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still unanswered questions about the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |title=Cap\u00edtulo 6 Aqu\u00ed en Vivo: 'Los man\u00edacos del martillo' |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311011756/http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Alleged copycat case in Irkutsk ==\n\nOn 5 April 2011, two [[Russia]]n youths, Artyom Anoufriev ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0451\u043c \u0410\u043d\u0443\u0444\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432}}) (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin ({{lang-ru|\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0438\u043d}}) (born 1993), known as the [[Academy maniacs]] ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438}}) were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in [[Irkutsk]].

A psychiatric examination found them sane, and they told doctors they chose weak people as their victims.

All three lawyers were originally court-appointed, but after the initial hearings Sayenko requested to be represented by his father, because his appointed lawyer apparently graduated from law school only two months earlier.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The request was granted, which significantly delayed the proceedings as Sayenko's father familiarized himself with the evidence. Igor Sayenko became the most prominent figure on the defense, giving numerous interviews and taking a lead role in court proceedings.\n\nHanzha's attorneys based their defense on the fact that he never participated in the murder spree, and was involved only with a single incident four months before the killings began, in which two men were robbed in the nearby town of [[Kamianske|Dniprodzerzhynsk]]. Hanzha admitted his guilt, hoping for leniency in sentencing.<ref name=\"poleznaya\"/>\n \nThe defense strategy for the other two suspects was to attack the prosecution on a wide front. Multiple investigators were called to the stand, including the leader of the arrest team and the lead investigator in the case. The defense claimed illegal searches, improperly kept records, and problems during questioning. Igor Sayenko raised questions about the videotape of the searches conducted in the suspects' apartments. According to Sayenko, the tape constantly stops and restarts, showing the evidence obtained only after being picked up by investigators, but never the actual moment of discovery.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> The legal team also denied that the people in the murder videos were the suspects.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', Igor Sayenko claimed that a fourth suspect named Danila Kozlov was initially charged with the murders.<ref name=\"kiev1\"/> Tatiana Shram, a sister of victim Elena Shram, also stated in an interview that she saw Kozlov's name mentioned in court documents, and that Kozlov was reportedly aware of the murders, and was with the suspects just before her sister was murdered. Shram further stated that the investigators told her that Kozlov remains free because he \"did not murder anyone,\" and that when her attorney attempted to bring up the matter in court, the judge \"asked him to sit down.\"<ref name=\"credit\">{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=12946|title=Justice on credit: The case of the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs |publisher=Dnepropetrovsk City News|language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIgor Sayenko continued to speculate on the influence of the families of the \"real killers\", claiming that he conducted an interview with an escaped victim who wanted his identity kept secret for fear for his life. This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired.<ref name=\"credit\"/> Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. \"But now these details are being covered up\", Sayenko said in court. \"The investigators claim that this did not happen. But there are people, officers in the Militsiya, who on July 19, 2007 received reports that those three were arrested. [\u2026] But, alas, it turned out that the persons arrested had powerful parents. So the information was quickly suppressed, and instead my son and two of his friends were railroaded.

Igor Sayenko claimed the police interviewed witnesses and recovered evidence from two additional murders. The suspects had a strong alibi for the time of these murders, so all information on these crimes was removed from the case.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |title=I'm 100% Convinced that my Son did not Murder Anyone! |language=Russian |access-date=2008-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103133523/http://gorod.dp.ua/news/news.php?id=10600 |archive-date=2009-01-03 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n \nSayenko's defense claimed that he had a \"psychological dependence\" on Suprunyuk, whom they called the ringleader.

A video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48\u2011year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen lying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One attacker stabs Yatzenko in the eye and abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer to ensure he is dead. The attack lasts over four minutes, during which the victim lapses in and out of consciousness. One murderer is seen smiling towards the camera during the video.<ref name=\"blik video\"/> The murderers walk back to their car, showing that the crime took place close to the side of a road, next to their parked car. They discuss the murder calmly, expressing mild surprise that the victim was still breathing after a screwdriver was plunged into his exposed brain. The suspects then wash their hands and the hammer with a water bottle, and begin to laugh. Only two suspects appear to be present in the video, with one always behind the camera.\n\nThe suspects were also found in possession of multiple photographs showing them attending funerals of the victims. They can be seen smiling and \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipping off]]\" the coffins and gravestones.

His murder took place on 12 July 2007, and his body was found on 16 July.<ref name=\"sergei\"/> Yatzenko was 48 years old. He had recently been forced into retirement due to a [[cancer]]ous [[tumor]] in his throat. The treatment left him unable to speak for some time, but Yatzenko was unhappy with being unable to work and continued to find odd jobs around the village. He took on small construction work, repaired cars, wove baskets and cooked for his family. He was beginning to regain his voice at the time he was murdered. Yatzenko was married and had two sons and one grandchild. He also looked after his disabled mother.\n\nAt around 14:30 on the day of the murder, he called his wife to say he was going to fill his motorcycle and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned [[Dnipro (motorcycle)|Dnepr]] bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe fact that Yatzenko's murder was captured on video was unknown to the public until a court session on 29 October 2008. The unedited video of the murder was shown as part of a large presentation by the prosecution, causing shock in the gallery. The court agreed with the prosecution that the video was genuine, that it showed Suprunyuk attacking the victim, and that Sayenko was the man behind the camera.<ref name=\"sergei\"/>\n\nThe video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko was leaked to a [[shock site]] based in the [[United States]] and dated 4 December 2008.

A longer version of the Yatzenko murder video was obtained by the Chilean [[television|TV]] documentary series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}''.]]\n\nOn 2 August 2010, the [[Chile]]an television channel [[Red Televisiva Megavisi\u00f3n|MEGA]] broadcast a documentary about the case. It was titled ''{{lang|es|Los man\u00edacos del martillo}}'' (''The Hammer Maniacs'') and ran for 1 hour and 25 minutes as part of the investigative series ''{{lang|es|Aqu\u00ed en Vivo}}'' (''Here, Live''). Journalist Michele Canale flew to Dnipropetrovsk and interviewed a range of people involved in the case.\n\nThe parents of Sayenko and Suprunyuk maintained the innocence of their children, while detectives involved in the case gave their recollections, and repeated the lack of confirmation for the theory that the murder videos had been shot as [[snuff film]]s for sale overseas. Lidia Mikrenischeva, an elderly woman who survived a hammer attack and helped to identify the killers in court, was also interviewed. She recalled being struck on the head from behind and falling to the ground, but her life was saved when the dogs accompanying her barked loudly and scared off the attackers. Natalia Ilchenko, the mother of the first known victim Ekaterina Ilchenko, recalled finding her daughter unrecognizable after the hammer attack, and commented that the killers should not be compared to animals because they killed for fun.\n\nThe documentary was notable for showing a wide range of previously unseen photographs and video material from the case. From an anonymous source, the makers obtained a longer and unedited version of the mobile phone video showing the murder of Sergei Yatzenko on 12 July 2007. Sayenko and Suprunyuk are seen standing at the woodland roadside next to their [[Daewoo Lanos]] taxi, waiting for a suitable victim to arrive, and discussing what they are going to do. At one point, Suprunyuk is seen looking through [[binoculars]] for any approaching vehicles. He can also be seen posing with a hammer, which he conceals inside a yellow plastic bag. After 20 minutes, Sergei Yatzenko arrives on a bicycle, and is knocked to the ground before the attack in the woods next to the road begins. Yatzenko's children were asked to take part in the documentary, but declined. According to the commentary, at least five more murder videos are known to exist. The Yatzenko video was shown to the Chilean horror film director [[Jorge Olgu\u00edn (director)|Jorge Olgu\u00edn]], who was so disturbed that he was unable to watch all of it. The documentary also showed brief excerpts from a five-minute video of the murder of another victim of the maniacs, an unidentified man. At one point in the video, the killers comment that the man has a gold tooth. The man was killed with blows to the head and a knife, with some of his personal belongings taken as trophies.\n\nThe documentary also showed a video recording of Sayenko's confession, in which he admits that robbery was a motive for some of the killings. A video of Hanzha was also shown, with his face bruised after an alleged beating by the police. Michele Canale attempted to obtain an interview with the killers in prison, but was denied by the Ukrainian authorities. A range of motives for the killings was examined, and it was concluded that despite the court verdict, there are still unanswered questions about the case.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |title=Cap\u00edtulo 6 Aqu\u00ed en Vivo: 'Los man\u00edacos del martillo' |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-08-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311011756/http://www.mega.cl/programas/aev/capitulos/capitulo-5-aqui-en-vivo-los-maniacos-del-martillo.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 }}</ref>\n\n== Alleged copycat case in Irkutsk ==\n\nOn 5 April 2011, two [[Russia]]n youths, Artyom Anoufriev ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u0440\u0442\u0451\u043c \u0410\u043d\u0443\u0444\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432}}) (born 1992) and Nikita Lytkin ({{lang-ru|\u041d\u0438\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0430 \u041b\u044b\u0442\u043a\u0438\u043d}}) (born 1993), known as the [[Academy maniacs]] ({{lang-ru|\u0410\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438}}) were arrested in connection with six murders and attacks on residents in Akademgorodok in [[Irkutsk]].

According to media reports, the youths were influenced by reading about the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs on the Internet. A psychiatric examination found them sane, and they told doctors they chose weak people as their victims. On 2 April 2013, Anoufriev was sentenced to life imprisonment, and Lytkin to 24 years in prison.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lifenews.ru/news/58330|title=Killers take script from the Internet|publisher=[[LifeNews|Lifenews.ru]]|language=Russian|date=May 12, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615222648/http://www.lifenews.ru/news/58330|archive-date=June 15, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsru.com/crime/09jun2011/nazimaniacconfes.html|title=Maniac from Akademgorodok, Irkutsk records video message, confessing to evil of nationalism|publisher=NEWSru|language=Russian|date=June 9, 2011|accessdate=2011-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611180152/http://www.newsru.com/crime/09jun2011/nazimaniacconfes.html|archive-date=June 11, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irk.kp.ru/online/news/990955/|title=Hammer killers from Akademgorodok to spend longer in jail: trial will not begin before December|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]|language=Russian|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=2011-10-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402233448/http://www.irk.kp.ru/online/news/990955/|archive-date=April 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.vsp.ru/social/2011/10/29/517150|title=Killing \u2013 It's fun|publisher=www.vsp.ru|language=Russian|date=October 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-30|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69x3MLtJZ?url=http://www.vsp.ru/social/2011/10/29/517150|archive-date=August 16, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://38.mvd.ru/news/item/912746/|title=Irkutsk \"hammer killers\" convicted over a series of murders, assassinations and extremism|publisher=38.mvd.ru|language=Russian|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=2013-04-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227183326/http://38.mvd.ru/news/item/912746/|archive-date=February 27, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Ukraine}}\n* [[Nighttime Killers]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dnepropetrovsk maniacs}}\n[[Category:2007 crimes in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian serial killers]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Animal cruelty incidents]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n[[Category:1988 births]]\n[[Category:Filmed killings]]\n[[Category:History of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast]]\n[[Category:Criminal duos]]\n[[Category:2000s murders in Ukraine]]\n[[Category:2007 murders in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Yulia Romero", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInvestigation:links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnepropetrovsk_maniacs"}
