Unsurprisingly, Goldie turns on Louie until she sees that he's invited to Doofus' birthday party and asks him to take her. They arrive pretending to be an aunt and nephew intending to take all of the million-dollar gift bags. However, Doofus sniffs out frauds among his guests and sends them to his \"Honey Bin\", leaving Louie and Goldie; Glomgold and his puppet-son; and Beaks and his robot-son, B.O.Y.D. (Nicolas Cantu). Once he's removed the villains, Doofus demands to know who ruined his party. Goldie blames Louie, so Doofus programs B.O.Y.D. to attack him, but Goldie saves him. The party turns out to be a test, as Doofus claims Goldie as his new \"Gemeemama\". Louie's allowed to leave with the gift bags, but he decides to rescue Goldie. He gives B.O.Y.D. to Doofus as a brother, who transfers half of his fortune to his account for his new parents ([[Yuri Lowenthal]] & [[Tara Platt]]), who finally stand up to Doofus and ground him. During the confusion, Goldie steals the gift bags, but keeps a picture of Louie.

Construction was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], and finally completed around 1868 by the new owner, John R. Wilder.<ref name=sotheby/> Nobody of the Mercer name ever lived in the house.\n\nIn 1969, 11-year-old Tommy Downs fell from the roof of the house and was killed after being impaled on the iron fence on the West Gordon Street (southern) side of the house. It is believed he was hunting pigeons. One of the two spiked prongs he landed on is still broken.<ref>[https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/57678079_10155990175381560_4491466516557987840_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=BCkNFUfAM7UAX__TIK8&_nc_ht=scontent-ort2-2.xx&oh=90abc1d776c3024ff77f6d646486780c&oe=5E9EB11C \"Tragedy Ends Pigeon Hunt\"] - ''Savannah Morning News'', 1969</ref>\n\nFor a period in the twentieth century, the building was used as the Savannah [[Shriners]] Alee Temple.<ref name=smn>''[[Savannah Morning News]]'', May 2 1981</ref> It then lay vacant for a decade until 1969, when [[James Arthur Williams|Jim Williams]], one of Savannah's earliest and most dedicated private restorationists, bought the house for $55,000<ref name=gma>John Berendt on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', 1998</ref> and fully restored it over two years.<ref name=sotheby/> Williams died in 1990, and Dorothy Kingery put the house up for sale later that decade with a price tag of just under $9,000,000.

It consists of a front yard, the house, a [[courtyard]] and a [[carriage house]]. It takes up a city block; the only building in Savannah in private ownership to do so. An [[iron railing]] surrounds the northern, eastern and southern sides of the house, with a brick wall continuing either side between the courtyard and the carriage house.\n\nThe main fa\u00e7ade, facing east onto Monterey Square, has five [[French window]]s (two on the first floor, three on the second).

It is dated 1899 and is estimated at around $10,000. It was given by the Tsar to the [[Qajar dynasty|Shah of Persia]] to commemorate the settlement of a long-standing border dispute. Williams put it on the jade-green coffee table in the drawing room, where it stayed for thirty years. He also owned a large silver-gilt and enamel-mounted leather desk folio, with the initial N 11 and the corners decorated with Imperial eagles.

Founded by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and [[Demetrios Vikelas]] in 1894, it is the authority responsible for organising the modern Summer and Winter [[Olympic Games]].<ref>Roger Bartlett, Chris Gratton, Christer G. Rolf ''Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies''. Routledge, 2012, p. 678</ref>\n\nThe IOC is the governing body of the [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), which are the national constituents of the worldwide Olympic Movement. As of 2016, there are 206 NOCs officially recognized by the IOC. The current President of the IOC is [[Thomas Bach]] of Germany, who succeeded [[Jacques Rogge]] of Belgium in September 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/10/thomas-bach-elected-ioc-president|title=Thomas Bach elected to succeed Jacques Rogge as IOC president|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=2013-09-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe IOC was created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], on 23 June 1894 with [[Demetrios Vikelas]] as its first president. As of April 2019, its membership consists of 95 active members, 44 honorary members, an honorary president ([[Jacques Rogge]]) and two honor members ([[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Youssoupha Ndiaye]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=IOC Members List|url=https://www.olympic.org/ioc-members-list|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref> The IOC is the supreme authority of the worldwide modern Olympic Movement.\n\nThe IOC organizes the modern [[Olympic Games]] and [[Youth Olympic Games]] (YOG), held in Summer and winter, every four years. The first [[Summer Olympics]] was held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]]; the first [[Winter Olympics]] was in [[Chamonix]], [[France]], in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. The first Summer YOG were in [[Singapore]] in [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] and the first Winter YOG in [[Innsbruck]] were in [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]].\n\nUntil 1992, both the Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games, to help space the planning of the two events from one another, and improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives a proportionally higher income in Olympic years.\n\nIn 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] granted the IOC [[Observer status|Permanent Observer]] status. The decision enables the IOC to be directly involved in the UN Agenda and to attend UN General Assembly meetings where it can take the floor. In 1993, the General Assembly approved a Resolution to further solidify IOC\u2013UN cooperation by reviving the [[Olympic Truce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/cooperation-with-the-un|title=Cooperation With The UN|date=21 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring each proclamation at the Olympics, announcers speak in different languages: [[France|French]] is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).\n\nThe IOC received approval in November 2015 to construct a new headquarters in [[Vidy]], Lausanne.

The IOC provides financial support from Olympic broadcast revenue to the 28 IFs of Olympic summer sports and the seven IFs of Olympic winter sports after the completion of the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, respectively.\n\nThe continually increasing value of Olympic broadcast partnership has enabled the IOC to deliver substantially increased financial support to the IFs with each successive Games. The seven winter sports IFs shared US$85.8&nbsp; million, \u20ac75 million in Salt Lake 2002 broadcast revenue. The contribution to the 28 summer sports IFs from Athens 2004 broadcast revenue has not yet been determined, but the grant is expected to mark a significant increase over the US$190&nbsp; million, \u20ac150 million that the IOC provided to the Summer IFs following Sydney 2000.\n\n===Other organisations===\nThe IOC contributes Olympic marketing revenue to the programs of various recognized international sports organizations, including the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC), and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).\n\n==The Olympic Partner programme==\n{{Further|List of the Olympic Partner sponsorship programmes}}\nThe Olympic Partner (TOP) sponsorship programme includes the following commercial sponsors of the Olympic Games. \n* [[Airbnb]]\n* [[Allianz]]\n* [[Alibaba Group]]\n* [[Atos]]\n* [[Bridgestone]]\n* [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]]\n* [[Dow Chemical Company]]\n* [[General Electric]]\n* [[Intel]]\n* [[Mengniu Dairy]] (joint partnership with Coca-Cola)\n* [[Omega SA]] (previously [[The Swatch Group]], its parent company)\n* [[Panasonic]]\n* [[Procter & Gamble]]\n* [[Samsung]]\n* [[Toyota]]\n* [[Visa Inc.]]\n\n==Environmental concerns==\nThe IOC recognizes that the Olympic Games demand substantial environmental resources, activities, and construction projects that could be detrimental to a host city's environment.<ref name=Jin2008{{>Jin Y, Zhang JJ, Ma X, Connaughton DP.

First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games.<ref>https://www.olympic.org/sustainability-and-legacy-commission</ref> Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on environmental health issues like air quality and environmental impact assessments. Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare \"pledges\" to address specific or general environmental health concerns of hosting the Olympic Games. Fourthly, the IOC has every host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives.<ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44575.pdf</ref> Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches in an attempt to minimize the negative environmental health concerns of a host city.\n\n===Venue construction effects on air===\nCities hosting the Olympic Games have two primary concerns: traffic congestion and air pollution, both of which can result in compromised air quality during and after Olympic venue construction.<ref name=\" Qiao Q 2011 \">Qiao Q, Zhang C, Huang B, Piper JDA.

Vol. 43; 4535-4543.</ref> The particulate matter in the air, along with other airborne pollutants, cause both serious health problems, such as [[asthma]], and contribute to the deterioration of urban ecosystems. Black Carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids contributing to global climate change and human health effects. The truck traffic highly impacts the black carbon concentrations due to the traffic congestion during the massive construction. Additionally, secondary pollutants like [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[NOx]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO2]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylenes]] (BTEX) are also released during the venue construction, resulting in harmful effects to the environment.<ref>Wang T et al. (2010). Air quality during the 2008 Beijing Olympics: secondary pollutants and regional impact. Atmos. Chem. Phys. Vol. 10; 7603\u20137615.</ref>\n\n====Methods to measure particulates in the air====\nEnvironmental magnetic methods have been established as a successful way of measuring the degree of pollution in air, water, and soil. Environmental magnetism is sensitive to particle size and has proven effective even at low detection levels. For these reasons, it is becoming more widely used.\n\n====Measures taken to improve air quality====\nVarious [[air quality]] measures are undertaken before and after the Olympic Games. Research studies demonstrate that the primary method to reduce concentrations of air pollutants is traffic control, including barring heavy vehicles from the roads. For the Beijing Olympics, vehicles not meeting the Euro 1 emission standards were also banned from the roads, and the odd-even rule was implemented in the Beijing administrative area. Additional air quality improvement measures include replacing coal with natural gas, suspending construction and imposing strict dust control on construction sites, closing or relocating the polluting industrial plants, building long subway lines, using cleaner fluid in power plants, and reducing the activity by some of the polluting factories. These were several air quality improvement measures implemented by the Beijing government. There, levels of primary and secondary pollutants were reduced, and good air quality was recorded during the Beijing Olympics on most of the days.\n\n===Venue construction effects on soil===\n[[Soil contamination]] can occur during the process of constructing the Olympic venues. In the case of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, negative environmental impacts were observed, including impacts on soil. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas which the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They performed an extensive analysis of the types of chemicals found in the soils in these areas both before and after the Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoils post-Games and indicated that soil was capable, as part of an ecosystem, of negating, or \"buffering,\" the effects of many heavy metals. However, their findings also revealed that this was not the case for all metals and that mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred into the food chain on a massive scale.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Soil Heavy Metals Patterns in the Torino Olympic Winter Games Venue (E.U.)|journal=Soil and Sediment Contamination|pages=205\u2013220|volume=17|issue=3|doi=10.1080/15320380802006905|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01577545/file/article.pdf}}</ref>\nOne of the promises made to Londoners when they won the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a \"blueprint for sustainable living.\" However, residents of the allotments of Manor Road were relocated, due to the building of the Olympic stadium. They would later disagree that the Olympics had had any positive effect on their lives. Allotments, originally, were intended to provide low-income residents with a plot of land on which to grow their food, thus receiving the dual health benefits of a supply of fresh food and outdoor work. Many of these sites were lost as a result of the Olympic venue construction, most notably the Manor Road site. Residents were promised that the allotments would be returned, and they eventually were. However, soil quality would never be the same. Crops tended by allotment residents were the result of years of careful cultivation, and thus, those years of care and attention were destroyed by a bulldozer. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months before moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other residents, construction workers, and onsite archeologists faced similar exposures and risks.<ref>Sadd D. (2012). Not all Olympic' events' are good for health. Just ask the previous occupants of the Manor Road. Allotments Perspectives in Public Health. Vol. 132; 2, 62\u201363.[SIC]</ref>\nIn contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 provided an opportunity to improve a highly contaminated area known as the Homebush Bay site. A study commissioned by the New South Wales Government Olympic Coordination Authority, which was responsible for the Games' site preparation, looked at soil contamination before the Games. The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that could pose a risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to contaminate groundwater potentially. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney's winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the \"greenest\" single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.<ref>Suh J-Y, Birch G. F., Hughes K., Matthai C. (2004) Spatial distribution and source of heavy metals in reclaimed lands of Homebush Bay: the venue of the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney, New South Wales. Australian Journal of Earth Sciences. Vol. 51: 53\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Venue construction effects on water===\nThe Olympic Games can affect water quality in the surrounding region in several ways, including water runoff and the transfer of polluting substances from the air to water sources through rainfall. Harmful particulates come from both natural substances (such as plant matter crushed by higher volumes of pedestrian and vehicle traffic) and human-made substances (such as exhaust from vehicles or industry). Contaminants from these two categories lead to elevated amounts of toxins in street dust. Street dust then reaches water sources through runoff, facilitating the transfer of toxins to environments and communities that rely on these water sources.<ref name= \"Qiao Q 2011\"/> For example, one method of measuring the runoff contamination of water sources involves magnetism. Magnetism measurement systems allow specialists to measure the differences in mineral magnetic parameters in samples of water, air, and vegetation. Unlike traditional methods of measuring pollutants, magnetism is relatively inexpensive, and can identify smaller particle sizes.<ref>, Qiao, 1223.</ref>\nAnother method used to assess the amount and effects of water pollutants is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle\u22642.5 \u03bcm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources.<ref>Ouyang W et. al. The washing effect of precipitation on particulate matter and the pollution dynamics of rainwater in downtown Beijing. Science of the Total Environment. Vol. 505; 306\u2013314. 1 February 2015.</ref> In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant \"washing\" effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources.<ref>Ouyang W. 313.</ref> In this way, Beijing's notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Olympic Games infobox}}\n\n===Amateurism and professionalism===\n{{main|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}\n\n[[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the IOC, was influenced by the ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[Independent school (UK)|English public schools]].<ref name=OIdeology>{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120\u2013123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}</ref> The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education and there was a prevailing concept of fairness in which practicing or training was considered cheating.<ref name=OIdeology/> As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.<ref name=OIdeology/> The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage.

[[Sports governing body|sports organisation]] based in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. Founded by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and [[Demetrios Vikelas]] in 1894, it is the authority responsible for organising the modern Summer and Winter [[Olympic Games]].<ref>Roger Bartlett, Chris Gratton, Christer G. Rolf ''Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies''. Routledge, 2012, p. 678</ref>\n\nThe IOC is the governing body of the [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), which are the national constituents of the worldwide Olympic Movement. As of 2016, there are 206 NOCs officially recognised by the IOC. The current president of the IOC is [[Thomas Bach]] of Germany, who succeeded [[Jacques Rogge]] of Belgium in September 2013.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/10/thomas-bach-elected-ioc-president|title=Thomas Bach elected to succeed Jacques Rogge as IOC president|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=2013-09-10|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-02-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe IOC was created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], on 23 June 1894 with [[Demetrios Vikelas]] as its first president. As of April 2019, its membership consists of 95 active members, 44 honorary members, an honorary president ([[Jacques Rogge]]) and two honour members ([[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Youssoupha Ndiaye]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=IOC Members List|url=https://www.olympic.org/ioc-members-list|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref> The IOC is the supreme authority of the worldwide modern Olympic Movement.\n\nThe IOC organises the modern [[Olympic Games]] and [[Youth Olympic Games]] (YOG), held in summer and winter, every four years. The first [[Summer Olympics]] was held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]]; the first [[Winter Olympics]] was in [[Chamonix]], [[France]], in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. The first Summer YOG were in [[Singapore]] in [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] and the first Winter YOG in [[Innsbruck]] were in [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]].\n\nUntil 1992, both Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games, to help space the planning of the two events from one another, and improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives a proportionally greater income in Olympic years.\n\nIn 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] granted the IOC [[Observer status|Permanent Observer]] status. The decision enables the IOC to be directly involved in the UN Agenda and to attend UN General Assembly meetings where it can take the floor. In 1993, the General Assembly approved a Resolution to further solidify IOC\u2013UN cooperation by reviving the [[Olympic Truce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/cooperation-with-the-un|title=Cooperation With The UN|date=21 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring each proclamation at the Olympics, announcers speak in different languages: [[France|French]] is always spoken first, followed by an English translation, and then the dominant language of the host nation (when this is not English or French).\n\nThe IOC received approval in November 2015 to construct a new headquarters in [[Vidy]], Lausanne. The cost of the project was estimated to stand at $156m.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/culture/olympic-spirit_lausanne-gives-green-light-to-new-ioc-headquarters/41799974|title=Lausanne gives green light to new IOC headquarters|last=swissinfo.ch|first=S.

The IOC distributes TOP programme revenue to each of the NOCs throughout the world. The IOC also contributes Olympic broadcast revenue to Olympic Solidarity, an IOC organisation that provides financial support to NOCs with the greatest need.\n\nThe continued success of the TOP programme and Olympic broadcast agreements has enabled the IOC to provide increased support for the NOCs with each Olympic quadrennium. The IOC provided approximately US$318.5&nbsp;million to NOCs for the 2001\u20132004 quadrennium.\n\n===International Olympic Sports Federations===\nThe IOC is now the largest single revenue source for the majority of [[List of international sports federations|IFs]], with its contributions of Olympic broadcast revenue that assist the IFs in the development of their respective sports worldwide. The IOC provides financial support from Olympic broadcast revenue to the 28 IFs of Olympic summer sports and the seven IFs of Olympic winter sports after the completion of the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, respectively.\n\nThe continually increasing value of Olympic broadcast partnership has enabled the IOC to deliver substantially increased financial support to the IFs with each successive Games. The seven winter sports IFs shared US$85.8&nbsp;million, \u20ac75 million in Salt Lake 2002 broadcast revenue. The contribution to the 28 summer sports IFs from Athens 2004 broadcast revenue has not yet been determined, but the contribution is expected to mark a significant increase over the US$190&nbsp;million, \u20ac150 million that the IOC provided to the summer IFs following Sydney 2000.\n\n===Other organisations===\nThe IOC contributes Olympic marketing revenue to the programmes of various recognised international sports organisations, including the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC), and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).\n\n==The Olympic Partner programme==\n{{Further|List of the Olympic Partner sponsorship programmes}}\nThe Olympic Partner (TOP) sponsorship programme includes the following commercial sponsors of the Olympic Games. \n* [[Airbnb]]\n* [[Allianz]]\n* [[Alibaba Group]]\n* [[Atos]]\n* [[Bridgestone]]\n* [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]]\n* [[Dow Chemical Company]]\n* [[General Electric]]\n* [[Intel]]\n* [[Mengniu Dairy]] (joint partnership with Coca-Cola)\n* [[Omega SA]] (previously [[The Swatch Group]], its parent company)\n* [[Panasonic]]\n* [[Procter & Gamble]]\n* [[Samsung]]\n* [[Toyota]]\n* [[Visa Inc.]]\n\n==Environmental concerns==\nThe IOC recognizes that the Olympic Games demand substantial environmental resources, activities, and construction projects that could be detrimental to a host city's environment.<ref name=Jin2008{{>Jin Y, Zhang JJ, Ma X, Connaughton DP.

First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games.<ref>https://www.olympic.org/sustainability-and-legacy-commission</ref> Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on environmental health issues like air quality and environmental impact assessments. Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare \"pledges\" to address specific or general environmental health concerns of hosting the Olympic Game. Fourthly, the IOC has every host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives.<ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44575.pdf</ref> Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches in an attempt to minimize the negative environmental health concerns of a host city.\n\n===Venue construction effects on air===\nCities hosting the Olympic Games have two primary concerns: traffic congestion and air pollution, both of which can result in compromised air quality during and after Olympic venue construction.<ref name=\"Qiao Q 2011\">Qiao Q, Zhang C, Huang B, Piper JDA.

Vol. 43; 4535-4543.</ref> The particulate matter in the air, along with other airborne pollutants, cause both serious health problems, such as [[asthma]], and contribute to the deterioration of urban ecosystems. Black Carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids contributing to global climate change and human health effects. The black carbon concentrations are highly impacted by the truck traffic due to the traffic congestion during the massive construction. Additionally, secondary pollutants like [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[NOx]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO2]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylenes]] (BTEX) are also released during the venue construction, resulting in harmful effects to the environment.<ref>Wang T et. al. (2010). Air quality during the 2008 Beijing Olympics: secondary pollutants and regional impact. Atmos. Chem. Phys. Vol. 10; 7603\u20137615.</ref>\n\n====Methods to measure particulates in the air====\nEnvironmental magnetic methods have been established as a successful way of measuring the degree of pollution in air, water and soil. Environmental magnetism is sensitive to particle size, and has proven effective even at low detection levels. For these reasons, it is becoming more widely used.\n\n====Measures taken to improve air quality====\nVarious [[air quality]] measures are undertaken before and after the Olympic Games. Research studies demonstrate that the primary method to reduce concentrations of air pollutants is traffic control, including barring heavy vehicles from the roads. For the Beijing Olympics, vehicles not meeting the Euro 1 emission standards were also banned from the roads, and the odd-even rule was implemented in the Beijing administrative area. Additional air quality improvement measures include replacing coal with natural gas, suspending construction and/or imposing strict dust control on construction sites, closing or relocating the polluting industrial plants, building long subway lines, using cleaner fluid in power plants, and reducing the activity by some of the polluting factories. These were several air quality improvement measures implemented by the Beijing government. There, levels of primary and secondary pollutants were reduced, and good air quality was recorded during the Beijing Olympics on most of the days.\n\n===Venue construction effects on soil===\n[[Soil contamination]] can occur during the process of constructing the Olympic venues. In the case of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, negative environmental impacts were observed, including impacts on soil. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas which the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They performed an extensive analysis in the types of chemicals found in the soils in these areas both before and after the Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoils post-Games, and indicated that soil was capable, as part of an ecosystem, of negating, or \"buffering,\" the effects of many heavy metals. However, their findings also revealed that this was not the case for all metals, and that mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred into the food chain on a massive scale.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Soil Heavy Metals Patterns in the Torino Olympic Winter Games Venue (E.U.)|journal=Soil and Sediment Contamination|pages=205\u2013220|volume=17|issue=3|doi=10.1080/15320380802006905|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01577545/file/article.pdf}}</ref>\nOne of the promises made to Londoners when they won the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a \"blueprint for sustainable living.\" However, residents of the allotments of Manor Road were relocated, due to the building of the Olympic stadium, and would later disagree that the Olympics had had any positive effect on their lives. Allotments, originally, were intended to provide low-income residents with a plot of land on which to grow their own food, thus receiving the dual health benefits of a supply of fresh food and outdoor work. Many of these sites were lost as a result of the Olympic venue construction, most notably the Manor Road site. Residents were promised that the allotments would be returned, and they eventually were. However, the soil quality would never be the same. Crops tended by allotment residents were the result of years of careful cultivation, and thus, those years of care and attention were destroyed by a bulldozer. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months prior to moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other local residents, construction workers, and onsite archeologists faced similar exposures and risks.<ref>Sadd D. (2012). Not all Olympic 'events' are good for the health just ask the previous occupants of the Manor Road. Allotments Perspectives in Public Health. Vol. 132; 2, 62\u201363.[SIC]</ref>\nIn contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 provided an opportunity to improve a highly contaminated area known as the Homebush Bay site. A study commissioned by the New South Wales Government Olympic Coordination Authority, which was responsible for the Games' site preparation, looked at soil contamination prior to the Games. The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that could pose a risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney's winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the \"greenest\" single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.<ref>Suh J-Y, Birch G. F., Hughes K., Matthai C. (2004) Spatial distribution and source of heavy metals in reclaimed lands of Homebush Bay: the venue of the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney, New South Wales. Australian Journal of Earth Sciences. Vol. 51: 53\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Venue construction effects on water===\nThe Olympic Games can affect water quality in the surrounding region in several ways, including water runoff and the transfer of polluting substances from the air to water sources through rainfall. Harmful particulates come from both natural substances (such as plant matter crushed by higher volumes of pedestrian and vehicle traffic) and man-made substances (such as exhaust from vehicles or industry). Contaminants from these two categories lead to elevated amounts of toxins in street dust. Street dust then reaches water sources through runoff, facilitating the transfer of toxins to environments and communities that rely on these water sources.<ref name=\"Qiao Q 2011\"/> For example, one method of measuring the runoff contamination of water sources involves magnetism. Magnetism measurement systems allow specialists to measure the differences in mineral magnetic parameters in samples of water, air, and vegetation. Unlike traditional methods of measuring pollutants, magnetism is relatively inexpensive, and can identify smaller particle sizes.<ref>Qiao, 1223.</ref>\nAnother method used to assess the amount and effects of water pollutants is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle\u22642.5 \u03bcm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources.<ref>Ouyang W et. al. The washing effect of precipitation on particulate matter and the pollution dynamics of rainwater in downtown Beijing. Science of the Total Environment. Vol. 505; 306\u2013314. 1 February 2015.</ref> In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant \"washing\" effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources.<ref>Ouyang W. 313.</ref> In this way, Beijing's notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Olympic Games infobox}}\n\n===Amateurism and professionalism===\n{{main|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}\n\n[[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the IOC, was influenced by the ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[Independent school (UK)|English public schools]].<ref name=OIdeology>{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120\u2013123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}</ref> The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education and there was a prevailing concept of fairness in which practicing or training was considered cheating.<ref name=OIdeology/> As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.<ref name=OIdeology/> The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage.

The MacLarnon Cup is the competition for schools at senior 'B' grade.\n\nPlayers must be under nineteen at the start of the tournament. The winners advance to the semi-finals of the [[Hogan Cup]], the All-Ireland colleges \"A\" senior football championship.\n\nThe competition and trophy are named after [[Joseph MacRory]], then [[Bishop of Down and Connor]], who donated the first cup in 1923.\n\nThe 2018\u201319 winners were St Michaels College, Enniskillen who beat Omagh CBS in the final on 18 March 2019.\nThe 2020 final, along with all other Gaelic game activity, between [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera|St. Patrick's, Maghera]] was postponed due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus Pandemic]]<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/games-postponed/</ref>\n\nThe final is held every year on (or close to) St. Patrick's Day and is televised live on [[BBC Northern Ireland]] along with the [[Ulster Schools Cup|Ulster Rugby Schools Cup]] final. The venue for the last number of years has been the [[Athletic Grounds]] in Armagh. Previous finals have been held in [[Coalisland]] and [[Casement Park]].\n\n==History==\nAn inter-seminary football competition between [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's College, Monaghan]] and [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh]] had been started in 1902. This was a soccer competition until, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, a vote was taken to change over to Gaelic rules and St Patrick\u2019s won the first Gaelic encounter in 1918 by 4-4 to 0-1.\n\nBishop [[Joseph MacRory]], the Bishop of Down and Connor at this time, \u201coffered\u201d to present a Cup for the winners of an Ulster Secondary schools\u2019 competition. The \u201coffer\u201d was not honoured for another five seasons however and in the interim the matches between other seminaries and St Patrick\u2019s Armagh are recorded as \u201cchallenges\u201d until the arrival of the first MacRory Cup in late spring 1923.\n\nOver the next five seasons the competition was played on a league basis until in 1928 an Ulster Colleges\u2019 Committee was established and the MacRory Cup competition became the new body\u2019s main competition.  Participation in the MacRory Cup in its early years was confined to those who attended boarding schools. [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]] were the first winners in 1923, and dominated the competition in its early years. First time victories by other challengers were recorded by [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's]] (1930), [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan]] (1935), and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] (1949).\n\nThe 1930s was notable for the affiliation of a number of Christian Brothers\u2019 schools. These were \u2018day schools\u2019 (i.e. non boarding schools) which catered mainly for boys from humble backgrounds, but they did not yet have the prowess to compete with the established diocesan colleges, as was confirmed by comprehensive defeats for Monaghan CBS (1935), and [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS, Newry]] (1944 and 1947).\n\n1954 was a watershed year in that the triumph of [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] after a replay over [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan|St Patrick\u2019s Cavan]] was the first MacRory Cup win by a \u2018day school\u2019; the [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] repeated this feat in 1959 and 1964, but no other day school made the breakthrough until St Mary\u2019s CBS in 1971; next came Omagh CBS in 1974.\n\n1976 marks another significant landmark in the history of the competition although that particular Final ended in defeat for [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] a. It ushered in an extraordinary sequence of 14 Final appearances by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] in the following 15 years, 8 of which were won, including 4 consecutive victories 1982-85. Those 15 years witnessed a legendary rivalry between [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] when they faced one another in 10 Finals, including replays. These included the iconic 1989 Final, won by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] on the scoreline 4-10 to 4-9, a game which is widely and rightly regarded as one of the greatest ever played at any level in Ulster. Those were the days when the blanket defence would have been regarded as a distasteful, unchivalrous, and unthinkable option.\n\nThe 1990s marked the arrival of [[St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon]] and [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's College, Enniskillen]] at centre stage, and accelerated change in the educational domain with the disappearance of the remaining boarding departments in schools, and an equalisation in standards across a greater range of schools.\n\nThe new millennium produced a victory in 2000 for the original kingpins, [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]], their first victory since 1953, and the next decade was marked by the emergence and appearance of [[Christian Brothers Grammar School, Omagh|Omagh CBS]] in 7 Finals.\n\nThe MacRory Cup, first donated by [[Joseph MacRory|Bishop MacRory]] in 1923, is now fiercely contested by 10 schools annually, and a feature of each successive year is the number of genuine contenders and the unpredictability of the outcome. That original trophy was replaced in 1962, and that trophy, in turn, was retired and donated to the O\u2019Fiaich Library in February 2012. A magnificent replacement trophy has been donated to Ulster Colleges by Cardinal Brady, thereby perpetuating the historic link between the Archdiocese of Armagh and this unique competition. The trophy won in March 2012 by [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's, Enniskillen]] is therefore the 3rd Cup to bear the name of the original visionary, Cardinal MacRory.\n\nFifteen schools have their names on the MacRory Cup with [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] winning the first of their record 19 titles in 1949 and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]], who are in second place with 15 crowns, won their first in 1977.\n\n[[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] also lead the way in terms of [[Hogan Cup]] titles won by Ulster schools with eight and five respectively.\n<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/history/macrory-cup/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/11/01/news/macrory-cup-the-stats-1748138/</ref>\n\n==Competition format==\n'''Current Format'''\n\nThe format introduced at the start of the 2017-18 season continues. Sixteen teams compete in four groups of four teams. After the group rounds, all matches are knock-out. The four group winners are given byes to the quarter-finals. The four teams who finished third play the four teams who finished fourth in playoff round 1 with the winners playing the four group runners-up in playoff round 2 for the four remaining quarter-final places.\n\n'''2016-17 Format'''\n\nThe format was changed for the 2016-17 season. Fourteen teams competed in three groups - Groups A and B had five teams and Group C had four teams. The three group winners and the best group runner-up advanced to the quarter-finals. The fifth-placed teams in groups A and B were eliminated. The remaining eight teams played-off in four matches with the four winners completing the quarter-final line-up. From the quarter-finals onwards all matches were knock-out.<ref>{{cite web|title=New MacRory Cup format for 2016-7|url=http://ulstercollegesgaa.org/general/new-macrory-cup-format-for-2016-7/|accessdate=14 July 2016|date=24 June 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918093050/http://ulstercollegesgaa.org/general/new-macrory-cup-format-for-2016-7/|archivedate=18 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''Previous Format'''\n\nThe competition began with a round-robin tournament consisting of two groups of six teams.

The MacLarnon Cup is the competition for schools at senior 'B' grade.\n\nPlayers must be under nineteen at the start of the tournament. The winners advance to the semi-finals of the [[Hogan Cup]], the All-Ireland colleges \"A\" senior football championship.\n\nThe competition and trophy are named after [[Joseph MacRory]], then [[Bishop of Down and Connor]], who donated the first cup in 1923.\n\nThe 2018\u201319 winners were St Michaels College, Enniskillen who beat Omagh CBS in the final on 18 March 2019.\nThe 2020 final, along with all other Gaelic game activity, between [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera|St. Patrick's, Maghera]] was postponed due to the [[2019-20 coronavirus pandemic|Coronavirus Pandemic]]<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/games-postponed/</ref>\n\nThe final is held every year on (or close to) St. Patrick's Day and is televised live on [[BBC Northern Ireland]] along with the [[Ulster Schools Cup|Ulster Rugby Schools Cup]] final. The venue for the last number of years has been the [[Athletic Grounds]] in Armagh. Previous finals have been held in [[Coalisland]] and [[Casement Park]].\n\n==History==\nAn inter-seminary football competition between [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's College, Monaghan]] and [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh]] had been started in 1902. This was a soccer competition until, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, a vote was taken to change over to Gaelic rules and St Patrick\u2019s won the first Gaelic encounter in 1918 by 4-4 to 0-1.\n\nBishop [[Joseph MacRory]], the Bishop of Down and Connor at this time, \u201coffered\u201d to present a Cup for the winners of an Ulster Secondary schools\u2019 competition. The \u201coffer\u201d was not honoured for another five seasons however and in the interim the matches between other seminaries and St Patrick\u2019s Armagh are recorded as \u201cchallenges\u201d until the arrival of the first MacRory Cup in late spring 1923.\n\nOver the next five seasons the competition was played on a league basis until in 1928 an Ulster Colleges\u2019 Committee was established and the MacRory Cup competition became the new body\u2019s main competition.  Participation in the MacRory Cup in its early years was confined to those who attended boarding schools. [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]] were the first winners in 1923, and dominated the competition in its early years. First time victories by other challengers were recorded by [[St Macartan's College|St. Macartan's]] (1930), [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan]] (1935), and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] (1949).\n\nThe 1930s was notable for the affiliation of a number of Christian Brothers\u2019 schools. These were \u2018day schools\u2019 (i.e. non boarding schools) which catered mainly for boys from humble backgrounds, but they did not yet have the prowess to compete with the established diocesan colleges, as was confirmed by comprehensive defeats for Monaghan CBS (1935), and [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS, Newry]] (1944 and 1947).\n\n1954 was a watershed year in that the triumph of [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] after a replay over [[St. Patrick's College, Cavan|St Patrick\u2019s Cavan]] was the first MacRory Cup win by a \u2018day school\u2019; the [[Abbey Christian Brothers' Grammar School|Abbey CBS]] repeated this feat in 1959 and 1964, but no other day school made the breakthrough until St Mary\u2019s CBS in 1971; next came Omagh CBS in 1974.\n\n1976 marks another significant landmark in the history of the competition although that particular Final ended in defeat for [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] a. It ushered in an extraordinary sequence of 14 Final appearances by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] in the following 15 years, 8 of which were won, including 4 consecutive victories 1982-85. Those 15 years witnessed a legendary rivalry between [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] and [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] when they faced one another in 10 Finals, including replays. These included the iconic 1989 Final, won by [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] on the scoreline 4-10 to 4-9, a game which is widely and rightly regarded as one of the greatest ever played at any level in Ulster. Those were the days when the blanket defence would have been regarded as a distasteful, unchivalrous, and unthinkable option.\n\nThe 1990s marked the arrival of [[St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon]] and [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's College, Enniskillen]] at centre stage, and accelerated change in the educational domain with the disappearance of the remaining boarding departments in schools, and an equalisation in standards across a greater range of schools.\n\nThe new millennium produced a victory in 2000 for the original kingpins, [[St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh|St. Patrick's Armagh]], their first victory since 1953, and the next decade was marked by the emergence and appearance of [[Christian Brothers Grammar School, Omagh|Omagh CBS]] in 7 Finals.\n\nThe MacRory Cup, first donated by [[Joseph MacRory|Bishop MacRory]] in 1923, is now fiercely contested by 10 schools annually, and a feature of each successive year is the number of genuine contenders and the unpredictability of the outcome. That original trophy was replaced in 1962, and that trophy, in turn, was retired and donated to the O\u2019Fiaich Library in February 2012. A magnificent replacement trophy has been donated to Ulster Colleges by Cardinal Brady, thereby perpetuating the historic link between the Archdiocese of Armagh and this unique competition. The trophy won in March 2012 by [[St. Michael's College (Enniskillen)|St. Michael's, Enniskillen]] is therefore the 3rd Cup to bear the name of the original visionary, Cardinal MacRory.\n\nFifteen schools have their names on the MacRory Cup with [[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] winning the first of their record 19 titles in 1949 and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]], who are in second place with 15 crowns, won their first in 1977.\n\n[[St Colman's College, Newry|St. Colman's College, Newry]] and [[St. Patrick's College, Maghera]] also lead the way in terms of [[Hogan Cup]] titles won by Ulster schools with eight and five respectively.\n<ref>http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/history/macrory-cup/</ref>\n<ref>https://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/11/01/news/macrory-cup-the-stats-1748138/</ref>\n\n==Competition format==\n'''Current Format'''\n\nThe format introduced at the start of the 2017-18 season continues. Sixteen teams compete in four groups of four teams. After the group rounds, all matches are knock-out. The four group winners are given byes to the quarter-finals. The four teams who finished third play the four teams who finished fourth in playoff round 1 with the winners playing the four group runners-up in playoff round 2 for the four remaining quarter-final places.\n\n'''2016-17 Format'''\n\nThe format was changed for the 2016-17 season.

McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.

McConnell Jr.''' (born February 20, 1942) is an American politician serving as Kentucky's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States senator]] and as [[Senate Majority Leader]]. McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the Senate, the longest-serving U.S. senator for Kentucky in history, and the longest-serving leader of U.S. Senate Republicans in history.\n\nMcConnell was first elected to the Senate [[United States Senate election in Kentucky, 1984|in 1984]] and has been re-elected five times since. During the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, he was chairman of the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]]. McConnell was elected as [[Majority Whip]] in the [[108th Congress]] and was re-elected to the post in 2004. In November 2006, he was elected Senate [[Minority Leader]]; he held that post until 2015, when Republicans took control of the Senate and he became Senate Majority Leader.\n\nMcConnell was known as a [[Realpolitik|pragmatist]] and a [[moderate]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] early in his political career but shifted to the right over time. He led opposition to stricter campaign finance laws, culminating in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that partially overturned the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] (McCain-Feingold) in 2009. During the [[Obama administration]], McConnell worked to withhold Republican support for major presidential initiatives, made frequent use of the [[Filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]], and blocked many of [[Obama]]'s judicial nominees, including [[Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination|Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland]]. Under McConnell's leadership of the Senate, Obama saw the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the final two years of a presidency since 1951\u201352. During the [[Trump administration]], Senate Republicans, under McConnell's leadership, broke records on the number of judicial nominees confirmed; among those nominees were [[Neil Gorsuch]] and [[Brett Kavanaugh]] who were confirmed to the Supreme Court. McConnell was included in the [[Time 100|''Time'' 100]] list of the most influential people in the world in 2015.\n\n==Early life and education (1942\u20131967)==\nMcConnell was born February 20, 1942, to Addison Mitchell McConnell, Sr. (1917-1990) and Julia Odene \"Dean\" ([[n\u00e9e]] Shockley) McConnell (1919-1993).<ref name=\"memoir\">{{Cite book |title=The Long Game: a Memoir |last=McConnell |first=Mitch|publisher=Sentinel|year=2016|isbn=9780399564123|location=New York, NY|chapter=Chapter One: A fighting spirit |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cO3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA9 |page=9 |quote=She'd been known her whole life not by her first name, Julia, which she loved, but by her middle name, Odene, which she detested.

He was allowed to leave post just five days later, though McConnell maintains that no one helped him with his enlistment into or discharge from the reserves.
