Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.\n\nAt the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams's fate.\n\nLee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a gruelling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his museum. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. A bruised and bloodied Roper sits victorious while the military finally arrive to take control of the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as Lee\n* [[John Saxon]] as Roper\n* [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]] as Williams<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2|title= DVD set is devoted to '70s martial arts star Jim Kelly |newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 10 January 2010|accessdate=28 January 2011 | first=Steve | last=Ryfle|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180715233633/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2 |archive-date= 15 July 2018 }}</ref>\n* [[Ahna Capri]] as Tania<ref>{{cite news |title=Car Accident Claims Ahna Capri |publisher=[[Inside Kung Fu]] |url=http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37/ |accessdate=10 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311115341/http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37 |archivedate=11 March 2011  }}</ref>\n* [[Shih Kien]] as Han (voice dubbed by [[Keye Luke]])<ref>{{cite news|title= Lee's Dragon co-star dies at 96 |publisher= [[BBC]]|date=5 June 2009|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8085659.stm|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Wall]] as O'Hara (as Bob Wall)<ref>{{cite news|title= Bob Wall Interview: \"Pulling No Punches\"|publisher= [[Black Belt Magazine|Black Belt]]|url= http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|accessdate=2 December 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220214509/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|archive-date= 20 December 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Angela Mao]] as Su Lin, Lee's sister (as Angela Mao Ying) \n* [[Betty Chung]] as Mei Ling\n* [[Geoffrey Weeks]] as Braithwaite\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Bolo (as Yang Sze)\n* [[Peter Archer (actor)|Peter Archer]] as Parsons\n* Ho Lee Yan as Old Man \n* [[Marlene Clark]] as Secretary\n* Allan Kent as Golfer\n* William Keller as L.A.

Lee is persuaded to attend a high-profile martial arts competition on Han's private island to gather evidence that will prove Han's involvement in drug trafficking and prostitution. Shortly before his departure, Lee also learns that the man responsible for his sister's death, O'Hara, is working as Han's bodyguard on the island. Also fighting in the competition are Roper, an indebted gambling addict, and fellow Vietnam war veteran Williams.\n\nAt the end of the first day, Han gives strict orders to the competitors not to leave their rooms. Lee makes contact with undercover operative Mei Ling and sneaks into Han's compound, looking for evidence. He is discovered by several guards but manages to escape. The next morning, Han orders his giant guard Bolo to kill the guards in public for failing their duties. After the execution, Lee faces O'Hara in the competition and ends up killing him. With the day's competition over, Han confronts Williams, who had also left his room the previous night to exercise. Han believes Williams to be the intruder and beats him to death when he refuses to cooperate. Han then reveals his drug operation to Roper, hoping that he will join his organisation. He also implicitly threatens to imprison Roper, along with all the other martial artists who joined Han's tournaments in the past, if Roper refuses. Despite being initially intrigued, Roper refuses after learning of Williams's fate.\n\nLee sneaks out again that night and manages to send a message to Braithwaite, but he is captured after a prolonged battle with the guards. The next morning, Han arranges for Roper to fight Lee, but Roper refuses. As a punishment, Roper has to fight Bolo instead, whom he manages to overpower and beat after a gruelling encounter. Enraged by the unexpected failure, Han commands his remaining men to kill Lee and Roper. Facing insurmountable odds, they are soon aided by the island's prisoners, who had been freed by Mei Ling. Han escapes and is pursued by Lee, who finally corners him in his museum. After a brutal fight, Han runs away into a hidden mirror room. The mirrors give Han an advantage, but Lee breaks all the room's mirrors to reveal Han's location, and eventually kills him. Lee returns outside to the main battle, which is now over. A bruised and bloodied Roper sits victorious while the military finally arrive to take control of the island.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Bruce Lee]] as Lee\n* [[John Saxon]] as Roper\n* [[Jim Kelly (martial artist)|Jim Kelly]] as Williams<ref>{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2|title= DVD set is devoted to '70s martial arts star Jim Kelly |newspaper= Los Angeles Times|date= 10 January 2010|accessdate=28 January 2011 | first=Steve | last=Ryfle|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180715233633/http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jan/10/entertainment/la-ca-secondlook10-2010jan10/2 |archive-date= 15 July 2018 }}</ref>\n* [[Ahna Capri]] as Tania<ref>{{cite news |title=Car Accident Claims Ahna Capri |publisher=[[Inside Kung Fu]] |url=http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37/ |accessdate=10 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311115341/http://www.insidekung-fu.com/content/view/212/37 |archivedate=11 March 2011  }}</ref>\n* [[Shih Kien]] as Han (voice dubbed by [[Keye Luke]])<ref>{{cite news|title= Lee's Dragon co-star dies at 96 |publisher= [[BBC]]|date=5 June 2009|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8085659.stm|accessdate=31 January 2011}}</ref>\n* [[Robert Wall]] as O'Hara (as Bob Wall)<ref>{{cite news|title= Bob Wall Interview: \"Pulling No Punches\"|publisher= [[Black Belt Magazine|Black Belt]]|url= http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|accessdate=2 December 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101220214509/http://www.blackbeltmag.com/archives/564|archive-date= 20 December 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Angela Mao]] as Su Lin, Lee's sister (as Angela Mao Ying) \n* [[Betty Chung]] as Mei Ling\n* [[Geoffrey Weeks]] as Braithwaite\n* [[Bolo Yeung]] as Bolo (as Yang Sze)\n* [[Peter Archer (actor)|Peter Archer]] as Parsons\n* Ho Lee Yan as Old Man \n* [[Marlene Clark]] as Secretary\n* Allan Kent as Golfer\n* William Keller as L.A.

It was directed by Jora Frantzis, mostly known by her work on the 2019 music video of \"[[Money (Cardi B song)|Money]]\", by [[Cardi B]].\nThe music video opens on Smith circling a man on the wrestling mat, as they sing about \"waiting patiently for a beautiful lover\" and vowing to \"take that risk tonight\" with someone new. As the instrumental approaches the bridge of the song, Smith lines up for a 100-meter sprint \u2014 they and their equally glam competitors dash off in sky-high stilettos, voluminous skirts, and impeccably applied makeup. These competitors include [[Valentina (drag queen)|Valentina]], Gigi Goode, Dee TrannyBear, Alok Vaid-Menon, [[Shea Diamond]] and Jeffrey C. Williams.\nThe second verse of the song is taken over by Lovato; she holds court on a tall diving board, and singing as swimmers dive into the pool around her. She and Smith eventually come together for the song's big climax, which takes them to a gymnast-filled medal ceremony.\nPrior to the video's premiere, Smith and Lovato hopped on a video chat to reminisce about writing the song together.<ref>{{cite web |author=Madeline Roth |title=Sam Smith and Demi Lovato are an olympic dream team in \"I'm Ready\" video |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3163246/sam-smith-demi-lovato-im-ready-video/ |website=[[MTV]] |accessdate=17 April 2020 |language=en |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136989881/credits |title=Credits / I'm Ready / Sam Smith |website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sam Smith]] \u2013 [[songwriter|songwriting]], [[singing|vocals]], [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]]\n* [[Demi Lovato]] \u2013 songwriting, vocals\n* [[Ilya]] \u2013 [[record producer|production]], songwriting, [[bass guitar|bass]], [[drum|drums]], [[guitar]], [[musical keyboard|keyboards]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]], [[programming (music)|programming]]\n* [[Peter Svensson]] \u2013 songwriting\n* [[Savan Kotecha]] \u2013 songwriting\n* Wojtek Goral \u2013 [[alto saxophone]]\n* David Bukovinszky \u2013 [[cello]]\n* [[Carolina Liar|Johan Carlsson]] \u2013 [[piano]]\n* Mattias Bylund \u2013 [[String instrument|strings]], [[String section|string arrangement]]\n* Tomas Jonsson \u2013 [[tenor saxophone]]\n* Peter Noos Johansson \u2013 [[trombone]]\n* Janne Bjerger \u2013 [[trumpet]]\n* Magnus Johansson \u2013 trumpet\n* Mattias Johansson \u2013 [[violin]]\n* John Hanes \u2013 [[audio engineer|engineering]], [[Recording studio|studio personnel]]\n* Sam Holland \u2013 engineering, studio personnel\n* Serban Ghenea \u2013 [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], studio personnel\n* Randy Merrill \u2013 [[mastering (audio)|mastering]], studio personnel\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Release history ==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of releases showing region, date, format, record label and reference\n!

It was directed by Jora Frantzis, mostly known by her work on the 2019 music video of \"[[Money (Cardi B song)|Money]]\", by [[Cardi B]].\nThe music video opens on Smith circling a man on the wrestling mat, as they sing about \"waiting patiently for a beautiful lover\" and vowing to \"take that risk tonight\" with someone new. As the instrumental approaches the bridge of the song, Smith lines up for a 100-meter sprint \u2014 they and their equally glam competitors dash off in sky-high stilettos, voluminous skirts, and impeccably applied makeup. These competitors include [[Valentina (drag queen)|Valentina]], Gigi Goode, Dee TrannyBear, Alok Vaid-Menon, [[Shea Diamond]] and Jeffrey C. Williams.\nThe second verse of the song is taken over by Lovato; she holds court on a tall diving board, and singing as swimmers dive into the pool around her. She and Smith eventually come together for the song's big climax, which takes them to a gymnast-filled medal ceremony.\nPrior to the video's premiere, Smith and Lovato hopped on a video chat to reminisce about writing the song together.<ref>{{cite web |author=Madeline Roth |title=Sam Smith and Demi Lovato are an olympic dream team in \"I'm Ready\" video |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3163246/sam-smith-demi-lovato-im-ready-video/ |website=[[MTV]] |accessdate=17 April 2020 |language=en |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136989881/credits |title=Credits / I'm Ready / Sam Smith |website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] |accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sam Smith]] \u2013 [[songwriter|songwriting]], [[singing|vocals]], [[backing vocalist|backing vocals]]\n* [[Demi Lovato]] \u2013 songwriting, vocals\n* [[Ilya]] \u2013 [[record producer|production]], songwriting, [[bass guitar|bass]], [[drum|drums]], [[guitar]], [[musical keyboard|keyboards]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]], [[programming (music)|programming]]\n* [[Peter Svensson]] \u2013 songwriting\n* [[Savan Kotecha]] \u2013 songwriting\n* Wojtek Goral \u2013 [[alto saxophone]]\n* David Bukovinszky \u2013 [[cello]]\n* [[Carolina Liar|Johan Carlsson]] \u2013 [[piano]]\n* Mattias Bylund \u2013 [[String instrument|strings]], [[String section|string arrangement]]\n* Tomas Jonsson \u2013 [[tenor saxophone]]\n* Peter Noos Johansson \u2013 [[trombone]]\n* Janne Bjerger \u2013 [[trumpet]]\n* Magnus Johansson \u2013 trumpet\n* Mattias Johansson \u2013 [[violin]]\n* John Hanes \u2013 [[audio engineer|engineering]], [[Recording studio|studio personnel]]\n* Sam Holland \u2013 engineering, studio personnel\n* Serban Ghenea \u2013 [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]], studio personnel\n* Randy Merrill \u2013 [[mastering (audio)|mastering]], studio personnel\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Release history ==\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of releases showing region, date, format, record label and reference\n! scope=\"col\"| Region\n! scope=\"col\"| Date\n! scope=\"col\"| Format\n! scope=\"col\"| Label\n! scope=\"col\"| {{abbr|Ref.|Reference}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Various\n| 16 April 2020\n| {{hlist|[[Music download|Digital download]]|[[streaming media|streaming]]}}\n| [[Capitol Records|Capitol]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <ref>{{cite web |title=I'm Ready \u2013 Single by Sam Smith & Demi Lovato |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/im-ready-single/1506964419 |website=[[Apple Music]] |accessdate=16 April 2020 |location=United States}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy\n| rowspan=\"4\"| 17 April 2020\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Contemporary hit radio]]\n| [[List of Universal Music Group labels#Other Universal Music Group national companies|Universal]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=http://radiodate.it/radio-date/sam-smith-demi-lovato-i-m-ready-200436-17-04-2020-radiodate/|title=Sam Smith I'm Ready|website=radiodate.it|accessdate=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United Kingdom\n| rowspan=\"3\"| Capitol\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3tqPdBWF9yMbTrfjWvfKV8t/radio-1-playlist|title=BBC - Radio 1 Playlist|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=17 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417124841/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3tqPdBWF9yMbTrfjWvfKV8t/radio-1-playlist|archive-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Adult contemporary radio]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2qNJsnjYFvbLrK9CZ0CfYfM/radio-2-new-music-playlist|title=BBC - Radio 2 Playlist|website=[[BBC]]|accessdate=17 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417125017/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2qNJsnjYFvbLrK9CZ0CfYfM/radio-2-new-music-playlist|archive-date=17 April 2020}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia\n| Contemporary hit radio\n| <ref>{{citeweb|url=https://themusicnetwork.com/charts/issues/1285/1285-singles-to-radio/|title=Singles to Radio Issue 1285|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n|}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Sam Smith}}\n{{Demi Lovato}}\n\n[[Category:2020 singles]]\n[[Category:2020 songs]]\n[[Category:Sam Smith (singer) songs]]\n[[Category:Demi Lovato songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Sam Smith (singer)]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Demi Lovato]]\n\n{{2020s-single-stub}}\n", "name_user": "2601:3c5:c280:40a0:258c:7105:402d:fd98", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I fixed a typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Ready_(Sam_Smith_and_Demi_Lovato_song)"}

Juni 1953}}&thinsp;) began with a [[strike action]] by [[East Berlin]] construction workers on 16 June, and turned into a widespread uprising against the communist [[German Democratic Republic]] government the next day. It involved more than one million people in about 700 localities.<ref name=NYT61713>{{cite news|title=60 Years Later, Germany Recalls Its Anti-Soviet Revolt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/world/europe/germany-puts-spotlight-on-its-own-anti-soviet-revolt.html|accessdate=June 18, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 17, 2013|author=Alison Smale}}</ref>\n\nThe uprising in East Berlin was violently suppressed by tanks of the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet occupation forces]], and the ''[[Kasernierte Volkspolizei]]''. In spite of the intervention of [[Soviet troops]], the wave of strikes and [[protest]]s were not easily brought under control. There were demonstrations in more than 500 towns and villages after 17 June.\n\nThe date, 17 June, was celebrated as a public holiday in [[West Germany]] up until the [[German reunification]], after which it was replaced by [[German Unity Day]], celebrated annually on 3 October. Strikes and working class networks, particularly relating to the old [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], anti-communist resistance networks and trade unions played a key role in the unfolding of the uprising.<ref name=\"GD\">{{cite web|last1=Dale|first1=Gareth|title=East German rising 17 June 1953|url=https://brunel.academia.edu/garethdale|website=academia.edu|publisher=Jacobin Magazine|accessdate=18 June 2017}}</ref> The event was always significantly downplayed in the Soviet Union.\n\n== Background ==\nIn May 1952, the Federal Republic of Germany rejected Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]]\u2019s second \"[[Stalin Note|Germany Note]]\", after which the FRG signed up to [[Treaty establishing the European Defence Community|the European Defence Community Treaty]]. Following these events, it became clear both to Moscow and Berlin that Germany would remain divided indefinitely. In Berlin, SED Party General Secretary Walter Ulbricht interpreted Stalin\u2019s failed attempt at German reunification as a \u2018green light\u2019 to proceed with the \u201caccelerated construction of socialism in the GDR,\u201d which the party announced at its Second Party Conference in July 1952. This move to Sovietise the GDR consisted of a drastic increase in investment allocated to heavy industry, discriminatory taxation against the last private industrial enterprises, the forced collectivisation of agriculture and a concerted campaign against religious activity in East Germany.<ref>Kopstein, 411</ref>\n\nHowever, the result of this change in economic direction was the rapid deterioration of workers\u2019 living standards, which lasted until the first half of 1953, and represented the first clear downward trend in the living standard of East Germans since the 1947 hunger crisis. Travel costs rose as generous state subsidies were cut, while many consumer goods began to disappear from store shelves. Factories were forced to clamp down on overtime: in the context of a now restricted budget, the wage bill was deemed excessively high.<ref>Ross, 54</ref>  Meanwhile, food prices rose as a result of both the effects of the state's collectivisation policy \u2013 40% of the wealthier farmers in the GDR fled to the West, leaving over 750,000 hectares of otherwise productive land lying fallow \u2013 and a poor harvest in 1952.<ref>Ibid.; Kopstein, 411</ref> Workers\u2019 cost of living therefore rose, while the take-home pay of large numbers of workers \u2013 many of whom depended on overtime hours to make ends meet \u2013 was diminishing. In the winter of 1952\u201353, there were also serious interruptions to the supply of heat and electricity to East Germany's cities.  By November 1952, sporadic food riots and incidents of industrial unrest took place in some of the GDR's major industrial centres: Leipzig, Dresden, Halle and Suhl.  Industrial unrest continued throughout the following spring, which ranged from rabble-rousing and anti-SED graffiti to alleged sabotage.<ref>Ross, 54</ref> \n\nTo ease the economic strain caused by the \"construction of socialism,\" the Politburo decided to increase worker norms on a compulsory basis by 10% across all state-owned factories: that is, workers now had to produce 10% more for the same wage.<ref>Hutchinson, 368</ref> Additionally, there were increases in prices for food, health care, and public transportation. Taken together, the norm and price increases amounted to a 33 per cent monthly wage cut.<ref>Ross, 55</ref>  The norm increase would take effect on 30 June, Ulbricht's 60th birthday. \n\nUlbricht's response to the consequences of crash Sovietization was to tighten East Germans\u2019 belts; many East Germans\u2019 response was to leave. In 1951, 160,000 people left; in 1952, 182,000. Yet by the first four months of 1953, 122,000 East Germans had already departed for the West, despite the now mostly sealed border.<ref>Ostermann, 3</ref>\n\nThe new collective leadership in the Soviet Union, established following Stalin's death in March 1953, was shocked by these disconcerting statistics when it received in early April a report from the Soviet Control Commission in Germany which provided a detailed, devastating account of the East German economic situation.<ref>Richter, 677</ref>  By 2 June, the Soviet Union leadership issued an order \u201cOn Measures to Improve the Health of the Political Situation in the GDR,\u201d in which [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the SED]]\u2019s policy of accelerated construction of socialism was roundly criticised. The huge flight of all professions and backgrounds from East Germany to the West had created \u201ca serious threat to the political stability of the German Democratic Republic.\u201d To salvage the situation, it was now necessary to end forced collectivisation and the war on private enterprise. The Five-Year Plan now needed to be changed at the expense of heavy industry and in favour of consumer goods. Political-judicial controls and regimentation had to be relaxed, and coercive measures against the Protestant Church had to cease. Ulbricht's \u201ccold exercise of power\u201d was denounced. However, there was no explicit demand to reverse the unpopular raised work norms. This decree was given to SED leaders Walter Ulbricht and [[Otto Grotewohl]] on 2 June, the day they landed in the Soviet capital. Soviet Premier [[Georgy Malenkov]] warned them that changes were essential to avoid a catastrophe.<ref>Ostermann, 18</ref> \n \nOn 9 June, the East German Politburo met and determined how to respond to the Soviet leadership's instructions. Although most Politburo members had concurred that the announcement of the \u201cNew Course\u201d required careful preparation of the party and the population at large, Soviet High Commissioner for Germany Vladimir Semyonov insisted that it be implemented right away.<ref>Ostermann, 20</ref>  Thus, the SED fatefully published the \u201cNew Course\u201d programme in [[Neues Deutschland]], the official party newspaper of the SED, on 11 June. The communique criticised the mistakes made by the SED and announced that most of Ulbricht's Sovietisation campaign would now be reversed, just as had been instructed by Moscow. There was now going to be a shift towards investment in consumer goods; the pressures on small private enterprise would end; forced collectivisation would cease; and policies against religious activity would be discontinued. But, crucially, the norm increase was not revoked: a threat to the legitimacy of a state that claimed to represent its workers - the bourgeoisie and farmers stood to benefit much more from the New Course than the proletariat. \n\nThe communique and its forthright admission of past mistakes shocked and confused many East Germans \u2013 both SED members and the wider populace. Disappointment, disbelief and confusion pervaded local party organisations, whose members felt betrayed and panicky. The wider populace viewed the \u201cNew Course\u201d as a sign of weakness on the part of the East German regime.<ref>Ostermann, 20</ref>\n\nThe next day, 12 June, 5,000 people participated in a demonstration in front of [[Brandenburg-G\u00f6rden Prison|the Brandenburg prison]].<ref>Ostermann, 163</ref>\nMore confusion followed: on 14 June, an editorial in Neues Deutschland condemned the new work norms; yet in that very issue, in contradiction to the editorial, news articles praised workers who had exceeded the new norms. \n\nOn 15 June, workers at the Stalinallee \u201cBlock 40\u201d site, Berlin, now with their hopes raised about the possibility that the work norms would be rescinded, dispatched a delegation to East German Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl to deliver a petition calling for a revocation of the higher work norms. Grotewohl ignored the workers\u2019 demands.<ref>Ostermann, 163</ref>\n\n== Uprising ==\n\n=== 16 June ===\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\nAn article in the trade union paper, Tribune, restated the necessity of the norm increases. Evidently, the government would not retreat on the issue of the 10% norm increase.\n\nSo, at 9am on the morning of 16 June, 300 workers from the construction sites at \u201cHospital Friedrichshain\u201d and \u201cStalinallee Block 40\u201d struck and marched on [[Free German Trade Union Federation|the FDGB]] headquarters in the Wallstrasse and thence to the city centre, hoisting banners and demanding a reinstatement of the old norms. Demands broadened out to encompass political matters. Via [[Alexanderplatz]] and [[Unter den Linden]], most of the demonstrators moved to the government seat on [[Leipziger Strasse]]; others went to the SED HQ on Wilhelm-Pieck-Strasse. En route, they took over two sound trucks and used them to spread their calls for a general strike and a demonstration, set for the [[Strausberger Platz]] at 7am the morrow. In front of the GDR House of Ministries, the quickly growing crowd demanded to speak to Ulbricht and Grotewohl. Only Heavy Industry Minister [[Fritz Selbmann]] and Professor [[Robert Havemann]], president of the GDR Peace Council, were brave enough to emerge. Their attempts to calm the workers were drowned out by the clamour of the crowd, which shouted the pair down.<ref>Ostermann, 162</ref> \n\nMeanwhile, the Politburo deliberated, unable to decide what to do. Despite the urgency of the situation, it was only after hours of deliberation \u2013 under the pressure of the demonstrators, and probably also from Semyonov \u2013 that the leadership decided to revoke the norm increase. They decreed that increases in productivity would now be voluntary. They blamed the strikes and demonstrations partly on how the rise had been implemented, partly on foreign provocateurs. But by the time an SED functionary reached the House of Ministries to give the workers the news, the protestors\u2019 agenda had expanded well beyond the issue of norm increases.<ref>Ostermann, 165</ref> \n\nLater that afternoon the crowd dispersed, and workers returned to their sites. Save for isolated clashes between the People's Police and groups of demonstrators, there was a period of calm for the remainder of the day. \n\nThe SED leadership was surprised by the depth of resentment and the extent of anti-regime actions. Indeed, so out of touch were they that they expected a massive propaganda drive would be sufficient to cope with the emerging crisis. It would not be enough, and Ulbrich probably realised this only after a few hours after that suggestion was made.<ref>Ostermann, 166</ref> \n\nThe Soviet authorities were likewise completely taken aback by the widespread protests that followed the demonstrations in East Berlin. Their response was improvised and uncoordinated.\n\nLater that evening, Semyonov met with the SED leadership and informed them of his decision to send Soviet troops to Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 169</ref>\n\nThroughout the night of 16 June and early morning of 17 June, the news of events in East Berlin spread quickly throughout the GDR: via word of mouth and by Western radio broadcasts, particularly [[Radio in the American Sector|RIAS]].\n\nRIAS had been broadcasting about the strikes being staged against the increase in work norms throughout the day; in the afternoon, there were broadcasts of the change in the demonstrator's demands: from the repeal of the higher work quotas and price cuts to shouts of \u201cWe want free elections.\u201d\n\nRIAS was later approached by East Berlin workers who sought assistance from them in disseminating their call for a general strike the next day. \n\nThe station's political director, Gordon Ewing, decided that the station could not directly lend itself as a mouthpiece to the workers: in his view, this had the potential to start a war. It would not actively incite rebellion, either \u2013 simply broadcast information about the demonstrations, factually and comprehensively.\n\nNonetheless, at 7.30pm RIAS reported that a delegation of construction workers had submitted a resolution for publication. The resolution stated that the strikers, having proved by their actions that \u201cthey were able to force the government to accept their justified demands,\u201d would \u201cmake use of their power at any time\u201d if their demands for lower quotas, price cuts, free elections and indemnity for all demonstrators were not fulfilled.\n\nLater that night, there was all but active encouragement to demonstrate against the regime. RIAS Programme Director Eberhard Schutz called the regime's reversal on the norm question \u201ca victory, which our Ostberliners share with the entire working population of the Soviet Zone.\u201d He attributed the government's U-turn to the workers\u2019 actions. His listeners\u2019 demands \u2013 i.e., the resignation of the government, Western-style liberties, etc. \u2013 were justified, and encouraged them to support the demonstrators. Schutz said that RIAS and the East German people expect these demands to be met: it was the East German people's task to show the SED and the Soviet Communist Party that this was true.\n\nFollowing West Germany's Federal Minister for All-German Questions [[Jakob Kaiser]]\u2019s admonition in a late night broadcast to East Germans to shy away from provocations, RIAS, starting with its 11pm news broadcast, and from then on in hourly intermissions, repeated the workers\u2019 demand to continue the strike the next day, calling specifically for all East Berliners to participate in a demo at 7am on the 17th at Strausberger Platz.<ref>Ostermann, 163</ref>\n\n=== 17 June ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-14676, Leipzig, Reichsgericht, russischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Soviet [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS-2 tank]] in [[Leipzig]], 17 June]]\n\n==== '''East Berlin''' ====\nFollowing Semyonov's decision, Soviet troops entered the environs of East Berlin in the early morning of 17 June.\nMeanwhile, crowds of workers began to gather at Strausberger Platz and other public places and began towards the city centre.\n\nEn route, they encountered GDR security forces \u2013 regular and Barracked People's Police units (KVP) \u2013 who, apparently lacking instructions, did not initially intervene.\n\nAlong with SED and FDJ functionaries, police officials tried \u2013 and mostly failed \u2013 to convince the marchers to return to their workplaces and homes. Where police attempted to halt or disperse the crowds, they rapidly ended up on the defensive.\n\nAs they drew in ever-greater numbers, a feeling of solidarity permeated the demonstrators. Loudspeaker cars and bicycles provided communications between the different columns of marchers from the outer districts as, all morning, they converged on the city centre.\n\nOn improvised banners and posters, the demonstrators again demanded the reinstatement of the old norms, but also price decreases, the release of fellow protestors who had been arrested the day before, even free and fair all-German elections. Slogans like \u201cDown with the government!\u201d and \u201cButter, not Arms\u201d were also visible.\nParty posters and statues \u2013 especially those depicting SED and Soviet leaders \u2013 were ransacked, burned or otherwise defaced. \n\nBy 9am, 25,000 people were gathered in front of the House of Ministries, and tens of thousands more were en route to Leipziger Strasse or across Potsdamer Platz.\n\nBetween 10am and 11am, 80 to 100 demonstrators seemed to storm the government seat, visibly demonstrating that the 500 members of GDR People's Police and State Security had been overpowered.<ref>Ostermann, 164</ref>\n\nThen, suddenly, Soviet military vehicles appeared, followed by tanks, and they appeared to prevent a complete takeover. Within an hour, Soviet troops had cleared and isolated the area around the government headquarters. At noon, the Soviet authorities terminated all tram and metro traffic into the Eastern sector and all but closed the sector borders to West Berlin to prevent more demonstrators from reaching the city centre. An hour later, they declared martial law in East Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 164</ref>\n\nThe repression took place outside East Berlin police HQ \u2013 where Soviet tanks opened fire on \u201cthe insurgents\u201d. \n\nFighting between the Red Army (and later GDR police) and the demonstrators persisted into the afternoon and night \u2013 with, in some cases, tanks and troops firing directly into the crowds. \n\nExecutions (most prominently of West Berlin worker Willi Gottling) and mass arrests followed.\n\nOvernight, the Soviets (and the Stasi) started to arrest hundreds of people. Ultimately, up to 10,000 people were detained and at least 20, probably as many as 40, people were executed, including Red Army soldiers who refused to obey orders. \n\nWith the SED leadership effectively paralysed at the Soviet headquarters Karlshorst, control of East Berlin passed to the Soviets in East Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 169</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-074-36A, Berlin, Reichsluftfahrtministerium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus|House of Ministries]] site, 1953]]\n\n==== '''Outside of East Berlin''' ====\nAll of East Germany's 24 cities with a population larger than 50,000 experienced upheavals; likewise in the case of roughly 80% of its towns with populations above 10,000 but below 50,000. \n\nApproximately 339,000 participated in 129 demonstrations outside of Berlin; more than 225,000 people struck in 332 factories.\n\nThe main centres of activity included the industrial region around Halle, Merseburg, and Bitterfeld, as well as middle-size towns like Jena, Gorlitz, and Brandenburg. \n\nNo more than 25,000 people participated in strikes and demonstrations Leipzig, but there were 32,000 in Magdeburg, 43,000 in Dresden, 53,000 in Potsdam \u2013 and in Halle, a figure close to 100,000. \n\nAt first, such demonstrations were relatively peaceful, but as increasing numbers began to participate, the protests became more violent. Looting, particularly of Party-owned shops, became a regular occurrence; there was some arson, and many Party functionaries were beaten up later in the day. In some towns, the jails were seized by the demonstrators, who demanded the release of certain political prisoners.<ref>Hutchinson, 369</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Soviet Army|Red Army]] intervened in these places outside of Berlin, they seemed to be more restrained and more passive. Some Soviet soldiers even displayed a friendly attitude towards the demonstrators.<ref>Ostermann, 169</ref>\n\nIn the countryside, meanwhile, protests took place in more than 200 villages. However, many East German farmers did not take collective action against the regime: the most common expression of protest in rural areas was for farmers to leave and/or dissolve recently formed collective farms and resume farming on one's own.<ref>Port, 124</ref>\n\nAlthough the demands made by protesters could be political \u2013 in favour of the dissolution of the East German government and the organisation of free elections, e.g. \u2013 often they were simply of a local and economic character. They were about issues like bread shortages, unpopular night shifts, even the number of toilets in the workplace and the fact that tea was being served in rusty \nurns.<ref>Pritchard, 211</ref>\n\nThat said, many strikers demanded that their factories to be taken out of state ownership and returned to the original employers, or that employers who'd been imprisoned be released from jail.\n\nOthers, particularly workers, demanded the re-foundation of the SPD in East Germany. Among former Social Democrats there existed enormous bitterness against their ex-leader Otto Grotewohl, whom they believed had \u2018betrayed the SPD.\u2019 In their view, he should now \u2018have his neck wrung.\u2019<ref>Pritchard, 212</ref>\n\nAlso expressed were widely held grievances against the intelligentsia, who were perceived to enjoy \u2018unfair privileges\u2019, such as special deliveries of basic foodstuffs and other commodities.<ref>Ross, 56</ref>\n\nThere were even Nazi elements involved in the protests, though seldom as ringleaders. Walls, bridges and school blackboards were defaced with Nazi slogans and swastikas. In some places, Nazi songs were sung on demonstrations. A significant minority of East Germans still clung to ideas of Nazism.<ref>Pritchard, 209</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nProtests and demonstrations continued for days after 17 June and, according to the GDR security service, the situation calmed down only by 24 June.<ref>Ostermann, 170</ref>\n\nMany workers lost faith in East Germany's socialist state following the denouement of the Uprising. Out of disgust at the violent suppression of the strikes \u2013 at the fact that the Volkspolizei had shot at workers: that workers had shot their own kind \u2013 the SED lost large numbers of members. Throughout the [[Bezirke]] of Leipzig and Karl-Marx-Stadt, hundreds of SED members, many of whom had spent decades in the labour movement, left the party. At the Textima plant in Altenberg, 450 SED members had left the party by 7 July \u2013 most of them workers, many of whom with great experience in the labour movement. There was also a widespread refusal of workers to pay their trade union subscriptions: they now ceased to support it, and hence also to confer legitimacy upon it.<ref>Pritchard, 214</ref>\n\n=== '''Ulbricht Survives''' ===\nMeanwhile, Ulbricht's position as party leader became tenuous, and his position was only saved by the leadership turmoil in Moscow following the death of Joseph Stalin. Ulbricht, after all, was tainted by his association with the disastrous Second Party Conference, the policies following which had led to the crisis East Germany was now mired in. \n\nBy the time of a Politburo meeting on 8 July, it seemed that Ulbricht was approaching the end of his time as party leader. Minister of State Security [[Wilhelm Zaisser]] conceded that the whole Politburo was responsible for the \u2018accelerated construction of socialism\u2019 and the disastrous fallout thereof. But he also added that to leave Ulbricht as leader \u201cwould be opposed catastrophic for the New Course.\u201d By the end of the meeting, just two Politburo members supported Ulbricht's continued leadership: [[Free German Youth]] League chief [[Erich Honecker]] and Party Control Commission Chairman Hermann Matern. Ulbricht only managed to forestall a decision then and there with a promise to make a statement at the forthcoming 15th SED CC Plenum, scheduled for later that month.<ref>Ostermann, 168</ref>\n\nThe leading Soviet officials in East Berlin \u2013 Semyonov, Yudin and Sokolovskii \u2013 had reached the same conclusion in a report describing and analysing the events of 17-19 June, submitted to Moscow two weeks earlier, 24 June. In a self-serving report which sought to play down the culpability of the Soviet Commission in East Berlin and emphasise the responsibility of Ulbricht for the Uprising, they concluded \u2013 inter alia \u2013 that Ulbricht's position as general secretary should be terminated, and that the party would move towards collective leadership, in addition to other far-reaching structural political changes in East Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 170-171</ref>\n\nHowever, the situation in Moscow dramatically changed just two days later, on 26 June, when Soviet Security Chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]] was arrested. On 2 July, when a commission met to discuss proposals for reform in East Germany, the decision was made to shelve the far-reaching and political sensitive changes. The Soviet leadership, preoccupied with the Beria affair and its internal implications, became disinclined to rock the East German boat and more inclined towards the maintenance of the status quo: to maintain power in East Germany via the reinforcement of an experienced, reliable, if Stalinist and unpopular, ruler.\n\nIn late July Ulbricht, ever more certain of his continued backing in Moscow, expelled his main opponents, Zaisser, Hernstadt and Ackermann, from the Politburo, and thus strengthened his position further.<ref>Ostermann, 179</ref>\n\nBy late August, Moscow had committed to shoring up the current East German regime. Now, the situation in East Germany had stabilised thanks to economic measures implemented by Moscow and East Berlin. Major political changes in the GDR dropped off the agenda. Substantial economic and financial aid was to flow into East Germany and reparation payments were to cease by the end of the year. Additional prisoners of war would be freed and Moscow's mission in Berlin elevated to the status of embassy. Ulbricht's position was firmly secure once more.<ref>Ostermann, 180</ref>\n\n=== '''The Uprising's impact on the long-term development of the GDR''' ===\nAccording to historian Corey Ross, the party leadership derived two key lessons from 17 June.\n\nThe first was that it became more concerned about shopfloor discontent and now sought more determinedly to preclude it from escalating into a broader conflict. Factory surveillance was now raised to better monitor the mood of the workforce, Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse (workforce combat groups) were established as an on-the-spot force to prevent or quell any signs of unrest, and the Stasi was expanded and improved to deal swiftly with any signs of organised protest in the future. \n\nThe second was that it became clear that a heavy-handed venture such as the \u2018accelerated construction of socialism\u2019 could never again be embarked upon. SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht was haunted throughout the 1950s by the thought of a repetition of 17 June. The government never again attempted to introduce arbitrary blanket norm increases such as it attempted in May and June 1953.\nThe \u201cNew Course\u201d policies \u2013 increased investment in consumer goods, housing and price and travel subventions \u2013 led to an improvement in living standards overall but failed to achieve an immediate end to the discontent that had been accumulating over the past year. \n\nWorkers, meanwhile, learnt that little could be gained from open confrontation \u2013 to act openly against the regime in large numbers was to be left to their own devices by the West against Soviet tanks.<ref>Ross, 57-59</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:DBPB 1953 110 17.Juni.jpg|thumb|uppright=1.1|''[[Deutsche Bundespost Berlin]]'' stamp]]\nIn memory of the 1953 East German rebellion, West Germany established 17 June as a national holiday, called [[Day of German Unity]]. Upon [[German reunification]] in October 1990, it was moved to 3 October, the date of formal reunification. The extension of the ''[[Unter den Linden]]'' boulevard to the west of the [[Brandenburg Gate]], called ''Charlottenburger Chaussee'', was renamed ''[[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]]'' (\"17 June Street\") following the 1953 rebellion. \n\nThe event is commemorated in ''\"[[Die L\u00f6sung]]\"'', a poem by [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Other prominent GDR authors who dealt with the uprising include [[Stefan Heym]] (''F\u00fcnf Tage im Juni'' / \"Five Days in June\", Munich 1974) and [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] (''Wolokolamsker Chaussee III: Das Duell'' / \"Volokolamsk Highway III: The Duel\", 1985/86).\n\nWest German group [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]] mention the date explicitly as \"the seventeenth of June\" but without reference to the year in their 1984 song \"Summer in Berlin,\" from the album ''[[Forever Young (Alphaville album)|Forever Young]]''. When the compilation album ''[[Alphaville Amiga Compilation]]'' was assembled for release in East Germany in 1988, the song \"Summer in Berlin\" was submitted for inclusion, but rejected \"for political reasons.\"<ref>[http://www.alphaville.info/main.htm Alphaville Discography]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe 1966 [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] play ''The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising'' depicts Brecht preparing a production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Coriolanus]]'' against the background of the events of 1953.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Pozna\u0144 protests]], June 1956\n* [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], October\u2013November 1956\n* [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], August 1968\n* [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]], April\u2013June 1989\n* [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany]], September 1989 \u2013 April 1991\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Baring, Arnulf.

Following these events, it became clear both to Moscow and Berlin that Germany would remain divided indefinitely. In Berlin, SED Party General Secretary Walter Ulbricht interpreted Stalin\u2019s failed attempt at German reunification as a \u2018green light\u2019 to proceed with the \u201caccelerated construction of socialism in the GDR,\u201d which the party announced at its Second Party Conference in July 1952. This move to Sovietise the GDR consisted of a drastic increase in investment allocated to heavy industry, discriminatory taxation against the last private industrial enterprises, the forced collectivisation of agriculture and a concerted campaign against religious activity in East Germany.<ref>Kopstein, 411</ref>\n\nHowever, the result of this change in economic direction was the rapid deterioration of workers\u2019 living standards, which lasted until the first half of 1953, and represented the first clear downward trend in the living standard of East Germans since the 1947 hunger crisis. Travel costs rose as generous state subsidies were cut, while many consumer goods began to disappear from store shelves. Factories were forced to clamp down on overtime: in the context of a now restricted budget, the wage bill was deemed excessively high.<ref>Ross, 54</ref>  Meanwhile, food prices rose as a result of both the effects of the state's collectivisation policy \u2013 40% of the wealthier farmers in the GDR fled to the West, leaving over 750,000 hectares of otherwise productive land lying fallow \u2013 and a poor harvest in 1952.<ref>Ibid.; Kopstein, 411</ref> Workers\u2019 cost of living therefore rose, while the take-home pay of large numbers of workers \u2013 many of whom depended on overtime hours to make ends meet \u2013 was diminishing. In the winter of 1952\u201353, there were also serious interruptions to the supply of heat and electricity to East Germany's cities.  By November 1952, sporadic food riots and incidents of industrial unrest took place in some of the GDR's major industrial centres: Leipzig, Dresden, Halle and Suhl.  Industrial unrest continued throughout the following spring, which ranged from rabble-rousing and anti-SED graffiti to alleged sabotage.<ref>Ross, 54</ref> \n\nTo ease the economic strain caused by the \"construction of socialism,\" the Politburo decided to increase worker norms on a compulsory basis by 10% across all state-owned factories: that is, workers now had to produce 10% more for the same wage.<ref>Hutchinson, 368</ref> Additionally, there were increases in prices for food, health care, and public transportation. Taken together, the norm and price increases amounted to a 33 per cent monthly wage cut.<ref>Ross, 55</ref>  The norm increase would take effect on 30 June, Ulbricht's 60th birthday. \n\nUlbricht's response to the consequences of crash Sovietization was to tighten East Germans\u2019 belts; many East Germans\u2019 response was to leave. In 1951, 160,000 people left; in 1952, 182,000. Yet by the first four months of 1953, 122,000 East Germans had already departed for the West, despite the now mostly sealed border.<ref>Ostermann, 3</ref>\n\nThe new collective leadership in the Soviet Union, established following Stalin's death in March 1953, was shocked by these disconcerting statistics when it received in early April a report from the Soviet Control Commission in Germany which provided a detailed, devastating account of the East German economic situation.<ref>Richter, 677</ref>  By 2 June, the Soviet Union leadership issued an order \u201cOn Measures to Improve the Health of the Political Situation in the GDR,\u201d in which [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|the SED]]\u2019s policy of accelerated construction of socialism was roundly criticised. The huge flight of all professions and backgrounds from East Germany to the West had created \u201ca serious threat to the political stability of the German Democratic Republic.\u201d To salvage the situation, it was now necessary to end forced collectivisation and the war on private enterprise. The Five-Year Plan now needed to be changed at the expense of heavy industry and in favour of consumer goods. Political-judicial controls and regimentation had to be relaxed, and coercive measures against the Protestant Church had to cease. Ulbricht's \u201ccold exercise of power\u201d was denounced. However, there was no explicit demand to reverse the unpopular raised work norms. This decree was given to SED leaders Walter Ulbricht and [[Otto Grotewohl]] on 2 June, the day they landed in the Soviet capital. Soviet Premier [[Georgy Malenkov]] warned them that changes were essential to avoid a catastrophe.<ref>Ostermann, 18</ref> \n \nOn 9 June, the East German Politburo met and determined how to respond to the Soviet leadership's instructions. Although most Politburo members had concurred that the announcement of the \u201cNew Course\u201d required careful preparation of the party and the population at large, Soviet High Commissioner for Germany Vladimir Semyonov insisted that it be implemented right away.<ref>Ostermann, 20</ref>  Thus, the SED fatefully published the \u201cNew Course\u201d programme in [[Neues Deutschland]], the official party newspaper of the SED, on 11 June. The communique criticised the mistakes made by the SED and announced that most of Ulbricht's Sovietisation campaign would now be reversed, just as had been instructed by Moscow. There was now going to be a shift towards investment in consumer goods; the pressures on small private enterprise would end; forced collectivisation would cease; and policies against religious activity would be discontinued. But, crucially, the norm increase was not revoked: a threat to the legitimacy of a state that claimed to represent its workers - the bourgeoisie and farmers stood to benefit much more from the New Course than the proletariat. \n\nThe communique and its forthright admission of past mistakes shocked and confused many East Germans \u2013 both SED members and the wider populace. Disappointment, disbelief and confusion pervaded local party organisations, whose members felt betrayed and panicky. The wider populace viewed the \u201cNew Course\u201d as a sign of weakness on the part of the East German regime.<ref>Ostermann, 20</ref>\n\nThe next day, 12 June, 5,000 people participated in a demonstration in front of [[Brandenburg-G\u00f6rden Prison|the Brandenburg prison]].<ref>Ostermann, 163</ref>\nMore confusion followed: on 14 June, an editorial in Neues Deutschland condemned the new work norms; yet in that very issue, in contradiction to the editorial, news articles praised workers who had exceeded the new norms. \n\nOn 15 June, workers at the Stalinallee \u201cBlock 40\u201d site, Berlin, now with their hopes raised about the possibility that the work norms would be rescinded, dispatched a delegation to East German Prime Minister Otto Grotewohl to deliver a petition calling for a revocation of the higher work norms. Grotewohl ignored the workers\u2019 demands.<ref>Ostermann, 163</ref>\n\n== Uprising ==\n\n=== 16 June ===\n{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}\nAn article in the trade union paper, Tribune, restated the necessity of the norm increases. Evidently, the government would not retreat on the issue of the 10% norm increase.\n\nSo, at 9am on the morning of 16 June, 300 workers from the construction sites at \u201cHospital Friedrichshain\u201d and \u201cStalinallee Block 40\u201d struck and marched on [[Free German Trade Union Federation|the FDGB]] headquarters in the Wallstrasse and thence to the city centre, hoisting banners and demanding a reinstatement of the old norms. Demands broadened out to encompass political matters. Via [[Alexanderplatz]] and [[Unter den Linden]], most of the demonstrators moved to the government seat on [[Leipziger Strasse]]; others went to the SED HQ on Wilhelm-Pieck-Strasse. En route, they took over two sound trucks and used them to spread their calls for a general strike and a demonstration, set for the [[Strausberger Platz]] at 7am the morrow. In front of the GDR House of Ministries, the quickly growing crowd demanded to speak to Ulbricht and Grotewohl. Only Heavy Industry Minister [[Fritz Selbmann]] and Professor [[Robert Havemann]], president of the GDR Peace Council, were brave enough to emerge. Their attempts to calm the workers were drowned out by the clamour of the crowd, which shouted the pair down.<ref>Ostermann, 162</ref> \n\nMeanwhile, the Politburo deliberated, unable to decide what to do. Despite the urgency of the situation, it was only after hours of deliberation \u2013 under the pressure of the demonstrators, and probably also from Semyonov \u2013 that the leadership decided to revoke the norm increase. They decreed that increases in productivity would now be voluntary. They blamed the strikes and demonstrations partly on how the rise had been implemented, partly on foreign provocateurs. But by the time an SED functionary reached the House of Ministries to give the workers the news, the protestors\u2019 agenda had expanded well beyond the issue of norm increases.<ref>Ostermann, 165</ref> \n\nLater that afternoon the crowd dispersed, and workers returned to their sites. Save for isolated clashes between the People's Police and groups of demonstrators, there was a period of calm for the remainder of the day. \n\nThe SED leadership was surprised by the depth of resentment and the extent of anti-regime actions. Indeed, so out of touch were they that they expected a massive propaganda drive would be sufficient to cope with the emerging crisis. It would not be enough, and Ulbrich probably realised this only after a few hours after that suggestion was made.<ref>Ostermann, 166</ref> \n\nThe Soviet authorities were likewise completely taken aback by the widespread protests that followed the demonstrations in East Berlin. Their response was improvised and uncoordinated.\n\nLater that evening, Semyonov met with the SED leadership and informed them of his decision to send Soviet troops to Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 169</ref>\n\nThroughout the night of 16 June and early morning of 17 June, the news of events in East Berlin spread quickly throughout the GDR: via word of mouth and by Western radio broadcasts, particularly [[Radio in the American Sector|RIAS]].\n\nRIAS had been broadcasting about the strikes being staged against the increase in work norms throughout the day; in the afternoon, there were broadcasts of the change in the demonstrator's demands: from the repeal of the higher work quotas and price cuts to shouts of \u201cWe want free elections.\u201d\n\nRIAS was later approached by East Berlin workers who sought assistance from them in disseminating their call for a general strike the next day. \n\nThe station's political director, Gordon Ewing, decided that the station could not directly lend itself as a mouthpiece to the workers: in his view, this had the potential to start a war. It would not actively incite rebellion, either \u2013 simply broadcast information about the demonstrations, factually and comprehensively.\n\nNonetheless, at 7.30pm RIAS reported that a delegation of construction workers had submitted a resolution for publication. The resolution stated that the strikers, having proved by their actions that \u201cthey were able to force the government to accept their justified demands,\u201d would \u201cmake use of their power at any time\u201d if their demands for lower quotas, price cuts, free elections and indemnity for all demonstrators were not fulfilled.\n\nLater that night, there was all but active encouragement to demonstrate against the regime. RIAS Programme Director Eberhard Schutz called the regime's reversal on the norm question \u201ca victory, which our Ostberliners share with the entire working population of the Soviet Zone.\u201d He attributed the government's U-turn to the workers\u2019 actions. His listeners\u2019 demands \u2013 i.e., the resignation of the government, Western-style liberties, etc. \u2013 were justified, and encouraged them to support the demonstrators. Schutz said that RIAS and the East German people expect these demands to be met: it was the East German people's task to show the SED and the Soviet Communist Party that this was true.\n\nFollowing West Germany's Federal Minister for All-German Questions [[Jakob Kaiser]]\u2019s admonition in a late night broadcast to East Germans to shy away from provocations, RIAS, starting with its 11pm news broadcast, and from then on in hourly intermissions, repeated the workers\u2019 demand to continue the strike the next day, calling specifically for all East Berliners to participate in a demo at 7am on the 17th at Strausberger Platz.<ref>Ostermann, 163</ref>\n\n=== 17 June ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-14676, Leipzig, Reichsgericht, russischer Panzer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Soviet [[Iosif Stalin tank|IS-2 tank]] in [[Leipzig]], 17 June]]\n\n==== '''East Berlin''' ====\nFollowing Semyonov's decision, Soviet troops entered the environs of East Berlin in the early morning of 17 June.\nMeanwhile, crowds of workers began to gather at Strausberger Platz and other public places and began towards the city centre.\n\nEn route, they encountered GDR security forces \u2013 regular and Barracked People's Police units (KVP) \u2013 who, apparently lacking instructions, did not initially intervene.\n\nAlong with SED and FDJ functionaries, police officials tried \u2013 and mostly failed \u2013 to convince the marchers to return to their workplaces and homes. Where police attempted to halt or disperse the crowds, they rapidly ended up on the defensive.\n\nAs they drew in ever-greater numbers, a feeling of solidarity permeated the demonstrators. Loudspeaker cars and bicycles provided communications between the different columns of marchers from the outer districts as, all morning, they converged on the city centre.\n\nOn improvised banners and posters, the demonstrators again demanded the reinstatement of the old norms, but also price decreases, the release of fellow protestors who had been arrested the day before, even free and fair all-German elections. Slogans like \u201cDown with the government!\u201d and \u201cButter, not Arms\u201d were also visible.\nParty posters and statues \u2013 especially those depicting SED and Soviet leaders \u2013 were ransacked, burned or otherwise defaced. \n\nBy 9am, 25,000 people were gathered in front of the House of Ministries, and tens of thousands more were en route to Leipziger Strasse or across Potsdamer Platz.\n\nBetween 10am and 11am, 80 to 100 demonstrators seemed to storm the government seat, visibly demonstrating that the 500 members of GDR People's Police and State Security had been overpowered.<ref>Ostermann, 164</ref>\n\nThen, suddenly, Soviet military vehicles appeared, followed by tanks, and they appeared to prevent a complete takeover. Within an hour, Soviet troops had cleared and isolated the area around the government headquarters. At noon, the Soviet authorities terminated all tram and metro traffic into the Eastern sector and all but closed the sector borders to West Berlin to prevent more demonstrators from reaching the city centre. An hour later, they declared martial law in East Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 164</ref>\n\nThe repression took place outside East Berlin police HQ \u2013 where Soviet tanks opened fire on \u201cthe insurgents\u201d. \n\nFighting between the Red Army (and later GDR police) and the demonstrators persisted into the afternoon and night \u2013 with, in some cases, tanks and troops firing directly into the crowds. \n\nExecutions (most prominently of West Berlin worker Willi Gottling) and mass arrests followed.\n\nOvernight, the Soviets (and the Stasi) started to arrest hundreds of people. Ultimately, up to 10,000 people were detained and at least 20, probably as many as 40, people were executed, including Red Army soldiers who refused to obey orders. \n\nWith the SED leadership effectively paralysed at the Soviet headquarters Karlshorst, control of East Berlin passed to the Soviets in East Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 169</ref>\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-074-36A, Berlin, Reichsluftfahrtministerium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Detlev-Rohwedder-Haus|House of Ministries]] site, 1953]]\n\n==== '''Outside of East Berlin''' ====\nAll of East Germany's 24 cities with a population larger than 50,000 experienced upheavals; likewise in the case of roughly 80% of its towns with populations above 10,000 but below 50,000. \n\nApproximately 339,000 participated in 129 demonstrations outside of Berlin; more than 225,000 people struck in 332 factories.\n\nThe main centres of activity included the industrial region around Halle, Merseburg, and Bitterfeld, as well as middle-size towns like Jena, Gorlitz, and Brandenburg. \n\nNo more than 25,000 people participated in strikes and demonstrations Leipzig, but there were 32,000 in Magdeburg, 43,000 in Dresden, 53,000 in Potsdam \u2013 and in Halle, a figure close to 100,000. \n\nAt first, such demonstrations were relatively peaceful, but as increasing numbers began to participate, the protests became more violent. Looting, particularly of Party-owned shops, became a regular occurrence; there was some arson, and many Party functionaries were beaten up later in the day. In some towns, the jails were seized by the demonstrators, who demanded the release of certain political prisoners.<ref>Hutchinson, 369</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Soviet Army|Red Army]] intervened in these places outside of Berlin, they seemed to be more restrained and more passive. Some Soviet soldiers even displayed a friendly attitude towards the demonstrators.<ref>Ostermann, 169</ref>\n\nIn the countryside, meanwhile, protests took place in more than 200 villages. However, many East German farmers did not take collective action against the regime: the most common expression of protest in rural areas was for farmers to leave and/or dissolve recently formed collective farms and resume farming on one's own.<ref>Port, 124</ref>\n\nAlthough the demands made by protesters could be political \u2013 in favour of the dissolution of the East German government and the organisation of free elections, e.g. \u2013 often they were simply of a local and economic character. They were about issues like bread shortages, unpopular night shifts, even the number of toilets in the workplace and the fact that tea was being served in rusty \nurns.<ref>Pritchard, 211</ref>\n\nThat said, many strikers demanded that their factories to be taken out of state ownership and returned to the original employers, or that employers who'd been imprisoned be released from jail.\n\nOthers, particularly workers, demanded the re-foundation of the SPD in East Germany. Among former Social Democrats there existed enormous bitterness against their ex-leader Otto Grotewohl, whom they believed had \u2018betrayed the SPD.\u2019 In their view, he should now \u2018have his neck wrung.\u2019<ref>Pritchard, 212</ref>\n\nAlso expressed were widely held grievances against the intelligentsia, who were perceived to enjoy \u2018unfair privileges\u2019, such as special deliveries of basic foodstuffs and other commodities.<ref>Ross, 56</ref>\n\nThere were even Nazi elements involved in the protests, though seldom as ringleaders. Walls, bridges and school blackboards were defaced with Nazi slogans and swastikas. In some places, Nazi songs were sung on demonstrations. A significant minority of East Germans still clung to ideas of Nazism.<ref>Pritchard, 209</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nProtests and demonstrations continued for days after 17 June and, according to the GDR security service, the situation calmed down only by 24 June.<ref>Ostermann, 170</ref>\n\nMany workers lost faith in East Germany's socialist state following the denouement of the Uprising. Out of disgust at the violent suppression of the strikes \u2013 at the fact that the Volkspolizei had shot at workers: that workers had shot their own kind \u2013 the SED lost large numbers of members. Throughout the [[Bezirke]] of Leipzig and Karl-Marx-Stadt, hundreds of SED members, many of whom had spent decades in the labour movement, left the party. At the Textima plant in Altenberg, 450 SED members had left the party by 7 July \u2013 most of them workers, many of whom with great experience in the labour movement. There was also a widespread refusal of workers to pay their trade union subscriptions: they now ceased to support it, and hence also to confer legitimacy upon it.<ref>Pritchard, 214</ref>\n\n=== '''Ulbricht Survives''' ===\nMeanwhile, Ulbricht's position as party leader became tenuous, and his position was only saved by the leadership turmoil in Moscow following the death of Joseph Stalin. Ulbricht, after all, was tainted by his association with the disastrous Second Party Conference, the policies following which had led to the crisis East Germany was now mired in. \n\nBy the time of a Politburo meeting on 8 July, it seemed that Ulbricht was approaching the end of his time as party leader. Minister of State Security [[Wilhelm Zaisser]] conceded that the whole Politburo was responsible for the \u2018accelerated construction of socialism\u2019 and the disastrous fallout thereof. But he also added that to leave Ulbricht as leader \u201cwould be opposed catastrophic for the New Course.\u201d By the end of the meeting, just two Politburo members supported Ulbricht's continued leadership: [[Free German Youth]] League chief [[Erich Honecker]] and Party Control Commission Chairman Hermann Matern. Ulbricht only managed to forestall a decision then and there with a promise to make a statement at the forthcoming 15th SED CC Plenum, scheduled for later that month.<ref>Ostermann, 168</ref>\n\nThe leading Soviet officials in East Berlin \u2013 Semyonov, Yudin and Sokolovskii \u2013 had reached the same conclusion in a report describing and analysing the events of 17-19 June, submitted to Moscow two weeks earlier, 24 June. In a self-serving report which sought to play down the culpability of the Soviet Commission in East Berlin and emphasise the responsibility of Ulbricht for the Uprising, they concluded \u2013 inter alia \u2013 that Ulbricht's position as general secretary should be terminated, and that the party would move towards collective leadership, in addition to other far-reaching structural political changes in East Berlin.<ref>Ostermann, 170-171</ref>\n\nHowever, the situation in Moscow dramatically changed just two days later, on 26 June, when Soviet Security Chief [[Lavrentiy Beria]] was arrested. On 2 July, when a commission met to discuss proposals for reform in East Germany, the decision was made to shelve the far-reaching and political sensitive changes. The Soviet leadership, preoccupied with the Beria affair and its internal implications, became disinclined to rock the East German boat and more inclined towards the maintenance of the status quo: to maintain power in East Germany via the reinforcement of an experienced, reliable, if Stalinist and unpopular, ruler.\n\nIn late July Ulbricht, ever more certain of his continued backing in Moscow, expelled his main opponents, Zaisser, Hernstadt and Ackermann, from the Politburo, and thus strengthened his position further.<ref>Ostermann, 179</ref>\n\nBy late August, Moscow had committed to shoring up the current East German regime. Now, the situation in East Germany had stabilised thanks to economic measures implemented by Moscow and East Berlin. Major political changes in the GDR dropped off the agenda. Substantial economic and financial aid was to flow into East Germany and reparation payments were to cease by the end of the year. Additional prisoners of war would be freed and Moscow's mission in Berlin elevated to the status of embassy. Ulbricht's position was firmly secure once more.<ref>Ostermann, 180</ref>\n\n=== '''The Uprising's impact on the long-term development of GDR''' ===\nAccording to historian Corey Ross, the party leadership derived two key lessons from 17 June.\n\nThe first was that it became more concerned about shopfloor discontent and now sought more determinedly to preclude it from escalating into a broader conflict. Factory surveillance was now raised to better monitor the mood of the workforce, Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse (workforce combat groups) were established as an on-the-spot force to prevent or quell any signs of unrest, and the Stasi was expanded and improved to deal swiftly with any signs of organised protest in the future. \n\nThe second was that it became clear that a heavy-handed venture such as the \u2018accelerated construction of socialism\u2019 could never again be embarked upon. SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht was haunted throughout the 1950s by the thought of a repetition of 17 June. The government never again attempted to introduce arbitrary blanket norm increases such as it attempted in May and June 1953.\nThe \u201cNew Course\u201d policies \u2013 increased investment in consumer goods, housing and price and travel subventions \u2013 led to an improvement in living standards overall but failed to achieve an immediate end to the discontent that had been accumulating over the past year. \n\nWorkers, meanwhile, learnt that little could be gained from open confrontation \u2013 to act openly against the regime in large numbers was to be left to their own devices by the West against Soviet tanks.<ref>Ross, 57-59</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:DBPB 1953 110 17.Juni.jpg|thumb|uppright=1.1|''[[Deutsche Bundespost Berlin]]'' stamp]]\nIn memory of the 1953 East German rebellion, West Germany established 17 June as a national holiday, called [[Day of German Unity]]. Upon [[German reunification]] in October 1990, it was moved to 3 October, the date of formal reunification. The extension of the ''[[Unter den Linden]]'' boulevard to the west of the [[Brandenburg Gate]], called ''Charlottenburger Chaussee'', was renamed ''[[Stra\u00dfe des 17. Juni]]'' (\"17 June Street\") following the 1953 rebellion. \n\nThe event is commemorated in ''\"[[Die L\u00f6sung]]\"'', a poem by [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Other prominent GDR authors who dealt with the uprising include [[Stefan Heym]] (''F\u00fcnf Tage im Juni'' / \"Five Days in June\", Munich 1974) and [[Heiner M\u00fcller]] (''Wolokolamsker Chaussee III: Das Duell'' / \"Volokolamsk Highway III: The Duel\", 1985/86).\n\nWest German group [[Alphaville (band)|Alphaville]] mention the date explicitly as \"the seventeenth of June\" but without reference to the year in their 1984 song \"Summer in Berlin,\" from the album ''[[Forever Young (Alphaville album)|Forever Young]]''. When the compilation album ''[[Alphaville Amiga Compilation]]'' was assembled for release in East Germany in 1988, the song \"Summer in Berlin\" was submitted for inclusion, but rejected \"for political reasons.\"<ref>[http://www.alphaville.info/main.htm Alphaville Discography]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe 1966 [[G\u00fcnter Grass]] play ''The Plebeians Rehearse the Uprising'' depicts Brecht preparing a production of [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Coriolanus]]'' against the background of the events of 1953.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Pozna\u0144 1956 protests|Pozna\u0144 protests]], June 1956\n* [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]], October\u2013November 1956\n* [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]], August 1968\n* [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]], April\u2013June 1989\n* [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany]], September 1989 \u2013 April 1991\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Baring, Arnulf.
