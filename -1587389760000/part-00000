The country before 1898 was dominated by several Spanish religious orders. Several years before the De La Salle Christian Brothers were invited to the Philippines, the local American government ordered Ateneo to modernize and use English as a mode of instruction, but the Spanish Jesuits refused and argued that their allegiance was with Spain. The Americans have known this made them decide that it would be best for the De La Salle Christian Brothers (FSC \u2013 Fraternum Scholarum Christianarum) to take over the task, the Christian Brothers have established several De La Salle schools worldwide provided Christian values-based education in 35 countries at that time. The Americans have always known that the De La Salle Christian Brothers were up to the given task due to the Brothers' main religious vocation was Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers had 3 centuries of innovative teaching experience making them highly knowledgeable, capable and qualified in providing modern educational methods to the young Filipinos in Manila. In fact, several Filipinos like the future President Manuel L. Quezon's Secretary of National Defense and General Basilio Valdes were also educated in the oldest De La Salle School in Hong Kong-St. Joseph's College. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were very hesitant in establishing a De La Salle school in the country because the Americans insisted that the first De La Salle school should only educate the rich children of the Filipino ruling elite. The Americans ordered the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American request had put the De La Salle Brothers in a dilemma because it ran contrary to the original teachings and charism of Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]] \u2013 Patron Saint of Teachers whose religious vocation was to provide tuition-free, quality Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers eventually relented, conceding that the \u201cupper-class children also needed good moral and spiritual training.\" Saint La Salle's mission was to empower the last, the least and the lost among the poorest children in the world in order to free them from the shackles of ignorance that creates poverty.\n\nDe La Salle University traces its founding roots to then [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in Saint Louis, Missouri U.S.A. believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental and vital in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and American Protestant church missions.<ref name =\"Handbook\">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003\u201306 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate = May 15, 2011 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of De La Salle Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus.

During the initial outbreak of the invasion of Manila by the Japanese Marines, several La Salle boys helped secure and save Ateneo's prized \"Jesuit Bell\" along with several valuable Jesuit religious antiques just before the Japanese shock troops could enter Manila and ransack the Jesuits' pre-war campus.\n\nThe American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Banos, Laguna Prison for the duration of the 3-Year Japanese Occupation while the other non-American Brothers led by then Brother President-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC and Brother Flavius Leo FSC, both from Ireland, were allowed by the Japanese to stay in the Taft Campus.\n\nInitially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, wounded soldiers and Filipino guerilla fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, later on it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and was made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name=\"DLSU history\"/> Several repeated bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued as the Christian Brothers taught on during the Japanese occupation of Manila. During this time, several of the De La Salle boys along with the Ateneo boys had to set their school rivalry aside and share their classrooms with each other along with several other students from various neighboring schools. Several schools in Manila had discontinued their operations and closed down due to the fall of Manila to the Japanese invading forces.

On February 7, 1945, Brother Egbert Xavier Kelly FSC was abducted by Japanese soldiers, and was never seen again; he was believed to have been mercilessly tortured and killed.

The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924\u201326 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernie Oca's present DLSU AN1MO!SQUAD has been continuously cheerleading for {{Age|1926|1|1}} years.\n \nThe first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from Saint Scholastica's College, Manila several years before De La Salle College turned co-educational. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more.\n\nIn 1941, the DLSC ''Green & White'' yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/17/1246180/animo-la-salle|title=ANIMO La Salle!|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Partner institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Cardinal Jaime Sin in 1988.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sin]]\n{{Main|List of De La Salle University people}}\nNotable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include:\n*[[Jose Diokno]]\n*[[Lorenzo Tanada]]\n*[[Salvador H.

The country before 1898 was dominated by several Spanish religious orders. Several years before the De La Salle Christian Brothers were invited to the Philippines, the local American government ordered Ateneo to modernize and use English as a mode of instruction, but the Spanish Jesuits refused and argued that their allegiance was with Spain. The Americans have known this made them decide that it would be best for the De La Salle Christian Brothers (FSC \u2013 Fraternum Scholarum Christianarum) to take over the task, the Christian Brothers have established several De La Salle schools worldwide provided Christian values-based education in 35 countries at that time. The Americans have always known that the De La Salle Christian Brothers were up to the given task due to the Brothers' main religious vocation was Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers had 3 centuries of innovative teaching experience making them highly knowledgeable, capable and qualified in providing modern educational methods to the young Filipinos in Manila. In fact, several Filipinos like the future President Manuel L. Quezon's Secretary of National Defense and General Basilio Valdes were also educated in the oldest De La Salle School in Hong Kong-St. Joseph's College. Initially, the De La Salle Brothers were very hesitant in establishing a De La Salle school in the country because the Americans insisted that the first De La Salle school should only educate the rich children of the Filipino ruling elite. The Americans ordered the Christian Brothers to Americanize future Filipino leaders through their Catholic Lasallian education. The American request had put the De La Salle Brothers in a dilemma because it ran contrary to the original teachings and charism of Saint [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]] \u2013 Patron Saint of Teachers whose religious vocation was to provide tuition-free, quality Christian values-based education. The De La Salle Brothers eventually relented, conceding that the \u201cupper-class children also needed good moral and spiritual training.\" Saint La Salle's mission was to empower the last, the least and the lost among the poorest children in the world in order to free them from the shackles of ignorance that creates poverty.\n\nDe La Salle University traces its founding roots to then [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila Archbishop]] [[Jeremiah James Harty]]. Harty, an alumnus of a Christian Brother school in Saint Louis, Missouri U.S.A. believed that the establishment of a De La Salle school in Manila would be instrumental and vital in preempting the spread of [[Protestantism in the Philippines]] through the arrival of the [[Thomasites]] and American Protestant church missions.<ref name =\"Handbook\">{{Cite book | url = http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/offices/mco/publications/student_handbook/primer.pdf | title = Student handbook 2003\u201306 | publisher=De La Salle University | date = June 26, 2003 | accessdate = May 15, 2011 | location = Manila}}</ref> His request would be later endorsed in 1907 by Pope [[Pius X]]. An envoy of De La Salle Brothers arrived in 1910. Together with Manila Archbishop Harty, the Brothers searched for a suitable campus.

During the initial outbreak of the invasion of Manila by the Japanese Marines, several La Salle boys helped secure and save Ateneo's prized \"Jesuit Bell\" along with several valuable Jesuit religious antiques just before the Japanese shock troops could enter Manila and ransack the Jesuits' pre-war campus.\n\nThe American De La Salle Christian Brothers were interred in the Japanese Los Banos, Laguna Prison for the duration of the 3-Year Japanese Occupation while the other non-American Brothers led by then Brother President-Brother Egbert Xavier FSC and Brother Flavius Leo FSC, both from Ireland, were allowed by the Japanese to stay in the Taft Campus.\n\nInitially, the De La Salle campus served as a secret shelter for several displaced civilians, wounded soldiers and Filipino guerilla fighters at the beginning of the Japanese occupation. However, later on it was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]], and was made into military defense quarters on January 2, 1942.<ref name=\"DLSU history\"/> Several repeated bombings severely damaged the DLSC campus. Despite this, classes continued as the Christian Brothers taught on during the Japanese occupation of Manila.

Several schools in Manila had discontinued their operations and closed down due to the fall of Manila to the Japanese invading forces.

Rah! Boys, then in 1926 as the LSC Yell Commanders. The DLSC Squad was the first and oldest Collegiate Coed Spirit Team in the Philippines. Decades later on as the post-war DLSC cheerleading Squad then in the 80's as the DLSU Pep Squad in the UAAP prior to its 2008 renaming by Br. Bernie Oca, FSC as the present DLSU AN1MO! SQUAD. The DLSU Green & White Spirit Team has since then won five cheer dance podium finishes in the span of its UAAP participation, in 1994, 1996, 1998, 2011 and 2013. The original Lasallian cheerleading spirit team was formally established in 1924\u201326 with four LaS Rah! Rah! Boys / LSC Yell Command pioneers. Br. John Lynam's pre-war LaS Rah! Rah! Boys, as well his LSC and DLSC Yell Commanders up to Br. Bernie Oca's present DLSU AN1MO!SQUAD has been continuously cheerleading for {{Age|1926|1|1}} years.\n \nThe first members of the LaS, LSC and DLSC cheerleading squad were all male until the inclusion of female cheerleaders in the early 1970s. The DLSC cheerleading squad was the first spirit team in the NCAA and the UAAP to have female cheerleaders. The first female DLSC cheerleaders were cross-enrollees from Saint Scholastica's College, Manila several years before De La Salle College turned co-educational. During De La Salle's pre-war years in the old NCAA, Lasallites enjoyed singing several battle songs such as \"Men of La Salle!, \"On Into The Fight - Green Archer Song\", \"Cheer! Cheer! For O'l De La Salle\" and several more.\n\nIn 1941, the DLSC ''Green & White'' yearbook featured a vintage black and white photo of four elementary school boys who proudly wore their Green Archer costumes that formed the first Green Archer Grade School boys mascot cheerleading squad. The tradition of singing Br. Stephen Malachy and Br. Bonaventure Richard's \"Hail to De La Salle\" Alma Mater Song (composed in 1961) after every Lasallian gathering, event and varsity game while doing the defiant raised, clenched fist \"HAIL!, HAIL!, HAIL!\" salute has been performed since 1964. This famous Lasallian tradition was defiantly initiated by the DLSC cheerleading squad during the final buzzer of the Green Archers' only winless 1965 NCAA basketball season. At that historical moment, the DLSC Yell Command proudly showcased the indestructible \"Invictus La Salle!\" school spirit. De La Salle started the tradition of proudly singing the De La Salle Alma Mater Song at the end of all its then-NCAA matches which were later followed by other rival universities and colleges in the NCAA and UAAP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2013/10/17/1246180/animo-la-salle|title=ANIMO La Salle!|work=The Philippine Star|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Partner institution==\n===Malaysia===\n*[[Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n[[File:Cardinal Jaime Sin in 1988.jpg|thumb|Jaime Sin]]\n{{Main|List of De La Salle University people}}\nNotable alumni from the high school and college of De La Salle include:\n*[[Jose Diokno]]\n*[[Lorenzo Tanada]]\n*[[Salvador H.

S. Khandekar]]. One of Khandekar's best-known works, it retells the story of the [[Hindu mythology|mythical]] [[Hindu]] king [[Yayati]], from the Hindu epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. The novel is narrated through [[multiple narrators]], and asks several questions relating to the nature of [[morality]]. Scholars analyzed the book for its depiction of hero, Yayati, as a representative of modern man. Accepted as classic of [[Marathi literature]], it won several awards including the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1960 and the [[Jnanapith Award]] in 1974.\n\n==Background==\nIn his preface to ''Yayati'', Khandekar states that he was drawn to the original story from the ''Mahabharata'' at multiple levels, and for many reasons.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\">{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Santosh|title='Yayati': The Myth and Its Interpretation|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=September\u2013October 1982|volume=25|issue=5|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=150\u2013157|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23331119}} {{closed access}}</ref> The resulting novel is a modern retelling of the story of the mythological Hindu king, who enjoyed all the pleasures of the flesh for a millennium only to realize how empty of meaning was his pursuit of desire.\n\nKhandekar saw modernity, with its materialistic values, as an elephant on the rampage through the delicate garden of traditional virtues and feelings, blurring the distinction between good and evil, between selfishness and compassion, and blinding people to the evils of the world. In response, Khandekar looked to the past and chose the story of Yayati, making use of a kind of tale often dismissed as the fairy stories of old women to describe the vacuousness and futility of contemporary society's endless obsession with avarice and lust. Where Khandekar's writing had previously focussed predominantly on style and imagination, in ''Yayati'' these concerns are integrated into a form of social realism the author had little explored until this novel.<ref name=\"Khandekar1977\">{{cite book|last=Khandekar|first=V.

The early life of Yayati is characterized by a number of disillusionment. He comes to know that his mother weans him for fear of losing her beauty. Yayati's faith in motherly love is shattered with this knowledge. Later on he experiences cruelty and passion which in a sense challenges his manhood. He then has a fleeting experience of carnal love.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nWhen he has to leave the security of the palace for [[Ashvamedha]] [[Yajna]] (a horse sacrifice ritual in Hindu tradition), he meets his elder brother Yati, who became an ascetic abandoning all material pleasures. After this he meets Kacha and sees in him a model of happy, peaceful life. It is, however, when his father, Nahusha, dies, that Yayati undergoes a traumatic experience and for the first time, realizes the destructive power of death, and is gripped with fear and helplessness. While in this state of mind, he comes in contact with Mukulika, a maidservant in the palace. Yayati's attempts to bury his grief in carnal pleasures constitute a critical period of his life. Later on he meets Alaka and experiences sisterly love; but Alaka ultimately falls a prey to Queen Mother's cruelty. Precisely at this time, Yayati comes to know of a curse on his father, foretelling that he (the father) and his children shall never be happy.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe second part of the narrative tells the story of Yayati's married life. We come to know of Devayani's love for Kacha and his quiet but firm refusal. Devayani decides to take revenge on Kacha by making advances to Yayati and ultimately succeeds in marrying him. Sharmishtha, originally a princess, is now living with Devayani as her maidservant. It is at this time that she comes in contact with Yayati. While Devayani is unable to establish any rapport with Yayati, Sharmishtha finds union with him both in body and mind. This union begets a son and for sometime Yayati experiences happiness of life. However, Sharmishtha runs away from Hastinapur on a tempestuous night. Yayati now suffers estrangement from Devayani as well as loss of Sharmishtha. This causes a vacuum in his life and he speedily advances on the path of moral degradation.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nDuring the period of 18 years, Yayati neglects his duties as a king and leads a life of unfettered carnal pleasures with women like Madhavi and Taraka. Even when Hastinapur is attacked by the enemies, Yayati, because of his anger against Devayani and his life of sensual pleasures, continues to neglect his duties. His son [[Yadu]] is imprisoned. Puru, younger son of Yayati, manages his release. Then Shukracharya, Devayani's father, seeing his daughter's unhappy marriage and Yayati's degradation, puts on him the curse of old age.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nWhen Yayati finds himself suddenly old, his unfulfilled desires disturbs him. He requests his sons to lend him their youth. His son Puru comes to his help and lends Yayati his youth. However, Puru and Sharmishtha's undemanding love for Yayati help him realize his mistakes, and within a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, he resolves to return it.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/> Devayani also undergoes a change of heart. At the end, Yayati hands over the reigns of government to Puru with all the blessings and seeks retirement to forest-life with Devayani and Sharmishtha. Yayati's journey from attachment to detachment thus ends here.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\n==Deviation from the Mahabharata==\nKhandekar has maid some significant deviation in the novel from the original story of Mahabharata.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\nThe first significant deviation occurs in the episode of the death of Yayati's father, Nahusha. In The Mahabharata, Nahusha is cursed by the [[Rishi]]s (sages) to live on earth in the form of a serpent. After suffering for a long period in this fate, he eventually meets [[Pandava]] king [[Yudhishthira]], who free him from the curse. In the novel, Nahusha is shown dying in his palace, desperately clinging to life. He pleads to his wife and son to give him a few hours of their own lives so that he may live a little longer. He fears death for he still has unfulfilled desires. Nahusha's helpless struggle with death leaves a lasting sense of insecurity on his son's mind and affects his whole life.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\nIn the original story of Mahabharata, Yayati enjoys his son Puru's youth for a thousand years, then returns the youth to his son, and lives for a long time, with sages in the Himalayas, and is finally taken up in Heaven. While in the novel, Yayati can return the youth of his son only at the cost of his life. He decides to return it immediately after a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, and he is saved from death by Kacha using Sanjivani Mantra.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe major characters in this narrative has been seen exemplifying major attitudes to life. Yayati represents an attitude of material pleasure-seeking. Devayani shows excessive involvement in power and pride. Sharmishtha stands for undemanding, selfless love while Kacha symbolizes a clean, moral and moderate enjoyment of life with a sense of well-being of the human race. Yati, rejecting of all material pleasures, is presented as counterpoint to Yayati.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel ask several moral questions \u2014 How does one define the fulfillment of life?, How can one separate the boundaries between morality and immorality?, What is the ultimate place of the pursuit of material pleasure in the context of spiritual values?<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/><ref name=\"Satchidanandan2000\">{{cite journal|last=Satchidanandan|first=K.|author-link=Satchidanandan|title=Reflection: Yayati, Yet Again|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=November\u2013December 2000|volume=44|issue=6|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=10|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23343302}} {{closed access}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOne of Khandekar's best-known work<ref>{{cite journal|title=Jnanpith Award to Marathi Writer, V.

Accepted as classic of [[Marathi literature]], it won several awards including the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1960 and the [[Jnanapith Award]] in 1974.\n\n==Background==\nIn his preface to ''Yayati'', Khandekar states that he was drawn to the original story from the ''Mahabharata'' at multiple levels, and for many reasons.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\">{{cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Santosh|title='Yayati': The Myth and Its Interpretation|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=September\u2013October 1982|volume=25|issue=5|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=150\u2013157|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23331119}} {{closed access}}</ref> The resulting novel is a modern retelling of the story of the mythological Hindu king, who enjoyed all the pleasures of the flesh for a millennium only to realize how empty of meaning was his pursuit of desire.\n\nKhandekar saw modernity, with its materialistic values, as an elephant on the rampage through the delicate garden of traditional virtues and feelings, blurring the distinction between good and evil, between selfishness and compassion, and blinding people to the evils of the world. In response, Khandekar looked to the past and chose the story of Yayati, making use of a kind of tale often dismissed as the fairy stories of old women to describe the vacuousness and futility of contemporary society's endless obsession with avarice and lust. Where Khandekar's writing had previously focussed predominantly on style and imagination, in ''Yayati'' these concerns are integrated into a form of social realism the author had little explored until this novel.<ref name=\"Khandekar1977\">{{cite book|last=Khandekar|first=V.

These include Mukulika and Mandar.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nThe novel has three narrator: Yayati, Devayani and Sharmishtha.<ref name=\"Lal1992\"/><ref name=\"Thorat2005\">{{cite journal|last=Thorat|first=Harishchandra|title=The \"Mahabharata\" and the Marathi Novel: Textual Strategies|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=January\u2013February 2005|volume=49|issue=1|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|page=132|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23346582}} {{closed access}}</ref> The story is narrated in different section in the first person narrative of each narrators, from their own perspective.<ref name=\"Pai2005\"/><ref name=\"Lal1992\"/> The characters in the novels mostly speak in a romantic, ornamental and poetic language.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel centres round the life of the hero, Yayati, king of Hastinapur. The early life of Yayati is characterized by a number of disillusionment. He comes to know that his mother weans him for fear of losing her beauty. Yayati's faith in motherly love is shattered with this knowledge. Later on he experiences cruelty and passion which in a sense challenges his manhood. He then has a fleeting experience of carnal love.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nWhen he has to leave the security of the palace for [[Ashvamedha]] [[Yajna]] (a horse sacrifice ritual in Hindu tradition), he meets his elder brother Yati, who became an ascetic abandoning all material pleasures. After this he meets Kacha and sees in him a model of happy, peaceful life. It is, however, when his father, Nahusha, dies, that Yayati undergoes a traumatic experience and for the first time, realizes the destructive power of death, and is gripped with fear and helplessness. While in this state of mind, he comes in contact with Mukulika, a maidservant in the palace. Yayati's attempts to bury his grief in carnal pleasures constitute a critical period of his life. Later on he meets Alaka and experiences sisterly love; but Alaka ultimately falls a prey to Queen Mother's cruelty. Precisely at this time, Yayati comes to know of a curse on his father, foretelling that he (the father) and his children shall never be happy.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe second part of the narrative tells the story of Yayati's married life. We come to know of Devayani's love for Kacha and his quiet but firm refusal. Devayani decides to take revenge on Kacha by making advances to Yayati and ultimately succeeds in marrying him. Sharmishtha, originally a princess, is now living with Devayani as her maidservant. It is at this time that she comes in contact with Yayati. While Devayani is unable to establish any rapport with Yayati, Sharmishtha finds union with him both in body and mind. This union begets a son and for sometime Yayati experiences happiness of life. However, Sharmishtha runs away from Hastinapur on a tempestuous night. Yayati now suffers estrangement from Devayani as well as loss of Sharmishtha. This causes a vacuum in his life and he speedily advances on the path of moral degradation.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nDuring the period of 18 years, Yayati neglects his duties as a king and leads a life of unfettered carnal pleasures with women like Madhavi and Taraka. Even when Hastinapur is attacked by the enemies, Yayati, because of his anger against Devayani and his life of sensual pleasures, continues to neglect his duties. His son [[Yadu]] is imprisoned. Puru, younger son of Yayati, manages his release. Then Shukracharya, Devayani's father, seeing his daughter's unhappy marriage and Yayati's degradation, puts on him the curse of old age.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nWhen Yayati finds himself suddenly old, his unfulfilled desires disturbs him. He requests his sons to lend him their youth. His son Puru comes to his help and lends Yayati his youth. However, Puru and Sharmishtha's undemanding love for Yayati help him realize his mistakes, and within a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, he resolves to return it.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/> Devayani also undergoes a change of heart. At the end, Yayati hands over the reigns of government to Puru with all the blessings and seeks retirement to forest-life with Devayani and Sharmishtha. Yayati's journey from attachment to detachment thus ends here.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\n==Deviation from the Mahabharata==\nKhandekar has maid some significant deviation in the novel from the original story of Mahabharata.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\nThe first significant deviation occurs in the episode of the death of Yayati's father, Nahusha. In The Mahabharata, Nahusha is cursed by the [[Rishi]]s (sages) to live on earth in the form of a serpent. After suffering for a long period in this fate, he eventually meets [[Pandava]] king [[Yudhishthira]], who free him from the curse. In the novel, Nahusha is shown dying in his palace, desperately clinging to life. He pleads to his wife and son to give him a few hours of their own lives so that he may live a little longer. He fears death for he still has unfulfilled desires. Nahusha's helpless struggle with death leaves a lasting sense of insecurity on his son's mind and affects his whole life.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\nIn the original story of Mahabharata, Yayati enjoys his son Puru's youth for a thousand years, then returns the youth to his son, and lives for a long time, with sages in the Himalayas, and is finally taken up in Heaven. While in the novel, Yayati can return the youth of his son only at the cost of his life. He decides to return it immediately after a few minutes of accepting Puru's youth, and he is saved from death by Kacha using Sanjivani Mantra.<ref name=\"Gupta1982\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe major characters in this narrative has been seen exemplifying major attitudes to life. Yayati represents an attitude of material pleasure-seeking. Devayani shows excessive involvement in power and pride. Sharmishtha stands for undemanding, selfless love while Kacha symbolizes a clean, moral and moderate enjoyment of life with a sense of well-being of the human race. Yati, rejecting of all material pleasures, is presented as counterpoint to Yayati.<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/>\n\nThe novel ask several moral questions \u2014 How does one define the fulfillment of life?, How can one separate the boundaries between morality and immorality?, What is the ultimate place of the pursuit of material pleasure in the context of spiritual values?<ref name=\"KMGeorge1997\"/><ref name=\"Satchidanandan2000\">{{cite journal|last=Satchidanandan|first=K.|author-link=Satchidanandan|title=Reflection: Yayati, Yet Again|journal=[[Indian Literature (journal)|Indian Literature]]|date=November\u2013December 2000|volume=44|issue=6|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|publication-place=New Delhi|pages=10|issn=0019-5804|jstor=23343302}} {{closed access}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOne of Khandekar's best-known work<ref>{{cite journal|title=Jnanpith Award to Marathi Writer, V.

Hastings was also friend and lover of [[Katherine Mansfield]], whose work was first published in ''The New Age''.<ref>Edensor, Louise. (2016).

''The Craft of Literary Biography''. p. 118</ref> .\n\n==Biography==\n\nBeatrice Hastings was born in London but grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. She was educated in Pevensey, Kent, near [[Hastings]], which may have supplied her chosen name.<ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nIn 1907 she met [[A. R. Orage]], the editor of [[The New Age]] magazine, with whom she embarked on a romantic relationship. Hastings soon began contributing to the magazine and went on to become one of its most prolific contributors, although most of her work appeared under [[pseudonyms]]. These include: Pagan, Alice Morning, A.M.A., E.H., B.L.H., Beatrice Tina, Cynicus, Robert a Field, T.K.L., D. Triformis, Edward Stafford, S. Robert West, V.M., G. Whiz, J. Wilson, Annette Doorly, Hastings Lloyd, Mrs. Malaprop, and T.W. <ref>Robert Scholes, Modernist Journals Project https://modjourn.org/biography/hastings-beatrice-emily-alice-haigh-1879-1943/</ref>. \n\nHastings' work for ''The New Age'' spanned many different forms and genres, including items of correspondence, parody, poetry, polemic, travel writing, prose fiction, and dramatic dialogue. She described herself in one instance as 'a minor poet of the first class.'<ref>Beatrice Hastings, \u2018Two Reviews\u2019, The New Age, 13.26 (October 23rd, 1913) , p.759.</ref>. One of Hastings' greatest talents was parody, and she composed parodies of many her contemporaries, including [[Ezra Pound]], [[Filippo Marinetti]], and  [[H.G. Wells]].<ref>See: \"T.K.L.\", 'The Way Back to America' (NA 13.21); \"T.K.L.\", 'Wake Up, England!\" (NA 15.8), \"B.H. and K.M.\", 'A P.S.A.' (NA 9.4)</ref>. Hastings was also outspoken in her feminist views and ''The New Age'' correspondence section provided the space in which she developed many of the ideas which would inform her 1909 feminist tract, ''Woman's Worst Enemy: Woman''. \n\nIn 1914 Hastings moved to Paris and became a figure in bohemian circles due to her friendship with [[Max Jacob]]. She shared an apartment in [[Montparnasse]] with [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and became a model for countless paintings, including his 1916 ''[[Seated Nude (1916)|Seated Nude]]''. Another friend was adventure novelist [[Charles Beadle]], with whom she had several things in common. He grew up in Hackney, spent time in South Africa (participating in the Boer War as a member of the British South African Police), and published several novels about [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] life in Paris. When Beadle came to America, from Paris, in November 1916, he listed Hastings as his nearest friend in Paris.\n\nTowards the end of her life Hastings felt excluded from the literary recognition she felt her due, and blamed Orage, whom she accused of conspiring to keep her out of literary circles in Britain. She published a pamphlet, ''The Old New Age'' (1936), in which she bitterly criticised Orage, calling him 'a rustic, a lout, a snob\u2019.<ref>Beatrice Hastings, The Old New Age: Orage and Others (London: Blue Moon Press, 1936), p.18</ref>. Hastings claimed that she \u2018offended Orage\u2019s masculine amour-propre, and for this, was made the victim of a social cabale [\u2026] a literary boycott that does, or should, matter to every reading person\u2019.<ref>Hastings, The Old New Age, p.3</ref>. While many of the contents of this pamphlet are thought to be exaggerated, it nevertheless shines a light on Orage's already well-documented misogyny, and the experience of being a female author in the 1910s.\n\nIn 1943, probably suffering from cancer, she killed herself with gas from a domestic cooker.\n\n== Posthumous Recognition ==\n\nAlthough in her lifetime, Hastings was regarded as a relatively minor literary figure, more recently she has been praised for her innovative use of pseudonyms and her pioneering feminist views.\n\nWallace Martin mentions her in his seminal study of [[The New Age]], commenting that \u2018Beatrice Hastings displayed amazing versatility as reviewer, poet, and satirist; she was most effective, albeit unnecessarily malicious, in the last capacity.\u2019<ref>Wallace Martin, The New Age Under Orage: Chapters in English Cultural History (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1967), p.125.</ref> \n\nLiterary critic [[Robert Scholes]] has noted that \"Hastings, who was an important presence on the ''New Age'' editorial staff before the war, had an unhappy life that ended in suicide, never receiving the recognition as a writer that she sought.\"<ref>[[Robert Scholes|Scholes, Robert]]. (2008). ''Paradoxy of Modernism''. Yale University Press. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0-300-10820-0}}</ref>\n\n==Theosophy==\n\nHastings was a convert to [[Theosophical Society|Theosophy]]. She attempted to defend [[Helena Blavatsky]] from charges of fraud and [[plagiarism]]. In 1937, she published two volumes entitled, ''Defence of Madame Blavatsky''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gomes |first=Michael |title=Beatrice Hastings and the Defence of Madame Blavatsky |url=http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |accessdate=28 December 2017 |url-status= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228170602/http://www.theosophycanada.com/files/hastings-solovyoff-fraud.pdf |archivedate=28 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nHer writings on Theosophy have been criticized by [[Skepticism|skeptics]].
