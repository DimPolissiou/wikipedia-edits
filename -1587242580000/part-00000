Created by [[Maria De Filippi]], the show began in 2001 and has since aired annually from October/November until May/June. The show is produced by [[Fascino P.G.T. s.r.l.]] (owned by [[Maria De Filippi]]) and is broadcast on [[Canale 5]].\n\nAmici is an academy school involving a class of about 20 youth students (18-25 age), who aspire to become professional singers, songwriters and dancers (classical, modern, jazz and hip-hop). Additional original categories of \"actors\", \"musicians\" and \"TV presenters\" have since been dropped in the recent seasons (after 2009).\n\n[[File:Maria De Filippi a Sanremo

Created by [[Maria De Filippi]], the show began in 2001 and has since aired annually from October/November until May/June. The show is produced by [[Fascino P.G.T. s.r.l.]] (owned by [[Maria De Filippi]]) and is broadcast on [[Canale 5]].\n\nAmici is an academy school involving a class of about 20 youth students (18-25 age), who aspire to become professional singers, songwriters and dancers (classical, modern, jazz and hip-hop). Additional original categories of \"actors\", \"musicians\" and \"TV presenters\" have since been dropped in the recent seasons (after 2009).\n\n[[File:Maria De Filippi a Sanremo

It has a maximum wingspan of {{convert|3.3|m|ftin|abbr=on}}{{sfn|Richard P.

The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid. It is one of the world's longest-living birds, with a lifespan of over 70 years in some cases.\n\nThe Andean condor is a national symbol of [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]] and plays an important role in the [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered [[Near Threatened|near threatened]] by the [[IUCN]].<ref name=IUCN/> It is threatened by habitat loss and by [[secondary poisoning]] from carcasses killed by hunters. [[Captive breeding]] programs have been instituted in several countries.\n\n==Taxonomy and systematics==\nThe Andean condor was described by [[Sweden|Swedish]] scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1758 in the [[10th edition of Systema Naturae|tenth edition]] of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and retains its original [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] name of ''Vultur gryphus''.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae, secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis.

The head and neck are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]] or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], the male is larger than the female.\n\nThe condor is primarily a [[scavenger]], feeding on [[carrion]]. It prefers large carcasses, such as those of [[deer]] or [[cattle]]. It reaches sexual maturity at five or six years of age and [[Bird nest|nests]] at elevations of up to {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, generally on inaccessible rock ledges. One or two eggs are usually laid.

It was released as the third and final single from Eminem's ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' (1999).  It was also released on his 2005 greatest hits album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. It samples \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]].\n\n==Background==\nWhile Eminem and Dr. Dre were at a gym, they were talking about song concepts, and Dre said that they should do a song together called \"Night 'n' Day\", where everything Dre was saying, Eminem would say the complete opposite. Eminem thought about it and went home that same night and began writing it. An announcer from a talent agency was hired to come in to voice the narrator. Eminem and co. told him his parts and what he had to say, and they made the skit around what he said.<ref>''[[Angry Blonde]]'' pg. 52 and 53</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n\"Guilty Conscience\" features a duel between the two rappers playing the roles of good and evil in someone's head in the manner of a medieval [[morality play]], i.e., the angel and devil on a person's shoulders competing for possession of the person's soul. [[Dr. Dre]] is the angel; [[Eminem|Slim Shady]] the devil. The song contains spoken parts and sound effects describing several conflicting scenarios building tension and curiosity, narrated by [[Mark Avery]]. Eminem is generally credited for writing Dre's verses as well as his own.\n\nThe first verse of the song features the story of Eddie, 23, a frustrated young man about to rob a liquor store. Dre warns Eddie not to go through with it, telling him that the witnesses will report the robbery to the police, that it will be mentioned on the news, and that Eddie will end up on the most wanted list. Slim Shady urges Eddie to go through with his plan; he tells Eddie to go to his aunts' house and disguise himself so witnesses would not recognize him. Shady uses the [[poverty]] of Eddie's family to justify the robbery, and in the unedited version, tries to persuade Eddie to [[murder]] the [[clerk (position)|store clerk]], whom Dre says is \"older than [[George Burns]]\". Though in the song alone the end is ambiguous, the [[music video]] depicts Eddie ultimately deciding not to go through with the theft and walks away.\n\nIn the next verse, the 21-year-old Stan takes an underage girl upstairs during a [[rave]] party. In the Director's Cut music video, the scene takes place at a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] party. [[Eminem]] attempts to convince Stan to [[Date rape|date-rape]] the girl over Dre's protests and warnings about jail time for [[statutory rape]], and it is left somewhat vague whether or not Stan goes through with it. Dre refers to the 1995 movie ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'' in which the climax scene shows a teenage boy date-raping a girl who is infected with HIV. In the uncensored version of the song, Slim Shady suggests unprotected sex in an earlier refrain. Shady also references [[Funkdoobiest]] front man Son Doobie. In the edited version, the intensity is toned down and Slim suggests leaving the girl passed out on her parents' doorstep. The scene, especially the edited ending version, is reminiscent of a famous scene from the movie ''[[Animal House]]''. During the narration of this scene, the song \"Hoochie Mama\" by [[2 Live Crew]] is heard playing in the background at the party.\n\nIn the third verse, Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker, comes home to find his wife having sex with another man in bed. In the unedited version, Slim Shady demands that Grady brutally kill his wife. When Dre tries to cut in, Slim tells Grady to leave his wife and take their kids with him, bringing up Dre's violent [[N.W.A]] past accusing him of [[hypocrisy]], including when he says \"You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped [[Dee Barnes]]?\" and again when he says, \"Mr. Dre, Mr. [[N.W.A]], Mr. [[AK-47|A.K.]] coming ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', y'all better make way. How in the fuck are you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\" In turn, Dre argues that Grady does not need to take the same foolish path Dre himself once took, saying \"[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]\". In the end, Shady's taunting pushes Dre into agreeing that Grady should murder both his wife and her lover. This particular ending caused a lot of [[controversy]], especially since it was left in the edited version of the song. This song was referenced multiple times in Eminem's next album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nAllmusic highlighted this song on LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-slim-shady-lp-mw0000601851|title=The Slim Shady LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> David Browne noted that Eminem's \"coldly-calculated-to-offend alter ego considers date rape\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274722,00.html|title=The Slim Shady LP - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Guilty Conscience\" has a nonstop back-beat with a chorus, unlike the album version, and a different narrator, played by actor [[Robert Culp]]. The lyrics in the chorus samples the song \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]] (''\"These voices, I hear them. And, when they talk, I'll follow\"''). The version that aired on [[MTV]] eliminated the murder at the end of the song and converted it into an escalating argument between Eminem and Dre with no resolution. The Director's Cut leaves the murder in.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_BxDwdjk Video clip] on YouTube</ref> The video is produced using the [[bullet time]] technique, depicting Eminem and Dr. Dre rapping to the song's protagonists on how to deal with their conflicting situations: including a man's temptation to robbing a liquor store, a college student's urge to have sex with an underage girl at a frat party, and the urge of a construction worker to murder his wife after he catches her cheating with another man. [[Dr. Dre]] poses as the \"good conscience\" and wins the first arguments (Eddie) while Eminem poses as the \"evil conscience\" and wins the second (Stan). However, in the third argument, which is over the actions Grady (the construction worker) should take when he catches his wife cheating with another man, [[Eminem]]'s taunting and accusations of hypocrisy coaxes [[Dr. Dre]] into agreeing with him that Grady should kill them both and subsequently Dre suggests that Grady should get his gun and murder his wife and her lover. The song contains a sample from the [[Ronald Stein]] song \"Go Home Pigs\" from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Getting Straight]]''. Eminem later released \"Guilty Conscience\" on his greatest hits album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. The nonstop back-beat and chorus from the music video were only used in the edited version of the song, but the narrator was not changed. The video won the \"Hottest Music Video\" award at the Online Hip-Hop Awards in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629000315/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000617074920/http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|title=The Online Hip-Hop Awards|archivedate=17 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> The video was listed on [[MuchMusic|MuchMusic's]] ''50 Most Controversial Videos'' at No. 38 for its promotion on how people get crossed with their consciences.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Pigs Go Home\" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.<ref name=\"OldLady\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&nbsp;...

It was released as the third and final single from Eminem's ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'' (1999).  It was also released on his 2005 greatest hits album ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. It samples \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]].\n\n==Background==\nWhile Eminem and Dr. Dre were at a gym, they were talking about song concepts, and Dre said that they should do a song together called \"Night 'n' Day\", where everything Dre was saying, Eminem would say the complete opposite. Eminem thought about it and went home that same night and began writing it. An announcer from a talent agency was hired to come in to voice the narrator. Eminem and co. told him his parts and what he had to say, and they made the skit around what he said.<ref>''[[Angry Blonde]]'' pg. 52 and 53</ref>\n\n==Lyrics==\n\"Guilty Conscience\" features a duel between the two rappers playing the roles of good and evil in someone's head in the manner of a medieval [[morality play]], i.e., the angel and devil on a person's shoulders competing for possession of the person's soul. [[Dr. Dre]] is the angel; [[Eminem|Slim Shady]] the devil. The song contains spoken parts and sound effects describing several conflicting scenarios building tension and curiosity, narrated by [[Mark Avery]]. Eminem is generally credited for writing Dre's verses as well as his own.\n\nThe first verse of the song features the story of Eddie, 23, a frustrated young man about to rob a liquor store. Dre warns Eddie not to go through with it, telling him that the witnesses will report the robbery to the police, that it will be mentioned on the news, and that Eddie will end up on the most wanted list. Slim Shady urges Eddie to go through with his plan; he tells Eddie to go to his aunts' house and disguise himself so witnesses would not recognize him. Shady uses the [[poverty]] of Eddie's family to justify the robbery, and in the unedited version, tries to persuade Eddie to [[murder]] the [[clerk (position)|store clerk]], whom Dre says is \"older than [[George Burns]]\". Though in the song alone the end is ambiguous, the [[music video]] depicts Eddie ultimately deciding not to go through with the theft and walks away.\n\nIn the next verse, the 21-year-old Stan takes an underage girl upstairs during a [[rave]] party. In the Director's Cut music video, the scene takes place at a [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] party. [[Eminem]] attempts to convince Stan to [[Date rape|date-rape]] the girl over Dre's protests and warnings about jail time for [[statutory rape]], and it is left somewhat vague whether or not Stan goes through with it. Dre refers to the 1995 movie ''[[Kids (film)|Kids]]'' in which the climax scene shows a teenage boy date-raping a girl who is infected with HIV. In the uncensored version of the song, Slim Shady suggests unprotected sex in an earlier refrain. Shady also references [[Funkdoobiest]] front man Son Doobie. In the edited version, the intensity is toned down and Slim suggests leaving the girl passed out on her parents' doorstep. The scene, especially the edited ending version, is reminiscent of a famous scene from the movie ''[[Animal House]]''. During the narration of this scene, the song \"Hoochie Mama\" by [[2 Live Crew]] is heard playing in the background at the party.\n\nIn the third verse, Grady, a 29-year-old construction worker, comes home to find his wife having sex with another man in bed. In the unedited version, Slim Shady demands that Grady brutally kill his wife. When Dre tries to cut in, Slim tells Grady to leave his wife and take their kids with him, bringing up Dre's violent [[N.W.A]] past accusing him of [[hypocrisy]], including when he says \"You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped [[Dee Barnes]]?\" and again when he says, \"Mr. Dre, Mr. [[N.W.A]], Mr. [[AK-47|A.K.]] coming ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', y'all better make way. How in the fuck are you gonna tell this man not to be violent?\" In turn, Dre argues that Grady does not need to take the same foolish path Dre himself once took, saying \"[[Been There, Done That (Dr. Dre song)|Been There, Done That]]\". In the end, Shady's taunting pushes Dre into agreeing that Grady should murder both his wife and her lover. This particular ending caused a lot of [[controversy]], especially since it was left in the edited version of the song. This song was referenced multiple times in Eminem's next album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]''.\n\n==Critical reception==\nAllmusic highlighted this song on LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-slim-shady-lp-mw0000601851|title=The Slim Shady LP - Eminem - Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards - AllMusic|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=AllMusic|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> David Browne noted that Eminem's \"coldly-calculated-to-offend alter ego considers date rape\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,274722,00.html|title=The Slim Shady LP - EW.com|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Music video==\nThe video for \"Guilty Conscience\" has a nonstop back-beat with a chorus, unlike the album version, and a different narrator, played by actor [[Robert Culp]]. The lyrics in the chorus samples the song \"[[I Will Follow Him]]\" by [[Little Peggy March]] (''\"These voices, I hear them. And, when they talk, I'll follow\"''). The version that aired on [[MTV]] eliminated the murder at the end of the song and converted it into an escalating argument between Eminem and Dre with no resolution. The Director's Cut leaves the murder in.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbw_BxDwdjk Video clip] on YouTube</ref> The video is produced using the [[bullet time]] technique, depicting Eminem and Dr. Dre rapping to the song's protagonists on how to deal with their conflicting situations: including a man's temptation to robbing a liquor store, a college student's urge to have sex with an underage girl at a frat party, and the urge of a construction worker to murder his wife after he catches her cheating with another man. [[Dr. Dre]] poses as the \"good conscience\" and wins the first arguments (Eddie) while Eminem poses as the \"evil conscience\" and wins the second (Stan). However, in the third argument, which is over the actions Grady (the construction worker) should take when he catches his wife cheating with another man, [[Eminem]]'s taunting and accusations of hypocrisy coaxes [[Dr. Dre]] into agreeing with him that Grady should kill them both and subsequently Dre suggests that Grady should get his gun and murder his wife and her lover. The song contains a sample from the [[Ronald Stein]] song \"Go Home Pigs\" from the soundtrack to the film ''[[Getting Straight]]''. Eminem later released \"Guilty Conscience\" on his greatest hits album, ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]''. The nonstop back-beat and chorus from the music video were only used in the edited version of the song, but the narrator was not changed. The video won the \"Hottest Music Video\" award at the Online Hip-Hop Awards in 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629000315/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/04_2000/041400.asp# |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000617074920/http://onlinehiphopawards.com/list_winners.cfm|title=The Online Hip-Hop Awards|archivedate=17 June 2000|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}</ref> The video was listed on [[MuchMusic|MuchMusic's]] ''50 Most Controversial Videos'' at No. 38 for its promotion on how people get crossed with their consciences.\n\n==Lawsuit==\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Pigs Go Home\" composed for the film ''[[Getting Straight]]'' by her husband, [[Ronald Stein]], who died in 1988.<ref name=\"OldLady\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1478649/eminem-sued-over-sample.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Sued&nbsp;...

A 1993 re-release of the song in the [[United Kingdom]], where the initial release had been a minor hit, peaked at number 8. \"Jump Around\" was featured at position 580 on ''[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]''{{'}}s ''1001 Best Songs Ever'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.muzieklijstjes.nl/Q1001bestsongsever.htm|title=Q - 1001 best songs ever (2003)|publisher=}}</ref> number 24 on [[VH1]]'s ''100 Greatest Songs of the 90s'',<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/ | title = 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120214035830/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s |archive-date= 2012-02-14 |url-status= dead }}</ref> number 66 on VH1's ''100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop'', number 325 on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''{{'}}s ''500 Greatest Songs Since You Were Born'' and number 47 on ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s ''100 Best Songs Of The 1990s''. The song is popular among [[dancehall]] [[disc jockey|DJs]] and is widely regarded in the United Kingdom as a club classic.\n\n==Development==\nDJ Muggs has stated that he originally produced the beat for Cypress Hill, but rapper B-Real did not want to record at that time. It was subsequently offered to [[Ice Cube]], who refused it, before finally being taken and used by House of Pain.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/feb/12/how-we-made-cypress-hill-insane-in-the-brain-muggs-sen-dog|title=How we made Cypress Hill's Insane in the Brain|last=Simpson|first=Interviews by Dave|date=2019-02-12|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-23|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===Samples===\nThe song features a distinctive [[French horn|horn]] [[fanfare]] intro, sampled from [[Bob & Earl|Bob & Earl's]] 1963 track \"[[Harlem Shuffle]]\". The song also samples \"Popeye the Hitchhiker\" by [[Chubby Checker]], but it is best known for a high-pitched squealing sound that appears at the beginning of almost every bar\u201466 times in the course of the recording.\n\nThe origin of the squeal has been the subject of debate. The website [[WhoSampled]] credits the 1967 [[Junior Walker|Junior Walker & the All Stars]] track \"Shoot Your Shot\", in which a [[tenor saxophone]] makes the noise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/sample/2335/House-of-Pain-Jump-Around-Jr.-Walker-&-the-All-Stars-Shoot-Your-Shot/|title=House of Pain's 'Jump Around' - Discover the Sample Source|author=|date=|website=WhoSampled}}</ref> However, Americans blogger [[Anil Dash]] and musician [[Questlove]] of hip-hop band [[The Roots]] have insisted on [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] \"[[Gett Off]]\" as the source. A ''[[Newsweek]]'' reader performed a [[spectrogram]] where the sample more closely matches \"Shoot Your Shot\", and House of Pain member [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] himself told Questlove that it is a horn making the squeal and not Prince. However, Anil Dash claims the band has denied that the sample is Prince to avoid paying royalties to the singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newsweek.com/princes-gett-and-24-year-mystery-hip-hop-sample-456856|title=PRINCE'S 'GETT OFF' AND THE 24-YEAR MYSTERY OF AN ICONIC HIP-HOP SAMPLE|author=Zach Schonfeld|date=May 16, 2016|website=Newsweek}}</ref> For his part, DJ Muggs says the sample came from neither Prince nor Junior Walker.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/02/house-pain-look-back-20-years-jump-around/|title=House of Pain Look Back at 20 Years of \u2018Jump Around\u2019|date=February 24, 2012|website=SPIN}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[About.com]]'s Bill Lamb said that \"after one time of hearing this riveting blend of rap and rock, you will likely never forget the sampled saxophone squeal from [[Jr. Walker]] and the All Stars that leads off every bar.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.liveabout.com/top-pop-songs-of-1992-4054134|title=Top 10 Pop Songs of 1992|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=May 24, 2019|accessdate=March 21, 2020}}</ref> He also wrote that \"for a brief period of time in the 1990s, it seemed that the marriage of edgy rock and hip-hop could actually become a thing.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year.

It is typically preceded by a video of the \"Rally Monkey\" shown on the scoreboard video screen, which usually features a clip from a classic movie with the Rally Monkey interposed into the movie scene.  The Rally Monkey then holds up a \"Rally Time\" sign and the chorus of \"Jump Around\" is played to fire up the fans to cheer for the Angels to rally and catch up in the game while the Rally Monkey is shown jumping up and down.\n\n====Melbourne City FC====\nThe song is played by Australian football club [[Melbourne City FC]] after they score goals during home games at [[AAMI Park]].\n\n====New England Patriots====\nThe song was played during the 2015 post-season in [[Gillette Stadium]] when the [[New England Patriots]] scored the final touchdown against the [[Baltimore Ravens]].

The song has played at the beginning of every home game at the [[Dean Smith Center]] since that year.  Just like Madison, during the song the entire [[student section]] jumps up and down. Occasionally, the players are seen dancing to the song as well. When the Tar Heels won the national title in [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009]], the song was played over the Smith Center loudspeakers after the final buzzer. After the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] the song was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium.\n\nWhen the Tar Heels moved a 2010 game against [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]] to the [[Greensboro Coliseum]], ''Jump Around'' was played before the opening tip of that game as well.\n\nStarting with the 2012 season, the [[North Carolina Tar Heels football|UNC football team]] started playing the song before home games at [[Kenan Memorial Stadium]].\n\n====University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison====\n[[File:Jump Around Wisconsin Badgers Sept 6 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Students in sections O & P jumping around and dancing in 2014]]\nAt home [[Wisconsin Badgers football|football]] games at the [[University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison]], students \"Jump Around\" to the song between the third and fourth quarters. The tradition grew out of the men's varsity swim team members playing it over a portable CD player and broadcasting via a smuggled-in megaphone to sections O and P during the games to rile up those sections. This began in 1992, well before the official start. In March 1997, at a Fraternity party at [[Delta Tau Delta]] at midnight the song was played with the football team and members of the future stadium employees and it became the midnight anthem for every party until the end of that year. The \"official\" start was on Saturday, October 10, 1998, at the Badgers Homecoming game against the [[Purdue Boilermakers football|Purdue Boilermakers]].<ref name=\"GBO\">{{cite web |author= Andy Bitter |url= http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |title= \"An A - to - Z Guide to Camp Randall'' |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080704173545/http://www.greaterbuckyopen.com/gbofun_campr.htm |archive-date=2008-07-04 | accessdate= July 31, 2019 }}</ref> After no offensive points were scored in the third quarter, and en route to their second 6\u20130 start of the modern football era, one of the Badgers' marketing agents, who was in charge of sound, piped the song through the loudspeakers.<ref name=\"ABC News\">{{cite web |title=Wisconsin Football: More Than a Game|first=Jen|last=Brown|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/story?id=1172725&page=1|work=[[ABC News]]|date=September 30, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> It stirred up fans and players and eventually became a tradition.<ref name=\"ABC News\" />\n\nHowever, on September 6, 2003 (the Badgers' first home game of the season), with construction of skyboxes surrounding [[Camp Randall Stadium]], UW officials decided to cancel the \"Jump Around\" due to worries about structural integrity.

Petitions circulated and students pushed back against administration. Structural engineers confirmed that the stadium would suffer no structural damage caused by the vibrations created by jumping. Two days later, Chancellor [[John D. Wiley]] announced that the \"Jump Around\" tradition would resume.<ref>{{cite web |title='Jump Around' Tradition Returns to Student Section|url=http://www.news.wisc.edu/8907|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison|date=September 10, 2003|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}</ref> The song's title is displayed on unofficial [[Wisconsin Badgers]] clothing and apparel, along with the credit/debit cards of the university's [[UW Credit Union|employee/student/alumni credit union]].\n\n====Vegas Golden Knights====\nThe song is played by the [[Vegas Golden Knights]] [[ice hockey]] team prior to face-off of the third period of their home games at [[T-Mobile Arena]].\n\n===2016 presidential campaign===\nIn 2016, then-candidate [[Donald Trump]] used the song at some of his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|rallies]].
