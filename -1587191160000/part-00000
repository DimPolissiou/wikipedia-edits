Tanneberger did not want to put together a pure dance album.

The Movin' Melodies label [4] was created in 1992 and was quickly recognized being one of the originators of the handbag / hardbag sound [5] In 1998 German producer ATB used the Movin' Melodies name for his debut studio album. This album includes the hit singles \"9 PM (Till I Come)\", \"Don't Stop!\" and \"Killer\". The album was written, produced, arranged and engineered by ATB.[6][7][8][9]\n\nUnlike the singles, the typical ATB-sound is hardly used on the album's other tracks. Tanneberger did not want to put together a pure dance album. Therefore, in addition to more club-oriented songs, there are also quiet, melodic tracks that reflect his preference for sound compositions by [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]], [[Mike Oldfield]] and [[Jean Michel Jarre]]. Track 12 (\"Beach Vibes\") is commonly misnamed as \"Ocean Trance\".\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column    = \n| total_length=\n| headline = ''Movin' Melodies'' {{nobold|\u2013 Standard edition}}\n\n| title1          = The First Tones\n| note1           = \n| length1         = 2:09\n\n| title2          = Emotion\n| note2           =\n| length2         = 4:24\n\n| title3          = Underwater World\n| note3           = \n| length3         = 4:11\n\n| title4          = Zwischenst\u00fcck\n| note4           = \n| length4         = 0:58\n\n| title5          = [[9 PM (Till I Come)]]\n| note5           = featuring [[Yolanda Rivera]]\n| length5         = 3:14\n\n| title6          = [[Killer (Adamski song)#ATB version|Killer 2000]]\n| note6           = featuring [[Drue Williams]]\n| length6         = 5:56\n\n| title7          = Too Much Rain\n| note7           = ATB vs. [[Woody van Eyden]] Mix) ([[United Deejays For Central America]]\n| length7         = 5:36\n\n| title8          = [[Don't Stop!

He grew up in [[Camlough]], [[County Armagh]], and was equally fluent in Irish and English.\n\nIn 1906, when he was 14, Donn-Byrne went to an Irish Volunteer Movement meeting with Bulmer Hobson and Robert Lynd of the London Daily News, where Lynd noticed him, a fair-haired boy, and wrote of his singing. It was through Hobson that Byrne acquired his taste for Irish history and nationalism. (The \"taste for nationalism\" cited, is contested by Bradley. Many may confuse widespread interest in Irish Language and Byrne's excellence in the language, his prizes at feiseanna (festivals) with a more revolutionary political movement engaged in by Hobson and other associates). He attended the [[University of Dublin]], beginning in 1907, where he studied Romance languages and saw his own writing published in ''The National Student'', the student magazine. After graduation he continued his studies in Europe, hoping to join the British Foreign Office. It is related that he \"turned down his PhD\" when he learned that he would have to wear evening clothes to his early morning examinations, which he apparently felt that no true Irish gentleman would ever do. (The latter claim is shown by Bradley to be just one of Byrne's impossible, if entertaining, fantasies)\n\nHe returned to New York in 1911, where he began working first for the publishers of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', the ''New Standard Dictionary'', and then the'' Century Dictionary''. In February 1912 his poem \"The Piper\" appeared in ''Harper'''s magazine. His first short story, \"Battle,\" sold soon after to ''Smart Set'' magazine for $50, appearing in the February 1914 issue. He sold more stories; some of these were anthologised in his first book, ''Stories Without Women'', 1915. He then began working on his first novel, ''The Stranger's Banque''t (1919). He was a prolific novelist and short story writer from that point on. His novel ''Field of Honor'' was published posthumously in 1929. His poems were collected into an anthology and published as Poems (1934).\n\nDespite both his wife's success as a playwright, and his own increasing popularity as an author, Byrne's financial straits forced his family to sell their house in Riverside, Connecticut, and return to Ireland. They later purchased Coolmain Castle, near Bandon in County Cork, where Byrne lived until his death in a car accident due to defective steering,<ref>New York Times, 20 June 1928</ref> in June 1928. A Kilbrittain man Cornelius O'Sullivan who witnessed the incident pulled him from the water and tried to revive him, but to no avail. He is buried in Rathclarin churchyard, near Coolmain Castle. His headstone reads, in Irish and English: \"I am in my sleeping and don't waken me.\"<ref>It first appears in ''Ireland: The Rock Whence I Was Hewn'', where Byrne concludes with the following poem:\n\nThe bells of heather/\nHave ceased ringing their Angelus./\nSleepy June weather/\nHas instilled a drug in us.//\n\nThe cry of the plover/\nIs hushed, and the friendly dark/\nHas drawn a blue hood over/\nThe meadow lark.//\n\nWe travel sleeping,/\nOver heather hill and through ferny dale,/\nTo the Land of No Weeping,/\nOf races, and piping and ale.//\n\nHushenn! Hushoo!//\n\nThe wind is hid in the mountain. The leaves/\nare still on the tree./\nThe hawk is caged in the darkness. The field-/\nmouse safe in the hay./\nNow I am in my sleeping, and don't waken me./\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nTha mee, Tha mee--/\nGolden mammy!/\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nI am in my sleeping and don't waken me!//\n\nQuoted from the National Geographic version. (Vol. 51, no. 3, March 1927, page 316).</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nThe early novels can be said to be quite mediocre, noted as \"[[potboiler]]s\" by Thurston Macauley, Byrne's earliest biographer. ''Messsa Marco Polo'' tells the story of the Italian adventurer as told by an Irishman, and ''The Wind Bloweth'' is a romantic novel of the sea. Both show some highly lyrical passages intermixed with the plain language of real life. With Raftery, however, the author seems to reinvent the saga style, the prose breaking off into musical verse now and then as it tells the story of a blind poet wandering Ireland and avenging his wife's dishonor. A television opera based on the novel by [[Joan Trimble]] was commissioned and broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1957.<ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/page/8fba50823e2e4413b76ff784e78a624a ''Radio Times'' Issue 1749, 19 May 1957, p 6, 17]</ref> \n\nHis later novels invited comparison with Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], especially in their romance and historical themes. It was with Hangman's, though, that he began to identify himself with the traditional Irish storytellers, noting in his preface (\"A Foreword to Foreigner's\") that: \"I have written a book of Ireland for Irishmen. Some phrase, some name in it may conjure up the world they knew as children.\" It is also in this novel that Byrne returns to his Irish nationalist ideas by alluding to the ongoing strife of the Irish Civil War and fight for Independence.\n\nByrne was firmly of the neo-Romantic view of the mythical and pastoral beauty of Irish history. His writing hauntingly evokes these images, sometimes seeming want to preserve them. \"It seemed to me,\" he says in Wind, \"that I was capturing for an instant a beauty that was dying slowly, imperceptibly, but would soon be gone.\" His simple narrative style is rarely found today,{{Peacock term|date=September 2016}} and has the atmosphere of ancient oral epics such as ''[[Taine Bo Cualinge]]'' and the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.\n\nSome of the works were published in the United Kingdom under different titles. These are also noted after the American title.\n\n==Works==\n=== Novels ===\n\n* Blind Raftery and His Wife Hilaria (1924)\n* Brother Saul (1927)\n* Crusade (1928)\n* Field of Honor (1929), or The Power of the Dog\n* The Foolish Matrons (1920)\n* Hangman's House (1926)\n* Messer Marco Polo<ref>{{gutenberg|no=2058|name=Messer Marco Polo by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Messer Marco Polo\n|author=Donn Byrne\n|year=1921\n|publisher=The Century Co.\n|isbn=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHAQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Donn+Byrne%22\n}}</ref> (1921)\n* O'Malley of Shanganagh (1925), or An Untitled Story\n* A Party of Bacarat (1930), or The Golden Goat\n* The Stranger's Banquet (1919)\n* The Wind Bloweth<ref>{{gutenberg|no=21999|name=The Wind Bloweth by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Wind Bloweth . \n|author=Donn Byrne\n|year=1922\n|publisher=The Century Co.\n|isbn=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nG4QAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Donn+Byrne%22\n}}</ref> (1922)\n* The Wind Bloweth was illustrated by George Bellows\n=== Short story collections ===\nDoherty, 1997,<ref>Doherty, John J.

He grew up in [[Camlough]], [[County Armagh]], and was equally fluent in Irish and English.\n\nIn 1906, when he was 14, Donn-Byrne went to an Irish Volunteer Movement meeting with Bulmer Hobson and Robert Lynd of the London Daily News, where Lynd noticed him, a fair-haired boy, and wrote of his singing. It was through Hobson that Byrne acquired his taste for Irish history and nationalism. (The \"taste for nationalism\" cited, is contested by Bradley. Many may confuse widespread interest in Irish Language and Byrne's excellence in the language, his prizes at feiseanna (festivals) with a more revolutionary political movement engaged in by Hobson and other associates). He attended the [[University of Dublin]], beginning in 1907, where he studied Romance languages and saw his own writing published in ''The National Student'', the student magazine. After graduation he continued his studies in Europe, hoping to join the British Foreign Office. It is related that he \"turned down his PhD\" when he learned that he would have to wear evening clothes to his early morning examinations, which he apparently felt that no true Irish gentleman would ever do. (The latter claim is shown by Bradley to be just one of Byrne's impossible, if entertaining, fantasies)\n\nHe returned to New York in 1911, where he began working first for the publishers of the ''Catholic Encyclopedia'', the ''New Standard Dictionary'', and then the'' Century Dictionary''. In February 1912 his poem \"The Piper\" appeared in ''Harper'''s magazine. His first short story, \"Battle,\" sold soon after to ''Smart Set'' magazine for $50, appearing in the February 1914 issue. He sold more stories; some of these were anthologised in his first book, ''Stories Without Women'', 1915. He then began working on his first novel, ''The Stranger's Banque''t (1919). He was a prolific novelist and short story writer from that point on. His novel ''Field of Honor'' was published posthumously in 1929. His poems were collected into an anthology and published as Poems (1934).\n\nDespite both his wife's success as a playwright, and his own increasing popularity as an author, Byrne's financial straits forced his family to sell their house in Riverside, Connecticut, and return to Ireland. They later purchased Coolmain Castle, near Bandon in County Cork, where Byrne lived until his death in a car accident due to defective steering,<ref>New York Times, 20 June 1928</ref> in June 1928. A Kilbrittain man Cornelius O'Sullivan who witnessed the incident pulled him from the water and tried to revive him, but to no avail. He is buried in Rathclarin churchyard, near Coolmain Castle. His headstone reads, in Irish and English: \"I am in my sleeping and don't waken me.\"<ref>It first appears in ''Ireland: The Rock Whence I Was Hewn'', where Byrne concludes with the following poem:\n\nThe bells of heather/\nHave ceased ringing their Angelus./\nSleepy June weather/\nHas instilled a drug in us.//\n\nThe cry of the plover/\nIs hushed, and the friendly dark/\nHas drawn a blue hood over/\nThe meadow lark.//\n\nWe travel sleeping,/\nOver heather hill and through ferny dale,/\nTo the Land of No Weeping,/\nOf races, and piping and ale.//\n\nHushenn! Hushoo!//\n\nThe wind is hid in the mountain. The leaves/\nare still on the tree./\nThe hawk is caged in the darkness. The field-/\nmouse safe in the hay./\nNow I am in my sleeping, and don't waken me./\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nTha mee, Tha mee--/\nGolden mammy!/\nTha mee mo hulloo is na dhooshy may!/\nI am in my sleeping and don't waken me!//\n\nQuoted from the National Geographic version. (Vol. 51, no. 3, March 1927, page 316).</ref>\n\n== Writings ==\nThe early novels can be said to be quite mediocre, noted as \"[[potboiler]]s\" by Thurston Macauley, Byrne's earliest biographer. Polo tells the story of the Italian adventurer as told by an Irishman, and Wind is a romantic novel of the sea. Both show some highly lyrical passages intermixed with the plain language of real life. With Raftery, however, the author seems to reinvent the saga style, the prose breaking off into musical verse now and then as it tells the story of a blind poet wandering Ireland and avenging his wife's dishonor.\n\nHis later novels invited comparison with Irish novelist [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]], especially in their romance and historical themes. It was with Hangman's, though, that he began to identify himself with the traditional Irish storytellers, noting in his preface (\"A Foreword to Foreigner's\") that: \"I have written a book of Ireland for Irishmen. Some phrase, some name in it may conjure up the world they knew as children.\" It is also in this novel that Byrne returns to his Irish nationalist ideas by alluding to the ongoing strife of the Irish Civil War and fight for Independence.\n\nByrne was firmly of the neo-Romantic view of the mythical and pastoral beauty of Irish history. His writing hauntingly evokes these images, sometimes seeming want to preserve them. \"It seemed to me,\" he says in Wind, \"that I was capturing for an instant a beauty that was dying slowly, imperceptibly, but would soon be gone.\" His simple narrative style is rarely found today,{{Peacock term|date=September 2016}} and has the atmosphere of ancient oral epics such as ''[[Taine Bo Cualinge]]'' and the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''.\n\nSome of the works were published in the United Kingdom under different titles. These are also noted after the American title.\n\n==Works==\n=== Novels ===\n\n* Blind Raftery and His Wife Hilaria (1924)\n* Brother Saul (1927)\n* Crusade (1928)\n* Field of Honor (1929), or The Power of the Dog\n* The Foolish Matrons (1920)\n* Hangman's House (1926)\n* Messer Marco Polo<ref>{{gutenberg|no=2058|name=Messer Marco Polo by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=Messer Marco Polo\n|author=Donn Byrne\n|year=1921\n|publisher=The Century Co.\n|isbn=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHAQAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Donn+Byrne%22\n}}</ref> (1921)\n* O'Malley of Shanganagh (1925), or An Untitled Story\n* A Party of Bacarat (1930), or The Golden Goat\n* The Stranger's Banquet (1919)\n* The Wind Bloweth<ref>{{gutenberg|no=21999|name=The Wind Bloweth by Brian Oswald Donn-Byrne}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title=The Wind Bloweth . \n|author=Donn Byrne\n|year=1922\n|publisher=The Century Co.\n|isbn=\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nG4QAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=inauthor:%22Donn+Byrne%22\n}}</ref> (1922)\n* The Wind Bloweth was illustrated by George Bellows\n=== Short story collections ===\nDoherty, 1997,<ref>Doherty, John J.

The picture was directed by [[Michael Winner]] and stars [[Robert Mitchum]] in his second film portrayal of the detective [[Philip Marlowe]]. The cast includes [[Sarah Miles]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Joan Collins]], and [[Oliver Reed]], also featuring [[James Stewart]] as General Sternwood.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077234|The Big Sleep}}</ref>\n\nThe story's setting was changed from 1940s Los Angeles to 1970s London. The film contained material more explicit than what could only be hinted at in the [[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|1946 version]], such as homosexuality, pornography, and [[nudity]]. Mitchum was 60 at the time of filming, far older than Chandler's 33-year-old Marlowe (or the 1946 film's 38-year-old Marlowe played by a 44-year-old [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]]).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970s England, private detective Philip Marlowe ([[Robert Mitchum]]) is asked to the stately home of General Sternwood ([[James Stewart]]), who hires Marlowe to learn who is blackmailing him. While at the mansion, he meets the general's spoiled and inquisitive daughter Charlotte ([[Sarah Miles]]) and wild younger daughter Camilla ([[Candy Clark]]).\n\nMarlowe's investigation of the homosexual pornographer Arthur Geiger ([[John Justin]]) leads him to Agnes Lozelle ([[Joan Collins]]), an employee of Geiger, and to Joe Brody ([[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]]), a man that Agnes has taken up with. He also discovers Camilla at the scene of Geiger's murder, where she has posed for nude photographs, and takes her home safely to a grateful Charlotte.\n\nReturning to the crime scene, Marlowe is interrupted by gambler Eddie Mars ([[Oliver Reed]]), who owns the house where Geiger's body was found. Mars' wife Mona hasn't been seen in a while and may have run off with Rusty Regan (David Savile), Charlotte's missing husband. Due to Charlotte Regan's gambling debts, Mars appears to have a hold over Charlotte as well.\n\nCamilla tries to get her pictures back from Brody, who is now in possession of them. Marlowe intervenes but Brody is shot and killed by someone unseen.\n\nA man named Harry Jones ([[Colin Blakely]]) comes to Marlowe with a proposition. He is working with Agnes now, and she is willing to sell information as to Mrs. Mars' whereabouts. But on the night Marlowe shows up for their meeting, Harry is poisoned by Lash Canino ([[Richard Boone]]), a hit man who is working for Eddie Mars.\n\nMarlowe pays Agnes for the address. He tracks down Canino at a remote garage, where he is overpowered and taken prisoner. Mars' supposedly missing wife Mona ([[Diana Quick]]) is there as well. At a moment when Canino is out, Marlowe persuades her to set him free. In a shootout, he then kills Canino.\n\nCamilla Sternwood appears to be grateful to Marlowe and asks him to teach her how to use the gun he just returned to her so that she can protect herself. He takes her to a wooded area so she can learn. After he sets up an empty can on the ledge of a wall of the ruins of a Roman castle for her to use as a target, she points the gun at him and begins pulling the trigger repeatedly. Marlowe was prepared for this and had given her the weapon loaded with blanks. She becomes hysterical at the ruse and he takes her home. It turns out that the emotionally disturbed Camilla had murdered her sister's husband Rusty and that Charlotte had covered everything up with Eddie Mars' help.\n\nAfter confronting Charlotte with the facts, Marlowe tells her to have Camilla hospitalized. He then drives away from the Sternwood residence the same way he came in, hoping that the gravely ill general will never know the truth about his two wicked daughters.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Philip Marlowe]]\n* [[Sarah Miles]] as Charlotte Sternwood Regan\n* [[Richard Boone]] as Lash Canino\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Camilla Sternwood\n* [[Joan Collins]] as Agnes Lozelle\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Joe Brody\n* [[John Mills]] as Inspector Jim Carson\n* [[James Stewart]] as General Sternwood\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as Eddie Mars\n* [[Harry Andrews]] as Norris\n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Harry Jones\n* [[Richard Todd]] as Commander Barker\n* [[Diana Quick]] as Mona Grant\n* [[James Donald]] as Inspector Gregory\n* [[John Justin]] as Arthur Geiger\n* [[Simon Fisher Turner]] as Karl Lundgren\n\n==Production==\nMitchum had also portrayed [[Philip Marlowe]] three years earlier in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'', a film shot as a period piece rather than set in the present day. Mitchum remains the only actor to play the character in more than one movie. [[Dick Powell]] portrayed him in a movie, an episode of ''[[Climax!]]'' adapting ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]'', and several radio plays. [[Powers Boothe]] portrayed the character in a series of 1986 dramas made for [[HBO]].\n\nActors who had earlier played Marlowe in feature-length films include Powell (1944), [[Humphrey Bogart]] (1946), [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] (1947), [[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]] (1947), [[James Garner]] (1969) and [[Elliott Gould]] (1973). Marlowe would be played by [[James Caan]] in the 1998 television film ''[[Poodle Springs (film)|Poodle Springs]]''.\n===Development===\nThe film was originally developed for United Artists, as when that studio bought the Warner Bros library they obtained the remake rights.<ref>'Big Sleep's' reawakening is Winner's latest film dream\nMills, Bart.

The picture was directed by [[Michael Winner]] and stars [[Robert Mitchum]] in his second film portrayal of the detective [[Philip Marlowe]]. The cast includes [[Sarah Miles]], [[Candy Clark]], [[Joan Collins]], and [[Oliver Reed]], also featuring [[James Stewart]] as General Sternwood.<ref>{{IMDb title|0077234|The Big Sleep}}</ref>\n\nThe story's setting was changed from 1940s Los Angeles to 1970s London. The film contained material more explicit than what could only be hinted at in the [[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|1946 version]], such as homosexuality, pornography, and [[nudity]]. Mitchum was 60 at the time of filming, far older than Chandler's 33-year-old Marlowe (or the 1946 film's 38-year-old Marlowe played by a 44-year-old [[Humphrey Bogart|Bogart]]).\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1970s England, private detective Philip Marlowe ([[Robert Mitchum]]) is asked to the stately home of General Sternwood ([[James Stewart]]), who hires Marlowe to learn who is blackmailing him. While at the mansion, he meets the general's spoiled and inquisitive daughter Charlotte ([[Sarah Miles]]) and wild younger daughter Camilla ([[Candy Clark]]).\n\nMarlowe's investigation of the homosexual pornographer Arthur Geiger ([[John Justin]]) leads him to Agnes Lozelle ([[Joan Collins]]), an employee of Geiger, and to Joe Brody ([[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]]), a man that Agnes has taken up with. He also discovers Camilla at the scene of Geiger's murder, where she has posed for nude photographs, and takes her home safely to a grateful Charlotte.\n\nReturning to the crime scene, Marlowe is interrupted by gambler Eddie Mars ([[Oliver Reed]]), who owns the house where Geiger's body was found. Mars' wife Mona hasn't been seen in a while and may have run off with Rusty Regan (David Savile), Charlotte's missing husband. Due to Charlotte Regan's gambling debts, Mars appears to have a hold over Charlotte as well.\n\nCamilla tries to get her pictures back from Brody, who is now in possession of them. Marlowe intervenes but Brody is shot and killed by someone unseen.\n\nA man named Harry Jones ([[Colin Blakely]]) comes to Marlowe with a proposition. He is working with Agnes now, and she is willing to sell information as to Mrs. Mars' whereabouts. But on the night Marlowe shows up for their meeting, Harry is poisoned by Lash Canino ([[Richard Boone]]), a hit man who is working for Eddie Mars.\n\nMarlowe pays Agnes for the address. He tracks down Canino at a remote garage, where he is overpowered and taken prisoner. Mars' supposedly missing wife Mona ([[Diana Quick]]) is there as well. At a moment when Canino is out, Marlowe persuades her to set him free. In a shootout, he then kills Canino.\n\nCamilla Sternwood appears to be grateful to Marlowe and asks him to teach her how to use the gun he just returned to her so that she can protect herself. He takes her to a wooded area so she can learn. After he sets up an empty can on the ledge of a wall of the ruins of a Roman castle for her to use as a target, she points the gun at him and begins pulling the trigger repeatedly. Marlowe was prepared for this and had given her the weapon loaded with blanks. She becomes hysterical at the ruse and he takes her home. It turns out that the emotionally disturbed Camilla had murdered her sister's husband Rusty and that Charlotte had covered everything up with Eddie Mars' help.\n\nAfter confronting Charlotte with the facts, Marlowe tells her to have Camilla hospitalized. He then drives away from the Sternwood residence the same way he came in, hoping that the gravely ill general will never know the truth about his two wicked daughters.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Mitchum]] as [[Philip Marlowe]]\n* [[Sarah Miles]] as Charlotte Sternwood Regan\n* [[Richard Boone]] as Lash Canino\n* [[Candy Clark]] as Camilla Sternwood\n* [[Joan Collins]] as Agnes Lozelle\n* [[Edward Fox (actor)|Edward Fox]] as Joe Brody\n* [[John Mills]] as Inspector Jim Carson\n* [[James Stewart]] as General Sternwood\n* [[Oliver Reed]] as Eddie Mars\n* [[Harry Andrews]] as Norris\n* [[Colin Blakely]] as Harry Jones\n* [[Richard Todd]] as Commander Barker\n* [[Diana Quick]] as Mona Grant\n* [[James Donald]] as Inspector Gregory\n* [[John Justin]] as Arthur Geiger\n* [[Simon Fisher Turner]] as Karl Lundgren\n\n==Production==\nMitchum had also portrayed [[Philip Marlowe]] three years earlier in ''[[Farewell, My Lovely (1975 film)|Farewell, My Lovely]]'', a film shot as a period piece rather than set in the present day. Mitchum remains the only actor to play the character in more than one movie. [[Dick Powell]] portrayed him in a movie, an episode of ''[[Climax!]]'' adapting ''[[The Long Goodbye (novel)|The Long Goodbye]]'', and several radio plays. [[Powers Boothe]] portrayed the character in a series of 1986 dramas made for [[HBO]].\n\nActors who had earlier played Marlowe in feature-length films include Powell (1944), [[Humphrey Bogart]] (1946), [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] (1947), [[George Montgomery (actor)|George Montgomery]] (1947), [[James Garner]] (1969) and [[Elliott Gould]] (1973). Marlowe would be played by [[James Caan]] in the 1998 television film ''[[Poodle Springs (film)|Poodle Springs]]''.\n===Development===\nThe film was originally developed for United Artists, as when that studio bought the Warner Bros library they obtained the remake rights.<ref>'Big Sleep's' reawakening is Winner's latest film dream\nMills, Bart.
