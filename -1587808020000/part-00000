Joffe]]. The screenplay was written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]]. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl ([[Mariel Hemingway]]) but falls in love with his best friend ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]])'s mistress ([[Diane Keaton]]). [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] also star.\n\n''Manhattan'' was filmed in [[black-and-white]] and [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and presently used aspect ratios|2.35:1 widescreen]]. It features music by [[George Gershwin]], including ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which inspired the film. Allen described the film as a combination of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]]''.<ref name=\"combo\" />\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Hemingway and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (adjusting for inflation). Often considered one of his best films, it ranks 46th on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list and number 63 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\".<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/79388/Woody-Allen/biography Woody Allen \u2013 Biography] by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>[http://altscreen.com/01/22/2012/saturday-editors-pick-manhattan-1979/ Article] in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' by [[Bilge Ebiri]] on AFI Top 100</ref> In 2001 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of images of [[Manhattan]] and other parts of [[New York City]] accompanied by [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', with Isaac Davis ([[Woody Allen]]) narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer who quits his unfulfilling job. He is dating Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), a 17-year-old girl attending the [[Dalton School]]. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie ([[Diane Keaton]]). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah ([[Wallace Shawn]]), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis ([[Meryl Streep]]) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since [[Coming out|come out]] as a [[lesbian]] and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).\n\nWhen Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted by [[Bella Abzug]] (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through [[Central Park]].\n\nAfter Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book ''Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood''. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a [[Threesome|m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds stoically and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him.\n\nIn the [[d\u00e9nouement]], Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \"life worth living\". When he finds himself saying \"Tracy's face\", he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy's on foot. He arrives at her family's apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want \"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \"not everybody gets corrupted\" before saying \"you have to have a little faith in people\". He gives her a slight smile, with a final coy look to the camera then segueing into final shots of the skyline with some bars of ''Rhapsody in Blue'' playing again. An instrumental version of \"[[Embraceable You]]\" plays over the credits.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Woody Allen]] as Isaac Davis\n* [[Diane Keaton]] as Mary Wilkie\n* [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]] as Yale Pollack\n* [[Mariel Hemingway]] as Tracy\n* [[Meryl Streep]] as Jill Davis\n* [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0126117/bio|title=Anne Byrne Hoffman|website=IMDb}}</ref> as Emily Pollack\n* [[Michael O'Donoghue]] as Dennis\n* [[Wallace Shawn]] as Jeremiah\n** This was Shawn's film debut\n* Karen Ludwig <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0525023/|title=Karen Ludwig|website=IMDb}}</ref> as Connie\n* [[Charles Levin (actor)|Charles Levin]], [[Karen Allen]], and [[David Rasche]] as Television actors\n* [[Mark Linn-Baker]] and [[Frances Conroy]] as Shakespearean actors\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nAccording to Allen, the idea for ''Manhattan'' originated from his love of Gershwin's music.

Joffe]]. The screenplay was written by Allen and [[Marshall Brickman]]. Allen co-stars as a twice-divorced 42-year-old comedy writer who dates a 17-year-old girl ([[Mariel Hemingway]]) but falls in love with his best friend ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]])'s mistress ([[Diane Keaton]]). [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] also star.\n\n''Manhattan'' was filmed in [[black-and-white]] and [[Aspect ratio (image)#Previous and presently used aspect ratios|2.35:1 widescreen]]. It features music by [[George Gershwin]], including ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', which inspired the film. Allen described the film as a combination of ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Interiors]]''.<ref name=\"combo\" />\n\nThe film received critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Hemingway and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen]] for Allen and Brickman. Its North American box-office receipts of $39.9 million made it Allen's second biggest box-office hit (adjusting for inflation). Often considered one of his best films, it ranks 46th on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs]] list and number 63 on [[Bravo (U.S. TV network)|Bravo's]] \"100 Funniest Movies\".<ref>[https://movies.nytimes.com/person/79388/Woody-Allen/biography Woody Allen \u2013 Biography] by Jason Ankeny (Rovi), in ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref><ref>[http://altscreen.com/01/22/2012/saturday-editors-pick-manhattan-1979/ Article] in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' by [[Bilge Ebiri]] on AFI Top 100</ref> In 2001 the United States [[Library of Congress]] deemed the film \"culturally significant\" and selected it for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens with a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of images of [[Manhattan]] and other parts of [[New York City]] accompanied by [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'', with Isaac Davis ([[Woody Allen]]) narrating drafts of an introduction to a book about a man who loves the city. Isaac is a twice-divorced, 42-year-old television comedy writer who quits his unfulfilling job. He is dating Tracy ([[Mariel Hemingway]]), a 17-year-old girl attending the [[Dalton School]]. His best friend, college professor Yale Pollack ([[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]]), married to Emily (Anne Byrne), is having an affair with Mary Wilkie ([[Diane Keaton]]). Mary's ex-husband and former teacher, Jeremiah ([[Wallace Shawn]]), also appears, and Isaac's ex-wife Jill Davis ([[Meryl Streep]]) is writing a confessional book about their marriage. Jill has also since [[Coming out|come out]] as a [[lesbian]] and lives with her partner, Connie (Karen Ludwig).\n\nWhen Isaac meets Mary, her cultural snobbery rubs him the wrong way. Isaac runs into her again at an [[Equal Rights Amendment]] fund-raising event at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] hosted by [[Bella Abzug]] (playing herself) and accompanies her on a cab ride home. They chat until sunrise in a sequence that culminates in the iconic shot of the [[Queensboro Bridge]]. In spite of a growing attraction to Mary, Isaac continues his relationship with Tracy but emphasizes that theirs cannot be a serious relationship and encourages her to go to London to study acting. In another iconic scene, at Tracy's request, they go on a carriage ride through [[Central Park]].\n\nAfter Yale breaks up with Mary, he suggests that Isaac ask her out. Isaac does, always having felt that Tracy was too young for him. Isaac breaks up with Tracy, much to her dismay, and before long, Mary has virtually moved into his apartment. Emily is curious about Isaac's new girlfriend. The two couples enjoy a day out and upon walking down a street Isaac spots Jill's new book ''Marriage, Divorce, and Selfhood''. Emily proceeds to read parts of the book aloud, including passages about a [[Threesome|m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois]] Isaac had with Jill and another woman, and an incident where Isaac attempted to run Connie over, much to Mary and Yale's amusement. Thoroughly humiliated, Isaac confronts Jill, who responds stoically and mentions a film rights deal she has acquired. Upon returning home, Isaac learns from Mary that she is returning to Yale and wants to break up. A betrayed Isaac confronts Yale at the college where he teaches, and Yale argues that he found Mary first. Isaac discusses Yale's extramarital affairs with Emily and learns that Yale told her Isaac introduced Mary to him.\n\nIn the [[d\u00e9nouement]], Isaac lies on his sofa, musing into a tape recorder about the things that make \"life worth living\". When he finds himself saying \"Tracy's face\", he sets down the microphone. Unable to reach her by phone, he sets out for Tracy's on foot. He arrives at her family's apartment building just as she is leaving for London. He asks her not to go and says he does not want \"that thing about [her] that [he] like[s]\" to change. She replies that the plans have already been made and reassures him that \"not everybody gets corrupted\" before saying \"you have to have a little faith in people\".

The city is noted for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products. Dehradun houses various defense academies and research institutes, such as [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Rashtriya Indian Military College]], [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]], [https://www.oflox.com Oflox] and [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827\u20131828.\n\n[[File:Capt john.jpg|thumb|Capt John War memorial maintained by army at Dehradun]]\n[[Jawaharlal Nehru]], India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited.

It was the birthplace of the second to last [[King of Afghanistan]], [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]]. Two quaint palaces \u2014 the Kabul Place in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie \u2014 stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan. The Balahissar Palace has now been turned into Mussoorie's [[Wynberg Allen School]].

As the state capital, Dehradun is home to many government institutions. \n\nBuses are identified with blue bars. There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower. It was called \"The Gray City\" in the initial days because ex-Army officers and VIPs considered this place ideal for residence after retirement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://210.212.78.56/dehradun/Hindi/indexcity.html |title=\u0926\u0947\u0939\u0930\u093e\u0926\u0942\u0928 |accessdate=26 March 2011 |language=Hindi |trans-title=Dehradun |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921100815/http://210.212.78.56/dehradun/Hindi/indexcity.html |archive-date=21 September 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWoolen blankets are typical of this region and worn by people living at high altitude. Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year.

The city is noted for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as [[Mussoorie]], and [[Auli, India|Auli]] and the [[Hindu]] holy cities of [[Haridwar]] and [[Rishikesh]] along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of [[Chota Char Dham]]. Dehradun is also known for its [[Basmati]] rice and bakery products. Dehradun houses various defense academies and research institutes, such as [[Indian Military Academy]], [[Rashtriya Indian Military College]], [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]], [https://www.oflox.com Oflox] and [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]].\n\n==Etymology==\nDehradun is made up of two words: ''Dehra'' is derived from the word ''Dera'', meaning camp or temporary settlement. ''Dun'' or ''Doon'' in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \"[[Shivaliks]]\". Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. When Ram Rai, son of [[Guru Har Rai]], came to this region with his followers, he established a camp here for them. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. In ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]] the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here hence the name, \"Dronanagari\" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Lord [[Rama]], Lord Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. [[Dronacharya]], also known as \u2018Dronanagari\u2019 on the name of legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.\n\nIn the seventh century this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as the name of [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \"Dehra or Gooroodwara\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.\n[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]\nDehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \"Dera\" (camp) in \"dun\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.\n\nThe Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building of Darbar Shri Guru Ram Rai Ji Maharaj was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of the Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.\n\n[[File:Flag of Tehri Garhwal.svg|thumb|left|Princely flag of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Kingdom of Garhwal]]. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] in 1816.]]\nDehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806 Nepalese King [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.\n\nOn the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went on war from 1814 to 1816.

As the state capital, Dehradun is home to many government institutions. \n\nBuses are identified with blue bars. There are autorickshaws which are often used for transportation but blamed for pollution and noise. The evening buzz of Rajpur road is an attraction. The city centre is easily recognised by the [[Clock tower|Clock Tower]] (Ghanta Ghar), a structure with six functioning clocks. The statue of San Dijen placed in Shanti Niketan contributes to the beauty of the city. Dehradun has been home to artists and writers including [[Stephen Alter]], [[Nayantara Sahgal]], [[Allan Sealy]], [[Ruskin Bond]] and also to country singer [[Bobby Cash (singer)|Bobby Cash]].\n\nDehradun was home to freedom fighters whose names are engraved in gold on the Clock Tower.

Women wear saris with full-sleeve blouses along with angora jackets. Girls wear full skirts with scarfs covering their head and shoulders; more recently, they have adopted modern wear like salwar suits. In villages and to a lesser extent in towns, men wear the traditional dhoti, angarakha and langoti. The way dhotis are worn represents backgrounds and castes: short dhotis represent low status whereas long dhotis represent high. It is more common in urban areas for men to wear shirts and trousers, jeans and kurta-pyjamas. In winter, men usually dress in jackets, hats and overcoats. Hemp is grown in great quantities in this region, so its yarn is frequently used as lining.\n\nThere are fairs ([[mela]]s) throughout the year. Notable fairs include Magh Mela, held on 14 January and Jhanda Mela in March, a fair for the Hindu community, that attracts Hindus from all over India and abroad.\n\n==Sport==\nThe first indoor ice rink in India that meets the size requirements for [[ice hockey]], [[figure skating]], [[short track speed skating|short track]] and [[rink bandy]] was built in Dehradun.<ref name=IceRink>{{cite web |title=Nation's biggest ice-skating rink draws players from across country |author=Sandeep Rana |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524034007/http://www.tribuneindia.com/2010/20101218/dplus.htm#1 |archive-date=24 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cricket Association of Uttarakhand]] is the governing body of the cricket activities in the Uttarakhand state of India and the [[Uttarakhand cricket team]].

(Evidence suggests, as mentioned earlier, that the previous events occurred, instead at Voghera in the 1370s.)\nAfter his death, according to the ''Golden Legend'';{{quote|anon an angel brought from heaven a table divinely written with letters of gold into the prison, which he laid under the head of S.

The 16th-century [[Scuola Grande di San Rocco]] and the adjacent [[San Rocco, Venice|church of San Rocco]] were dedicated to him by a confraternity at [[Venice]], where his body was said to have been surreptitiously translated and was triumphantly inaugurated in 1485;{{sfnp|Marshall|1994|p=505}} the ''[[Scuola Grande di San Rocco|Scuola Grande]]'' is famous for its sequence of paintings by [[Tintoretto]], who painted St. Roch in glory in a ceiling canvas (1564).\n[[Image:St Rochus.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of St. Roch, B\u00edl\u00e1 Hora, Prague (1751)]]\nWe know for certain that the body of St. Roch was carried from Voghera, instead of Montpellier as previously thought, to Venice in 1485. [[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492\u20131503) built a church and a hospital in his honor. [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) instituted a [[confraternity]] of St. Roch.

In 1590 the Venetian ambassador at Rome reported back to the Serenissima that he had been repeatedly urged to present the witnesses and documentation of the life and miracles of San Rocco, already deeply entrenched in the Venetian life, because [[Pope Sixtus V]] \"is strong in his opinion either to canonize him or else to remove him from the ranks of the saints;\" the ambassador had warned a cardinal of the general scandal that would result if the widely venerated San Rocco were impugned as an impostor.

He is usually represented in the garb of a pilgrim, often lifting his tunic to demonstrate the plague sore, or [[bubo]], in his thigh, and accompanied by a dog carrying a loaf in its mouth. The [[Third Order of Saint Francis]], by tradition, claims him as a member and includes his feast on its own [[calendar of saints]], observing it on August 17.\n\n==Saint Roch in art==\n[[File:Ribalta-san roque.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Roch, by [[Francesc Ribalta|Francesco Ribalta]], ca. 1625, Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia.]]\nFollowing the Black Death, especially the Italian plague epidemic of 1477\u201379, new images of Christian martyrs and saints appeared and Saint Roch gained new fame and popularity. The religious art of the time emphasized the importance of the saint to plague-ridden Christians.\n\nThe new plague-related images of Saint Roch were drawn from a variety of sources. Plague texts dating from ancient and classical times, as well as Christian, scientific and folk beliefs, all contributed to this emerging visual tradition.  Some of the most popular symbols of plague were swords, darts, and most especially arrows.  There was also a prevalence of [[memento mori]] themes, dark clouds, and astrological signs (signa magna) such as comets, which were often referenced by physicians and writers of plague tracts as causes of plague. The physical symptoms of plague \u2013 a raised arm, a tilted head, or a collapsed body \u2013 began to symbolize plague in post-Black Death painting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boeckl|first=Christine M.|title=Images of Plague and Pestilence: Iconography and Iconology|year=2000|publisher=Truman State University Press|location=Kirksville, MO}}</ref>\n\nPlague saints offered hope and healing before, during, and after times of plague.  A specific style of painting, the plague votive, was considered a talisman for warding off plague. It portrayed a particular saint as an intercessor between God and the person or persons who commissioned the painting \u2013 usually a town, government, lay confraternity, or religious order to atone for the \"collective guilt\" of the community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worcester|first=Thomas W.|title=Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 1500\u20131800|year=2005|publisher=Worcester Art Museum|location=Worcester, MA|page=153}}</ref>\n\nThese plague votives worked as a psychological defense against disease in which people attempted to manipulate their situation through requesting the intercession of a saint against the arrows of plague.  Rather than a society depressed and resigned to repeated epidemics, these votives represent people taking positive steps to regain control over their environment. Paintings of St. Roch represent the confidence in which renaissance worshipers sought to access supernatural aid in overcoming the ravages of plague.\n\nThe very abundance of means by which people invoked the aid of the celestial court is essential in understanding Renaissance responses to the disease.  Rather than depression or resignation, people \"possessed a confidence that put even an apocalyptic disaster of the magnitude of the Black Death into perspective of God's secure and benevolent plan for humankind.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberth|first=John|title=The Black Death: The Great Mortality of 1348\u20131350: A Brief History with Documents|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}}</ref>\n\nThe plague votives functioned both to request intercessory aid from plague saints and to provide catharsis for a population that had just witnessed the profound bodily destruction of the plague. By showing plague saints such as St. Roch and St. Sebastian, votives influenced the distribution of God's mercy by invoking the memory of the human suffering experienced by Christ during the Passion. In the art of St. Roch after 1477 the saint displayed the wounds of his martyrdom without evidence of pain or suffering. Roch actively lifted his clothing to display the plague bubo in his thigh. This display of his plague bubo showed that \"he welcomed his disease as a divinely sent opportunity to imitate the sufferings of Christ\u2026 [his] patient endurance [of the physical suffering of plague was] a form of martyrdom.\"<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 505\">{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Louise|title=Manipulating the Sacred: Image and Plague in Renaissance Italy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|year=1994|volume=47|issue=3|pages=485\u2013532|doi=10.2307/2863019|jstor=2863019|ref=harv|postscript=,}} p.&nbsp;505</ref>\n\nRoch's status as a pilgrim who suffered plague is paramount in his iconography. \"The sight of Roch scarred by the plague yet alive and healthy must have been an emotionally-charged image of a promised cure.

Count Gothard, following his hunting dog that carried the bread, discovered Saint Roch and became his acolyte.\n\nOn his return incognito to Montpellier he was arrested as a spy (by orders of his own uncle) and thrown into prison, where he languished five years and died on 16 August 1327, without revealing his name, to avoid worldly glory.

[[Pope Alexander VI]] (1492\u20131503) built a church and a hospital in his honor. [[Pope Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) instituted a [[confraternity]] of St. Roch.

In 1590 the Venetian ambassador at Rome reported back to the Serenissima that he had been repeatedly urged to present the witnesses and documentation of the life and miracles of San Rocco, already deeply entrenched in the Venetian life, because [[Pope Sixtus V]] \"is strong in his opinion either to canonize him or else to remove him from the ranks of the saints;\" the ambassador had warned a cardinal of the general scandal that would result if the widely venerated San Rocco were impugned as an impostor.

He is usually represented in the garb of a pilgrim, often lifting his tunic to demonstrate the plague sore, or [[bubo]], in his thigh, and accompanied by a dog carrying a loaf in its mouth. The [[Third Order of Saint Francis]], by tradition, claims him as a member and includes his feast on its own [[calendar of saints]], observing it on August 17.\n\n==Saint Roch in art==\n[[File:Ribalta-san roque.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Roch, by [[Francesc Ribalta|Francesco Ribalta]], ca. 1625, Museo de Bellas Artes, Valencia.]]\nFollowing the Black Death, especially the Italian plague epidemic of 1477\u201379, new images of Christian martyrs and saints appeared and Saint Roch gained new fame and popularity. The religious art of the time emphasized the importance of the saint to plague-ridden Christians.\n\nThe new plague-related images of Saint Roch were drawn from a variety of sources. Plague texts dating from ancient and classical times, as well as Christian, scientific and folk beliefs, all contributed to this emerging visual tradition.  Some of the most popular symbols of plague were swords, darts, and most especially arrows.  There was also a prevalence of [[memento mori]] themes, dark clouds, and astrological signs (signa magna) such as comets, which were often referenced by physicians and writers of plague tracts as causes of plague. The physical symptoms of plague \u2013 a raised arm, a tilted head, or a collapsed body \u2013 began to symbolize plague in post-Black Death painting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boeckl|first=Christine M.|title=Images of Plague and Pestilence: Iconography and Iconology|year=2000|publisher=Truman State University Press|location=Kirksville, MO}}</ref>\n\nPlague saints offered hope and healing before, during, and after times of plague.  A specific style of painting, the plague votive, was considered a talisman for warding off plague. It portrayed a particular saint as an intercessor between God and the person or persons who commissioned the painting \u2013 usually a town, government, lay confraternity, or religious order to atone for the \"collective guilt\" of the community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Worcester|first=Thomas W.|title=Hope and Healing: Painting in Italy in a Time of Plague, 1500\u20131800|year=2005|publisher=Worcester Art Museum|location=Worcester, MA|page=153}}</ref>\n\nThese plague votives worked as a psychological defense against disease in which people attempted to manipulate their situation through requesting the intercession of a saint against the arrows of plague.  Rather than a society depressed and resigned to repeated epidemics, these votives represent people taking positive steps to regain control over their environment. Paintings of St. Roch represent the confidence in which renaissance worshipers sought to access supernatural aid in overcoming the ravages of plague.\n\nThe very abundance of means by which people invoked the aid of the celestial court is essential in understanding Renaissance responses to the disease.  Rather than depression or resignation, people \"possessed a confidence that put even an apocalyptic disaster of the magnitude of the Black Death into perspective of God's secure and benevolent plan for humankind.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Aberth|first=John|title=The Black Death: The Great Mortality of 1348\u20131350: A Brief History with Documents|year=2005|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}}</ref>\n\nThe plague votives functioned both to request intercessory aid from plague saints and to provide catharsis for a population that had just witnessed the profound bodily destruction of the plague. By showing plague saints such as St. Roch and St. Sebastian, votives influenced the distribution of God's mercy by invoking the memory of the human suffering experienced by Christ during the Passion. In the art of St. Roch after 1477 the saint displayed the wounds of his martyrdom without evidence of pain or suffering. Roch actively lifted his clothing to display the plague bubo in his thigh. This display of his plague bubo showed that \"he welcomed his disease as a divinely sent opportunity to imitate the sufferings of Christ\u2026 [his] patient endurance [of the physical suffering of plague was] a form of martyrdom.\"<ref name=\"Marshall 1994 505\">{{cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Louise|title=Manipulating the Sacred: Image and Plague in Renaissance Italy|journal=Renaissance Quarterly|year=1994|volume=47|issue=3|pages=485\u2013532|doi=10.2307/2863019|jstor=2863019|ref=harv|postscript=,}} p.&nbsp;505</ref>\n\nRoch's status as a pilgrim who suffered plague is paramount in his iconography. \"The sight of Roch scarred by the plague yet alive and healthy must have been an emotionally-charged image of a promised cure.

The original developer was William R. Forman, founder of Pacific Theatres.\n\n== History ==\nIn February 1963, [[Cinerama]] Inc. unveiled a radically new design for theaters which would show its movies. They would be based on the [[geodesic dome]] developed by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], would cost half as much as conventional theaters of comparable size, and could be built in half the time. Cinerama's goal was to see at least 600 built worldwide within two years. The following April, Pacific Theatres Inc. announced plans to build the first theater based upon the design, and had begun razing existing buildings at the [[Construction|construction site]]. Located on Sunset near [[Vine Street]], it would be the first new major motion picture theater in Hollywood in 33 years, and would be completed in time for the scheduled November 2 press premiere of ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''. The design was proposed by French architect Pierre Cabrol, lead designer in the noted architectural firm of [[Welton Becket|Welton Becket and Associates]]. Pierre Cabrol worked with R. Buckminster Fuller during his studies at the M.I.T..\n\nPacific Theatres founder, William R. Forman, announced the construction of the Cinerama Dome in July 1963 at a star studded ground breaking ceremony where Spencer Tracy, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Edie Adams, and Dorothy Provine donned hard hats, and with picks and shovels, began construction. Forman had committed to United Artists that the theatre would be ready for the November 7, 1963 world premiere of the first movie filmed in the new 70mm, single strip Cinerama process, Stanley Kramer\u2019s It\u2019s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World.

The original developer was William R. Forman, founder of Pacific Theatres.\n\n== History ==\nIn February 1963, [[Cinerama]] Inc. unveiled a radically new design for theaters which would show its movies. They would be based on the [[geodesic dome]] developed by [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], would cost half as much as conventional theaters of comparable size, and could be built in half the time. Cinerama's goal was to see at least 600 built worldwide within two years. The following April, Pacific Theatres Inc. announced plans to build the first theater based upon the design, and had begun razing existing buildings at the [[Construction|construction site]]. Located on Sunset near [[Vine Street]], it would be the first new major motion picture theater in Hollywood in 33 years, and would be completed in time for the scheduled November 2 press premiere of ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]''. The design was proposed by French architect Pierre Cabrol, lead designer in the noted architectural firm of [[Welton Becket|Welton Becket and Associates]]. Pierre Cabrol worked with R. Buckminster Fuller during his studies at the M.I.T..\n\nPacific Theatres founder, William R. Forman, announced the construction of the Cinerama Dome in July 1963 at a star studded ground breaking ceremony where Spencer Tracy, Buddy Hackett, Mickey Rooney, Dick Shawn, Edie Adams, and Dorothy Provine donned hard hats, and with picks and shovels, began construction. Forman had committed to United Artists that the theatre would be ready for the November 7, 1963 world premiere of the first movie filmed in the new 70mm, single strip Cinerama process, Stanley Kramer\u2019s It\u2019s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad, World. Working around the clock, the entire construction spanned only 16 weeks. The Cinerama Dome is the only concrete geodesic dome in the world. The theatre is made up of 316 individual hexagonal and pentagonal shapes in 16 different sizes. Each of these pieces is approximately 12 feet across and weigh around 7,500 pounds.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of

The station is owned by [[Quincy Media]], which also operates [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KXLT-TV]] (channel 47, also licensed to Rochester) under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA) with owner [[SagamoreHill Broadcasting]]. The two stations share studios in Rochester on Bandel Road Northwest along [[U.S. Route 52 in Minnesota|US 52]], and also maintain an advertising sales office on Lakeview Drive in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], that serves [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.clearlakeiowa.com/list/member/kxlt-tv-fox-47-rochester-5300|title=KXLT - TV FOX 47|work=clearlakeiowa.com}}</ref> KTTC's transmitter is located south of [[Ostrander, Minnesota]], near the [[Fillmore County, Minnesota|Fillmore]]\u2013[[Mower County, Minnesota|Mower]] county line.\n\n==History==\nThe station launched on July 14, 1953, under the [[call sign]] '''KROC-TV''', making it the first station in Southern Minnesota and third in the state after [[KSTP-TV]] and [[WCCO-TV|WTCN-TV]] in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]]. It was owned by the Gentling family and their Southern Minnesota Broadcasting Company, it was sister to KROC radio ([[KROC (AM)|AM 1340]] and [[KROC-FM|FM 106.9]]). The station's original studios and transmitter were located on Hennessey Hill, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} west of Rochester. The station carried programming from all four commercial networks of the 1950s: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] but was a primary NBC affiliate.<ref>[http://www.ellwanger.tv/collect/tvg/eds/old/nw.html]</ref> The station was launched by G. David Gentling, son of family patriarch Gregory P. Gentling. In November 1966, the station moved to a new building on First Avenue Southwest in Downtown Rochester.\n\nIn 1976, due to [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) restrictions on ownership of multiple stations in a single [[media market|market]], the station was purchased by Quincy Newspapers from Southern Minnesota Broadcasting. The Gentlings would hold onto the radio stations until 2003. In accordance with an FCC regulation in place then that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership groups from sharing the same callsign, channel 10's callsign became '''KTTC''' that July. KTTC-DT began broadcasting on [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 36 in September 2000.<ref>http://www.kttc.com/Global/story.asp?S=9790528&nav=menu1348_2</ref> The station has been digital-only since February 17, 2009.<ref>[http://news.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=2&a=385791 TV's digital conversion begins in Rochester]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Post-Bulletin, Feb 17/2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kttc.com/Global/story.asp?S=9790528&nav=menu1348_2|title=KTTC-TV has ended its analog signal.

However, Quincy could not buy KXLT due to FCC rules governing duopolies. The FCC does not allow two of the four highest-rated stations to be owned by one company. Additionally, Rochester\u2013[[Austin, Minnesota|Austin]]\u2013[[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] has only six full-power stations, not enough to legally permit a duopoly in any case. Nevertheless, Quincy took over KXLT's operations under a shared services agreement. In 2002, KTTC relocated from its longtime studios on First Avenue Southwest in Downtown Rochester to its current location on Bandel Road in North Rochester, the then-current offices for KXLT. Shockley would later sell the Fox station to SagamoreHill Broadcasting in 2005 which continued the operational agreement with Quincy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sccweb.com/televisi.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001205011900/http://www.sccweb.com/televisi.htm|title=Shockley Communications Corporation - Television|archivedate=5 December 2000|work=sccweb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn November of 2011, the former KTTC studio on First Avenue SW was demolished to clear the way for the University of Minnesota Rochester's future campus.<ref>https://www.postbulletin.com/gallery/photos-demolished-rochester-buildings/collection_fff6b4b4-443e-11e9-a727-0fdb5fbdf432.html#3</ref> The City of Rochester sold that property and the Fourth Street Boxing Gym and a small halal market were included in the deal. They were also demolished.\n\n==KTTC-DT2==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\n'''KTTC-DT2''' is the [[The CW Plus|CW+]]-affiliated second [[digital subchannel]] of KTTC, broadcasting in [[720p]] high definition on virtual and VHF channel 10.2.\n\n===History===\nWhat is now KTTC-DT2 began on [[1998 in American television|September 21, 1998]] after KTTC entered into a partnership with [[The WB 100+ Station Group|The WB 100+]], a national programming service operated by [[The WB]] for television [[Media market|markets]] ranked greater than 100, and [[cable television|cable]] systems in the Rochester area. Prior to 1998, The WB's programming was available in Rochester via WGN-TV's national feed or local WB affiliate KMWB (now [[WUCW]]) in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]]. It was a cable-exclusive station, and as a result, used the [[call signs in North America|call sign]] '''\"KWBR\"''' (standing for \"The '''WB''' '''R'''ochester\") in a fictional manner for identification purposes. KTTC provided local advertisement opportunities and performed promotional duties for the outlet.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, [[CBS Corporation]] (which [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|became separate]] from [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] after 2005) and [[Warner Bros. Television]] (the company which owned The WB) announced they then would cease operating the [[UPN]] and WB networks and combine their resources to create a programming service entitled [[The CW]]. The letters would represent the first initial of the new network's respective corporate parents.\n\nOn September 18 of that year, The CW officially launched nationwide at which point KTTC added a new second digital subchannel to simulcast \"KWBR\" and allowing non-cable subscribers access to the new network. With its over-their-air launch, \"KWBR\" began using '''KTTC-DT2''' as its official calls and became part of The CW Plus, a successor to The WB 100+.\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It provides over-the-air service of NBC to viewers in La Crosse unable to receive [[Gray Television]]'s [[WEAU]] (based in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]]) due to area topography.\n\nThere are two different signals from the same tower carrying The CW Plus national service as WXOW also carries a CW subchannel. However, WEAU and WXOW-DT2 are considered the area's primary NBC and CW affiliates respectively and are the only affiliates available on [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] providers.\n\n===Former translators===\nIn the La Crosse area, KTTC's analog translator W67CH channel 67 ceased broadcasting on November 4, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=17478488#post17478488|title=LaCrosse / Wausau, WI - HDTV - Page 47 - AVS - Home Theater Discussions And Reviews|work=avsforum.com}}</ref> It was replaced with digital translator station W50DR-D which went on-the-air at 2:10 in the afternoon on October 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=17355845#post17355845|title=LaCrosse / Wausau, WI - HDTV - Page 47 - AVS - Home Theater Discussions And Reviews|work=avsforum.com}}</ref> W50DR was subsequently replaced with W34FC in August 2018.

Known as ''Fox 47 News at Nine'', the program originates from a secondary set at the Bandel Road Northwest studios. It features a unique graphics package and news music theme that is different from KTTC. KXLT uses most of this NBC outlet's on-air personnel but maintains separate news anchors who can report for KTTC. At some point in 2009, KIMT added the market's second prime time local news show at 9 to its [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliated second digital subchannel. This newscast could be seen for a half hour competing with KXLT's broadcast. Eventually, the effort would be reduced to a five-minute weather cut-in featuring an updated [[weather forecasting|forecast]].\n\nOn June 12, 2009, KIMT became the market's first television station to upgrade local newscast production to [[16:9]] [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]] [[widescreen]] (with some portions in full high definition). Although not truly HD, the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] matched that of high definition television screens. Video reports from the field were still seen in pillarboxed [[4:3]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]. It would not be until March 20, 2011 when KTTC performed an upgrade to full high definition newscasts. With the launch to HD came a brand new set and high definition graphics.\n\nOn July 28, 2014, KXLT debuted a weekday morning show known as ''Fox in the Morning'' (that is produced by KTTC). Airing for thirty minutes at 8 a.m., the program is formatted like a magazine with lifestyle, cooking, and style segments although there are local weather updates featured in the show.

The station is owned by [[Quincy Media]], which also operates [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] affiliate [[KXLT-TV]] (channel 47, also licensed to Rochester) under a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA) with owner [[SagamoreHill Broadcasting]]. The two stations share studios in Rochester on Bandel Road Northwest along [[U.S. Route 52 in Minnesota|US 52]], and also maintain an advertising sales office on Lakeview Drive in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], that serves [[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.clearlakeiowa.com/list/member/kxlt-tv-fox-47-rochester-5300|title=KXLT - TV FOX 47|work=clearlakeiowa.com}}</ref> KTTC's transmitter is located south of [[Ostrander, Minnesota]], near the [[Fillmore County, Minnesota|Fillmore]]\u2013[[Mower County, Minnesota|Mower]] county line.\n\n==History==\nThe station launched on July 14, 1953, under the [[call sign]] '''KROC-TV''', making it the first station in Southern Minnesota and third in the state after [[KSTP-TV]] and [[WCCO-TV|WTCN-TV]] in the [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]]. It was owned by the Gentling family and their Southern Minnesota Broadcasting Company, it was sister to KROC radio ([[KROC (AM)|AM 1340]] and [[KROC-FM|FM 106.9]]). The station's original studios and transmitter were located on Hennessey Hill, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} west of Rochester. The station carried programming from all four commercial networks of the 1950s: [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] but was a primary NBC affiliate.<ref>[http://www.ellwanger.tv/collect/tvg/eds/old/nw.html]</ref> The station was launched by G. David Gentling, son of family patriarch Gregory P. Gentling. In November 1966, the station moved to a new building on First Avenue Southwest in Downtown Rochester.\n\nIn 1976, due to [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) restrictions on ownership of multiple stations in a single [[media market|market]], the station was purchased by Quincy Newspapers from Southern Minnesota Broadcasting. The Gentlings would hold onto the radio stations until 2003. In accordance with an FCC regulation in place then that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market, but with different ownership groups from sharing the same callsign, channel 10's callsign became '''KTTC''' that July. KTTC-DT began broadcasting on [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] channel 36 in September 2000.<ref>http://www.kttc.com/Global/story.asp?S=9790528&nav=menu1348_2</ref> The station has been digital-only since February 17, 2009.<ref>[http://news.postbulletin.com/newsmanager/templates/localnews_story.asp?z=2&a=385791 TV's digital conversion begins in Rochester]{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Post-Bulletin, Feb 17/2009</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kttc.com/Global/story.asp?S=9790528&nav=menu1348_2|title=KTTC-TV has ended its analog signal.

However, Quincy could not buy KXLT due to FCC rules governing duopolies. The FCC does not allow two of the four highest-rated stations to be owned by one company. Additionally, Rochester\u2013[[Austin, Minnesota|Austin]]\u2013[[Mason City, Iowa|Mason City]] has only six full-power stations, not enough to legally permit a duopoly in any case. Nevertheless, Quincy took over KXLT's operations under a shared services agreement. In 2002, KTTC relocated from its longtime studios on First Avenue Southwest in Downtown Rochester to its current location on Bandel Road in North Rochester, the then-current offices for KXLT. Shockley would later sell the Fox station to SagamoreHill Broadcasting in 2005 which continued the operational agreement with Quincy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sccweb.com/televisi.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001205011900/http://www.sccweb.com/televisi.htm|title=Shockley Communications Corporation - Television|archivedate=5 December 2000|work=sccweb.com}}</ref>\n\nIn November of 2011, the former KTTC studio on First Avenue SW was demolished to clear the way for the University of Minnesota Rochester's future campus.<ref>https://www.postbulletin.com/gallery/photos-demolished-rochester-buildings/collection_fff6b4b4-443e-11e9-a727-0fdb5fbdf432.html#3</ref> The City of Rochester sold that property and the Fourth Street Boxing Gym and a small halal market were included in the deal. They were also demolished.\n\n==KTTC-DT2==\n{{Unreferenced-section|date=April 2019}}\n'''KTTC-DT2''' is the [[The CW Plus|CW+]]-affiliated second [[digital subchannel]] of KTTC, broadcasting in [[720p]] high definition on virtual and VHF channel 10.2.\n\n===History===\nWhat is now KTTC-DT2 began on [[1998 in American television|September 21, 1998]] after KTTC entered into a partnership with [[The WB 100+ Station Group|The WB 100+]], a national programming service operated by [[The WB]] for television [[Media market|markets]] ranked greater than 100, and [[cable television|cable]] systems in the Rochester area. Prior to 1998, The WB's programming was available in Rochester via WGN-TV's national feed or local WB affiliate KMWB (now [[WUCW]]) in [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul]]. It was a cable-exclusive station, and as a result, used the [[call signs in North America|call sign]] '''\"KWBR\"''' (standing for \"The '''WB''' '''R'''ochester\") in a fictional manner for identification purposes. KTTC provided local advertisement opportunities and performed promotional duties for the outlet.\n\nOn January 24, 2006, [[CBS Corporation]] (which [[Viacom (original)#2005 split|became separate]] from [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]] after 2005) and [[Warner Bros. Television]] (the company which owned The WB) announced they then would cease operating the [[UPN]] and WB networks and combine their resources to create a programming service entitled [[The CW]]. The letters would represent the first initial of the new network's respective corporate parents.\n\nOn September 18 of that year, The CW officially launched nationwide at which point KTTC added a new second digital subchannel to simulcast \"KWBR\" and allowing non-cable subscribers access to the new network. With its over-their-air launch, \"KWBR\" began using '''KTTC-DT2''' as its official calls and became part of The CW Plus, a successor to The WB 100+.\n\n==Digital channels==\nThe station's digital signal is [[multiplex (TV)|multiplexed]]:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It provides over-the-air service of NBC to viewers in La Crosse unable to receive [[WEAU]] (based in [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin]]) due to area topography.\n\nThere are two different signals from the same tower carrying The CW Plus national service as WXOW also carries a CW subchannel. However, WEAU and WXOW-DT2 are considered the area's primary NBC and CW affiliates respectively and are the only affiliates available on [[cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] providers.\n\n===Former translators===\nIn the La Crosse area, KTTC's analog translator W67CH channel 67 ceased broadcasting on November 4, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=17478488#post17478488|title=LaCrosse / Wausau, WI - HDTV - Page 47 - AVS - Home Theater Discussions And Reviews|work=avsforum.com}}</ref> It was replaced with digital translator station W50DR-D which went on-the-air at 2:10 in the afternoon on October 14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?p=17355845#post17355845|title=LaCrosse / Wausau, WI - HDTV - Page 47 - AVS - Home Theater Discussions And Reviews|work=avsforum.com}}</ref> W50DR was subsequently replaced with W34FC in August 2018.

Known as ''Fox 47 News at Nine'', the program originates from a secondary set at the Bandel Road Northwest studios. It features a unique graphics package and news music theme that is different from KTTC. KXLT uses most of this NBC outlet's on-air personnel but maintains separate news anchors who can report for KTTC. At some point in 2009, KIMT added the market's second prime time local news show at 9 to its [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliated second digital subchannel. This newscast could be seen for a half hour competing with KXLT's broadcast. Eventually, the effort would be reduced to a five-minute weather cut-in featuring an updated [[weather forecasting|forecast]].\n\nOn June 12, 2009, KIMT became the market's first television station to upgrade local newscast production to [[16:9]] [[enhanced-definition television|enhanced definition]] [[widescreen]] (with some portions in full high definition). Although not truly HD, the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] matched that of high definition television screens. Video reports from the field were still seen in pillarboxed [[4:3]] [[standard-definition television|standard definition]]. It would not be until March 20, 2011 when KTTC performed an upgrade to full high definition newscasts. With the launch to HD came a brand new set and high definition graphics.\n\nOn July 28, 2014, KXLT debuted a weekday morning show known as ''Fox in the Morning'' (that is produced by KTTC). Airing for thirty minutes at 8 a.m., the program is formatted like a magazine with lifestyle, cooking, and style segments although there are local weather updates featured in the show. Eventually, this broadcast may be extended into the 7 o'clock hour to offer a true local alternative to the national [[breakfast television|morning programs]] seen on the [[Big Three television networks|big three affiliates]]. Like the prime time news at 9, the morning program on KXLT maintains separate anchors from KTTC (except for weather segments) and its own graphics scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.postbulletin.com/life/lifestyles/new-fox-show-seeks-morning-viewers/article_26616350-9283-579b-aa6b-b3f31e39a7d9.html?mode=jqm|title=New Fox show seeks morning viewers|work=PostBulletin.com}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*[http://www.kttc.com/Global/story.asp?S=8322852 KTTC History.]\n*[http://www.pavekmuseum.org/halloffame/ggentling.html G.
