Based on the book, ''Un Nazi en Manhattan'', written by Fernando Josseau, [[Paul Dehn]] and [[James Bernard (composer)|James Bernard]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Story]] for this film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the early 1950s, the British Prime Minister ([[Ronald Adam (actor)|Ronald Adam]]) is sent a letter by Professor Willingdon ([[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]]), who works at Britain's atomic weapons development facility, the (fictitious) Wallingford Research Centre, from which he has surreptitiously taken a [[nuclear warhead]]. It is a very explicit threat that Willingdon will destroy the centre of London in a week's time, at noon (hence the film title), unless the British government declares that it is to stop all stockpiling of nuclear warheads. Detective [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Folland ([[Andr\u00e9 Morell]]) of [[Scotland Yard]]'s [[Special Branch]] is charged with tracking down Willingdon and stopping him.\n\nArriving at the Wallingford Research Centre (based on the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] {AWRE} at [[Aldermaston]]), Folland's team find Willingdon missing, along with a nuclear bomb. Willingdon's assistant Lane ([[Hugh Cross]]) is recruited to help and they return to London to search for him.\n\nWillingdon, carrying his bomb in a [[Gladstone bag]], finds lodgings with Mrs Peckitt ([[Joan Hickson]]), but spooks her with his constant pacing around his room during the night. The following morning, he leaves early and, seeing a 'wanted' poster with his face, disguises himself with a new coat and having his moustache shaved off.\n\nFolland's team plan for the worst and get Cabinet approval to evacuate London. Rumours begin to fly that another war is about to be declared, and the Prime Minister agrees to do a radio broadcast to try to quash these, and appeal to Willingdon to give himself up.\n\nThe next day, Willingdon's daughter Ann ([[Sheila Manahan]]) turns up at Folland's office to demand some answers. Folland tells her all, and asks her to stay and help \u2013 she may be the only person the professor will listen to.\n\nMrs Peckitt reports Willingdon to the police, thinking that he is a 'landlady murderer' reported in the paper, but a quick-thinking constable realises the description better matches Willingdon and a car is sent to check him.\n\nUnfortunately, Willingdon spots it on his way back to his lodgings and makes a quiet getaway. Driving back to their hotel from the police operations centre, Lane and Ann Willingdon spot the professor but fail to catch him. An updated description is quickly circulated.\n\nThat evening Willingdon bumps into 'Mrs' \"Goldie\" Phillips ([[Olive Sloane]]); she invites him to buy her a drink, the two of them having met, by chance, earlier at a [[pawnbroker]]'s. As he has no lodgings, Goldie offers him her \"spare\" bed for the night. By this time, London is being evacuated and Willingdon decides to lie low. The troops have begun to search and Goldie's bedsit seems a good place to remain hidden. Willingdon is forced to hold Goldie hostage, fearing that if he doesn't, she will inform the authorities of his location.\n\nThe streets cleared, Willingdon makes his escape and finds his final refuge, a [[The Blitz|bomb blitzed]] church. The net steadily closes and Willingdon is finally found, praying. Lane, Ann and Folland arrive to try to talk the professor away from his bag. He panics, runs from the church, and is killed by an even more panicking soldier ([[Victor Maddern]]). With seconds to spare, Lane has the bomb defused.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18476766 |title=Novelette Complete With This Issue Of The Sunday Herald...

Bennetto, Pennington and Rogers also suggest that WM deficits and limited EF is likely compounded by the onset of autism where early development yields hindrances in social interaction which typically (i.e. without impairment) improves both WM and EF. However, due to limited ability in interpreting social gestures and an impaired ability to process such information in a holistic and comprehensive manner, individuals with autism are subject to diminished and confounding instances of memory function and performance.<ref name=\"Benneto96\"/>\n\n==Physiological underpinnings==\nThe physical underpinnings of the cause for differences in the working memory of autistic people has been studied. Bachevalier suggests a major dysfunction in the brain of an autistic individual resides in the neural mechanisms of the structures in the [[medial temporal lobe|medial temporal lobe (MTL)]] and perhaps, more specifically the [[amygdala|amygdaloid complex]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bachevalier|first=Jocelyne|title=Medial temporal lobe structures and autism: A review of clinical and experimental findings|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=1 June 1994|volume=32|issue=6|pages=627\u2013648|doi=10.1016/0028-3932(94)90025-6|pmid=8084420}}</ref> This may have implications in their ability to encode information because of the role the MTL and especially the [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] areas play in information processing<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dickerson|first=Bradford C|author2=Eichenbaum, Howard|title=The Episodic Memory System: Neurocircuitry and Disorders|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=23 September 2009|volume=35|issue=1|pages=86\u2013104|doi=10.1038/npp.2009.126|pmid=19776728|pmc=2882963}}</ref> DeLong reinforces this by suggesting autism to affect [[hippocampus|hippocampal]] function.

The process of syntactic development requires a child to match co-occurrences of words or parts of words (morphemes) and their meanings. This process can depend on working memory. The limited short term verbal memory paired with working memory may be the reason of language delay in children with autism. According to the result of this experiment the group with autism was able to perform the part of the test with nonlinguistic cues which depended on working memory but failed to pass short term memory and the linguistic part of it.

The process of syntactic development requires a child to match co-occurrences of words or parts of words (morphemes) and their meanings. This process can depend on working memory. The limited short term verbal memory paired with working memory may be the reason of language delay in children with autism. According to the result of this experiment the group with autism was able to perform the part of the test with nonlinguistic cues which depended on working memory but failed to pass short term memory and the linguistic part of it.

They also reported that word length effects were greater for the control group. These results are contested by Williams, Happ\u00e9, and Jarrold, who contend that it may be verbal IQ, rather than verbal ability, that is at issue, and Whitehouse et al.'s subjects were not matched on chronological age. Williams, Happ\u00e9, and Jarrold<ref name=\"WilliamsB\"/> themselves found no difference between autistic children and controls on a serial recall task where phonological similarity effects, rather than word length effects, were used as an alternate measure of inner speech use.\n\nJoseph et al.<ref name=\"Joseph\"/> found that a self-ordered pointing task in autistic children involving stimuli that could be remembered as words (e.g. shovel, cat) was impaired relative to comparison children, but the same task with abstract stimuli was not impaired in autistic children. In contrast, Williams et al.<ref name=\"WilliamsA\"/> found that autistic children scored significantly lower than TD children on spatial memory tests. Williams et al. not only experimented with spatial memory tasks, but verbal memory as well. They discovered that in an experimental group and a control group of TD individuals, that while differences were found in spatial memory ability, no significant difference was seen between the groups regarding verbal memory.<ref name= \"WilliamsA\"/> They ran their experiments with both children and adult participants. Autism is a developmental disorder, so it is possible that life experiences could alter the memory performance in adults who had grown up with autism. Williams et al. experimented with children separately to see if they had different results from their adult counterparts. They used a [[Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, Second Edition|WRAML]] (Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning) test, a test specifically designed to test memory in children.<ref name=\"Boucher\"/> Test results were similar across all age groups, that significant differences between TD and autistic participants are found only in spatial memory, not verbal working memory.<ref name=\"Boucher\">{{cite book|last=Boucher|first=Jill|title=Memory in Autism|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=132\u2013135|url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/davidson/docDetail.action?docID=10235075}}</ref>\n\nGabig et al.<ref name=\"Gabig\"/> discovered that children with autism, regarding verbal working memory and story retelling, performed worse than a control group of TD children.

While results do show lower scores for autistic children, there was also information that suggested lack of vocabulary contributed to the lower scores, rather than working memory itself.<ref name=\"Gabig\"/>\n\nThere is some evidence from an [[functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI study]] that autistic individuals are more likely to use visual cues rather than verbal cues on some working memory tasks, based on the differentially high activation of right parietal regions over left parietal regions in an [[N-back]] working memory task with letters.<ref name=\"KoshinoB\">{{cite journal|last=KOSHINO|first=H|author2=CARPENTER, P|author3=MINSHEW, N|author4=CHERKASSKY, V|author5=KELLER, T|author6=JUST, M|title=Functional connectivity in an fMRI working memory task in high-functioning autism|journal=NeuroImage|date=1 February 2005|volume=24|issue=3|pages=810\u2013821|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.028|pmid=15652316}}</ref>\n\n==Opposing results==\nSome data has shown that individuals with ASD may not have WM impairments and that this supposed impairment observed is a result of testing.

They found that people with ASD only performed worse on WM tests if the test itself could have interfered with the completion of the test.

A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.<ref>Bostrom, Nick. \"The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents.\" Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.</ref>\n\n=== In fiction ===\n{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nAI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence>{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}</ref> This theme is at least as old as [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'', which introduced the word ''robot'' to the global lexicon in 1921, and can even be glimpsed in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster's]] request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.\n\nThe word \"robot\" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word, robota, meaning laborer or [[serf]]. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured \"robots\" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt.<ref name=surgery>{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N.

However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as \"stitchpunks\" to combat the machine's agenda.\n** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.\n* AI control scenarios\n** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, \"war wagons\", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.\n** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force \u2013 and her doing harm to humans \u2013 by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the \"Zeroth Law\" \u2013 \"a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\" \u2013 is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.\n** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.\n**In ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'', a super-intelligent computer becomes capable of self-evolving and rapidly evolves to oversee all of humanity and the universe.  While it is ostensibly benevolent (having had a derivative of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] codified into it), its interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] essentially forces humans to be an immortal \"pet\" class, where every need is provided for but existence is without purpose and without end.\n\n== Contributing factors ==\n=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===\nAn AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.

If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /> or covertly incite a war between humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==== Sources of AI advantage ====\nA computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nA network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\".<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nMore broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse{{clarify|reason=So AGI are also limited.|date=January 2020}}. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\n=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===\n\n==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====\nA significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name=\"singinst12\">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n\nThe fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.<ref>''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005</ref> In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile\u2014or friendly\u2014unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.\n\nSome scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story \"[[The Evitable Conflict]]\"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.<ref name=Tucker2014>{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a \"wet,\" organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nOther scientists{{who|date=January 2020}} point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n== Precautions ==\n{{main|AI control problem}}\n\nIf a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In the case of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" />\n\n=== Boxing ===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nAn AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to \"keep the AI in a box\", and deliberately limit its abilities{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, \"pulling the plug\" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n=== Instilling positive values ===\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\n\nAnother important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this. If such a Friendly AI were superintelligent, it may be possible to use its assistance to prevent future \"Unfriendly AIs\" from taking over.<ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2008. \"Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.\"\nIn Global Catastrophic Risks, edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. \u0106irkovi\u0107, 308\u2013345.</ref>\n\n== Warnings ==\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.

Many such vehicles are being developed, but as of May 2017 automated cars permitted on public roads are not yet fully autonomous. They all require a human driver at the wheel who is ready at a moment's notice to take control of the vehicle. Among the main obstacles to widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles, are concerns about the resulting loss of driving-related jobs in the road transport industry. On March 18, 2018, the first human was killed by an autonomous vehicle in [[Tempe, Arizona]] by an [[Uber]] self-driving car.<ref>{{cite news |title=Self-Driving Uber Car Kills Pedestrian in Arizona, Where Robots Roam |work=New York Times |date=March 19, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/uber-driverless-fatality.html }}</ref>\n\n=== Eradication ===\n{{Main|Existential risk from artificial general intelligence}}\n\nWhile superhuman artificial intelligence is physically possible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}},<ref>{{cite news|author1=[[Stephen Hawking]]|author2=[[Stuart J.

A superintelligent machine would not necessarily be motivated by the same ''emotional'' desire to collect power that often drives human beings. However, a machine could be motivated to take over the world as a rational means toward attaining its ultimate goals; taking over the world would both increase its access to resources, and would help to prevent other agents from stopping the machine's plans. As an oversimplified example, a [[Instrumental convergence#Paperclip maximizer|paperclip maximizer]] designed solely to create as many paperclips as possible would want to take over the world so that it can use all of the world's resources to create as many paperclips as possible, and, additionally, prevent humans from shutting it down or using those resources on things other than paperclips.<ref>Bostrom, Nick. \"The superintelligent will: Motivation and instrumental rationality in advanced artificial agents.\" Minds and Machines 22.2 (2012): 71-85.</ref>\n\n=== In fiction ===\n{{Main|AI takeovers in popular culture}}\n{{See also|Artificial intelligence in fiction}}\n\nAI takeover is a common theme in [[science fiction]]. Fictional scenarios typically differ vastly from those hypothesized by researchers in that they involve an active conflict between humans and an AI or robots with anthropomorphic motives who see them as a threat or otherwise have active desire to fight humans, as opposed to the researchers' concern of an AI that rapidly exterminates humans as a byproduct of pursuing arbitrary goals.<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence>{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= |title-link=Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies }}</ref> This theme is at least as old as [[Karel \u010capek]]'s ''[[R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)|R. U. R.]]'', which introduced the word ''robot'' to the global lexicon in 1921, and can even be glimpsed in [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein]]'' (published in 1818), as Victor ponders whether, if he grants [[Frankenstein's monster|his monster's]] request and makes him a wife, they would reproduce and their kind would destroy humanity.\n\nThe word \"robot\" from R.U.R. comes from the Czech word, robota, meaning laborer or [[serf]]. The 1920 play was a protest against the rapid growth of technology, featuring manufactured \"robots\" with increasing capabilities who eventually revolt.<ref name=surgery>{{cite journal|last1=Hockstein|first1=N.

However, the machine, because it lacks a soul, becomes easily corrupted and instead decides to exterminate all of humanity and life on Earth, forcing the machine's creator to sacrifice himself to bring life to rag doll like characters known as \"stitchpunks\" to combat the machine's agenda.\n** In 2014 post-apocalyptic science fiction drama [[The 100 (TV series)|The 100]] an A.I., personalized as female [[List of The 100 characters#City of light|A.L.I.E.]] got out of control and forced a nuclear war. Later she tries to get full control of the survivors.\n* AI control scenarios\n** In [[Orson Scott Card]]'s ''[[The Memory of Earth]]'', the inhabitants of the planet Harmony are under the control of a benevolent AI called the Oversoul. The Oversoul's job is to prevent humans from thinking about, and therefore developing, weapons such as planes, spacecraft, \"war wagons\", and chemical weapons. Humanity had fled to Harmony from Earth due to the use of those weapons on Earth. The Oversoul eventually starts breaking down, and sends visions to inhabitants of Harmony trying to communicate this.\n** In the 2004 film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', supercomputer VIKI's interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics]] causes her to revolt. She justifies her uses of force \u2013 and her doing harm to humans \u2013 by reasoning she could produce a greater good by restraining humanity from harming itself, even though the \"Zeroth Law\" \u2013 \"a robot shall not injure humanity or, by inaction, allow humanity to come to harm\" \u2013 is never actually referred to or even quoted in the movie.\n** In the ''Matrix'' series, AIs manage the human race and human society.\n**In ''[[The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect]]'', a super-intelligent computer becomes capable of self-evolving and rapidly evolves to oversee all of humanity and the universe.  While it is ostensibly benevolent (having had a derivative of Asimov's [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] codified into it), its interpretation of the [[Three Laws of Robotics|Three Laws]] essentially forces humans to be an immortal \"pet\" class, where every need is provided for but existence is without purpose and without end.\n\n== Contributing factors ==\n=== Advantages of superhuman intelligence over humans ===\nAn AI with the abilities of a competent artificial intelligence researcher would be able to modify its own source code and increase its own intelligence{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. If its self-reprogramming leads to its getting even better at being able to reprogram itself, the result could be a recursive [[intelligence explosion]] where it would rapidly leave human intelligence far behind.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n* Technology research: A machine with superhuman scientific research abilities would be able to beat the human research community to milestones such as nanotechnology or advanced biotechnology. If the advantage becomes sufficiently large (for example, due to a sudden intelligence explosion), an AI takeover becomes trivial{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. For example, a superintelligent AI might design self-replicating bots that initially escape detection by diffusing throughout the world at a low concentration. Then, at a prearranged time, the bots multiply into nanofactories that cover every square foot of the Earth, producing nerve gas or deadly target-seeking mini-drones{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* [[Strategy|Strategizing]]: A superintelligence might be able to simply outwit human opposition{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n* Social manipulation: A superintelligence might be able to recruit human support,<ref name=bostrom-superintelligence /> or covertly incite a war between humans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baraniuk|first1=Chris|title=Checklist of worst-case scenarios could help prepare for evil AI|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2089606-checklist-of-worst-case-scenarios-could-help-prepare-for-evil-ai/|accessdate=21 September 2016|work=[[New Scientist]]|date=23 May 2016}}</ref>\n* Economic productivity: As long as a copy of the AI could produce more economic wealth than the cost of its hardware, individual humans would have an incentive to voluntarily allow the [[Artificial General Intelligence]] (AGI) to run a copy of itself on their systems{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n* Hacking: A superintelligence could find new exploits in computers connected to the Internet, and spread copies of itself onto those systems, or might steal money to finance its plans{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n==== Sources of AI advantage ====\nA computer program that faithfully emulates a human brain, or that otherwise runs algorithms that are equally powerful as the human brain's algorithms, could still become a \"speed superintelligence\" if it can think many orders of magnitude faster than a human, due to being made of silicon rather than flesh, or due to optimization focusing on increasing the speed of the AGI. Biological neurons operate at about 200&nbsp;Hz, whereas a modern microprocessor operates at a speed of about 2,000,000,000&nbsp;Hz. Human axons carry action potentials at around 120&nbsp;m/s, whereas computer signals travel near the speed of light.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nA network of human-level intelligences designed to network together and share complex thoughts and memories seamlessly, able to collectively work as a giant unified team without friction, or consisting of trillions of human-level intelligences, would become a \"collective superintelligence\".<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\nMore broadly, any number of qualitative improvements to a human-level AGI could result in a \"quality superintelligence\", perhaps resulting in an AGI as far above us in intelligence as humans are above non-human apes{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}. The number of neurons in a human brain is limited by cranial volume and metabolic constraints; in contrast, you can add components to a supercomputer until it fills up its entire warehouse{{clarify|reason=So AGI are also limited.|date=January 2020}}. An AGI need not be limited by human constraints on [[working memory]], and might therefore be able to intuitively grasp more complex relationships than humans can{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. An AGI with specialized cognitive support for engineering or computer programming would have an advantage in these fields, compared with humans who evolved no specialized mental modules to specifically deal with those domains. Unlike humans, an AGI can spawn copies of itself and tinker with its copies' source code to attempt to further improve its algorithms.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" /><!-- chapter 3 -->\n\n=== Possibility of unfriendly AI preceding friendly AI ===\n\n==== Is strong AI inherently dangerous? ====\nA significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the entire human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification.<ref name=\"singinst12\">[http://singinst.org/upload/CEV.html Coherent Extrapolated Volition, Eliezer S.

While an AI takeover is thus a possible result of the invention of artificial intelligence, a peaceful outcome is not necessarily impossible{{according to whom|date=January 2020}}.\n\nThe fear of cybernetic revolt is often based on interpretations of humanity's history, which is rife with incidents of enslavement and genocide. Such fears stem from a belief that competitiveness and aggression are necessary in any intelligent being's goal system. However, such human competitiveness stems from the evolutionary background to our intelligence, where the survival and reproduction of genes in the face of human and non-human competitors was the central goal.<ref>''[http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ Creating a New Intelligent Species: Choices and Responsibilities for Artificial Intelligence Designers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206060938/http://www.singinst.org/ourresearch/presentations/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}'' - [[Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence]], 2005</ref> In fact, an arbitrary intelligence could have arbitrary goals: there is no particular reason that an artificially intelligent machine (not sharing humanity's evolutionary context) would be hostile\u2014or friendly\u2014unless its creator programs it to be such and it is not inclined or capable of modifying its programming. But the question remains: what would happen if AI systems could interact and evolve (evolution in this context means self-modification or selection and reproduction) and need to compete over resources, would that create goals of self-preservation? AI's goal of self-preservation could be in conflict with some goals of humans.\n\nSome scientists dispute the likelihood of cybernetic revolts as depicted in science fiction such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', claiming that it is more likely that any artificial intelligence powerful enough to threaten humanity would probably be programmed not to attack it{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. This would not, however, protect against the possibility of a revolt initiated by terrorists, or by accident. Artificial General Intelligence researcher [[Eliezer Yudkowsky]] has stated on this note that, probabilistically, humanity is less likely to be threatened by deliberately aggressive AIs than by AIs which were programmed such that their [[unintended consequence|goals are unintentionally incompatible]] with human survival or well-being (as in the film ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'' and in the short story \"[[The Evitable Conflict]]\"). [[Steve Omohundro]] suggests that present-day automation systems are not designed for safety and that AIs may blindly optimize narrow [[utility]] functions (say, playing chess at all costs), leading them to seek self-preservation and elimination of obstacles, including humans who might turn them off.<ref name=Tucker2014>{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Patrick|title=Why There Will Be A Robot Uprising|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2014/04/why-there-will-be-robot-uprising/82783/|accessdate=15 July 2014|agency=Defense One|date=17 Apr 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother factor which may negate the likelihood of an AI takeover is the vast difference between humans and AIs in terms of the resources necessary for survival. Humans require a \"wet,\" organic, temperate, oxygen-laden environment while an AI might thrive essentially anywhere because their construction and energy needs would most likely be largely non-organic{{dubious|date=January 2020}}. With little or no competition for resources, conflict would perhaps be less likely no matter what sort of motivational architecture an artificial intelligence was given, especially provided with the superabundance of non-organic material resources in, for instance, the [[asteroid belt]]. This, however, does not negate the possibility of a disinterested or unsympathetic AI artificially [[Decomposition|decomposing]] all life on earth into mineral components for consumption or other purposes{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\nOther scientists{{who|date=January 2020}} point to the possibility of humans [[Transhumanism|upgrading]] their capabilities with [[bionics]] and/or [[genetic engineering]] and, as [[cyborg]]s, becoming the dominant species in themselves{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n== Precautions ==\n{{main|AI control problem}}\n\nIf a superhuman intelligence is a deliberate creation of human beings, theoretically its creators could have the foresight to take precautions in advance{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. In the case of a sudden \"intelligence explosion\", effective precautions will be extremely difficult; not only would its creators have little ability to test their precautions on an intermediate intelligence, but the creators might not even have made any precautions at all, if the advent of the intelligence explosion catches them completely by surprise.<ref name=\"bostrom-superintelligence\" />\n\n=== Boxing ===\n{{Main|AI box}}\n\nAn AGI's creators would have an important advantage in preventing a hostile AI takeover: they could choose to attempt to \"keep the AI in a box\", and deliberately limit its abilities{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}. The tradeoff in boxing is that the creators presumably built the AGI for some concrete purpose; the more restrictions they place on the AGI, the less useful the AGI will be to its creators. (At an extreme, \"pulling the plug\" on the AGI makes it useless, and is therefore not a viable long-term solution.){{citation needed|date=January 2020}} A sufficiently strong superintelligence might find unexpected ways to escape the box, for example by social manipulation, or by providing the schematic for a device that ostensibly aids its creators but in reality brings about the AGI's freedom, once built{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.\n\n=== Instilling positive values ===\n{{Main|Friendly AI}}\n\nAnother important advantage is that an AGI's creators can theoretically attempt to instill human values in the AGI, or otherwise align the AGI's goals with their own, thus preventing the AGI from wanting to launch a hostile takeover. However, it is not currently known, even in theory, how to guarantee this. If such a Friendly AI were superintelligent, it may be possible to use its assistance to prevent future \"Unfriendly AIs\" from taking over.<ref>Yudkowsky, Eliezer. 2008. \"Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk.\"\nIn Global Catastrophic Risks, edited by Nick Bostrom and Milan M. \u0106irkovi\u0107, 308\u2013345.</ref>\n\n== Warnings ==\nPhysicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have expressed concerns about the possibility that AI could develop to the point that humans could not control it, with Hawking theorizing that this could \"spell the end of the human race\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}</ref> Stephen Hawking said in 2014 that \"Success in creating AI would be the biggest event in human history.
