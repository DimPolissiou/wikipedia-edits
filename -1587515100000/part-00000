Even before this, there was a small chapel dedicated to Saint [[Simon the Zealot]].\nUntil the 19th century the parish was called St. Simon, after which it assumed the common name of Barco. \nSaint Simon was said to have been martyred by being sawed in half, and the emblem of the parish is a saw.{{sfn|Barco: Covilh\u00e3 Municipality}}\n\nBetween 1860 and 1950 the parish saw rapid population growth.{{sfn|Barco: Covilh\u00e3 Municipality}}\nThe census of 1878 gave Barco a population of 923, of whom 429 were male and 494 female, in 234 dwellings.{{sfn|Costa Brand\u00e3o e Albuquerque|1879|p=45}}\nBy 1950 there were 1,800 people. \nSince then the population has declined steadily.{{sfn|Barco: Covilh\u00e3 Municipality}}\nIn 2011 Barco had a population of just 473.{{sfn|Quadros de apuramento}}\n\n==Economy and culture==\n\nUntil recently wolfram and tin were mined in the parish.{{sfn|Barco: Guia da Cidade}} \nThe Mina da Argemela, a tin mine that was abandoned around 1960, is located near Barco.{{sfn|Argimela Mine: Mindat}}\nEconomic activities include trade, industry, agriculture and construction.\nMost people work in agriculture, growing maize, beans, olives and rye.\nLocal gastronomical specialties include ''Borelh\u00f5es'', sausages, river fish and wild boar.{{sfn|Barco: Covilh\u00e3 Municipality}}\nReligion plays an important role in local culture, as shown by the many small shrines one sees in the countryside.{{sfn|Barco: Guia da Cidade}} \nFestivals include St. Simon (28 October), San Sebastian (4th Sunday of August), St John (June 23) and Our Lady of Fatima (May 30).{{sfn|Barco: Covilh\u00e3 Municipality}}\n\n==Administration==\n\nBarco has always been part of Covilh\u00e3. There was some uncertainty about the extent of its territory, now {{convert|1316|ha}}.\nThe boundary between Barco and the neighboring parish of Peso was only defined on 4 October 1894. \nFrom 1872 to 1984 the parish of Coutada was attached to Barco.
