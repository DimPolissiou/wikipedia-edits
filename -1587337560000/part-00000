It became part of the [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] at [[Railways Act 1921|grouping]] in 1922.<ref name=\"Whitehouse\"/>\n\nThe Midland had a large network of lines emanating from Derby, stretching to [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Manchester Central railway station|Manchester]], [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle]], [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838\u20131966)|Birmingham]], and the South West. It expanded as much through acquisitions as by builing its own lines. It also operated ships from [[Heysham]] in Lancashire to [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and [[Belfast]]. A large amount of the Midland's infrastructure still remains in use and visible, such as the [[Midland main line]], [[Settle\u2013Carlisle line]], and multiple of its large railway hotels still hold the name ''Midland Hotel''.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Midland Railway - geograph.org.uk - 2301176.jpg|thumb|Midland Railway insignia on London Road bridge, Leicester]]\n[[File:Midland Railway boundary marker.jpg|thumb|Midland Railway boundary marker]]\nThe Midland Railway originated from 1832 in [[Leicestershire]] / [[Nottinghamshire]], with the purpose of serving the needs of local coal owners.<ref>{{cite book|last=Edward Walford|first=|title=Old and New London: Volume 5|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/old-new-london/vol5/pp368-373|year=1878|publisher=Cassell, Petter and Galpin| via=British History Online|pages=368\u2013373|chapter=28.

It absorbed the [[Mansfield and Pinxton Railway]] in 1847, building the [[Erewash Valley Line]] from the latter between [[Chesterfield]] and [[Trent railway station|Trent Junction]] at [[Long Eaton]], completed to Chesterfield in 1862, giving access to the coalfields that became its major source of income. Passengers from [[Sheffield]] continued to use [[Rotherham Masborough railway station|Rotherham Masborough]] until a direct route was completed in 1870.\n\nMeanwhile, it extended its influence in the [[Leicestershire]] coalfields, by buying the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]] in 1846,<ref>{{cite book |last=Twells |first=H.N. |title=A Pictorial Record of the Leicester and Burton Branch Railway |year=1985 |publisher=Trent Valley Publications |location=Burton-upon-Trent |isbn=0-948131-04-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2018}} and extending it to Burton in 1849.\n\n==The South-West==\n[[File:Curzon Street Railway station.JPG|thumb|Curzon Street railway station in Birmingham]]\nAfter the merger, London trains were carried on the shorter Midland Counties route.

The original 1839 line from Derby had run to [[Hampton-in-Arden railway station|Hampton-in-Arden]]: the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway]] had built a terminus at [[Lawley Street railway station|Lawley Street]] in 1842, and on 1 May 1851 the MR started to run into [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Curzon Street]].<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Midland Railway.

The change of gauge at Gloucester meant that everything had to be transferred between trains, creating chaos, and the C&GWU was owned by the [[Great Western Railway]], which wished to extend its network by taking over the Bristol to Birmingham route.  While the two parties were bickering over the price, the MR's John Ellis overheard two directors of the [[Birmingham and Bristol Railway]] on a London train discussing the business, and pledged that the MR would match anything the Great Western would offer.<ref name=\"vaughan\">{{cite book| last=Vaughan| first=A.| year=1997| title=Railwaymen, Politics and Money| location=London| publisher=John Murray}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nSince it would have brought broad gauge into Curzon Street with the possibility of extending it to the Mersey, it was something that the other standard gauge lines wished to avoid, and they pledged to assist the MR with any losses it might incur.<ref name=\"vaughan\"/>{{page needed|date=May 2018}} In the event all that was necessary was for the later [[London and North Western Railway|LNWR]] to share [[Birmingham New Street railway station|Birmingham New Street]] with the Midland when it was opened in 1854, and [[Lawley Street railway station|Lawley Street]] became a goods depot.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pinton |first=B |date=2005 |title=Birmingham-Derby: Portrait of a Famous Route |url= |location= |publisher=Runpast Publishing |page= |isbn=}}</ref>\n\n==Eastern competition==\nThe MR controlled all the traffic to the North East and Scotland from London. The LNWR was progressing slowly through the Lake District, and there was pressure for a direct line from London to York. Permission had been gained for the [[Northern and Eastern Railway]] to run through [[Peterborough]] and [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] but it had barely reached [[Cambridge]].\n\nTwo obvious extensions of the Midland Counties line were from [[Nottingham]] to Lincoln and from [[Leicester]] to Peterborough. They had not been proceeded with, but Hudson saw that they would make ideal \"stoppers\": if the cities concerned were provided with a rail service, it would make it more difficult to justify another line. They were approved while the bill for the direct line was still before Parliament, forming the present day [[Nottingham to Lincoln Line|Lincoln Branch]] and the [[Syston and Peterborough Railway|Syston to Peterborough Line]].\n\nThe [[Leeds and Bradford Railway]] had been approved in 1844. By 1850 it was losing money but a number of railways offered to buy it. Hudson made an offer more or less on his own account and the line gave the MR an exit to the north, which became the start of the Settle and Carlisle line, and it gave the MR a much more convenient station at [[Leeds railway station#History|Leeds Wellington]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn spite of the objections of Hudson, for the MR and others, the \"London and York Railway\" (later the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]) led by [[Edmund Denison]] persisted, and the bill passed through Parliament in 1846.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=11211&CATLN=3&FullDetails=True&j=1 |website=The National Archives| title=Great Northern Railway Company: Records |year=1845 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==The Battle of Nottingham==\nIn 1851 the [[Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway]] completed its line from [[Grantham]] as far as [[Colwick]], from where a branch led to the MR Nottingham station. The [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] by then passed through Grantham and both railway companies paid court to the fledgling line. Meanwhile, Nottingham had woken up to its branch line status and was keen to expand. The MR made a takeover offer only to discover that a shareholder of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] had already gathered a quantity of Ambergate shares. An attempt to amalgamate the line with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] was foiled by Ellis, who managed to obtain an [[Court of Chancery|Order in Chancery]] preventing the GN from running into Nottingham. However, in 1851 it opened a new service to the north that included Nottingham.<ref>{{cite book| last=Anderson| first=P.H.| year=1985| edition=2nd| title=Forgotten Railways Vol 2: The East Midlands| location=Newton Abbot| publisher=David and Charles}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1852 an [[Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway|ANB&EJR]] train arrived in Nottingham with a [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] locomotive at its head.

This episode became known as the \"Battle of Nottingham\" and, with the action moved to the courtroom, it was seven months before the locomotive was released.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==The Euston Square Confederacy==\nThe [[London and Birmingham Railway]] and its successor the [[London and North Western Railway]] had been under pressure from two directions. Firstly the Great Western Railway had been foiled in its attempt to enter Birmingham by the Midland, but it still had designs on Manchester. At the same time the LNWR was under threat from the GN's attempts to enter Manchester by the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==To London==\n\n===King's Cross 1857 \u2013 1868===\n[[File:Kings Cross ILN 1852.jpg|thumb|An illustration of King's Cross from 1852, shortly before its use by the Midland Railway]]\nIn 1850 the MR, though much more secure, was still a provincial line. Ellis realised that if it were to fend off its competitors it must expand outwards. The first step, in 1853, was to appoint [[James Allport]] as General Manager and the next was to shake off the dependence on the LNWR to [[Euston railway station|London]].\n\nAlthough a bill for a line from [[Hitchin]] into [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] jointly with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]], was passed in 1847 it had not been proceeded with.\n\nThe bill was resubmitted in 1853 with the support of the people of Bedford, whose branch to the LNWR was slow and unreliable, and with the knowledge of the Northamptonshire iron deposits.\n\nThe '''Leicester and Hitchin Railway ''' ran from [[South Wigston railway station|Wigston]] to [[Market Harborough railway station|Market Harborough]], through [[Desborough railway station|Desborough]], [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]], [[Wellingborough railway station|Wellingborough]] and [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]], then on the [[Bedford to Hitchin Line]], joining the GN at [[Hitchin railway station|Hitchin]] for King's Cross. The line began its life in a proposition presented for the shareholders by George Hudson on 2 May 1842 as: \"To vest \u00a3600,000 in the South Midland Railway Company in their line from Wigston to Hitchin.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  a full decade before realisation. The delay was partly due to the withdrawal of GN's interest in the competing scheme, the Bedford and Leicester Railway, after Midland purchased the Leicester and Swannington Railway and the Ashby Canal and Tramway,<ref>{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Hadfield  |title=The Canals of the East Midlands |publisher=David and Charles |year=1970 |isbn=0-7153-4871-X |ref=harv}}</ref> which were to have been the feeder lines. With the competition thwarted there was less rush to have this line as well as its branch lines to Huntingdon (from Kettering) and Northampton (from Bedford) finished. Both these branches were subsequently built by independent companies.\n\nWhile this took some of the pressure off the route through Rugby, the GNR insisted that passengers for London alight at Hitchin, buying tickets in the short time available, to catch a GNR train to finish their journey. [[James Allport]] arranged a seven-year deal with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] to run into King's Cross for a guaranteed \u00a320,000 a year ({{Inflation|UK|20000|1857|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}.

Its carriage of coal and iron \u2013 and beer from [[Burton-on-Trent]] \u2013 had increased by three times and passenger numbers were rising, as they were on the GN. Since GN trains took precedence on its own lines, MR passengers were becoming more and more delayed. Finally in 1862 the decision was taken for the MR to have its own terminus in the Capital, as befitted a national railway.\n\nOn 22 June 1863, the Midland Railway (Extension to London) Bill was passed:\n:\"An Act for the Construction by the Midland Railway Company of a new Line of Railway between London and Bedford, with Branches therefrom; and for other Purpose\".<ref>{{cite book| chapter=Local and Personal Acts| title=The Sessional Papers Printed by Order of The House of the Lords Or Presented by Royal Command in the Session 1863| year=1863| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T-ZbAAAAQAAJ&dq=Midland%20Railway%20London%20Extension%20act%20%201863&pg=PA119#v=onepage&q=%22Midland%20Railway%22&f=false| page=119| via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe new line deviated at Bedford, through a gap in the [[Chiltern Hills]] at [[Luton railway station|Luton]], reaching London by curving around [[Hampstead Heath]] to a point between King's Cross and Euston.

The [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], it received the Royal Assent in 1846, in spite of opposition from the [[Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway]]. It was completed as far as [[Rowsley]] a few miles north of [[Matlock railway station|Matlock]] in 1849. However the M&BR had become part of the LNWR in 1846, thus instead of being a partner it had an interest in thwarting the Midland.\n\nIn 1863 the MR reached Buxton, just as the LNWR arrived from the other direction by the [[Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway]]. In 1867 the MR began an alternative line through Wirksworth (now the [[Ecclesbourne Valley Railway]]), to avoid the problem of the Ambergate line. The section from Wirksworth to Rowsley, which would have involved some tricky engineering, was not completed because the MR gained control of the original line in 1871, but access to Manchester was still blocked at Buxton. At length an agreement was made with the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway|Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR)]] to share lines from a branch at [[Millers Dale]] and running almost alongside the LNWR, in what became known as the [[Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nContinuing friction with the LNWR caused the MR to join the MS&LR and the GN in the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]], which also gave scope for wider expansion into Lancashire and Cheshire, and finally a new station at [[Manchester Central railway station|Manchester Central]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Casserley |first=H.C. |title=Britain's Joint Lines |date=April 1968 |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] |location=Shepperton |isbn=0-7110-0024-7 |chapter=Cheshire Lines Committee |pages=68\u201380 |ref=Casserley}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime Sheffield had at last gained a main-line station. Following representations by the council in 1867 the MR promised to build a through line within two years. To the MR's surprise, the Sheffield councillors then backed an improbable speculation called the Sheffield, Chesterfield, Bakewell, Ashbourne, Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway. This was unsurprisingly rejected by Parliament and the Midland built its \"New Road\" into a station at Pond Street. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAmong the last of the major lines built by the MR was a connection between Sheffield and Manchester, by a branch at [[Dore and Totley railway station|Dore]] to [[Chinley railway station|Chinley]], opened in 1894 through the [[Totley Tunnel|Totley]] and [[Cowburn Tunnel|Cowburn]] Tunnels, now the [[Hope Valley Line]].\n\n==To Scotland==\n[[File:View from the flanks of Whernside. - geograph.org.uk - 156256.jpg|thumb|The [[Ribblehead Viaduct]].

The MR was also under pressure from Scottish railway companies, which were eagerly awaiting the Midland traffic reaching Carlisle as it would allow them to challenge the [[Caledonian Railway]]'s dominance on the West Coast traffic to Glasgow and Edinburgh. The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]] had its own route from Carlisle to Glasgow via Dumfries and Kilmarnock, whilst the [[North British Railway]] had built the [[Waverley Line]] through the Scottish Borders from Carlisle to Edinburgh.

By the new century the quantity of goods, particularly coal, was clogging the network. The passenger service was acquiring a reputation for lateness. Lord Farrar reorganised the expresses, but by 1905 the whole system was so overloaded that no one was able to predict when many of the trains would reach their destinations. At this point Sir [[Guy Granet]] took over as General Manager. He introduced a centralised traffic control system, and the locomotive power classifications that became the model for those used by British Railways.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe MR acquired other lines, including the [[Belfast and Northern Counties Railway]] in 1903 and the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]] in 1912.

It expanded as much through acquisitions as by builing its own lines. It also operated ships from [[Heysham]] in Lancashire to [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] and [[Belfast]].

Passengers from [[Sheffield]] continued to use [[Rotherham Masborough railway station|Rotherham Masborough]] until a direct route was completed in 1870.\n\nMeanwhile, it extended its influence in the [[Leicestershire]] coalfields, by buying the [[Leicester and Swannington Railway]] in 1846,<ref>{{cite book |last=Twells |first=H.N. |title=A Pictorial Record of the Leicester and Burton Branch Railway |year=1985 |publisher=Trent Valley Publications |location=Burton-upon-Trent |isbn=0-948131-04-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2018}} and extending it to Burton in 1849.\n\n==The South-West==\n[[File:Curzon Street Railway station.JPG|thumb|Curzon Street railway station in Birmingham]]\nAfter the merger, London trains were carried on the shorter Midland Counties route.

They had not been proceeded with, but Hudson saw that they would make ideal \"stoppers\": if the cities concerned were provided with a rail service, it would make it more difficult to justify another line. They were approved while the bill for the direct line was still before Parliament, forming the present day [[Nottingham to Lincoln Line|Lincoln Branch]] and the [[Syston and Peterborough Railway|Syston to Peterborough Line]].\n\nThe [[Leeds and Bradford Railway]] had been approved in 1844. By 1850 it was losing money but a number of railways offered to buy it. Hudson made an offer more or less on his own account and the line gave the MR an exit to the north, which became the start of the Settle and Carlisle line, and it gave the MR a much more convenient station at [[Leeds railway station#History|Leeds Wellington]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn spite of the objections of Hudson, for the MR and others, the \"London and York Railway\" (later the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]]) led by [[Edmund Denison]] persisted, and the bill passed through Parliament in 1846.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/catalogue/DisplayCatalogueDetails.asp?CATID=11211&CATLN=3&FullDetails=True&j=1 |website=The National Archives| title=Great Northern Railway Company: Records |year=1845 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==The Battle of Nottingham==\nIn 1851 the [[Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway]] completed its line from [[Grantham]] as far as [[Colwick]], from where a branch led to the MR Nottingham station. The [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] by then passed through Grantham and both railway companies paid court to the fledgling line. Meanwhile, Nottingham had woken up to its branch line status and was keen to expand. The MR made a takeover offer only to discover that a shareholder of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] had already gathered a quantity of Ambergate shares. An attempt to amalgamate the line with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] was foiled by Ellis, who managed to obtain an [[Court of Chancery|Order in Chancery]] preventing the GN from running into Nottingham. However, in 1851 it opened a new service to the north that included Nottingham.<ref>{{cite book| last=Anderson| first=P.H.| year=1985| edition=2nd| title=Forgotten Railways Vol 2: The East Midlands| location=Newton Abbot| publisher=David and Charles}}</ref>{{page needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1852 an [[Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway|ANB&EJR]] train arrived in Nottingham with a [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] locomotive at its head.

Firstly the Great Western Railway had been foiled in its attempt to enter Birmingham by the Midland, but it still had designs on Manchester. At the same time the LNWR was under threat from the GN's attempts to enter Manchester by the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==To London==\n\n===King's Cross 1857 \u2013 1868===\n[[File:Kings Cross ILN 1852.jpg|thumb|An illustration of King's Cross from 1852, shortly before its use by the Midland Railway]]\nIn 1850 the MR, though much more secure, was still a provincial line. Ellis realised that if it were to fend off its competitors it must expand outwards. The first step, in 1853, was to appoint [[James Allport]] as General Manager and the next was to shake off the dependence on the LNWR to [[Euston railway station|London]].\n\nAlthough a bill for a line from [[Hitchin]] into [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] jointly with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]], was passed in 1847 it had not been proceeded with.\n\nThe bill was resubmitted in 1853 with the support of the people of Bedford, whose branch to the LNWR was slow and unreliable, and with the knowledge of the Northamptonshire iron deposits.\n\nThe '''Leicester and Hitchin Railway ''' ran from [[South Wigston railway station|Wigston]] to [[Market Harborough railway station|Market Harborough]], through [[Desborough railway station|Desborough]], [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]], [[Wellingborough railway station|Wellingborough]] and [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]], then on the [[Bedford to Hitchin Line]], joining the GN at [[Hitchin railway station|Hitchin]] for King's Cross. The line began its life in a proposition presented for the shareholders by George Hudson on 2 May 1842 as: \"To vest \u00a3600,000 in the South Midland Railway Company in their line from Wigston to Hitchin.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}  a full decade before realisation. The delay was partly due to the withdrawal of GN's interest in the competing scheme, the Bedford and Leicester Railway, after Midland purchased the Leicester and Swannington Railway and the Ashby Canal and Tramway,<ref>{{Cite book |first=Charles |last=Hadfield  |title=The Canals of the East Midlands |publisher=David and Charles |year=1970 |isbn=0-7153-4871-X |ref=harv}}</ref> which were to have been the feeder lines. With the competition thwarted there was less rush to have this line as well as its branch lines to Huntingdon (from Kettering) and Northampton (from Bedford) finished. Both these branches were subsequently built by independent companies.\n\nWhile this took some of the pressure off the route through Rugby, the GNR insisted that passengers for London alight at Hitchin, buying tickets in the short time available, to catch a GNR train to finish their journey. [[James Allport]] arranged a seven-year deal with the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|GN]] to run into King's Cross for a guaranteed \u00a320,000 a year ({{Inflation|UK|20000|1857|r=-4|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}),{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}.

Its carriage of coal and iron \u2013 and beer from [[Burton-on-Trent]] \u2013 had increased by three times and passenger numbers were rising, as they were on the GN. Since GN trains took precedence on its own lines, MR passengers were becoming more and more delayed.

The [[Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway]], it received the Royal Assent in 1846, in spite of opposition from the [[Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway]]. It was completed as far as [[Rowsley]] a few miles north of [[Matlock railway station|Matlock]] in 1849. However the M&BR had become part of the LNWR in 1846, thus instead of being a partner it had an interest in thwarting the Midland.\n\nIn 1863 the MR reached Buxton, just as the LNWR arrived from the other direction by the [[Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway]]. In 1867 the MR began an alternative line through Wirksworth (now the [[Ecclesbourne Valley Railway]]), to avoid the problem of the Ambergate line. The section from Wirksworth to Rowsley, which would have involved some tricky engineering, was not completed because the MR gained control of the original line in 1871, but access to Manchester was still blocked at Buxton. At length an agreement was made with the [[Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway|Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR)]] to share lines from a branch at [[Millers Dale]] and running almost alongside the LNWR, in what became known as the [[Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies' Committee]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nContinuing friction with the LNWR caused the MR to join the MS&LR and the GN in the [[Cheshire Lines Committee]], which also gave scope for wider expansion into Lancashire and Cheshire, and finally a new station at [[Manchester Central railway station|Manchester Central]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Casserley |first=H.C. |title=Britain's Joint Lines |date=April 1968 |publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]] |location=Shepperton |isbn=0-7110-0024-7 |chapter=Cheshire Lines Committee |pages=68\u201380 |ref=Casserley}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime Sheffield had at last gained a main-line station. Following representations by the council in 1867 the MR promised to build a through line within two years. To the MR's surprise, the Sheffield councillors then backed an improbable speculation called the Sheffield, Chesterfield, Bakewell, Ashbourne, Stafford and Uttoxeter Railway. This was unsurprisingly rejected by Parliament and the Midland built its \"New Road\" into a station at Pond Street. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAmong the last of the major lines built by the MR was a connection between Sheffield and Manchester, by a branch at [[Dore and Totley railway station|Dore]] to [[Chinley railway station|Chinley]], opened in 1894 through the [[Totley Tunnel|Totley]] and [[Cowburn Tunnel|Cowburn]] Tunnels, now the [[Hope Valley Line]].\n\n==To Scotland==\n[[File:View from the flanks of Whernside. - geograph.org.uk - 156256.jpg|thumb|The [[Ribblehead Viaduct]].

The MR was also under pressure from Scottish railway companies, which were eagerly awaiting the Midland traffic reaching Carlisle as it would allow them to challenge the [[Caledonian Railway]]'s dominance on the West Coast traffic to Glasgow and Edinburgh. The [[Glasgow and South Western Railway]] had its own route from Carlisle to Glasgow via Dumfries and Kilmarnock, whilst the [[North British Railway]] had built the [[Waverley Line]] through the Scottish Borders from Carlisle to Edinburgh.

By the new century the quantity of goods, particularly coal, was clogging the network. The passenger service was acquiring a reputation for lateness. Lord Farrar reorganised the expresses, but by 1905 the whole system was so overloaded that no one was able to predict when many of the trains would reach their destinations. At this point Sir [[Guy Granet]] took over as General Manager. He introduced a centralised traffic control system, and the locomotive power classifications that became the model for those used by British Railways.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe MR acquired other lines, including the [[Belfast and Northern Counties Railway]] in 1903 and the [[London, Tilbury and Southend Railway]] in 1912.

At the center of the room, ''Time'' reported on the items being traded in \"pits\" organized based on commodities type with pits names such as the corn pit, soybean pit or wheat pit. The individual pits are raised octagonal structures where [[open outcry]] trading occurs. Steps up the outside of each octagon provide an [[amphitheater]] atmosphere, and enable a large number of [[Trader (finance)|traders]] to see each other and communicate during trading hours. With early versions dating back to 1870, this type of trading pit was patented in 1878.<ref name=CBOTHistory/>\n\nThe trading area is surrounded by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, [[Morse code]] operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined the walls of the trading hall and the advent of [[electronic trading]] resulted in computers being placed on desktops.\n\nSubsequent additions to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new spaces in the additions to the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 trading floor, already substantially altered (and unused for more than two years), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete. It was renovated in a modern style and now is leased to a privately owned [[option (finance)|options]] trading firm.<ref>{{Cite news | title = CBOT Leases 1930 Trading Floor to PEAK6 | publisher=PEAK6 Investments, LP | date = February 24, 2004 | url = http://www.peak6.com/news3.htm | accessdate = March 16, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070218092838/http://www.peak6.com/news3.htm| archivedate = February 18, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Chicago board of trade building detail.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Outdoor building detail depicting crops]]\n\n===Expansion===\nIn 1980, the owners added a {{convert|275|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} 23-story expansion to the south side of the building.<ref>Zaloom, p. 45</ref> It was topped by an octagonal ornament shaped similarly to the terraced trading pits and was designed in a [[Postmodern architecture|postmodern style]] by [[Helmut Jahn]].

At the center of the room, ''Time'' reported on the items being traded in \"pits\" organized based on commodities type with pits names such as the corn pit, soybean pit or wheat pit. The individual pits are raised octagonal structures where [[open outcry]] trading occurs. Steps up the outside of each octagon provide an [[amphitheater]] atmosphere, and enable a large number of [[Trader (finance)|traders]] to see each other and communicate during trading hours. With early versions dating back to 1870, this type of trading pit was patented in 1878.<ref name=CBOTHistory/>\n\nThe trading area is surrounded by desks allowing workers to support transactions. In the early days, the desks served as a relay point between the pits and those wishing to buy or sell. When trade orders and information began to be communicated by telegraph, [[Morse code]] operators were employed, later replaced by phone operators. In the late 20th century, electric display boards lined the walls of the trading hall and the advent of [[electronic trading]] resulted in computers being placed on desktops.\n\nSubsequent additions to the Board of Trade Building moved the agricultural and financial trading floors out of the original trading room and into new spaces in the additions to the building's rear in the 1980s. In 2004 the historic 1930 trading floor, already substantially altered (and unused for more than two years), was demolished and its pits filled with concrete.

It was designed by the noted American architect, [[Louis Sullivan]] of the firm [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] & Sullivan.  Getty became familiar with Sullivan's work from the architect's various [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] projects as well as from the mausoleum (also in Graceland) Sullivan designed for Getty's late partner, Martin Ryerson.\n\n==History==\nThe Getty Tomb has been said to be the most significant piece of architecture in Graceland cemetery and the beginning of Sullivan's involvement in the architectural style known as the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]].\n\nThe [[tomb]], which stands on its own triangular plot of land, is composed of [[limestone]] [[masonry]] construction.  Roughly a cube in shape, the bottom half of the tomb is composed of large, smooth limestone blocks.  The upper half is composed of a rectangular pattern of octagons, each containing an eight-pointed starburst design.  The [[cornice]] is banded with smooth limestone above intricate spiraling patterns below, and the top-edge of the roofline is straight and horizontal on the front and back and scalloped in a concave fashion on the sides.\n\n[[Image:Getty Tomb Graceland Sullivan side window.jpg|thumb|left|Side window]]\n\nWhen approaching the tomb, the obvious focus is the ornate doorway.  An intricately ornamented [[bronze]] gate and door, [[patina]]ted green over time, are spanned by a broad semi-circular [[arch]]way.  The [[voussoir]]s, emanating radially in long thin wedges, share alternating plain and intricately carved concentric bands.

It was designed by the noted American architect, [[Louis Sullivan]] of the firm [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] & Sullivan.  Getty became familiar with Sullivan's work from the architect's various [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] projects as well as from the mausoleum (also in Graceland) Sullivan designed for Getty's late partner, Martin Ryerson.\n\n==History==\nThe Getty Tomb has been said to be the most significant piece of architecture in Graceland cemetery and the beginning of Sullivan's involvement in the architectural style known as the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]].\n\nThe [[tomb]], which stands on its own triangular plot of land, is composed of [[limestone]] [[masonry]] construction.  Roughly a cube in shape, the bottom half of the tomb is composed of large, smooth limestone blocks.  The upper half is composed of a rectangular pattern of octagons, each containing an eight-pointed starburst design.  The [[cornice]] is banded with smooth limestone above intricate spiraling patterns below, and the top-edge of the roofline is straight and horizontal on the front and back and scalloped in a concave fashion on the sides.\n\n[[Image:Getty Tomb Graceland Sullivan side window.jpg|thumb|left|Side window]]\n\nWhen approaching the tomb, the obvious focus is the ornate doorway.  An intricately ornamented [[bronze]] gate and door, [[patina]]ted green over time, are spanned by a broad semi-circular [[arch]]way.  The [[voussoir]]s, emanating radially in long thin wedges, share alternating plain and intricately carved concentric bands.  The twin gates as well as the door behind share a combination of geometric and floral details that incorporate the starburst seen in the upper patterned walls.  The three other sides of the tomb house semi-circular, bronze-clad windows that mimick the arch and door details of the front.

The region is currently populated mostly by [[Armenians]] and the primary spoken language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Artsakh controls most of the territory of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|some of the surrounding area]], giving it a border with [[Armenia]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the south. Its capital is [[Stepanakert]].\n\nThe predominantly Armenian-populated region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] was claimed by both the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] and the [[First Republic of Armenia]] when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], and a [[History of Nagorno-Karabakh|brief war over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out]] in 1920. The dispute was largely shelved after the [[Soviet Union]] established control over the area and created the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) within the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] in 1923. During the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1991, a [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|referendum]] held in the NKAO and the neighbouring [[Shahumian]] region resulted in a [[declaration of independence]] based on its right of [[self-determination]]. A large-scale ethnic conflict led to the 1991\u20131994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which ended with a ceasefire.\n\nArtsakh is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[democracy]] (in the middle of transforming from a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential democracy]] after a [[2017 Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum|2017 referendum]]) with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh|legislature]]. Some have said that its reliance on Armenia means that, in many ways, it functions de facto as part of Armenia.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"cornell\"/>\n\nThe country is very mountainous, averaging {{convert|3600|ft|m|-1|order=flip}} [[metres above sea level|above sea level]]. The population is overwhelmingly Christian, most being affiliated with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Several historical monasteries are popular with tourists, mostly from the [[Armenian diaspora]], as most travel can take place only between Armenia and Artsakh.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to Armenian and Western specialists, inscriptions dating to the [[Urartian]] period mention the region under a variety of names: \"Ardakh\", \"Urdekhe\", and \"Atakhuni\".<ref>Chorbajian, Levon; Donabedian Patrick; Mutafian, Claude.

Lang]], the ancient name of Artsakh possibly derives from the name of King [[Artaxias I]] of Armenia (190\u2013159 BC), founder of the [[Artaxiad Dynasty]] and the kingdom of [[Kingdom of Armenia (Antiquity)|Greater Armenia]].<ref>[[David M.

It may have been inhabited by [[Caspians|Caspian tribes]] and/or by [[Scythians]].\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\n==== Kingdom of Armenia ====\nAfter decades of raids by the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and the [[Medes]], Urartu finally collapsed with the rise of the [[Medes|Median Empire]], and shortly after, the geopolitical region previously ruled as Urartu re-emerged as [[Satrapy of Armenia|Armenia]]. By the 5th century BC, Artsakh was part of Armenia under the [[Orontid Dynasty]]. It would continue to be part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under the [[Artaxiad dynasty|Artaxiad Dynasty]], under which Armenia became one of the largest realms in [[Western Asia]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Great King]] of Armenia, [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II]], built several cities named after himself in regions he considered particularly important, one of which was the [[Tigranakert of Artsakh|city]] he built in [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]].\n\n==== Persian Empire and the Satrapy of Arran ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], Armenia was partitioned between the two empires. Artsakh was removed from [[Sasanian Armenia|Persian Armenia]] and included into the neighbouring [[satrap]]y of [[Albania (satrapy)|Arran]]. At this time, the population of Artsakh consisted of [[Armenians]] and ''Armenicized'' aborigines, though many of the latter were still cited as distinct ethnic entities.<ref name=\"Hewsen\">[[Robert H.

Under the Arabs, most of the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] and the [[Armenian Highlands]], including [[Principality of Iberia|Iberia]] and Arran, would be unified into an [[emirate]] called ''[[Arminiya]]'', under which Artsakh would continue to remain as part of Arran.\n\nDespite being under Persian and Arab rule, many of the Armenian territories, including Artsakh, were governed by Armenian nobility. Arran would gradually disappear as a geopolitical entity, and its population would be assimilated by neighbouring ethnic groups with whom they shared a common culture and religion. Many Christians from Arran would [[Ethnogenesis|form part of the ethnic composition]] of the Armenians living in modern-day Artsakh.<ref>Ronald G. Suny: ''What Happened in Soviet Armenia?'' Middle East Report, No. 153, Islam and the State. (Jul. - Aug., 1988), pp. 37-40.</ref>\n\n==== Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia and the Kingdom of Artsakh ====\nFragmentation of Arab authority provided the opportunity for the resurgence of an Armenian state in the Armenian Highlands. One particular noble dynasty, the [[Bagratid dynasty of Armenia|Bagratids]], began annexing territories from other Armenian nobles, which, in the later half of the 9th century gave rise to a new [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian kingdom]] which included Artsakh.\n\nThe new Kingdom wouldn't stay united for long, however, due to internal conflicts, civil wars, and external pressures, Armenia would often find itself fragmented between other noble Armenian houses, most notably the [[Mamikonian]] and [[Siunia dynasty|Siunia]] families, the latter of which would produce a [[cadet branch]] known as the House of Khachen, named after their stronghold in Artsakh. The House of Khachen ruled the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] in the 11th century as an independent kingdom under the protectorate of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Under the House of Khachen, the region historically called Artsakh would become synonymous with the name \"Khachen\".\n\n==== Turko-Mongol rule, the Principality of Khachen, and the Melikdoms of Karabakh ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Byzantine Empire]], and with the arrival of [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the later half of the 11th century, the Kingdom of Armenia collapsed, and Artsakh became the autonomous [[Principality of Khachen]], ruled by the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]], within the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for a short time until the [[Ilkhanate|Mongols]] would acquire the region. Although the Armenians of Artsakh would not rule the lands as fully sovereign entities, the mountainous geography of the location would allow them to maintain a semi-independent or autonomous status within other realms, such as the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]], [[Kara Koyunlu]], and [[Aq Qoyunlu|Ak Koyunlu]] realms.\n\nDuring this time, the lands to the west of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]] up to the eastern slopes of the [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur mountain range]] would become known as ''[[Karabakh]]'', with the lands of the Principality of Khachen corresponding to the highlands. During the period of Mongol domination, a great number of Armenians left the lowlands of Karabakh and sought refuge in the mountainous heights of the region.<ref>[[George Bournoutian|Bournoutian, George A]]. \"Review of ''The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule'', by Audrey L.

The Armenian princes continued to rule autonomously over the highlands of Karabakh during this time.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the whole of Karabakh became a semi-independent [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanate]] called the [[Karabakh Khanate]] which lasted for about 75 years. The [[Russian Empire]] advanced into the region in 1805, declared Artsakh a Russian protectorate and formally annexed it from Iran in 1813 according to the G\u00fclistan/Northern Karabakh Treaty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Berg-Karabach/Arzach|last=Luchterbach|first=Otto|publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2010|isbn=9783832955885|editor-last=Soghomonyan|editor-first=Vahram|location=Badan.Badan|pages=15}}</ref> The Armenian princes lost their status as princes (''meliks'') in 1822.\n\n=== Late modern era ===\n\n==== War in Transcaucasia ====\n{{Main|First Republic of Armenia|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic}}\nFollowing the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, [[Transcaucasia]] became the stage of wars between every political entity that emerged in the region ([[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]]) and their neighbors ([[Ottoman Empire]]). The newly formed [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] (declared on 28 May 1918) claimed most of the highlands of [[Karabakh]], which was also claimed by the newly formed [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Assistance from the Republic of Armenia to Karabakh was limited as it found itself fighting enemies on all fronts, but the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and the territories formerly known as Khachen (Artsakh) managed to maintain their control over the lands, consistently fighting off offensives from Azerbaijan and quelling Muslim uprisings from within. Azerbaijan maintained control of the lowlands of Karabakh and some regions between Zangezur and Artsakh.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the [[British Empire]] established itself in Azerbaijan, and advocated that all of Karabakh (including Zangezur and Artsakh) should be part of Azerbaijan until the boundaries can be decided upon peacefully at the upcoming [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], but the battles did not cease until the [[Red Army]] from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] began reclaiming the former territories of the Russian Empire and created [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] out of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1920. The Armenians of Zangezur and Artsakh had consistently maintained control of the region and intended to unite with Armenia during the entirety of the two years of chaos, with Azerbaijan only temporarily occupying parts of the regions at certain times. The fall of Azerbaijan gave Armenia the opportunity to properly unite with the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and Artsakh, but they were taken by the Red Army on 26 May 1920. The rest of Armenia fell to the Red Army shortly after.\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\nThe [[Bolsheviks]] tried to end the centuries-long rivalry between Russia and Turkey, and in 1921, [[Joseph Stalin]] formally transferred the Armenian-populated highlands of Karabakh to [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] to try to placate Turkey,<ref>[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], ''Stalin: a Biography'' (Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-674-02258-0}}), p. 204</ref> though the majority of Zangezur remained within [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In December 1920 under Soviet pressure central authorities issued a statement that Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhjivan were all transferred to Armenian control.

The inclusion of Artsakh within Soviet Azerbaijan caused an uproar amongst Armenians, which led to the creation of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] within Soviet Azerbaijan on 7 July 1923 (implemented in November 1924). Although the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to desire reunification with Armenia, the conflict was largely dormant during the Soviet era.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Nagorno-Karabakh War ====\n[[File:Nkr.gif|thumb|Armenian expansion in NKR, 1989-1994]]\nDuring the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was revitalized.

The region is currently populated mostly by [[Armenians]] and the primary spoken language is [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Artsakh controls most of the territory of the former [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|some of the surrounding area]], giving it a border with [[Armenia]] to the west and [[Iran]] to the south. Its capital is [[Stepanakert]].\n\nThe predominantly Armenian-populated region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] was claimed by both the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]] and the [[First Republic of Armenia]] when both countries became independent in 1918 after the fall of the [[Russian Empire]], and a [[History of Nagorno-Karabakh|brief war over Nagorno-Karabakh broke out]] in 1920. The dispute was largely shelved after the [[Soviet Union]] established control over the area and created the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] (NKAO) within the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijan SSR]] in 1923. During the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]], the region re-emerged as a source of dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 1991, a [[1991 Nagorno-Karabakh independence referendum|referendum]] held in the NKAO and the neighbouring [[Shahumian]] region resulted in a [[declaration of independence]] based on its right of [[self-determination]]. A large-scale ethnic conflict led to the 1991\u20131994 [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], which ended with a ceasefire.\n\nArtsakh is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[democracy]] (in the middle of transforming from a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential democracy]] after a [[2017 Nagorno-Karabakh constitutional referendum|2017 referendum]]) with a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Nagorno-Karabakh|legislature]]. Some have said that its reliance on Armenia means that, in many ways, it functions de facto as part of Armenia.<ref name=\"hughes\"/><ref name=\"cornell\"/>\n\nThe country is very mountainous, averaging {{convert|3600|ft|m|-1|order=flip}} [[metres above sea level|above sea level]]. The population is overwhelmingly Christian, most being affiliated with the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]]. Several historical monasteries are popular with tourists, mostly from the [[Armenian diaspora]], as most travel can take place only between Armenia and Artsakh.\n\n==Etymology==\nAccording to Armenian and Western specialists, inscriptions dating to the [[Urartian]] period mention the region under a variety of names: \"Ardakh\", \"Urdekhe\", and \"Atakhuni\".<ref>Chorbajian, Levon; Donabedian Patrick; Mutafian, Claude.

It may have been inhabited by [[Caspians|Caspian tribes]] and/or by [[Scythians]].\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n\n==== Kingdom of Armenia ====\nAfter decades of raids by the [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and the [[Medes]], Urartu finally collapsed with the rise of the [[Medes|Median Empire]], and shortly after, the geopolitical region previously ruled as Urartu re-emerged as [[Satrapy of Armenia|Armenia]]. By the 5th century BC, Artsakh was part of Armenia under the [[Orontid Dynasty]]. It would continue to be part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] under the [[Artaxiad dynasty|Artaxiad Dynasty]], under which Armenia became one of the largest realms in [[Western Asia]]. At its greatest extent, the [[Great King]] of Armenia, [[Tigranes the Great|Tigranes II]], built several cities named after himself in regions he considered particularly important, one of which was the [[Tigranakert of Artsakh|city]] he built in [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]].\n\n==== Persian Empire and the Satrapy of Arran ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Persians]], Armenia was partitioned between the two empires. Artsakh was removed from [[Sasanian Armenia|Persian Armenia]] and included into the neighbouring [[satrap]]y of [[Albania (satrapy)|Arran]]. At this time, the population of Artsakh consisted of [[Armenians]] and ''Armenicized'' aborigines, though many of the latter were still cited as distinct ethnic entities.<ref name=\"Hewsen\">[[Robert H.

Under the Arabs, most of the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] and the [[Armenian Highlands]], including [[Principality of Iberia|Iberia]] and Arran, would be unified into an [[emirate]] called ''[[Arminiya]]'', under which Artsakh would continue to remain as part of Arran.\n\nDespite being under Persian and Arab rule, many of the Armenian territories, including Artsakh, were governed by Armenian nobility. Arran would gradually disappear as a geopolitical entity, and its population would be assimilated by neighbouring ethnic groups with whom they shared a common culture and religion. Many Christians from Arran would [[Ethnogenesis|form part of the ethnic composition]] of the Armenians living in modern-day Artsakh.<ref>Ronald G. Suny: ''What Happened in Soviet Armenia?'' Middle East Report, No. 153, Islam and the State. (Jul. - Aug., 1988), pp. 37-40.</ref>\n\n==== Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia and the Kingdom of Artsakh ====\nFragmentation of Arab authority provided the opportunity for the resurgence of an Armenian state in the Armenian Highlands. One particular noble dynasty, the [[Bagratid dynasty of Armenia|Bagratids]], began annexing territories from other Armenian nobles, which, in the later half of the 9th century gave rise to a new [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenian kingdom]] which included Artsakh.\n\nThe new Kingdom wouldn't stay united for long, however, due to internal conflicts, civil wars, and external pressures, Armenia would often find itself fragmented between other noble Armenian houses, most notably the [[Mamikonian]] and [[Siunia dynasty|Siunia]] families, the latter of which would produce a [[cadet branch]] known as the House of Khachen, named after their stronghold in Artsakh. The House of Khachen ruled the [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] in the 11th century as an independent kingdom under the protectorate of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia. Under the House of Khachen, the region historically called Artsakh would become synonymous with the name \"Khachen\".\n\n==== Turko-Mongol rule, the Principality of Khachen, and the Melikdoms of Karabakh ====\nFollowing wars with the [[Byzantine Empire]], and with the arrival of [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]] in the later half of the 11th century, the Kingdom of Armenia collapsed, and Artsakh became the autonomous [[Principality of Khachen]], ruled by the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]], within the [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for a short time until the [[Ilkhanate|Mongols]] would acquire the region. Although the Armenians of Artsakh would not rule the lands as fully sovereign entities, the mountainous geography of the location would allow them to maintain a semi-independent or autonomous status within other realms, such as the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]], [[Kara Koyunlu]], and [[Aq Qoyunlu|Ak Koyunlu]] realms.\n\nDuring this time, the lands to the west of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura river]] up to the eastern slopes of the [[Zangezur Mountains|Zangezur mountain range]] would become known as ''[[Karabakh]]'', with the lands of the Principality of Khachen corresponding to the highlands. During the period of Mongol domination, a great number of Armenians left the lowlands of Karabakh and sought refuge in the mountainous heights of the region.<ref>[[George Bournoutian|Bournoutian, George A]]. \"Review of ''The Azerbaijani Turks: Power and Identity Under Russian Rule'', by Audrey L.

The Armenian princes continued to rule autonomously over the highlands of Karabakh during this time.\n\nIn the mid-18th century, the whole of Karabakh became a semi-independent [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanate]] called the [[Karabakh Khanate]] which lasted for about 75 years. The [[Russian Empire]] advanced into the region in 1805, declared Artsakh a Russian protectorate and formally annexed it from Iran in 1813 according to the G\u00fclistan/Northern Karabakh Treaty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=L\u00f6sungsans\u00e4tze f\u00fcr Berg-Karabach/Arzach|last=Luchterbach|first=Otto|publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft|year=2010|isbn=9783832955885|editor-last=Soghomonyan|editor-first=Vahram|location=Badan.Badan|pages=15}}</ref> The Armenian princes lost their status as princes (''meliks'') in 1822.\n\n=== Late modern era ===\n\n==== War in Transcaucasia ====\n{{Main|First Republic of Armenia|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic}}\nFollowing the collapse of the Russian Empire during World War I, [[Transcaucasia]] became the stage of wars between every political entity that emerged in the region ([[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Azerbaijan]], and [[Democratic Republic of Georgia|Georgia]]) and their neighbors ([[Ottoman Empire]]). The newly formed [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]] (declared on 28 May 1918) claimed most of the highlands of [[Karabakh]], which was also claimed by the newly formed [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. Assistance from the Republic of Armenia to Karabakh was limited as it found itself fighting enemies on all fronts, but the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and the territories formerly known as Khachen (Artsakh) managed to maintain their control over the lands, consistently fighting off offensives from Azerbaijan and quelling Muslim uprisings from within. Azerbaijan maintained control of the lowlands of Karabakh and some regions between Zangezur and Artsakh.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the [[British Empire]] established itself in Azerbaijan, and advocated that all of Karabakh (including Zangezur and Artsakh) should be part of Azerbaijan until the boundaries can be decided upon peacefully at the upcoming [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], but the battles did not cease until the [[Red Army]] from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] began reclaiming the former territories of the Russian Empire and created [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] out of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1920. The Armenians of Zangezur and Artsakh had consistently maintained control of the region and intended to unite with Armenia during the entirety of the two years of chaos, with Azerbaijan only temporarily occupying parts of the regions at certain times. The fall of Azerbaijan gave Armenia the opportunity to properly unite with the Armenian irregulars in Zangezur and Artsakh, but they were taken by the Red Army on 26 May 1920. The rest of Armenia fell to the Red Army shortly after.\n\n==== Soviet Union ====\nThe [[Bolsheviks]] tried to end the centuries-long rivalry between Russia and Turkey, and in 1921, [[Joseph Stalin]] formally transferred the Armenian-populated highlands of Karabakh to [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Azerbaijan]] to try to placate Turkey,<ref>[[Robert Service (historian)|Robert Service]], ''Stalin: a Biography'' (Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]], 2006, {{ISBN|0-674-02258-0}}), p. 204</ref> though the majority of Zangezur remained within [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Armenia]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} In December 1920 under Soviet pressure central authorities issued a statement that Karabakh, Zangezur and Nakhjivan were all transferred to Armenian control.

The inclusion of Artsakh within Soviet Azerbaijan caused an uproar amongst Armenians, which led to the creation of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]] within Soviet Azerbaijan on 7 July 1923 (implemented in November 1924). Although the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh continued to desire reunification with Armenia, the conflict was largely dormant during the Soviet era.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Nagorno-Karabakh War ====\n[[File:Nkr.gif|thumb|Armenian expansion in NKR, 1989-1994]]\nDuring the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was revitalized.

Workers were unable to identify any ash layers directly within the Mazatzal Group needed to constrain the actual timing of folding and thrusting attributed to the Mazatzal orogeny.

Later Mako et al. (2015) revised the age of the granite near Young, Arizona, to 1664+/-17 Ma.\n\nNew mapping and utilization of detrital zircon geochronology during the 2010s were able to constrain the age of the youngest sediments above the Mazatzal Group involved in the classic deformation of the Mazatzal orogeny. Detrital zircons from the [[Hopi Springs Shale]] in the northern Mazatzal Mountains yielded a maximum depositional age (MDA) of 1571 Mya. Similar sediments collected from a shale folded in the core of the Four Peaks synform yielded a MDA of 1580 Mya. Both ages constrained the timing of the Mazatzal orogeny to some time after 1570 Mya. Finally, in the Upper [[Salt River Canyon]], overlying the [[White Ledge Formation]] (a correlative to the Mazatzal Group), sediments from the conformably overlying Yankee Joe and [[Blackjack Formation]]s yielded MDA of ca. 1470 Mya. The entire sediment sequence of Redmond (1657 Mya), White Ledge, Yankee Joe, and Blackjack Formations were deformed during the Mazatzal orogeny sometime after 1470 Mya.

The Mazatzal orogeny was the last major orogeny in the region before the [[Grenville orogeny]] began ca 1151 Mya.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of orogenies]]\n*[[Geology of Arizona]]\n*[[Geology of New Mexico]]\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Geology of North America| ]]\n[[Category:Paleoproterozoic orogenies| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kent G.
