These terms are not synonymous, yet the academic discourse considers both to exist within a spectrum of assaults on nations or religio-ethnic groups.

Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area \"ethnically homogeneous\", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is \"to destroy, in whole or in part\" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. \u2014 ICJ.{{sfn|International Court of Justice|2007|pp=83\u201384}}</blockquote>\n\n==International reports==\nOn 17 November 1992, [[United Nations special rapporteur]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] issued the report ''Situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia'' to the [[UN]].

Neither the intent, as a matter of policy, to render an area \"ethnically homogeneous\", nor the operations that may be carried out to implement such policy, can as such be designated as genocide: the intent that characterizes genocide is \"to destroy, in whole or in part\" a particular group, and deportation or displacement of the members of a group, even if effected by force, is not necessarily equivalent to destruction of that group, nor is such destruction an automatic consequence of the displacement. This is not to say that acts described as 'ethnic cleansing' may never constitute genocide, if they are such as to be characterized as, for example, 'deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part', contrary to Article II, paragraph (c), of the Convention, provided such action is carried out with the necessary specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]''), that is to say with a view to the destruction of the group, as distinct from its removal from the region. \u2014 ICJ.{{sfn|International Court of Justice|2007|pp=83\u201384}}</blockquote>\n\n==International reports==\nOn 17 November 1992, [[United Nations special rapporteur]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] issued the report ''Situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia'' to the [[UN]].

Starring [[Sridevi]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] in the lead roles, the film revolves around Rajni, a [[N\u0101gin\u012b]] who marries a civilian to avenge the death of her spouse at the hands of an evil saint. The film also stars [[Rupini (actress)|Komal Mahuvakar]], [[Amrish Puri]], [[Sushma Seth]] and [[Prem Chopra]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film upon its release was a widespread success grossing \u20b913 crore at the box office, becoming the  [[Bollywood films of 1986|second-highest-grossing Indian film of 1986]]. The success of the film proved to be a major watershed moment in  [[Indian Cinema]], as the film, despite being a woman-centric movie became a massive commercial success. A sequel to the film was released; ''[[Nigahen: Nagina Part II]]'' (1989), which made the former the first Indian movie ever to have a sequel, although the sequel failed commercially. Today, ''Nagina'' is considered a  [[cult classic]] and one of Sridevi's finest performances.\n\n== Plot ==\nRajiv ([[Rishi Kapoor]]) comes from a wealthy land-owning family, and lives in a palatial home with his mother ([[Sushma Seth]]), who would like him to marry a beautiful young woman named Vijaya Singh ([[Rupini (actress)|Komal Mahuvakar]]), the only daughter of Thakur Ajay Singh ([[Prem Chopra]]). Rajiv, however, is in love with Rajni ([[Sridevi]]), who is an orphan without connections. When Rajiv informs his mother of his intent to marry Rajni, she refuses to give her blessings, but relents after a favourable meeting with Rajni. The marriage is arranged and they enjoy their marriage \u2013 until the arrival of Bhairo Nath ([[Amrish Puri]]), a [[sadhu]] capable of controlling snakes. He informs Rajiv's mother that Rajni is a [[Ichchhadhari Nag|shape-shifting]] venomous snake who has married Rajiv to avenge the death of her spouse during Rajiv's childhood. To remove her from the household, Bhairo and his disciples do a snake dance song, forcing Rajni to dance for them as she is a snake. However, when Rajiv comes into the house, Rajni escapes, only to be caught by Bhairo, who reveals his plot, to control the world with the Mani, a sacred jewel that only Rajni knows where is hidden. However, Rajiv comes and engages in a fight with Bhairo. Bhairo is bitten by two snakes and dies. Rajiv and Rajni live happily ever after.\n\n== Reception ==\nAccording to [[Taran Adarsh]], ''Nagina'' turned out to be the biggest blockbuster of the year,<ref>http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/features/type/view/id/3705</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Boxofficeindia.co.in|title=Worth Their Weight In Gold!(80s)|url=http://www.boxofficeindia.co.in/worth-their-weight-in-gold-80s/}}</ref> with [[Box Office India]] stating that [[Sridevi]] remained \"''the undisputed No.1\"''.<ref name=\"Boxofficeindia.com\">{{cite web|last=Boxofficeindia.com|title=Top Actress|url=http://boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actress|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017104803/http://boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actress|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The movie was appreciated for its screenplay, dialogues and direction.<ref>[http://entertainment.oneindia.in/celebrities/memoirs/sridevi-261106.html Sridevi \u2013 The child woman]</ref> Named one of the best snake fantasy films by [[Yahoo]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Yahoo|title=Meet Bollywood's celebrity snakes|url=http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/oct/18/slide-show-1-snake-movies-in-bollywood.htm}}</ref> [[Times of India]] ranked ''Nagina'' as one of the 'Top 10 Snake Films of Hindi Cinema'.<ref>{{cite web|last=Times of India|title=Top Ten snake films|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videols/9481862.cms}}</ref> Sridevi's climax dance number \"Main Teri Dushman\" also remains one of the best snake dances in Bollywood<ref>{{cite web|last=MidDay|title=The best of Sridevi|url=http://www.mid-day.com/photos/b-town-specials/the-best-of-sridevi/}}</ref> with Desi Hits calling it \"''one of Sridevi's most iconic dance numbers... that still gives fans goose bumps\"''<ref>{{cite web|last=Desihits|title=Top 5 Bollywood Dancing Queens|url=http://www.desihits.com/news/view/top-5-bollywood-dancing-queens-20100310}}</ref> and iDiva describing it as \"''the stuff of movie legends\"''.<ref name=\"iDiva\">{{cite web|last=iDiva|title=Sridevi \u2013 The Dancing Queen|url=http://idiva.com/photogallery-entertainment/sridevi-the-dancing-queen/8403}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Sridevi was given the [[Filmfare Special Award]] for her performances in ''Nagina'' as well as ''[[Mr. India (1987 film)|Mr. India]]'' (1987) to recognise her work at that time.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sridevi]] as Rajni/Nagin\n* [[Rishi Kapoor]] as Rajiv\n* [[Rupini (actress)|Komal Mahuvakar]] as Vijaya Singh\n* [[Amrish Puri]] as Bhairon Nath\n* [[Sushma Seth]] as Rajiv's mother\n* [[Prem Chopra]] as Thakur Ajay Singh\n* [[Guddi Maruti]] as Banumati\n\n== Sequel ==\nThis movie was followed by a sequel in 1989 called ''[[Nigahen: Nagina Part II]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187351 IMDB: Nigahen: Nagina Part II]</ref>\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe film's music was provided by [[Laxmikant-Pyarelal]], with lyrics by [[Anand Bakshi]], and had classic songs like, ''Main Teri Dushman''  originally sung by Lata Mangeshkar.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! # !!

The film also stars [[Rupini (actress)|Komal Mahuvakar]], [[Amrish Puri]], [[Sushma Seth]] and [[Prem Chopra]] in supporting roles.\n\nThe film upon its release was a widespread success grossing \u20b913 crore at the box office, becoming the  [[Bollywood films of 1986|second-highest-grossing Indian film of 1986]].

He was drafted 25th overall by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft|National Hockey League's 1988 entry draft]]. Major acquired many [[penalty minutes]] over his career due to his playing style, which involved battling in front of the net for loose pucks, scoring [[garbage goal]]s, and blocking the [[goaltender]]s view. Major only played in two [[National Hockey League|NHL]] games, for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. He also enjoyed a short career as a professional [[roller hockey]] player in [[Roller Hockey International]] (RHI). Taking into account all of his hockey games played at a professional level, Major played in 1,339 games and acquired 4,334 penalty minutes, giving Major an average of 3.24 penalty minutes per game during his career. After 4 seasons and 2 Championships as Head Coach of the Amherstview Jets Junior A team, Major is taking a year off to help coach his daughter's Kingston Ice Wolves' Peewee AA team.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Junior and early minor-league career===\nMajor started receiving attention from NHL scouts while playing for the [[Don Mills Flyers]] of the [[MTHL]] in 1986. He advanced to the [[North Bay Centennials]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1987\u201388 season and put up 33 points in 57 games to go along with a whopping 272 penalty minutes (PIM). Major averaged almost 5 penalty minutes a game, but his hard-nosed style was admired by NHL scouts and Major was selected 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft|1988 NHL Draft]]. Now as an NHL prospect, Major gained confidence and began the 1988\u201389 season again with the Centennials before being traded 11 games into the [[Kingston Raiders]]. He would remain in Kingston for that season and the next (when they were renamed the [[Kingston Frontenacs]]), scoring 112 points and 361 PIMs, before moving up to the [[Muskegon Lumberjacks]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]]. Major remained with the Lumberjacks for three seasons, scoring 77 points and 617 PIMs. He led the team in penalties during the 1991\u201392 season with 302 and would add another 29 PIMs in the Lumberjacks' playoff run which saw them lose four games to none in the finals to the [[Kansas City Blades]]. After his last season with the Lumberjacks, that included relocation to [[Cleveland Lumberjacks|Cleveland]], Major was let go by the parent club Pittsburgh and quickly signed as a [[free agent]] by the [[Boston Bruins]] on July 22, 1993.\n\nMajor started play with Boston's affiliate the [[Providence Bruins]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. He scored 26 points along with 176 PIMs during the [[1993\u201394 AHL season|1993\u201394 season]], but Providence failed to make the playoffs. He was let go by the Bruins, and joined the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the IHL for the following season. He continued to play aggressively, with his 36 points and 229 PIMs helping push the Vipers into the playoffs, but his play couldn't help them past the second round.\n\nMajor again caught the attention of an NHL team, when the Detroit Red Wings signed him as a free agent on June 26, 1995. He began play for the [[Adirondack Red Wings]] of the AHL in the [[1995\u201396 AHL season|1995\u201396 season]] and scored 29 points while racking up 234 PIMs for second on the team. He was known as a player who wouldn't back down from a [[fighting in ice hockey|fight]], and he was involved in several fights during Adirondack's short playoff run that season, receiving 21 PIMs in just three games.\n\n===NHL appearance===\nMajor finally received his first shot in the big leagues during the [[1996\u201397 NHL season]] when he was brought up from Adirondack for two games starting on November 2, 1996. In his very first game, halfway through the second period, Major [[Fighting in ice hockey|fought]] veteran instigator [[Tie Domi]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. Major held his own against Domi but was rewarded with a bloody nose and a five-minute major. Major played the following night and failed to impress the Detroit staff, which resulted in him being sent back down to the minors. Finishing the season with Adirondack, and leading the team in PIMs with 213, Major was let go by Detroit.\n\n===Late minor-league career===\nMajor still had NHL interest and was quickly signed as a free agent on August 20, 1997 by the [[Washington Capitals]]. He started out in their farm system playing for the [[Portland Pirates]] of the AHL. In his [[1997\u201398 AHL season|first season]], Major was first on his team and second in the league for penalty minutes with 355. This was his career-high for PIMs in a season and as of 2007, he still holds the team record for penalty minutes in a single season. Major wasn't finished with 355 and added 52 more PIMs in 10 playoff games that year. The [[1998\u201399 AHL season|following season]] he again led the team in PIMs and saw his point production decrease to only nine points in 66 games. He was let go by Washington and began play for the [[Houston Aeros (1994\u20132013)|Houston Aeros]] of the IHL in 1999. After just 20 games (with 81 PIMs), Major was signed as a free agent by the [[Flint Generals]] of the [[United Hockey League]]. He was named team [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]] and finished out the 1999\u201300 season with the Generals scoring 41 points, his highest point total in years, and helped the team win the [[Colonial Cup (hockey)|Colonial Cup]]. He put up great numbers the following season when he finished with 46 points and 163 PIMs. Generals coach [[Billy Thurlow]] had this to say about Major's style of play:\n\n<blockquote>Anytime he's on the ice, people have to respect us. Nobody's going to shove us around.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|author=Dean Howe\n|title = Major Uses Games to Mask Personal Pain\n|url = \n|publisher=The Flint Journal\n|date = October 19, 2000\n|accessdate =}}</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nHe would also go on to join the AHL's [[Hershey Bears]] for two games in the [[2000\u201301 AHL season|2000\u201301 season]]. In 2001, he joined the [[Wheeling Nailers]] of the [[East Coast Hockey League]] and would go on to score 84 points in two seasons with the Nailers. The coach, [[John Brophy (ice hockey)|John Brophy]], had this to say about Major returning for his second season in Wheeling:\n\n<blockquote>We are very fortunate to have Mark return to the Nailers, not only are we getting a great player and a natural team leader, but a guy who is good in the community and represents the Nailers and Penguins organizations with class.<ref>\n{{cite news\n |author      = Press Release\n |title       = Mark Major is returning to Wheeling\n |url         = http://www.sportzdomain.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4443\n |publisher   = ECHL.com\n |date        = September 5, 2002\n |accessdate  = August 8, 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716122224/http://www.sportzdomain.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4443\n |archivedate = July 16, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe 2003\u201304 season would be Major's last, playing in 40 games for the [[Laval Chiefs]] of the [[QSMHL]] and 12 games for the [[Kalamazoo Wings]] of the UHL.\n\n===Playing roller hockey===\nMajor was also an active member of the [[Roller Hockey International|Roller Hockey International League]] for its entire lifespan. Major played on the [[Buffalo Stampede (RHI)|Buffalo Stampede]] in 1994 and 1995, winning the [[Murphy Cup]] in 1994. He joined the [[Empire State Cobras]] in 1996 and the [[New Jersey Rockin' Rollers]] in 1997. When the RHI folded in 1997, Major continued playing with the [[Buffalo Wings (roller hockey)|Buffalo Wings]] of [[Major League Roller Hockey]] in 1998 and joined the newly re-formed Roller Hockey International with Buffalo in [[1999 RHI season|1999]]. The league folded for good after the 1999 season.\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n*'''Murphy Cup Champion''':1994 (Buffalo Stampede \u2013 RHI)\n*'''Colonial Cup Champion''':2000 (Flint Generals \u2013 UHL)\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{| BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" width=\"75%\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

He was drafted 25th overall by the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft|National Hockey League's 1988 entry draft]]. Major acquired many [[penalty minutes]] over his career due to his playing style, which involved battling in front of the net for loose pucks, scoring [[garbage goal]]s, and blocking the [[goaltender]]s view. Major only played in two [[National Hockey League|NHL]] games, for the [[Detroit Red Wings]]. He also enjoyed a short career as a professional [[roller hockey]] player in [[Roller Hockey International]] (RHI). Taking into account all of his hockey games played at a professional level, Major played in 1,339 games and acquired 4,334 penalty minutes, giving Major an average of 3.24 penalty minutes per game during his career. After 4 seasons and 2 Championships as Head Coach of the Amherstview Jets Junior A team, Major is taking a year off to help coach his daughter's Kingston Ice Wolves' Peewee AA team.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Junior and early minor-league career===\nMajor started receiving attention from NHL scouts while playing for the [[Don Mills Flyers]] of the [[MTHL]] in 1986. He advanced to the [[North Bay Centennials]] of the [[Ontario Hockey League]] for the 1987\u201388 season and put up 33 points in 57 games to go along with a whopping 272 penalty minutes (PIM). Major averaged almost 5 penalty minutes a game, but his hard-nosed style was admired by NHL scouts and Major was selected 25th overall by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the [[1988 NHL Entry Draft|1988 NHL Draft]]. Now as an NHL prospect, Major gained confidence and began the 1988\u201389 season again with the Centennials before being traded 11 games in to the [[Kingston Raiders]]. He would remain in Kingston for that season and the next (when they were renamed the [[Kingston Frontenacs]]), scoring 112 points and 361 PIMs, before moving up to the [[Muskegon Lumberjacks]] of the [[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]]. Major remained with the Lumberjacks for three seasons, scoring 77 points and 617 PIMs. He led the team in penalties during the 1991\u201392 season with 302 and would add another 29 PIMs in the Lumberjacks' playoff run which saw them lose four games to none in the finals to the [[Kansas City Blades]]. After his last season with the Lumberjacks, that included a relocation to [[Cleveland Lumberjacks|Cleveland]], Major was let go by the parent club Pittsburgh and quickly signed as a [[free agent]] by the [[Boston Bruins]] on July 22, 1993.\n\nMajor started play with Boston's affiliate the [[Providence Bruins]] of the [[American Hockey League]]. He scored 26 points along with 176 PIMs during the [[1993\u201394 AHL season|1993\u201394 season]], but Providence failed to make the playoffs. He was let go by the Bruins, and joined the [[Detroit Vipers]] of the IHL for the following season. He continued to play aggressively, with his 36 points and 229 PIMs helping push the Vipers into the playoffs, but his play couldn't help them past the second round.\n\nMajor again caught the attention of an NHL team, when the Detroit Red Wings signed him as a free agent on June 26, 1995. He began play for the [[Adirondack Red Wings]] of the AHL in the [[1995\u201396 AHL season|1995\u201396 season]] and scored 29 points while racking up 234 PIMs for second on the team. He was known as a player who wouldn't back down from a [[fighting in ice hockey|fight]], and he was involved in several fights during Adirondack's short playoff run that season, receiving 21 PIMs in just three games.\n\n===NHL appearance===\nMajor finally received his first shot in the big leagues during the [[1996\u201397 NHL season]] when he was brought up from Adirondack for two games starting on November 2, 1996. In his very first game, halfway though the second period, Major [[Fighting in ice hockey|fought]] veteran instigator [[Tie Domi]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. Major held his own against Domi but was rewarded with a bloody nose and a five-minute major. Major played the following night and failed to impress the Detroit staff, which resulted in him being sent back down to the minors. Finishing the season with Adirondack, and leading the team in PIMs with 213, Major was let go by Detroit.\n\n===Late minor-league career===\nMajor still had NHL interest and was quickly signed as a free agent on August 20, 1997 by the [[Washington Capitals]]. He started out in their farm system playing for the [[Portland Pirates]] of the AHL. In his [[1997\u201398 AHL season|first season]], Major was first on his team and second in the league for penalty minutes with 355. This was his career high for PIMs in a season and as of 2007, he still holds the team record for penalty minutes in a single season. Major wasn't finished with 355 and added 52 more PIMs in 10 playoff games that year. The [[1998\u201399 AHL season|following season]] he again led the team in PIMs and saw his point production decrease to only nine points in 66 games. He was let go by Washington and began play for the [[Houston Aeros (1994\u20132013)|Houston Aeros]] of the IHL in 1999. After just 20 games (with 81 PIMs), Major was signed as a free agent by the [[Flint Generals]] of the [[United Hockey League]]. He was named team [[captain (ice hockey)|captain]] and finished out the 1999\u201300 season with the Generals scoring 41 points, his highest point total in years, and helped the team win the [[Colonial Cup (hockey)|Colonial Cup]]. He put up great numbers the following season when he finished with 46 points and 163 PIMs. Generals coach [[Billy Thurlow]] had this to say about Major's style of play:\n\n<blockquote>Anytime he's on the ice, people have to respect us. Nobody's going to shove us around.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|author=Dean Howe\n|title = Major Uses Games to Mask Personal Pain\n|url = \n|publisher=The Flint Journal\n|date = October 19, 2000\n|accessdate =}}</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nHe would also go on to join the AHL's [[Hershey Bears]] for two games in the [[2000\u201301 AHL season|2000\u201301 season]]. In 2001, he joined the [[Wheeling Nailers]] of the [[East Coast Hockey League]] and would go on to score 84 points in two seasons with the Nailers. The coach, [[John Brophy (ice hockey)|John Brophy]], had this to say about Major returning for his second season in Wheeling:\n\n<blockquote>We are very fortunate to have Mark return to the Nailers, not only are we getting a great player and a natural team leader, but a guy who is good in the community and represents the Nailers and Penguins organizations with class.<ref>\n{{cite news\n |author      = Press Release\n |title       = Mark Major is returning to Wheeling\n |url         = http://www.sportzdomain.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4443\n |publisher   = ECHL.com\n |date        = September 5, 2002\n |accessdate  = August 8, 2007\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716122224/http://www.sportzdomain.com/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=4443\n |archivedate = July 16, 2011\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe 2003\u201304 season would be Major's last, playing in 40 games for the [[Laval Chiefs]] of the [[QSMHL]] and 12 games for the [[Kalamazoo Wings]] of the UHL.\n\n===Playing roller hockey===\nMajor was also an active member in the [[Roller Hockey International|Roller Hockey International League]] for its entire lifespan. Major played on the [[Buffalo Stampede (RHI)|Buffalo Stampede]] in 1994 and 1995, winning the [[Murphy Cup]] in 1994. He joined the [[Empire State Cobras]] in 1996 and the [[New Jersey Rockin' Rollers]] in 1997. When the RHI folded in 1997, Major continued playing with the [[Buffalo Wings (roller hockey)|Buffalo Wings]] of [[Major League Roller Hockey]] in 1998 and joined the newly re-formed Roller Hockey International with Buffalo in [[1999 RHI season|1999]]. The league folded for good after the 1999 season.\n\n==Awards and achievements==\n*'''Murphy Cup Champion''':1994 (Buffalo Stampede \u2013 RHI)\n*'''Colonial Cup Champion''':2000 (Flint Generals \u2013 UHL)\n\n==Career statistics==\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{| BORDER=\"0\" CELLPADDING=\"0\" CELLSPACING=\"0\" width=\"75%\"\n|- ALIGN=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\"\n!

Emerson won the case, and Drinker's patents were declared invalid.\n\nThe United Kingdom's first iron lung was designed in 1934 by Robert Henderson, an Aberdeen doctor. Henderson had seen a demonstration of the Drinker respirator in the early 1930s, and built a device of his own upon his return to Scotland. Four weeks after its construction, the Henderson respirator was used to save the life of a 10-year-old boy from New Deer, Aberdeenshire, who was suffering from poliomyelitis. Despite this success, Henderson was reprimanded for secretly using hospital facilities to build the machine.<ref name=\"Wills\">{{cite book| last=Wills| first=Elspeth| title=Scottish Firsts: A Celebration of Innovation and Achievement| publisher=[[Mainstream Publishing]]| location=Edinburgh| year=2002| pages=[https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51 51\u20132]| isbn=978-1840186116| url-access=registration| url=https://archive.org/details/scottishfirstsce00will/page/51}}</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\">{{cite web| last=Thomas| first=Campbell| date=15 February 2000| url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/dr-robert-henderson-1.249085| title=Dr Robert Henderson | work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]| accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Both respirator==\n[[File:Both Cabinet Respirator in WWII.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Both cabinet respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943]]\n{{main|Both respirator}}\nThe [[Both respirator]], a negative pressure ventilator, was invented in 1937 when Australia's epidemic of poliomyelitis created an immediate need for more ventilating machines to compensate for respiratory paralysis. Although the Drinker model was effective and saved lives, its widespread use was hindered by the fact that the machines were very large, heavy (about 750 lbs), bulky, and expensive. In the US, an adult machine cost about $2000 in 1930, and \u00a32000 delivered to Melbourne in 1936. The cost in Europe in the mid-1950s was around \u00a31500.

Most patients with paralysis of the breathing muscles use modern [[mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] that push air into the airway with positive pressure. These are generally efficacious and have the advantage of not restricting patients' movements or caregivers' ability to examine the patients as significantly as an iron lung does. However, [[wikt:negative pressure|negative pressure]] ventilation is a truer approximation of normal physiological breathing and results in more normal distribution of air in the lungs. It may also be preferable in certain rare conditions, such as [[central hypoventilation syndrome]], in which failure of the medullary respiratory centers at the base of the brain results in patients having no [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic control]] of breathing.

Bach Mass in B Minor|1996}}\n\n#'''{{lang|la|Missa|italic=no}}'''\n#'''{{lang|la|Symbolum Nicenum|italic=no}}'''\n#'''{{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}}'''\n#{{lang|la|'''Osanna''', Benedictus, Agnus Dei et Dona nobis pacem|italic=no}}\n\nThe four sections of the manuscript are numbered, and Bach's usual closing formula (S.D.G = {{lang|la|[[Soli Deo Gloria]]|italic=no}}) is found at the end of the {{lang|la|Dona nobis pacem|italic=no}}.\n\nSome parts of the mass were used in Latin even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Leipzig, and Bach had composed them: five settings of the [[Missa (Bach)|Missa]], containing the {{lang|grc|[[Kyrie]]|italic=no}} and the {{lang|la|[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]|italic=no}}, and several additional individual settings of the {{lang|grc|Kyrie}} and the {{lang|la|[[Sanctus]]}}. To achieve the {{lang|la|[[Missa brevis|Missa tota]]|italic=no}}, a setting of the complete text of the mass, he combined his most elaborate Missa, the [[Bach's Missa of 1733|Missa in B minor, written in 1733]] for the court in [[Dresden]], and a {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} written for Christmas of 1724. He added a few new compositions, but mostly derived movements from [[List of Bach cantatas|cantata]] movements, in a technique known as [[Parody music|parody]].\n\nThe Mass is a [[compendium]] of many different styles in vocal composition, in both the \"[[Prima pratica|stile antico]]\" reminiscent of [[Renaissance music]] (even containing [[Gregorian chant]]) and the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] concertante style of his own time: [[fugal]] writing and dances, [[aria]]s and a movement for two four-part choirs. Similar to [[Baroque architecture|architecture of the period]], Bach achieved a symmetry of parts, with the profession of faith ({{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}) in the center and the {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} in its center. Bach scored the work for five vocal parts (two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], [[SATB|SSATB]]). While some choral movements are for only four parts, the {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} is scored for six voices (SSAATB), and the {{lang|la|Osanna|italic=no}} even for two four-part choirs. Bach called for a rich [[Baroque instruments|instrumentation]] of brass, woodwinds and strings, assigning varied [[obbligato]] parts to different instruments.\n\n== History and parody ==\n\nThe Mass was Bach's last major artistic undertaking. The reason for the composition is unknown.{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}} Scholars have found no plausible occasion for which the work may have been intended. Joshua Rifkin notes:\n<blockquote>... likely, Bach sought to create a paradigmatic example of vocal composition while at the same time contributing to the venerable musical genre of the Mass, still the most demanding and prestigious apart from opera.{{sfnp|Rifkin|2006}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Missa in B Minor (\"Kyrie\" and \"Gloria\" of the B Minor Mass) WDL11619.pdf|thumb|upright|Title page for the Missa for Dresden from 1733]]\nBach first composed [[Bach's Missa of 1733|a setting of the Kyrie and Gloria in 1733]] for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] royal court in Dresden. He presented that composition to [[Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony]] (later, as Augustus III, also king of Poland),{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}} accompanied by a letter:<blockquote>In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.{{sfnp|Talbeck|2002}}</blockquote> He arranged the text in diverse movements for a five-part choir and solo voices, according to the taste in Dresden where sacred music \"borrowed\" from Italian opera with a focus on choral movements, as [[Musicology|musicologist]] Arthur Wenk notes.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach 1746.jpg|thumb|upright| left|Johann Sebastian Bach towards the end of his life, by  [[Elias Gottlob Haussmann]], 1746|alt=portrait of Bach towards the end of his life, posing in a dark outfit with a wig, holding a single sheet of music in his right hand, facing the viewer with a serious expression]]\nBach expanded the Missa of 1733 to a {{lang|la|Missa tota|italic=no}} from 1748 to 1749, near the end of his life.{{sfnp|Rifkin|2006}}{{sfnp|Sherman|2004}}{{sfnp|Libbey|2009}} In these last years, he added three choral movements for the {{lang|de|Credo|italic=no}}: its opening {{lang|de|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|Confiteor|italic=no}} and Et incarnatus est. The Sanctus was originally an individual movement composed for Christmas 1724 in [[Leipzig]].{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}}\n\nMost other movements of the mass are [[Parody music|parodies]] of music from earlier [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s,{{sfnp|Libbey|2009}} dating back as far as 1714. Wenk points out that Bach often used parody to \"bring a composition to a higher level of perfection\".{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=6}} The original musical sources of several movements are known, for others they are lost but the score shows that they are copied and reworked. Bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and ''[[affekt]]''. For example, {{lang|la|Gratias agimus tibi|italic=no}} (We give you thanks) is based on {{lang|de|[[Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir, BWV 29|Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir]]}}{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} (We thank you, God, we thank you) and the {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} (Crucified) is based on the general lamenting about the situation of the faithful Christian, {{lang|de|[[Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12|Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen]]}}{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} (Weeping, lamenting, worrying, fearing) which Bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for the court of [[Weimar]].\n\nBach quoted Gregorian chant twice, in the {{lang|de|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}} as a [[Theme (music)|theme]] and in the {{lang|de|Confiteor|italic=no}} as a [[cantus firmus]] embedded in complex [[polyphony]].\n\n[[File:Friedrichsthalgotha.jpg|thumb|Schloss Friedrichsthal|alt=The symmetrical structure of Schloss Friedrichsthal, seen through the front gate to the property]]\nBach achieved a symmetry of the parts, with the profession of faith ({{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}) in the center and the movement {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} in its center. Markus Rathey, Associate Professor of Music History at the Institute of Sacred Music at the [[Yale School of Music]], sees a similarity to architecture of the period, such as the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Bach knew buildings in that style, for example {{ill|Schloss Friedrichsthal|de}} in Gotha, built in 1710.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|pp=2\u20134}} Rathey continues:\n<blockquote>The symmetry on earth mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose of art at this time\u2014in architecture, the visual arts, and music\u2014was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, and in this way to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=4}}</blockquote> The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.\n\nAccording to [[Christoph Wolff]], the Mass can be seen as a \"kind of specimen book of his finest compositions in every kind of style, from the stile antico of Palestrina in the 'Credo' and 'Confiteor' and the expressively free writing of the 'Crucifixus' and 'Agnus Dei', to the supreme counterpoint of the opening Kyrie as well as so many other choruses, right up to the most modern style in galant solos like 'Christe eleison' and 'Domine Deus'\".{{sfnp|Jenkins|2001|p=2}} Bach made \"a conscious effort to incorporate all styles that were available to him, to encompass all music history as far as it was accessible\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=78}} The Mass is a [[compendium]] of vocal sacred music, similar to other collections that Bach compiled during the last decade of his life, such as the [[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]], ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', the ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'', the [[Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes]] and ''[[The Musical Offering]]''.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=7}}\n\n== Overview ==\n\nGiven Bach's Lutheran background and the history of the composition, developed over several decades, he deviated from the typical structure of the mass in five parts, {{lang|grc|Kyrie|italic=no}}, {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}, {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} and {{lang|la|Agnus Dei|italic=no}}. He had composed the {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} in 1724, and the {{lang|la|Missa|italic=no}} (consisting of the {{lang|grc|Kyrie|italic=no}} and the {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}) in 1733. When he compiled the mass, he used these parts, added the {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}, including new compositions, and concluded with {{lang|la|[[Osanna]]|italic=no}}, which is normally part of the {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}}.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ Comparison of Bach's titles to the parts of the mass\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Five usual sections of the<br />[[Mass (music)#Ordinarium|Mass&nbsp;ordinary]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Mass in B&nbsp;minor sections\n! scope=\"col\" | Number of movements\n! scope=\"col\" | Year from\n! scope=\"col\" | Year to\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | I.&nbsp;{{lang|la|[[Kyrie]]|italic=no}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" | {{nowrap|I. {{lang|la|[[#No. 1 Missa|Missa]]|italic=no}} (consisting of {{lang|la|[[#Kyrie I|Kyrie]]|italic=no}}}}<br />and {{lang|la|[[#Gloria|Gloria]]|italic=no}})\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3 || 1733 || 1733 || symmetry, {{nowrap|central duet}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | II.&nbsp;{{lang|la|[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]]|italic=no}}\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9 || ? || 1733 || symmetry, {{nowrap|central duet}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | III.&nbsp;{{lang|la|[[Credo]]|italic=no}}\n!

Its movements are listed in a table with the scoring of [[Voice type|voice]]s and instruments, [[Key (music)|key]], [[Tempo|tempo marking]], [[time signature]] and source. The movement numbering follows the [[B\u00e4renreiter]] edition of the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]], first in a consecutive numbering ([[NBA (Bach)|NBA]] II), then in a numbering for the four individual parts (NBA I).\n\nThe voices are abbreviated S for [[soprano]], A for [[alto]], T for [[tenor]], B for [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]. Bach asked for two sopranos. Practical performances often have only one soprano soloist, sharing the parts for the second soprano (SII) between soprano and alto. A four-part choir is indicated by [[SATB]], a five-part choir by SSATB. The {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} requires six vocal parts, SSAATB, which are often divided in the three upper voices versus the lower voices. The {{lang|la|Osanna|italic=no}} requires two choirs SATB.\n\n[[Baroque instruments|Instruments in the orchestra]] are three [[trumpet]]s (Tr), [[timpani]] (Ti), [[Natural horn|corno da caccia]] (Co), two [[Flauto traverso|flauti traversi]] (Ft), two [[oboe]]s (Ob), two [[Oboe d'amore|oboes d'amore]] (Oa), two [[bassoon]]s (Fg), two [[violin]]s (Vl), [[viola]] (Va), and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]. The continuo is not mentioned in the table as it is present all the time. The other instruments are grouped by brass, woodwinds and strings. \n\nBach based movements of the Mass in B minor on earlier compositions. What is known about reworked earlier material is indicated in the last two columns of the table (earlier composition; year of composition), including some educated guesswork, as found in the indicated scholarly literature. This does not include the 1733 version of Part I (the movements that constitute the {{lang|la|Kyrie}} and {{lang|la|Gloria}}), but earlier compositions which Bach used as basis for that version.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Structure of ''Mass in B Minor'' by J.

As the Dresden Mass style required, it opens with a short [[Homophony|homophonic]] section,{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=5}} followed by an extended [[fugue]] in two sections, which both begin with an instrumental fugue.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=2\u201317}}\n\n[[File:Wilderer Bach BWV 232.svg|thumb|300px|Kyrie, ''Lento'', themes by Wilderer (top) and Bach]]\n[[Christoph Wolff]] notes a similarity between the fugue theme and one by [[Johann Hugo von Wilderer]], whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731.

In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}}\n\n==== Christe ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 2 Christe.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Christe]]\nThe acclamation of Christ stresses the second person of the [[Trinity]] and is therefore rendered as a duet of the two sopranos.{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=4}} Their lines are often parallel, in an analogy to Christ and God proclaimed as \"two in one\". Probably a parody of an earlier work, it is Bach's only extant duet for two sopranos, stressing that idea.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=18\u201325}} Rathey points out that the duet is similar in many aspects to the love duets of Neapolitan opera.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=6}} Typical features of these duets are consonant melodies, in parallel thirds and sixths, or imitating each other, with sigh motifs as on the word Christe.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|pp=10\u201311}} Rendering Christe eleison as a duet follows the Dresden Mass style.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=5}}\n\n==== Kyrie II ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 3 Kyrie.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Kyrie]]\nThe second acclamation of God is a four-part choral fugue, set in stile antico, with the instruments playing [[colla parte]].{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=4}} This style was preferred at the court in Dresden.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=4}} The theme begins with intervals such as [[minor second]]s and [[major second]]s, similar to the motif [[B-A-C-H]]. The first entrances build from the lowest voice in the sequence bass, tenor, alto, soprano.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=26\u201333}} According to Christoph Wolff, Bach assimilated the stricter style of the Renaissance only in the early 1730s, after he had composed most of his cantatas, and this movement is his first \"significant product\" in the style.{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=78}}\n\n==== Gloria ====\n\nThe {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}} is structured in nine movements. The first and last are similar in style, concertante music of the eighteenth century.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}} In further symmetry, the opening in two different tempos corresponds to the final sequence of an aria leading to \"{{lang|la|Cum sancto spiritu|italic=no}}\", the soprano II solo with obbligato violin \"{{lang|la|Laudamus te|italic=no}}\" to the alto solo with obbligato oboe \"{{lang|la|Qui sedes|italic=no}}\", and the choral movements \"{{lang|la|Gratias|italic=no}}\" frame the central duet of soprano I and tenor \"{{lang|la|Domine Deus|italic=no}}\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=93}}\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 4 Gloria.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Gloria]]\nThe text of the {{lang|la|''Hymnus'' Gloria|italic=unset}} begins with the angels' song from [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]]'s Christmas story. Bach used this section, the central duet and the concluding [[doxology]] as a [[Christmas cantata]], {{lang|la|[[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]]|italic=unset}} (Glory to God in the Highest), probably in 1745, a few years before the compilation of the Mass. The opening is set as a five-part chorus, beginning with an instrumental presentation of the material.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}} In great contrast to the first section {{lang|grc|Kyrie|italic=no}}, it is in D major, introducing the trumpets and timpani.{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} The first thought, \"{{lang|la|Gloria in excelsis Deo|italic=no}}\" (Glory to God in the Highest), is set in 3/8 time, compared by Wenk to the [[Gigue|Giga]], a dance form.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n\n==== Et in terra pax ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 5 terra pax.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et in terra pax]]\nThe continuation of the thought within the angels' song, \"{{lang|la|Et in terra pax|italic=no}}\" (and peace on earth), is in common time. The duration of an eighth note stays the same, Bach thus achieves a contrast of \"heavenly\" three eights, a symbol of the Trinity, and \"earthly\" four quarters.{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=5}} The voices start this section,{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}} and the trumpets are silent for its beginning, but return for its conclusion.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=34\u201352}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Laudamus te ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 6 Laudamus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Laudamus te]]\nAn aria for soprano II and [[obbligato]] violin express the praise and adoration of God in vivid [[coloratura]]s.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=53\u201358}} It has been argued that Bach might have thought of the Dresden taste and the specific voice of [[Faustina Bordoni]].{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Gratias agimus tibi ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 7 Gratias.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Gratias agimus tibi]]\nA four-part chorus in stile antico illustrates the idea of thanks and praise, again with trumpets and timpani. It is based on the first choral movement of {{lang|de|[[Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir, BWV 29|''Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir'', BWV 29]]|italic=unset}},{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation (but this cantata movement may have been derived from an even earlier source<ref>[http://allofbach.com/en/bwv/bwv-29/ Cantata BWV 29 (allofbach.com)]</ref>). The first part of the text, devoted to thanks, is a melody in even tempo that rises gradually and falls again. The voices enter without instrumental support in dense succession. The [[countersubject]] on the second line \"propter magnam gloriam tuam\" (for your great glory), devoted to the glory of God, is more complex in rhythm. Similarly, in the cantata the second line \"und verk\u00fcndigen deine Wunder\" (and proclaim your wonders) leads to a more vivid countersubject.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=11}} Towards the end of the movement, the trumpets take part in the [[polyphony]] of the dense movement.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=59\u201365}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Domine Deus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 8 Domine Deus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Domine Deus]]\nThe section addressing God as Father and Son is again a duet, this time of soprano I and tenor. The voices are often in canon and in parallel, as in the ''[[#Christe|Christe]]''.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=66\u201375}} The movement is likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata [[Ihr H\u00e4user des Himmels, BWV 193a|''Ihr H\u00e4user des Himmels'', BWV 193a]]. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear as the center of the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=10}}\n\nRathey points out, that the scoring at first glance does not seem to match the text \"Domine Deus, Rex coelestis\" (Lord God, Heavenly King), but it matches the continuation \"Domine Deus, Agnus Dei\" (Lord God, Lamb of God), stressing the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] \"theologia crucis\" (theology of the cross) that the omnipotent God is the same as the one revealed on the cross.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=11}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Qui tollis ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 9 Qui tollis.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Qui tollis]]\n[[File:Parodie.png|thumb|300px|alt=two lines of musical notation in comparison|The beginning of the first vocal entry in the cantata movement and the beginning of {{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Qui tollis|Qui tollis peccata mundi]]|italic=no}} in the mass]]\nWhen the text reaches the phase \"{{lang|la|Qui tollis peccata mundi|italic=no}}\" (who takest away the sins of the world), the music is given [[attacca]] to a four-part choir with two obbligato flutes.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=75\u201381}} The movement is based on the first choral movement of {{lang|de|[[Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei, BWV 46|''Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei'', BWV 46]]|italic=unset}}.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} The cantata text was based on the [[Book of Lamentations]], {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Lamentations|chapter=1|verse=12}}, a similar expression of grief.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=11}} Bach changed the key and the rhythm because of the different text.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} The key of B minor connects this description of \"Christ's suffering and mankind's plea for mercy\" to the similar quest in the first Kyrie. The keys G \u2013 B \u2013 D form the G major triad, leading to the \"home key\" of the Gloria, D major.{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=93}} Bach uses only part of the cantata movement, without the instrumental introduction and the second part.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=18}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Qui sedes ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 10 Qui sedes.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Qui sedes]]\nThe continuation of the thought, \"{{lang|la|Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris|italic=no}}\" (who sits at the right [hand] of the Father), is expressed by an aria for alto and obbligato oboe d'amore.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=82\u201386}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} It is probably a parody. In Bach's earlier settings of the mass he had treated \"Qui tollis and \"Qui sedes\" as one movement, here he distinguished Jesus at the right hand of the father by dance-like music.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=11}} Wenk likens it to a gigue.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Quoniam tu solus sanctus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 11 Quoniam.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Quoniam tu solus sanctus]]\nThe last section begins with an aria for bass, showing \"{{lang|la|Quoniam tu solus sanctus|italic=no}}\" (For you alone are holy) in an unusual scoring of only corno da caccia and two bassoons.{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} Paczkowski points out the symbolic function of this corno da caccia as well as the polonaise.{{sfnp|Paczkowski|2013|p=82}} By using the polonaise, Bach not only expressed the text by musical means, but also paid respect to the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, August III, to whom the Mass is dedicated. Probably a parody, it is the only movement in the work using the horn.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=87\u201394}}{{sfnp|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} The unusual scoring provides a \"solemn character\".{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=12}} Butt observes that Bach uses a rhythmic pattern throughout the movement in the two bassoons which is even extended into the following movement, although they originally were independent. The repeated figure of an [[anapaest]] provides the \"rhythmic energy of the texture.\"{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=86}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Cum sancto spiritu ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 12 Cum Sancto.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Cum sancto spiritu]]\nOn the continuing text \"{{lang|la|Cum sancto spiritu|italic=no}}\" (with the Holy Spirit), the choir enters in five parts, in symmetry to the beginning. A homophonic section is followed by a fugue.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=95\u2013114}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} The concertante music corresponds in symmetry to the opening of the Gloria, both praising God.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=12}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== No. 2 Symbolum Nicenum ===\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Credo Architektur.svg|thumb|300px|Architecture of the {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}]]\n[[File:Bwv232-credo.jpg|thumb|Autograph of the first page of {{lang|la|[[Nicene Creed|Symbolum&nbsp;Nicenum]]|italic=no}}]]\nThe text of the profession of faith, '''{{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}''', is the [[Nicene Creed]]. It is structured in three sections, regarding Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Bach follows the structure, devoting two choral movements to the first section, beginning the second section with a duet, followed by three choral movements, and opening the third with an aria, followed by two choral movements. The center is the {{lang|grc|Crucifixus|italic=no}}, set in E&nbsp;minor, the lowest key of the part. The {{lang|grc|Crucifixus|italic=no}} is also the oldest music in the Mass, dating back to 1714.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}} The part begins and ends with a sequence of two connected choral movements in contrasting style, a motet in ''stile antico'', containing a chant melody, and a concerto. The chant melodies are devoted to two of the key words of this part: Credo (I believe) and Confiteor (I confess).{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=14}}\n\n==== Credo in unum Deum ====\n\nThe Credo begins with \"{{lang|la|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}}\" (I believe in one God), a polyphonic movement for five-part choir, to which two obbligato violins add independent parts. The theme is a [[Gregorian Chant]],{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=7}} first presented by the tenor in long notes on a [[walking bass]] of the continuo. The other voices enter in the sequence bass, alto, soprano I, soprano II, each one before the former one even finishes its line. The two violins enter independently, reaching a seven-part fugue.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=115\u2013120}} The complex counterpoint of the seven parts, five voices and two violins, expands the theme of the chant, often in [[stretto]] function, and uses a variety of countersubjects. In the second [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] (sequence of fugue entries), the bass voice is missing, leading to anticipation and a climactic entry in [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (long notes) beginning the third exposition, just as an entry of the first violin ends the second exposition. Musicologist John Butt summarizes: \"By using numerous stile antico devices in a particular order and combination, Bach has created a movement in which a standardised structure breeds a new momentum of its own\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThis movement in stile antico contrasts with the following modern concerto-style movement, {{lang|la|Patrem omnipotentem|italic=no}}. This contrast is reminiscent of the contrast between the two Kyrie movements and foreshadows the last two movements of the Symbolum Nicenum. Recent research dates the movement to 1747 or 1748 and suggests that it might have been the introduction to a Credo by a different composer, before Bach began to assemble the Mass.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==== Patrem omnipotentem ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 14 Patrem omnipotentem.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Patrem omnipotentem]]\nThe thought is continued in \"{{lang|la|Patrem omnipotentem|italic=no}}\" (to the Father, almighty), in a four-part choral movement with trumpets.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=121\u2013130}} The movement probably shares its original source with the opening chorus of {{lang|de|[[Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm, BWV 171|''Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm'', BWV 171]]|italic=unset}} (God, as Your name is, so is also Your praise),{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=14}} The voices sing a fugue to a concerto of the orchestra. The bass introduces the theme, without an instrumental opening, while the other voices repeat simultaneously in homophony \"{{lang|la|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}}\" as a firm statement. The theme contains all eight notes of the scale, as a symbol completeness.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}} Bach noted at the end of the movement that it contains 84 measures, the multiplication of 7 and 12, a hint at the symbolic meaning of numbers. The word \"{{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}\" appears 49 times (7*7), the words \"{{lang|la|Patrem omnipotentem|italic=no}}\" 84 times.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Et in unum Dominum ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 15 Et in unum.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et in unum Dominum]]\n[[File:BWV 232 Et in unum.svg|thumb|250px|''Et in unum Domium'': different articulation of the instruments, canon of the voices]]\nThe belief in Jesus Christ begins with \"{{lang|la|Et in unum Dominum|italic=no}}\" (And in one Lord), another duet, this time of soprano and alto, beginning in a canon where the second voice follows the first after only one beat. The instruments often play the same line with different articulation.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=131\u2013138}} The movement is based on a lost duet which served already in 1733 as the basis for a movement of [[La\u00dft uns sorgen, la\u00dft uns wachen, BWV 213|''La\u00dft uns sorgen, la\u00dft uns wachen'', BWV 213]]. Bach headed the movement \"{{lang|la|Duo voces articuli 2|italic=no}}\" which can be translated as \"Two voices express 2\" or \"the two vocal parts of Article 2\". The text included originally the line \"{{lang|la|Et incarnatus est de Spiritu sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est|italic=no}}\", illustrating \"{{lang|la|descendit|italic=no}}\" by a descending figure for the violins. When Bach treated \"{{lang|la|Et incarnatus est|italic=no}}\" as a separate choral movement, he rearranged the text, and the figure lost its \"pictorial association\".{{sfnp|Jenkins|2001|p=3}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Et incarnatus est ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 16 Et incarnatus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et incarnatus est]]\n[[File:BWV 232 Incarnatus Grafik.jpg|thumb|300px|Autograph of the beginning]]\nThe virgin birth, \"{{lang|la|Et incarnatus est|italic=no}}\" (And was incarnate), is a five-part movement. It is probably Bach's last vocal composition, dating from the end of 1749 or the first weeks of 1750.{{sfnp|Wolff|2009}} Until then, the text had been included in the preceding duet. The late separate setting of the words which had been given special attention by previous composers of the mass, established the symmetry of the {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}. The humiliation of God, born as man, is illustrated by the violins in a pattern of one measure that descends and then combines the symbol of the [[Cross (Christianity)|cross]] and sighing motifs, alluding to the crucifixion.\nThe voices sing a [[Motif (music)|motif]] of descending triads. They enter in imitation starting in measure 4, one voice every measure in the sequence alto, soprano II, soprano I, tenor, bass, forming a rich texture. The text \"{{lang|la|ex Maria vergine|italic=no}}\" (out of the virgin Mary) appears in an upward movement, \"et homo factus est\" (and made man) is even in upward triads.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=139\u2013142}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Crucifixus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 17 Crucifixus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Crucifixus]]\n[[File:Bach's Crucifixus B Minor Mass ground bass.png|thumb|300px|''[[Passus duriusculus]]'' in the ground bass]]\n\"{{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}}\" (Crucified), the center of the Credo part, is the oldest music in the setting of the Mass, dating back to 1714.

Speaking about the third person of the Trinity, the number three appears in many aspects: the aria is in three sections, in a triple 6/8-time, in A major, a key with three sharps, in German \"Kreuz\" (cross). A major is the dominant key to D major, the main key of the part, symbolising superiority, in contrast to the E minor of the \"{{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}}\" as the lowest point of the architecture. The two oboes d'amore open the movement with a ritornello, with an ondulating theme played in parallels, which is later picked up by the voice. The ritornello is played between the three sections, the second time shortened, and it concludes the movement. The sections cover first the Holy Spirit, then his adoration with the Father and the Son, finally how he acted through the prophets and the church. The voice sings in highest register for the words \"{{lang|la|Et unam sanctam catholicam&nbsp;... ecclesiam|italic=no}}\" (and one holy universal&nbsp;... church), and expands in a repeat of the text in long coloraturas the words \"{{lang|la|catholicam|italic=no}}\" and \"{{lang|la|ecclesiam|italic=no}}\".{{sfn|Baxter|2013|p=5}} Wenk likens the movement to a [[Pastorale]], a \"Christmas dance\", often on a [[Drone (music)|drone]] bass.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Confiteor ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 20 Confiteor.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Confiteor]]\nThe belief in the baptism for the forgiveness of sins, \"{{lang|la|Confiteor|italic=no}}\" (I confess), is expressed in strict counterpoint, which incorporates a [[cantus firmus]] in [[plainchant]].{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=170\u2013180}} The five-part choir is accompanied only by the continuo as a walking bass.

The voices follow each other in fast succession, only one or two measures apart. The two themes appear in complex combinations, until the cantus firmus is heard from measure 73 as a [[Canon (music)|canon]] in the bass and alto, and then in augmentation (long notes) from measure 92 in the tenor. {{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} Then the movement slows down to Adagio (a written tempo change, rare in Bach), as the altos sing the word \"peccatorum\" (sinners) one last time in an extremely low range. As the text turns to the words \"{{lang|la|Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum|italic=no}}\" (and expect the resurrection of the dead), the slow music modulates daringly with [[enharmonic]] transformations through several keys,{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=8}} touching E-flat major and G-sharp major, vividly bringing a sense of dissolving into disorder as well as expectation before the resurrection to come.

The movement is based on a choral movement dating from about 1729 which is used in {{lang|de|[[Gott, man lobet dich in der Stille, BWV 120|''Gott, man lobet dich in der Stille'', BWV 120]]|italic=unset}} and a related wedding cantata [[BWV 120a]]. In BWV 120 it sets the words {{lang|de|Jauchzet, ihr erfreuten Stimmen}} (Exult, you delighted voices).{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} After this statement, which ends in homophony, the instruments begin a short section in which runs in rising sequences alternate with the fanfare, in which the voices are later embedded. The word \"resurrectionem\" appears then in the runs in the voices, one after the other in cumulation. A second repetition of instruments, embedded voices and upward runs brings the whole section to a jubilant close on the words \"{{lang|la|et vitam venturi saeculi. Amen|italic=no}}\" (and the life of the world to come. Amen), with extended runs on \"Amen\".{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=182\u2013191}} Wenk likens the movement to a [[bourr\u00e9e]], a dance in \"quick duple meter with an upbeat\".{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== No. 3 Sanctus ===\n\n==== Sanctus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 22 Sanctus.svg|thumb|300px|{{lang|la|Incipit of Sanctus}}]]\n{{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} (Holy) is an independent movement written for Christmas 1724, scored for six voices SSAATB and a festive orchestra with trumpets and three oboes.{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}}{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=192\u2013199}} In the original, Bach had asked for three soprano parts, alto, tenor and bass. Only the score and duplicate parts of this performance survived.{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}} The music in D major is in common time, but dominated by [[Triplet (music)|triplet]]s. The three upper voices sing frequently alternating with the three lower voices, reminiscent of a passage by Isaiah about the angels singing \"Holy, holy, holy\" to each other ({{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Isaiah|chapter=6|verse=2|range=3}}). The number of voices may relate to the six wings of the [[seraphim]] described in that passage.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=15}}\n\n==== Pleni sunt coeli ====\n\nThe continuation, \"{{lang|la|Pleni sunt coeli|italic=no}}\" (Full are the heavens), follows immediately, written for the same scoring, as a fugue in dancing 3/8 time with \"quick runs\".{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=199\u2013209}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}}\n\n=== No. 4 Osanna, Benedictus, Agnus Dei et Dona nobis pacem ===\n\n==== Osanna in excelsis ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 24 Osanna.svg|thumb|300px|{{lang|la|Incipit of Osanna}}]]\n{{lang|la|Osanna in excelsis|italic=no}} (Osanna in the Highest) is set for two choirs and a festive orchestra, in the same key and time as the previous movement.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=210\u2013229}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} The movement is based, as is the opening chorus of the secular cantata {{lang|de|[[Preise dein Gl\u00fccke, gesegnetes Sachsen, BWV 215|''Preise dein Gl\u00fccke, gesegnetes Sachsen'', BWV 215]]|italic=unset}},{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} probably on the opening movement of the secular cantata [[Es lebe der K\u00f6nig, der Vater im Lande, BWV Anh 11|''Es lebe der K\u00f6nig, der Vater im Lande'', BWV Anh 11]], of 1732.{{sfnp|D\u00fcrr|1981|p=670}} The movement contrasts homophonic sections with fugal development.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=88}} Wenk likens the movement to the [[Passepied]], a dance in \"fast triple meter with an upbeat\".{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Benedictus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 25 Benedictus.svg|thumb|300px|{{lang|la|Incipit of Benedictus|italic=no}}]]\nThe following thought, {{lang|la|Benedictus|italic=no}}, \"blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\", is sung by the tenor in an aria with an obbligato instrument, probably a flauto traverso,{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} leading to a repeat of the Osanna.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=230\u2013233}} The intimate music contrasts with the Osanna like the {{lang|grc|Christe eleison|italic=no}} with {{lang|grc|Kyrie eleison|italic=no}}.

Bach Mass in B Minor|1996}}\n\n#'''{{lang|la|Missa|italic=no}}'''\n#'''{{lang|la|Symbolum Nicenum|italic=no}}'''\n#'''{{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}}'''\n#{{lang|la|'''Osanna''', Benedictus, Agnus Dei et Dona nobis pacem|italic=no}}\n\nThe four sections of the manuscript are numbered, and Bach's usual closing formula (S.D.G = {{lang|la|[[Soli Deo Gloria]]|italic=no}}) is found at the end of the {{lang|la|Dona nobis pacem|italic=no}}.\n\nSome parts of the mass were used in Latin even in [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Leipzig, and Bach had composed them: five settings of the [[Missa (Bach)|Missa]], containing the {{lang|grc|[[Kyrie]]|italic=no}} and the {{lang|la|[[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]]|italic=no}}, and several additional individual settings of the {{lang|grc|Kyrie}} and the {{lang|la|[[Sanctus]]}}. To achieve the {{lang|la|[[Missa brevis|Missa tota]]|italic=no}}, a setting of the complete text of the mass, he combined his most elaborate Missa, the [[Bach's Missa of 1733|Missa in B minor, written in 1733]] for the court in [[Dresden]], and a {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} written for Christmas of 1724. He added a few new compositions, but mostly derived movements from [[List of Bach cantatas|cantata]] movements, in a technique known as [[Parody music|parody]].\n\nThe Mass is a [[compendium]] of many different styles in vocal composition, in both the \"[[Prima pratica|stile antico]]\" reminiscent of [[Renaissance music]] (even containing [[Gregorian chant]]) and the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] concertante style of his own time: [[fugal]] writing and dances, [[aria]]s and a movement for two four-part choirs. Similar to [[Baroque architecture|architecture of the period]], Bach achieved a symmetry of parts, with the profession of faith ({{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}) in the center and the {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} in its center. Bach scored the work for five vocal parts (two [[soprano]]s, [[alto]], [[tenor]] and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], [[SATB|SSATB]]). While some choral movements are for only four parts, the {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} is scored for six voices (SSAATB), and the {{lang|la|Osanna|italic=no}} even for two four-part choirs. Bach called for a rich [[Baroque instruments|instrumentation]] of brass, woodwinds and strings, assigning varied [[obbligato]] parts to different instruments.\n\n== History and parody ==\n\nThe Mass was Bach's last major artistic undertaking. The reason for the composition is unknown.{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}} Scholars have found no plausible occasion for which the work may have been intended. Joshua Rifkin notes:\n<blockquote>... likely, Bach sought to create a paradigmatic example of vocal composition while at the same time contributing to the venerable musical genre of the Mass, still the most demanding and prestigious apart from opera.{{sfnp|Rifkin|2006}}</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Missa in B Minor (\"Kyrie\" and \"Gloria\" of the B Minor Mass) WDL11619.pdf|thumb|upright|Title page for the Missa for Dresden from 1733]]\nBach first composed [[Bach's Missa of 1733|a setting of the Kyrie and Gloria in 1733]] for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] royal court in Dresden. He presented that composition to [[Frederick Augustus II, Elector of Saxony]] (later, as Augustus III, also king of Poland),{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}} accompanied by a letter:<blockquote>In deepest Devotion I present to your Royal Highness this small product of that science which I have attained in Musique, with the most humble request that you will deign to regard it not according to the imperfection of its Composition, but with a most gracious eye&nbsp;... and thus take me into your most mighty Protection.{{sfnp|Talbeck|2002}}</blockquote> He arranged the text in diverse movements for a five-part choir and solo voices, according to the taste in Dresden where sacred music \"borrowed\" from Italian opera with a focus on choral movements, as [[Musicology|musicologist]] Arthur Wenk notes.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Johann Sebastian Bach 1746.jpg|thumb|upright| left|Johann Sebastian Bach towards the end of his life, by  [[Elias Gottlob Haussmann]], 1746|alt=portrait of Bach towards the end of his life, posing in a dark outfit with a wig, holding a single sheet of music in his right hand, facing the viewer with a serious expression]]\nBach expanded the Missa of 1733 to a {{lang|la|Missa tota|italic=no}} from 1748 to 1749, near the end of his life.{{sfnp|Rifkin|2006}}{{sfnp|Sherman|2004}}{{sfnp|Libbey|2009}} In these last years, he added three choral movements for the {{lang|de|Credo|italic=no}}: its opening {{lang|de|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}}, {{lang|de|Confiteor|italic=no}} and Et incarnatus est. The Sanctus was originally an individual movement composed for Christmas 1724 in [[Leipzig]].{{sfnp|Wolf|2011}}\n\nMost other movements of the mass are [[Parody music|parodies]] of music from earlier [[Bach cantata|cantata]]s,{{sfnp|Libbey|2009}} dating back as far as 1714. Wenk points out that Bach often used parody to \"bring a composition to a higher level of perfection\".{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=6}} The original musical sources of several movements are known, for others they are lost but the score shows that they are copied and reworked. Bach selected movements that carried a similar expression and ''[[affekt]]''. For example, {{lang|la|Gratias agimus tibi|italic=no}} (We give you thanks) is based on {{lang|de|[[Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir, BWV 29|Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken dir]]}}{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} (We thank you, God, we thank you) and the {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} (Crucified) is based on the general lamenting about the situation of the faithful Christian, {{lang|de|[[Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen, BWV 12|Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen]]}}{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} (Weeping, lamenting, worrying, fearing) which Bach had composed already in 1714 as one of his first cantatas for the court of [[Weimar]].\n\nBach quoted Gregorian chant twice, in the {{lang|de|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}} as a [[Theme (music)|theme]] and in the {{lang|de|Confiteor|italic=no}} as a [[cantus firmus]] embedded in complex [[polyphony]].\n\n[[File:Friedrichsthalgotha.jpg|thumb|Schloss Friedrichsthal|alt=The symmetrical structure of Schloss Friedrichsthal, seen through the front gate to the property]]\nBach achieved a symmetry of the parts, with the profession of faith ({{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}) in the center and the movement {{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}} in its center. Markus Rathey, Associate Professor of Music History at the Institute of Sacred Music at the [[Yale School of Music]], sees a similarity to architecture of the period, such as the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Bach knew buildings in that style, for example {{ill|Schloss Friedrichsthal|de}} in Gotha, built in 1710.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|pp=2\u20134}} Rathey continues:\n<blockquote>The symmetry on earth mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose of art at this time\u2014in architecture, the visual arts, and music\u2014was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, and in this way to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=4}}</blockquote> The parts Kyrie, Gloria and Credo are all designed with choral sections as the outer movements, framing an intimate center of theological significance.\n\nAccording to [[Christoph Wolff]], the Mass can be seen as a \"kind of specimen book of his finest compositions in every kind of style, from the stile antico of Palestrina in the 'Credo' and 'Confiteor' and the expressively free writing of the 'Crucifixus' and 'Agnus Dei', to the supreme counterpoint of the opening Kyrie as well as so many other choruses, right up to the most modern style in galant solos like 'Christe eleison' and 'Domine Deus'\".{{sfnp|Jenkins|2001|p=2}} Bach made \"a conscious effort to incorporate all styles that were available to him, to encompass all music history as far as it was accessible\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=78}} The Mass is a [[compendium]] of vocal sacred music, similar to other collections that Bach compiled during the last decade of his life, such as the [[Clavier-\u00dcbung III]], ''[[The Art of Fugue]]'', the ''[[Goldberg Variations]]'', the [[Great Eighteen Chorale Preludes]] and ''[[The Musical Offering]]''.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=7}}\n\n== Overview ==\n\nGiven Bach's Lutheran background and the history of the composition, developed over several decades, he deviated from the typical structure of the mass in five parts, {{lang|grc|Kyrie|italic=no}}, {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}, {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}, {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} and {{lang|la|Agnus Dei|italic=no}}. He had composed the {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} in 1724, and the {{lang|la|Missa|italic=no}} (consisting of the {{lang|grc|Kyrie|italic=no}} and the {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}}) in 1733. When he compiled the mass, he used these parts, added the {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}, including new compositions, and concluded with {{lang|la|[[Osanna]]|italic=no}}, which is normally part of the {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}}.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n|+ Comparison of Bach's titles to the parts of the mass\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Five usual sections of the<br />[[Mass (music)#Ordinarium|Mass&nbsp;ordinary]]\n! scope=\"col\" | Mass in B&nbsp;minor sections\n! scope=\"col\" | Number of movements\n! scope=\"col\" | Year from\n! scope=\"col\" | Year to\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | I.&nbsp;{{lang|la|[[Kyrie]]|italic=no}}\n! rowspan=\"2\" | I.&nbsp;{{nowrap|[[#No. 1 Missa|Missa]] (consisting of {{lang|la|[[#Kyrie I|Kyrie]]|italic=no}}}}<br />and {{lang|la|[[#Gloria|Gloria]]|italic=no}})\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 3 || 1733 || 1733 || symmetry, {{nowrap|central duet}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | II.&nbsp;{{lang|la|[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloria]]|italic=no}}\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | 9 || ? || 1733 || symmetry, {{nowrap|central duet}}\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | III.&nbsp;{{lang|la|[[Credo]]|italic=no}}\n!

Its movements are listed in a table with the scoring of [[Voice type|voice]]s and instruments, [[Key (music)|key]], [[Tempo|tempo marking]], [[time signature]] and source. The movement numbering follows the [[B\u00e4renreiter]] edition of the [[Neue Bach-Ausgabe]], first in a consecutive numbering ([[NBA (Bach)|NBA]] II), then in a numbering for the four individual parts (NBA I).\n\nThe voices are abbreviated S for [[soprano]], A for [[alto]], T for [[tenor]], B for [[Bass (voice type)|bass]]. Bach asked for two sopranos. Practical performances often have only one soprano soloist, sharing the parts for the second soprano (SII) between soprano and alto. A four-part choir is indicated by [[SATB]], a five-part choir by SSATB. The {{lang|la|Sanctus|italic=no}} requires six vocal parts, SSAATB, which are often divided in the three upper voices versus the lower voices. The {{lang|la|Osanna|italic=no}} requires two choirs SATB.\n\n[[Baroque instruments|Instruments in the orchestra]] are three [[trumpet]]s (Tr), [[timpani]] (Ti), [[Natural horn|corno da caccia]] (Co), two [[Flauto traverso|flauti traversi]] (Ft), two [[oboe]]s (Ob), two [[Oboe d'amore|oboes d'amore]] (Oa), two [[bassoon]]s (Fg), two [[violin]]s (Vl), [[viola]] (Va), and [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]]. The continuo is not mentioned in the table as it is present all the time. The other instruments are grouped by brass, woodwinds and strings. \n\nBach based movements of the Mass in B minor on earlier compositions. What is known about reworked earlier material is indicated in the last two columns of the table (earlier composition; year of composition), including some educated guesswork, as found in the indicated scholarly literature. This does not include the 1733 version of Part I (the movements that constitute the {{lang|la|Kyrie}} and {{lang|la|Gloria}}), but earlier compositions which Bach used as basis for that version.\n\n== Structure ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|+ Structure of ''Mass in B Minor'' by J.

The three notes B, D and F-sharp form the B minor [[Triad (music)|triad]]. Butt notes D major as the central key, corresponding to the \"atonement of Christ\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=93}}\n\nThe {{lang|la|Gloria}} is structured in symmetry as a sequence of choral movements and solo movements, arias and a central duet, in three sections. The first is opened with a chorus followed by an aria, closed in the last section in symmetry by an aria followed with a chorus; the middle section alternates choral music with solo movements.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}} The trumpets are introduced as a symbol of divine glory in several movements, beginning and ending in D major, with a planned architecture of keys in the middle movements. The central duet is in the \"lowly\" key of G major, referring to Christ as a \"human incarnation of God\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=93}} A [[corno da caccia]] appears only once in the whole work, in the movement {{lang|la|Quoniam|italic=no}}, which is about the holiness of God.\n\n==== Kyrie I ====\n\nThe first movement is scored for five-part choir, woodwinds and strings. As the Dresden Mass style required, it opens with a short [[Homophony|homophonic]] section,{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=5}} followed by an extended [[fugue]] in two sections, which both begin with an instrumental fugue.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=2\u201317}}\n\n[[File:Wilderer Bach BWV 232.svg|thumb|300px|Kyrie, ''Lento'', themes by Wilderer (top) and Bach]]\n[[Christoph Wolff]] notes a similarity between the fugue theme and one by [[Johann Hugo von Wilderer]], whose mass Bach had probably copied and performed in Leipzig before 1731. Wilderer's mass also has a slow introduction, a duet as the second movement and a [[motet]] in [[Prima pratica|stile antico]], similar to late [[Renaissance music]],{{sfnp|Talbeck|2002}} as the third movement.{{sfnp|Wolff|1967}} Bach based the work on a composition in [[C minor]], as mistakes in the copying process show.{{sfnp|Wolff|1967}}\n\nThe vast movement has aspects of both a fugue and a ritornello movement.{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=77}} In the first fugal section, the voices enter in the sequence tenor, alto, soprano I, soprano II, bass, expanding from middle range to the extreme parts, just as the theme expands from the repeated first notes to sighing motives leading upwards. In the second fugal section, the instruments begin in low registers, and the voices build, with every part first in extremely low range, from bass to soprano I. In both sections, the instruments open the fugue, but play with the voices once they enter.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}}\n\n==== Christe ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 2 Christe.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Christe]]\nThe acclamation of Christ stresses the second person of the [[Trinity]] and is therefore rendered as a duet of the two sopranos.{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=4}} Their lines are often parallel, in an analogy to Christ and God proclaimed as \"two in one\". Probably a parody of an earlier work, it is Bach's only extant duet for two sopranos, stressing that idea.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=18\u201325}} Rathey points out that the duet is similar in many aspects to the love duets of Neapolitan opera.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=6}} Typical features of these duets are consonant melodies, in parallel thirds and sixths, or imitating each other, with sigh motifs as on the word Christe.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|pp=10\u201311}} Rendering Christe eleison as a duet follows the Dresden Mass style.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=5}}\n\n==== Kyrie II ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 3 Kyrie.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Kyrie]]\nThe second acclamation of God is a four-part choral fugue, set in stile antico, with the instruments playing [[colla parte]].{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=4}} This style was preferred at the court in Dresden.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=4}} The theme begins with intervals such as [[minor second]]s and [[major second]]s, similar to the motif [[B-A-C-H]]. The first entrances build from the lowest voice in the sequence bass, tenor, alto, soprano.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=26\u201333}} According to Christoph Wolff, Bach assimilated the stricter style of the Renaissance only in the early 1730s, after he had composed most of his cantatas, and this movement is his first \"significant product\" in the style.{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=78}}\n\n==== Gloria ====\n\nThe {{lang|la|Gloria|italic=no}} is structured in nine movements. The first and last are similar in style, concertante music of the eighteenth century.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}} In further symmetry, the opening in two different tempos corresponds to the final sequence of an aria leading to \"{{lang|la|Cum sancto spiritu|italic=no}}\", the soprano II solo with obbligato violin \"{{lang|la|Laudamus te|italic=no}}\" to the alto solo with obbligato oboe \"{{lang|la|Qui sedes|italic=no}}\", and the choral movements \"{{lang|la|Gratias|italic=no}}\" frame the central duet of soprano I and tenor \"{{lang|la|Domine Deus|italic=no}}\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=93}}\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 4 Gloria.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Gloria]]\nThe text of the {{lang|la|''Hymnus'' Gloria|italic=unset}} begins with the angels' song from [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]]'s Christmas story. Bach used this section, the central duet and the concluding [[doxology]] as a [[Christmas cantata]], {{lang|la|[[Gloria in excelsis Deo, BWV 191|''Gloria in excelsis Deo'', BWV 191]]|italic=unset}} (Glory to God in the Highest), probably in 1745, a few years before the compilation of the Mass. The opening is set as a five-part chorus, beginning with an instrumental presentation of the material.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}} In great contrast to the first section {{lang|grc|Kyrie|italic=no}}, it is in D major, introducing the trumpets and timpani.{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} The first thought, \"{{lang|la|Gloria in excelsis Deo|italic=no}}\" (Glory to God in the Highest), is set in 3/8 time, compared by Wenk to the [[Gigue|Giga]], a dance form.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n\n==== Et in terra pax ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 5 terra pax.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et in terra pax]]\nThe continuation of the thought within the angels' song, \"{{lang|la|Et in terra pax|italic=no}}\" (and peace on earth), is in common time. The duration of an eighth note stays the same, Bach thus achieves a contrast of \"heavenly\" three eights, a symbol of the Trinity, and \"earthly\" four quarters.{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=5}} The voices start this section,{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}} and the trumpets are silent for its beginning, but return for its conclusion.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=34\u201352}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Laudamus te ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 6 Laudamus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Laudamus te]]\nAn aria for soprano II and [[obbligato]] violin express the praise and adoration of God in vivid [[coloratura]]s.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=53\u201358}} It has been argued that Bach might have thought of the Dresden taste and the specific voice of [[Faustina Bordoni]].{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=8}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Gratias agimus tibi ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 7 Gratias.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Gratias agimus tibi]]\nA four-part chorus in stile antico illustrates the idea of thanks and praise, again with trumpets and timpani.

The first part of the text, devoted to thanks, is a melody in even tempo that rises gradually and falls again. The voices enter without instrumental support in dense succession. The [[countersubject]] on the second line \"propter magnam gloriam tuam\" (for your great glory), devoted to the glory of God, is more complex in rhythm. Similarly, in the cantata the second line \"und verk\u00fcndigen deine Wunder\" (and proclaim your wonders) leads to a more vivid countersubject.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=11}} Towards the end of the movement, the trumpets take part in the [[polyphony]] of the dense movement.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=59\u201365}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Domine Deus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 8 Domine Deus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Domine Deus]]\nThe section addressing God as Father and Son is again a duet, this time of soprano I and tenor. The voices are often in canon and in parallel, as in the ''[[#Christe|Christe]]''.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=66\u201375}} The movement is likely another parody, possibly from the 1729 cantata [[Ihr H\u00e4user des Himmels, BWV 193a|''Ihr H\u00e4user des Himmels'', BWV 193a]]. As the Christe, it is a love-duet addressing Jesus. Both duets appear as the center of the symmetry within the respective part, Kyrie and Gloria. Here an obbligato flute opens a concerto with the orchestra and introduces material that the voices pick up.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=10}}\n\nRathey points out, that the scoring at first glance does not seem to match the text \"Domine Deus, Rex coelestis\" (Lord God, Heavenly King), but it matches the continuation \"Domine Deus, Agnus Dei\" (Lord God, Lamb of God), stressing the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] \"theologia crucis\" (theology of the cross) that the omnipotent God is the same as the one revealed on the cross.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=11}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Qui tollis ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 9 Qui tollis.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Qui tollis]]\n[[File:Parodie.png|thumb|300px|alt=two lines of musical notation in comparison|The beginning of the first vocal entry in the cantata movement and the beginning of {{lang|la|[[Mass in B minor structure#Qui tollis|Qui tollis peccata mundi]]|italic=no}} in the mass]]\nWhen the text reaches the phase \"{{lang|la|Qui tollis peccata mundi|italic=no}}\" (who takest away the sins of the world), the music is given [[attacca]] to a four-part choir with two obbligato flutes.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=75\u201381}} The movement is based on the first choral movement of {{lang|de|[[Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei, BWV 46|''Schauet doch und sehet, ob irgend ein Schmerz sei'', BWV 46]]|italic=unset}}.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} The cantata text was based on the [[Book of Lamentations]], {{Sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Lamentations|chapter=1|verse=12}}, a similar expression of grief.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=11}} Bach changed the key and the rhythm because of the different text.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} The key of B minor connects this description of \"Christ's suffering and mankind's plea for mercy\" to the similar quest in the first Kyrie. The keys G \u2013 B \u2013 D form the G major triad, leading to the \"home key\" of the Gloria, D major.{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=93}} Bach uses only part of the cantata movement, without the instrumental introduction and the second part.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=18}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Qui sedes ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 10 Qui sedes.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Qui sedes]]\nThe continuation of the thought, \"{{lang|la|Qui sedes ad dexteram Patris|italic=no}}\" (who sits at the right [hand] of the Father), is expressed by an aria for alto and obbligato oboe d'amore.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=82\u201386}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} It is probably a parody. In Bach's earlier settings of the mass he had treated \"Qui tollis and \"Qui sedes\" as one movement, here he distinguished Jesus at the right hand of the father by dance-like music.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=11}} Wenk likens it to a gigue.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Quoniam tu solus sanctus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 11 Quoniam.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Quoniam tu solus sanctus]]\nThe last section begins with an aria for bass, showing \"{{lang|la|Quoniam tu solus sanctus|italic=no}}\" (For you alone are holy) in an unusual scoring of only corno da caccia and two bassoons.{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} Paczkowski points out the symbolic function of this corno da caccia as well as the polonaise.{{sfnp|Paczkowski|2013|p=82}} By using the polonaise, Bach not only expressed the text by musical means, but also paid respect to the King of Poland and Elector of Saxony, August III, to whom the Mass is dedicated. Probably a parody, it is the only movement in the work using the horn.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=87\u201394}}{{sfnp|Jenkins|2001|p=7}} The unusual scoring provides a \"solemn character\".{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=12}} Butt observes that Bach uses a rhythmic pattern throughout the movement in the two bassoons which is even extended into the following movement, although they originally were independent. The repeated figure of an [[anapaest]] provides the \"rhythmic energy of the texture.\"{{sfnp|Butt|1991|p=86}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Cum sancto spiritu ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 12 Cum Sancto.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Cum sancto spiritu]]\nOn the continuing text \"{{lang|la|Cum sancto spiritu|italic=no}}\" (with the Holy Spirit), the choir enters in five parts, in symmetry to the beginning. A homophonic section is followed by a fugue.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=95\u2013114}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} The concertante music corresponds in symmetry to the opening of the Gloria, both praising God.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=12}}\n{{clear}}\n\n=== No. 2 Symbolum Nicenum ===\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Credo Architektur.svg|thumb|300px|Architecture of the {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}]]\n[[File:Bwv232-credo.jpg|thumb|Autograph of the first page of {{lang|la|[[Nicene Creed|Symbolum&nbsp;Nicenum]]|italic=no}}]]\nThe text of the profession of faith, '''{{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}''', is the [[Nicene Creed]]. It is structured in three sections, regarding Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Bach follows the structure, devoting two choral movements to the first section, beginning the second section with a duet, followed by three choral movements, and opening the third with an aria, followed by two choral movements. The center is the {{lang|grc|Crucifixus|italic=no}}, set in E&nbsp;minor, the lowest key of the part. The {{lang|grc|Crucifixus|italic=no}} is also the oldest music in the Mass, dating back to 1714.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}} The part begins and ends with a sequence of two connected choral movements in contrasting style, a motet in ''stile antico'', containing a chant melody, and a concerto. The chant melodies are devoted to two of the key words of this part: Credo (I believe) and Confiteor (I confess).{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=14}}\n\n==== Credo in unum Deum ====\n\nThe Credo begins with \"{{lang|la|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}}\" (I believe in one God), a polyphonic movement for five-part choir, to which two obbligato violins add independent parts. The theme is a [[Gregorian Chant]],{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=7}} first presented by the tenor in long notes on a [[walking bass]] of the continuo. The other voices enter in the sequence bass, alto, soprano I, soprano II, each one before the former one even finishes its line. The two violins enter independently, reaching a seven-part fugue.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=115\u2013120}} The complex counterpoint of the seven parts, five voices and two violins, expands the theme of the chant, often in [[stretto]] function, and uses a variety of countersubjects. In the second [[Exposition (music)|exposition]] (sequence of fugue entries), the bass voice is missing, leading to anticipation and a climactic entry in [[augmentation (music)|augmentation]] (long notes) beginning the third exposition, just as an entry of the first violin ends the second exposition. Musicologist John Butt summarizes: \"By using numerous stile antico devices in a particular order and combination, Bach has created a movement in which a standardised structure breeds a new momentum of its own\".{{sfnp|Butt|1991|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThis movement in stile antico contrasts with the following modern concerto-style movement, {{lang|la|Patrem omnipotentem|italic=no}}. This contrast is reminiscent of the contrast between the two Kyrie movements and foreshadows the last two movements of the Symbolum Nicenum. Recent research dates the movement to 1747 or 1748 and suggests that it might have been the introduction to a Credo by a different composer, before Bach began to assemble the Mass.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|pp=13\u201314}}\n\n==== Patrem omnipotentem ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 14 Patrem omnipotentem.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Patrem omnipotentem]]\nThe thought is continued in \"{{lang|la|Patrem omnipotentem|italic=no}}\" (to the Father, almighty), in a four-part choral movement with trumpets.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=121\u2013130}} The movement probably shares its original source with the opening chorus of {{lang|de|[[Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm, BWV 171|''Gott, wie dein Name, so ist auch dein Ruhm'', BWV 171]]|italic=unset}} (God, as Your name is, so is also Your praise),{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} which also expresses the idea of thanks to God and praise of his creation.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=14}} The voices sing a fugue to a concerto of the orchestra. The bass introduces the theme, without an instrumental opening, while the other voices repeat simultaneously in homophony \"{{lang|la|Credo in unum Deum|italic=no}}\" as a firm statement. The theme contains all eight notes of the scale, as a symbol completeness.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}} Bach noted at the end of the movement that it contains 84 measures, the multiplication of 7 and 12, a hint at the symbolic meaning of numbers. The word \"{{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}\" appears 49 times (7*7), the words \"{{lang|la|Patrem omnipotentem|italic=no}}\" 84 times.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Et in unum Dominum ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 15 Et in unum.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et in unum Dominum]]\n[[File:BWV 232 Et in unum.svg|thumb|250px|''Et in unum Domium'': different articulation of the instruments, canon of the voices]]\nThe belief in Jesus Christ begins with \"{{lang|la|Et in unum Dominum|italic=no}}\" (And in one Lord), another duet, this time of soprano and alto, beginning in a canon where the second voice follows the first after only one beat. The instruments often play the same line with different articulation.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=131\u2013138}} The movement is based on a lost duet which served already in 1733 as the basis for a movement of [[La\u00dft uns sorgen, la\u00dft uns wachen, BWV 213|''La\u00dft uns sorgen, la\u00dft uns wachen'', BWV 213]]. Bach headed the movement \"{{lang|la|Duo voces articuli 2|italic=no}}\" which can be translated as \"Two voices express 2\" or \"the two vocal parts of Article 2\". The text included originally the line \"{{lang|la|Et incarnatus est de Spiritu sancto ex Maria virgine et homo factus est|italic=no}}\", illustrating \"{{lang|la|descendit|italic=no}}\" by a descending figure for the violins. When Bach treated \"{{lang|la|Et incarnatus est|italic=no}}\" as a separate choral movement, he rearranged the text, and the figure lost its \"pictorial association\".{{sfnp|Jenkins|2001|p=3}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Et incarnatus est ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 16 Et incarnatus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et incarnatus est]]\n[[File:BWV 232 Incarnatus Grafik.jpg|thumb|300px|Autograph of the beginning]]\nThe virgin birth, \"{{lang|la|Et incarnatus est|italic=no}}\" (And was incarnate), is a five-part movement. It is probably Bach's last vocal composition, dating from the end of 1749 or the first weeks of 1750.{{sfnp|Wolff|2009}} Until then, the text had been included in the preceding duet. The late separate setting of the words which had been given special attention by previous composers of the mass, established the symmetry of the {{lang|la|Credo|italic=no}}. The humiliation of God, born as man, is illustrated by the violins in a pattern of one measure that descends and then combines the symbol of the [[Cross (Christianity)|cross]] and sighing motifs, alluding to the crucifixion.\nThe voices sing a [[Motif (music)|motif]] of descending triads. They enter in imitation starting in measure 4, one voice every measure in the sequence alto, soprano II, soprano I, tenor, bass, forming a rich texture. The text \"{{lang|la|ex Maria vergine|italic=no}}\" (out of the virgin Mary) appears in an upward movement, \"et homo factus est\" (and made man) is even in upward triads.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=139\u2013142}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Crucifixus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 17 Crucifixus.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Crucifixus]]\n[[File:Bach's Crucifixus B Minor Mass ground bass.png|thumb|300px|''[[Passus duriusculus]]'' in the ground bass]]\n\"{{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}}\" (Crucified), the center of the Credo part, is the oldest music in the setting of the Mass, dating back to 1714.

Speaking about the third person of the Trinity, the number three appears in many aspects: the aria is in three sections, in a triple 6/8-time, in A major, a key with three sharps, in German \"Kreuz\" (cross). A major is the dominant key to D major, the main key of the part, symbolising superiority, in contrast to the E minor of the \"{{lang|la|Crucifixus|italic=no}}\" as the lowest point of the architecture. The two oboes d'amore open the movement with a ritornello, with an ondulating theme played in parallels, which is later picked up by the voice. The ritornello is played between the three sections, the second time shortened, and it concludes the movement. The sections cover first the Holy Spirit, then his adoration with the Father and the Son, finally how he acted through the prophets and the church. The voice sings in highest register for the words \"{{lang|la|Et unam sanctam catholicam&nbsp;... ecclesiam|italic=no}}\" (and one holy universal&nbsp;... church), and expands in a repeat of the text in long coloraturas the words \"{{lang|la|catholicam|italic=no}}\" and \"{{lang|la|ecclesiam|italic=no}}\".{{sfn|Baxter|2013|p=5}} Wenk likens the movement to a [[Pastorale]], a \"Christmas dance\", often on a [[Drone (music)|drone]] bass.{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Confiteor ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 20 Confiteor.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Confiteor]]\nThe belief in the baptism for the forgiveness of sins, \"{{lang|la|Confiteor|italic=no}}\" (I confess), is expressed in strict counterpoint, which incorporates a [[cantus firmus]] in [[plainchant]].{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=170\u2013180}} The five-part choir is accompanied only by the continuo as a walking bass.

The voices follow each other in fast succession, only one or two measures apart. The two themes appear in complex combinations, until the cantus firmus is heard from measure 73 as a [[Canon (music)|canon]] in the bass and alto, and then in augmentation (long notes) from measure 92 in the tenor. {{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} Then the movement slows down to Adagio (a written tempo change, rare in Bach), as the altos sing the word \"peccatorum\" (sinners) one last time in an extremely low range. As the text turns to the words \"{{lang|la|Et expecto resurrectionem mortuorum|italic=no}}\" (and expect the resurrection of the dead), the slow music modulates daringly with [[enharmonic]] transformations through several keys,{{sfnp|Scobel|2006|p=8}} touching E-flat major and G-sharp major, vividly bringing a sense of dissolving into disorder as well as expectation before the resurrection to come. Whenever the word \"mortuorum\" appears, the voices sing long low notes, whereas \"resurrectionem\" is illustrated in triad motifs leading upwards.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=180\u2013181}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Et expecto ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 21 Et expecto.svg|thumb|300px|Incipit of Et expecto]]\nThe expectation of a world to come, \"{{lang|la|Et expecto|italic=no}}\" (And I expect) is a joyful concerto of five voices with trumpets.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011}} Marked \"Vivace a Allegro\", the voices begin with a trumpet fanfare in imitation on the same text as before.

The number of voices may relate to the six wings of the [[seraphim]] described in that passage.{{sfnp|Rathey|2003|p=15}}\n\n==== Pleni sunt coeli ====\n\nThe continuation, \"{{lang|la|Pleni sunt coeli|italic=no}}\" (Full are the heavens), follows immediately, written for the same scoring, as a fugue in dancing 3/8 time with \"quick runs\".{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=199\u2013209}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}}\n\n=== No. 4 Osanna, Benedictus, Agnus Dei et Dona nobis pacem ===\n\n==== Osanna in excelsis ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 24 Osanna.svg|thumb|300px|{{lang|la|Incipit of Osanna}}]]\n{{lang|la|Osanna in excelsis|italic=no}} (Osanna in the Highest) is set for two choirs and a festive orchestra, in the same key and time as the previous movement.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=210\u2013229}}{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} The movement is based, as is the opening chorus of the secular cantata {{lang|de|[[Preise dein Gl\u00fccke, gesegnetes Sachsen, BWV 215|''Preise dein Gl\u00fccke, gesegnetes Sachsen'', BWV 215]]|italic=unset}},{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=5}} probably on the opening movement of the secular cantata [[Es lebe der K\u00f6nig, der Vater im Lande, BWV Anh 11|''Es lebe der K\u00f6nig, der Vater im Lande'', BWV Anh 11]], of 1732.{{sfnp|D\u00fcrr|1981|p=670}} The movement contrasts homophonic sections with fugal development.{{sfnp|P\u00e9rez Torres|2005|p=88}} Wenk likens the movement to the [[Passepied]], a dance in \"fast triple meter with an upbeat\".{{sfnp|Wenk|2011|p=13}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Benedictus ====\n\n[[File:BWV 232 Incipit Nr. 25 Benedictus.svg|thumb|300px|{{lang|la|Incipit of Benedictus|italic=no}}]]\nThe following thought, {{lang|la|Benedictus|italic=no}}, \"blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord\", is sung by the tenor in an aria with an obbligato instrument, probably a flauto traverso,{{sfnp|Amati-Camperi|2005}} leading to a repeat of the Osanna.{{sfnp|Bach Mass in B Minor|2011|pp=230\u2013233}} The intimate music contrasts with the Osanna like the {{lang|grc|Christe eleison|italic=no}} with {{lang|grc|Kyrie eleison|italic=no}}.

One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974, a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

One of the most persistent was originally chartered in 1868 as the Hudson Highland Suspension Bridge Company, whose proposed bridge would have crossed from [[Anthony's Nose (Westchester)|Anthony's Nose]] to [[Fort Clinton]], now roughly the site of the [[Bear Mountain Bridge]]. It was never built.\n\nThe Poughkeepsie Bridge Company was chartered in June 1871 to build the bridge, and [[J. Edgar Thomson]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] was persuaded to support the effort. Contracts were let to a firm called the American Bridge Company (not the [[American Bridge Company|company of the same name]] founded later), but the [[Panic of 1873]] intervened and the scheme collapsed.\n\nIn 1886, the Manhattan Bridge Building Company was organized to finance the construction. Among the prominent backers was [[Henry Clay Frick]], the coal tycoon and associate of [[Andrew Carnegie]]. The [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[Athens, Pennsylvania]], which had completed the [[Michigan Central Railway|Michigan Central]] cantilever bridge at Niagara (see [[Niagara Cantilever Bridge]]), was subcontracted to build the Poughkeepsie Bridge. Dawson, Symmes and Usher were the foundation engineers, while John F. O'Rourke, P. P. Dickinson and Arthur B. Paine were the structural engineers. The bridge was designed by [[Charles Macdonald (architect)|Charles Macdonald]] and Arthur B. Paine. As is typical for cantilever bridges, construction was carried out by constructing cribwork, masonry piers, towers, fixed truss sections on falsework, and finally cantilever sections, with the final cantilever interconnection (suspended) spans floated out or raised with [[falsework]]. The first train crossed the bridge on December 29, 1888, and it was formally opened for scheduled passenger service on January 1, 1889.\n\nConsidered an engineering marvel of the day, the bridge has seven main spans. The total length is {{convert|6,768|ft|m}}, including approaches, and the top of the deck is {{convert|212|ft|m}} above water. It is a multispan cantilever truss bridge, having two river-crossing cantilever spans of {{convert|548|ft|m}} each, one center span of {{convert|546|ft|m}}, two anchor (connecting) spans of {{convert|525|ft|m}}, two shore spans of {{convert|201|ft|m}} each, a {{convert|2,641|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the eastern bank and a {{convert|1,033|ft|m}} approach viaduct on the western bank. All seven spans were built of newly available Bessemer Process \"mild\" (between 0.16% and 0.29% carbon) steel, while the two approach viaducts were built of iron. It formed part of the most direct rail route between the industrial northeastern states and the midwestern and western states.<ref>POUGHKEEPSIE EAGLE Souvenir Edition dated January 1, 1889; plus independent engineering articles from the period.</ref>\n\n===Operation===\n[[File:Detroit Photographic Company (0676).jpg|thumb|left|Poughkeepsie Bridge ca. 1900]]\n[[File:Under the Bridge, Poughkeepsie, N.

Traffic from the connecting [[New York, Ontario & Western]] ceased when that railroad shut down on March 30, 1957. Another connection, the coal-, slate-, and cement-hauling [[Lehigh & New England]], shut down in 1961. At the same time, some new traffic began crossing the bridge, such as the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven's]] \"Super Jet\", one of the first trains to carry truck trailers. The [[Penn Central Transportation Company|Penn Central]]'s acquisition of the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|New Haven]] in 1969 discouraged connecting traffic with the [[Erie Lackawanna]], which competed with other Penn Central routes. After 1971, only one through train in each direction, for [[Erie Lackawanna]], crossed the bridge.<ref name=swanberg>{{Citation | last = Swanberg | first = J.W. | title = Railroad Blueprint: Maybrook, New York| journal = Trains Magazine |date=January 2005 | pages = 50\u201359}}</ref>\n\nWhile the Penn Central did not connect with the old New Haven on the west side of the bridge, it came close. For a short time in 1969 and 1970, Penn Central ran a daily train between [[Cedar Hill Yard]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Potomac Yard]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], by way of the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]], which connected with the [[Penn Central]] [[Belvidere Delaware Railroad|Belvidere Division]] in [[Belvidere, New Jersey]], 72 miles south of the old interchange with the New Haven at [[Maybrook Yard]] in [[Maybrook, New York]]. The service ended in a dispute over haulage charges and the traffic was diverted to the longer all-Penn Central route through [[Selkirk, New York]]. Ironically, the only reason the [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] was not part of the Penn Central was because a Penn Central predecessor, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], had prevented the New Haven from acquiring it in 1905.<ref name=swanberg/> The [[Lehigh and Hudson River]] and Erie Lackawanna were finally joined with the Penn Central when all were taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976.\n\nOn May 8, 1974, a [[Railroad tie|tie]] fire damaged about {{convert|700|ft|m}} of decking and underlying girders on the bridge's eastern section.<ref>{{cite news | last = Cruz | first = Roberto | title = Railroad bridge fire 40th anniversary: Fire in the sky | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/news/local/2014/05/07/poughkeepsie-railroad-fire-anniversary/8831573/ | accessdate =  January 2, 2015}}</ref> It was likely started by a spark from an eastbound freight train that had just crossed the span.<ref>{{Citation | last  = Sutherland | first = Joseph | title = Fire Closes Rail Bridge 3 Months | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = May 9, 1974 | page = 1 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=R1VRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4DMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=1613%2C1667620 }}</ref> The Penn Central had neglected the bridge's fire-protection system, which had no water on the day of the fire, and had laid off employees who kept watch for such fires.<ref name=mabee /> A photograph of the last train, a run-through from the [[Erie Lackawanna]], was included in a 40th anniversary web feature by the [[Poughkeepsie Journal]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Cusumano | first = Chris | title = INTERACTIVE: How the Poughkeepsie Railroad Bridge fire changed history | newspaper = The Poughkeepsie Journal | date = May 7, 2014 | url = http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/longform/news/2014/05/07/bridgefire/8725801/ | accessdate = January 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1974, the Penn Central applied for $1.75 million to repair and improve the bridge from the federal government through the [[Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fate of Poughkeepsie Rail Bridge Up to Court | newspaper = The Evening News | location = Newburgh, NY | date = August 30, 1974  | page = 4A | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IlRRAAAAIBAJ&sjid=rTMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=987%2C5261610 }}</ref> By 1975, efforts had shifted to acquiring a combination of state and railroad funding.

The two primary candidates in the presidential race were [[Guillermo Endara]], who headed [[Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition]] (ADOC), a coalition opposed to military ruler [[Manuel Noriega]], and [[Carlos Duque]], who headed the pro-Noriega [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (PRD).\n\nHowever, the election was annulled before voting was completed by Noriega's government, and Endara and his running mate [[Guillermo Ford]] were attacked in front of foreign media by Noriega supporters, events that contributed to the [[US invasion of Panama]] in December of that year. During the invasion, Endara was declared the election's winner and sworn in as the new [[president of Panama]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe death of [[Arnulfo Arias]] in August 1988, a few days before his eighty-seventh birthday, removed a major obstacle to opposition unity, but also created several new problems. It left the opposition without a charismatic national leader to place at the head of any 1989 electoral ticket.<ref>Millett, Richard L. \"The failure of Panama's internal opposition, 1987-1989.\" Conflict resolution and democratization in Panama: implications for U.S. policy. 1992. Washington: The Center for Strategic and International Studies. Pp. 26.</ref>\n\nThe [[Paname\u00f1ista Party|Authentic Paname\u00f1ista Party]], Panama's leading opposition party, divided in December 1988. The Electoral Tribunal formally recognized the faction led by [[Hildebrando Nicosia P\u00e9rez]] as the legitimate party representative, entitling Nicosia and his colleagues to use the party symbols. According to the opposition, the government engineered the division in the party to sow confusion among the electorate. However, Nicosia's effort to present himself as the heir of Arias was singularly unsuccessful according to the opposition's election results, which showed him receiving less than one percent of the vote.\n\nThe PPA's main body, including a majority of the party's hierarchy, joined the anti-government [[Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition]] (ADOC); the party's secretary-general, [[Guillermo Endara]], was ADOC's presidential candidate. Denied use of the PPA symbol, Endara and the party's legislative candidates competed under the banner of the [[Authentic Liberal Party]], which is the product of a schism that developed in the [[Liberal Party (Panama)|Liberal Party]] prior to [[1984 Panamanian general election|the 1984 elections]]. The military rule of [[Manuel Noriega]] also provoked a split in the [[Republican Party (Panama)|Republican Party]] (RP), but the majority of the legitimate leadership of the RP participated in the ADOC coalition.<ref name=\"cartercenter.org\">The May 7, 1989 Panamanian Elections. International Delegation Report. 1989. Pp. 37. (http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/electionreports/democracy/FinalReportPanama1989.pdf)</ref> Two other major parties\u2014the PDC and MOLIRENA\u2014were also part of ADOC. ADOC also had the support of the small [[Popular Action Party (Panama)|Popular Action Party]] (PAPA), and National Peoples Party (PNP), and defectors from the Liberal and Republican parties, and a dissident faction of the PPA. In addition to Endara, ADOC's electoral slate included [[Ricardo Arias Calder\u00f3n]] of the PDC for first vice president and [[Guillermo Ford]] of MOLIRENA for second vice president.<ref name=\"cartercenter.org\"/>\n\nProgovernment parties - the PRD, PALA, PR, PL, PPR, PPP, PAN, PDT had formed a new electoral coalition, the [[National Liberation Coalition]] (COLINA). The PRD was the coalition's leading party and its president, [[Carlos Alberto Duque Ja\u00e9n]], a business associate of Noriega, was the coalition's presidential candidate. COLINA's other significant party was PALA, led by [[Ram\u00f3n Sieiro Murgas]], the coalition's candidate for first vice president and a brother-in-law of Noriega. COLINA's candidate for second vice president was [[Aquilino Boyd]], former foreign minister, and former ambassador to the United States, the [[United Nations]] and, most recently, the [[Organization of American States]]. COLINA, in presenting a united slate for the legislature, contained a broad ideological spectrum that included Communist Party members, businessmen and professionals.<ref>The May 7, 1989 Panamanian Elections. International Delegation Report. 1989. Pp. 36. (http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/electionreports/democracy/FinalReportPanama1989.pdf)</ref>\n\n== Results ==\nAn exit poll of 1,022 voters gave the opposition an overwhelming victory: 55.1% for Endara, but only 39.5% for Duque. The margin shocked Noriega, who either was misled by advisers or really believed that the election would be close enough to manipulate with minimal fraud.<ref>Scranton, Margaret E. 1991. The Noriega years: U.S.-Panamanian relations, 1981\u20131990. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers. Pp. 161.</ref>\n\nSuspecting that Noriega would never allow an honest vote, ADOC organized a count of results from election precincts before they were sent to district centers. As it turned out, Noriega's cronies had taken bogus tally sheets to the district centers in order to make it appear Duque had won in a landslide.<ref name=\"ToT\">{{cite book|title=In the Time of the Tyrants: Panama, 1968\u20131990|last=Koster|first=R.M.|author2=Guillermo S\u00e1nchez|year=1990|publisher=Norton|location=New York City|isbn=0-393-02696-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/intimeoftyrantsp00kost}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May, government-released results gave a clear-cut lead to Duque. By this time, however, the opposition's count was already out. It showed Endara winning in a landslide, with a nearly 3-to-1 lead over Duque. Opposition forces - as well as foreign observers and the clergy - thereupon claimed massive election irregularities. Parliamentary results also indicated an opposition victory.<ref>Chronicle of parliamentary elections. Geneva: International Centre for Parliamentary Documentation, Inter-Parliamentary Union.

Pp. 174.</ref><ref name=\"ToT\"/> Former US President [[Jimmy Carter]], one of the election observers, was placed under brief house arrest by Noriega's forces to prevent him from speaking to the press. At a later press conference, he called for an international response to the stolen election, then addressed the Noriega administration directly, asking \"Are you honest people, or are you thieves?\"{{sfn|Harding|2006|p=112}}\n\nNoriega had intended to declare Duque the winner regardless of the actual count. However, Duque knew that he had been soundly defeated and refused to go along.<ref name=\"ToT\"/> On 10 May, the president of the Electoral Tribunal read a statement signed by all three magistrates annulling the elections. The statement alluded to the fact that the great number of irregularities across the country made counting the votes impossible.<ref>P\u00e9rez, Orlando J. \"Elections under crisis: background to Panama in the 1980s.\" Seligson, Mitchell A. and John A.

The two primary candidates in the presidential race were [[Guillermo Endara]], who headed [[Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition]] (ADOC), a coalition opposed to military ruler [[Manuel Noriega]], and [[Carlos Duque]], who headed the pro-Noriega [[Democratic Revolutionary Party]] (PRD).\n\nHowever, the election was annulled before voting was completed by Noriega's government, and Endara and his running mate [[Guillermo Ford]] were attacked in front of foreign media by Noriega supporters, events that contributed to the [[US invasion of Panama]] in December of that year. During the invasion, Endara was declared the election's winner and sworn in as the new [[president of Panama]].\n\n== Background ==\nThe death of [[Arnulfo Arias]] in August 1988, a few days before his eighty-seventh birthday, removed a major obstacle to opposition unity, but also created several new problems. It left the opposition without a charismatic national leader to place at the head of any 1989 electoral ticket.<ref>Millett, Richard L. \"The failure of Panama's internal opposition, 1987-1989.\" Conflict resolution and democratization in Panama: implications for U.S. policy. 1992. Washington: The Center for Strategic and International Studies. Pp. 26.</ref>\n\nThe [[Paname\u00f1ista Party|Authentic Paname\u00f1ista Party]], Panama's leading opposition party, divided in December 1988. The Electoral Tribunal formally recognized the faction led by [[Hildebrando Nicosia P\u00e9rez]] as the legitimate party representative, entitling Nicosia and his colleagues to use the party symbols. According to the opposition, the government engineered the division in the party to sow confusion among the electorate. However, Nicosia's effort to present himself as the heir of Arias was singularly unsuccessful according to the opposition's election results, which showed him receiving less than one percent of the vote.\n\nThe PPA's main body, including a majority of the party's hierarchy, joined the anti-government [[Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition]] (ADOC); the party's secretary-general, [[Guillermo Endara]], was ADOC's presidential candidate. Denied use of the PPA symbol, Endara and the party's legislative candidates competed under the banner of the [[Authentic Liberal Party]], which is the product of a schism that developed in the [[Liberal Party (Panama)|Liberal Party]] prior to [[1984 Panamanian general election|the 1984 elections]]. The military rule of [[Manuel Noriega]] also provoked a split in the [[Republican Party (Panama)|Republican Party]] (RP), but the majority of the legitimate leadership of the RP participated in the ADOC coalition.<ref name=\"cartercenter.org\">The May 7, 1989 Panamanian Elections. International Delegation Report. 1989. Pp. 37. (http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/electionreports/democracy/FinalReportPanama1989.pdf)</ref> Two other major parties\u2014the PDC and MOLIRENA\u2014were also part of ADOC. ADOC also had the support of the small [[Popular Action Party (Panama)|Popular Action Party]] (PAPA), and National Peoples Party (PNP), and defectors from the Liberal and Republican parties, and a dissident faction of the PPA. In addition to Endara, ADOC's electoral slate included [[Ricardo Arias Calder\u00f3n]] of the PDC for first vice president and [[Guillermo Ford]] of MOLIRENA for second vice president.<ref name=\"cartercenter.org\"/>\n\nProgovernment parties - the PRD, PALA, PR, PL, PPR, PPP, PAN, PDT had formed a new electoral coalition, the [[National Liberation Coalition]] (COLINA). The PRD was the coalition's leading party and its president, [[Carlos Alberto Duque Ja\u00e9n]], a business associate of Noriega, was the coalition's presidential candidate. COLINA's other significant party was PALA, led by [[Ram\u00f3n Sieiro Murgas]], the coalition's candidate for first vice president and a brother-in-law of Noriega. COLINA's candidate for second vice president was [[Aquilino Boyd]], former foreign minister, and former ambassador to the United States, the [[United Nations]] and, most recently, the [[Organization of American States]]. COLINA, in presenting a united slate for the legislature, contained a broad ideological spectrum that included Communist Party members, businessmen and professionals.<ref>The May 7, 1989 Panamanian Elections. International Delegation Report. 1989. Pp. 36. (http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/electionreports/democracy/FinalReportPanama1989.pdf)</ref>\n\n== Results ==\nAn exit poll of 1,022 voters gave the opposition an overwhelming victory: 55.1% for Endara, but only 39.5% for Duque. The margin shocked Noriega, who either was misled by advisers or really believed that the election would be close enough to manipulate with minimal fraud.<ref>Scranton, Margaret E. 1991. The Noriega years: U.S.-Panamanian relations, 1981\u20131990. Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers. Pp. 161.</ref>\n\nSuspecting that Noriega would never allow an honest vote, ADOC organized a count of results from election precincts before they were sent to district centers. As it turned out, Noriega's cronies had taken bogus tally sheets to the district centers in order to make it appear Duque had won in a landslide.<ref name=\"ToT\">{{cite book|title=In the Time of the Tyrants: Panama, 1968\u20131990|last=Koster|first=R.M.|author2=Guillermo S\u00e1nchez|year=1990|publisher=Norton|location=New York City|isbn=0-393-02696-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/intimeoftyrantsp00kost}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May, government-released results gave a clear-cut lead to Duque. By this time, however, the opposition's count was already out. It showed Endara winning in a landslide, with a nearly 3-to-1 lead over Duque. Opposition forces - as well as foreign observers and the clergy - thereupon claimed massive election irregularities. Parliamentary results also indicated an opposition victory.<ref>Chronicle of parliamentary elections. Geneva: International Centre for Parliamentary Documentation, Inter-Parliamentary Union. Volume 24, 1990. Pp. 174.</ref><ref name=\"ToT\"/> Former US President [[Jimmy Carter]], one of the election observers, was placed under brief house arrest by Noriega's forces to prevent him from speaking to the press. At a later press conference, he called for an international response to the stolen election, then addressed the Noriega administration directly, asking \"Are you honest people, or are you thieves?\"{{sfn|Harding|2006|p=112}}\n\nNoriega had intended to declare Duque the winner regardless of the actual count. However, Duque knew that he had been soundly defeated and refused to go along.<ref name=\"ToT\"/> On 10 May, the president of the Electoral Tribunal read a statement signed by all three magistrates annulling the elections. The statement alluded to the fact that the great number of irregularities across the country made counting the votes impossible.<ref>P\u00e9rez, Orlando J. \"Elections under crisis: background to Panama in the 1980s.\" Seligson, Mitchell A. and John A.
