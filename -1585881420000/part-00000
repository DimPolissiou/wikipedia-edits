Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of [[\u00cele Gombrani]], which was then called au M\u00e2t. [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]], a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Hume\n| first1 = J.

As the Rodrigues and Mauritius starlings seem to be more closely related to each other than to the hoopoe starling, which appears to be closer to Southeast Asian starlings, there may have been two separate colonisations of starlings in the Mascarenes from Asia, with the hoopoe starling being the latest arrival. Apart from Madagascar, the Mascarenes were the only islands in the south-west Indian Ocean that contained native starlings. This is probably due to the isolation, varied topography and vegetation of these islands.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Rodrigues Starling.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical restoration, based on Tafforet's account, subfossils, and related species]]\nThe Rodrigues starling was large for a starling, being {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=on|0}} in length.

Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The [[maxilla]] of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/> Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was [[sexually dimorphic]].<ref name=\"Greenway\"/> Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but this may be due to individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There is a difference in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nG\u00fcnther and Newton noted that the [[skull]] of the Rodrigues starling was shaped somewhat differently and longer than that of the hoopoe starling, being about {{convert|29|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from the [[occipital condyle]]; it was also narrower, being {{convert|21\u201322|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The eyes were set slightly lower, and the upper rims of the [[eye socket]]s were about {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. The [[interorbital septum]] was more delicate, with a larger hole in its centre. The bill was about {{convert|36\u201339|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, less curved and proportionally a little deeper than in the hoopoe starling. It also seems to have had larger [[nostril]]s, with the nostril openings in the bone being {{convert|12\u201313|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The mandible was about {{convert|52\u201360|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4\u20135|mm|in|abbr=on}} deep [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximally]]. The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]].

This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

Its closest relatives were the [[Mauritius starling]] and the [[hoopoe starling]] from nearby islands; all three appear to be of Southeast Asian origin. The bird was only reported by French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]], who was marooned on the island from 1725 to 1726. Tafforet observed it on the offshore [[islet]] of [[\u00cele Gombrani]]. [[Subfossil]] remains found on the mainland were described in 1879, and were suggested to belong to the bird mentioned by Tafforet. There was much confusion about the bird and its taxonomic relations throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe Rodrigues starling was {{convert|25\u201330|cm|abbr=off|0}} long, and had a stout beak. It was described as having a white body, partially black wings and tail, and a yellow bill and legs. Little is known about its behaviour. Its diet included eggs and dead tortoises, which it processed with its strong bill. Predation by rats introduced to the area was probably responsible for the bird's extinction some time in the 18th century. It first became extinct on mainland Rodrigues, then on \u00cele Gombrani, its last refuge.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n[[File:Naturalis Biodiversity Center - RMNH.AVES.110050 - Fregilupus varius (Boddaert, 1783) - R\u00e9union Starling - specimen - video.webm|thumb|left|alt=Perching hoopoe starling museum specimen|thumbtime=0:02|Turnaround video showing a specimen of the related [[hoopoe starling]], [[Naturalis Biodiversity Center]]]]\nIn 1725, the French sailor [[Julien Tafforet]] was marooned on the [[Mascarene]] island of [[Rodrigues]] for nine months, and his report of his time there was later published as ''Relation d'\u00eele Rodrigue''. In the report, he described encounters with various indigenous species, including a white and black bird which fed on eggs and dead tortoises. He stated that it was confined to the offshore islet of [[\u00cele Gombrani]], which was then called au M\u00e2t. [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]], a Frenchman who was also marooned on Rodrigues from 1691 to 1693 and had written about several species there (his account was published in 1708), did not have a boat, and therefore could not explore the various islets as Tafforet did.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Hume\n| first1 = J.

The skull had an attachment scar above the [[temporal fossa]]. The [[supraoccipital ridge]] on the skull was quite strongly developed, and a [[biventer]] muscle attachment in the [[Parietal bone|parietal]] region below it was conspicuous. This indicates that the starling had strong neck and jaw muscles.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\nAccording to G\u00fcnther and Newton, the ulna of the Rodrigues starling was somewhat shorter than that of the hoopoe starling, measuring {{convert|37\u201340|mm|in|abbr=on}}; the humerus measured {{convert|32\u201335|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the keel on its sternum was a bit lower. It had strong [[quill knob]]s on the ulna, indicating that the secondary [[remiges]] were well developed. One coracoid measured {{convert|27.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and one [[carpometacarpus]] was {{convert|22.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. The leg and feet had the same proportions. The femur measured around {{convert|33|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tibiotarsus]] {{convert|52\u201359|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and the [[tarsometatarsus]] {{convert|36\u201341|mm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/>\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\n[[File:Leguat1891frontispieceFr1708.jpg|upright|thumb|Frontispiece to [[Fran\u00e7ois Leguat]]'s 1708 memoir, showing his settlement on Rodrigues, with tortoises and rats at the bottom|alt=Drawing of houses on Rodrigues]]\nLittle is known about the behaviour of the Rodrigues starling, apart from Tafforet's description, from which various inferences can be made. The robustness of its limbs and the strong jaws with the ability to gape indicates that it foraged on the ground. Its diet may have consisted of the various snails and invertebrates of Rodrigues, as well as scavenged items.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Rodrigues had large colonies of seabirds and now-extinct ''[[Cylindraspis]]'' land tortoises, as well as marine turtles, which would have provided a large amount of food for the starling, particularly during the breeding seasons. Tafforet reported that the pigeons and parrots on the offshore southern islets only came to the mainland to drink water, and Leguat noted that the pigeons only bred on the islets due to persecution from rats on the mainland; the starling may have also done this. Originally, the Rodrigues starling may have been widely distributed on Rodrigues, with seasonal visits to the islets. Tafforet's description also indicates that it had a complex song.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n[[File:Rodrigues.jpg|thumb|left|Leguat's map of pristine Rodrigues|alt=Map of Rodrigues, decorated with Solitaires]]\nThe stouter build and more bent shape of the mandible shows that the Rodrigues starling used greater force than the hoopoe starling when searching and perhaps digging for food. It probably also had the ability to remove objects and forcefully open entrances when searching for food; it did this by inserting its wedge-shaped bill and opening its mandibles, as other starlings and crows do. This ability supports Tafforet's claim that the bird fed on eggs and dead tortoises.<ref name=\"G\u00fcnther\"/> It could have torn dead, presumably juvenile, turtles and tortoises out of their shells. Tafforet did not see any Rodrigues starlings on the mainland, but he stated that they could easily be reared by feeding them meat, which indicates that he brought young birds from a breeding population on \u00cele Gombrani.<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/> Tafforet was marooned on Rodrigues during the summer and was apparently able to procure juvenile individuals; some other Rodrigues birds are known to breed at this time, so it is likely that the starling did the same.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 44\u201351\"/>\n\nMany other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests completely covered the island, but very little remains today. The Rodrigues starling lived alongside other recently extinct birds, such as the [[Rodrigues solitaire]], the [[Rodrigues parrot]], [[Newton's parakeet]], the [[Rodrigues rail]], the [[Rodrigues owl]], the [[Rodrigues night heron]], and the [[Rodrigues pigeon]]. Extinct reptiles include the [[domed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], the [[saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise]], and the [[Rodrigues day gecko]].<ref name=\"Lost Land\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Cheke | first1 = A.

Poyser\n|location=New Haven and London\n|isbn=978-0-7136-6544-4}}</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\nLeguat mentioned that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This may be the reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have either been absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets would have been the last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist [[Alexandre Guy Pingr\u00e9]] visited Rodrigues during the French [[Transit of Venus#1761 and 1769|1761 Transit of Venus expedition]].<ref name=\"Extinct Birds\"/>\n\nThe large populations of tortoises and marine turtles on Rodrigues resulted in the export of thousands of animals, and cats were introduced to control the rats, but the cats attacked the native birds and tortoises as well. The Rodrigues starling was already extinct on the mainland by this time. Rats are adept at crossing water, and inhabit almost all islets off Rodrigues today. At least five species of ''[[Aplonis]]'' starlings have become extinct in islands of the Pacific Ocean, and rats also contributed to their demise.<ref name=\"Hume 2014 55\u201358\">Hume, J. P.

The album has been certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. ''Sports'' was ranked number 2 on the ''Billboard'' year-end album chart for 1984. The album spawned four top-ten hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and a fifth went top 20. ''Sports'' did very well internationally where most of its singles charted in the top 40 or above in multiple countries.\n\nIn May 2013, a two-disc ''30th Anniversary Edition'' album of ''Sports'' was released. The album is now approaching 10 million sales in the U.S. according to the liner notes by Gary Graff and the press release issued prior to release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/huey-lewis-and-the-news-spring-2013-tour|title=Huey Lewis & The News Announce Sports 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition Plus Spring/summer 2013 Tour|date=10 April 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production and history==\nThe album was self-produced and recorded promptly after the modest breakthrough success of the band's second album, ''[[Picture This (Huey Lewis and the News album)|Picture This]]''. However, due to reorganization and internal issues at the band's label, [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], the band held back the master tapes, choosing to perform at small venues to showcase the new material while the matters were resolved. Once Chrysalis got their affairs in order and an agreement in place with the band's management, the master tapes were handed over for production. ''Sports'' was finally released in September 1983 and proceeded a slow climb up the charts throughout late 1983 and early 1984.\n\nLewis wrote \"Bad Is Bad\" in the late 1970s while working with [[Phil Lynott]] and [[Thin Lizzy]]. Lynott liked the song so much that he would sing it at some of his concerts in a fast pace.<ref name=Lynott>[http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&A: June 1, 2014]</ref> The band later recorded a music video for the song although it was not released as a single, filming the video on the streets of San Francisco in March 1985.<ref name=TourBook>''Huey Lewis and the News: World Tour'' 1986 tour book</ref> Huey Lewis based \"You Crack Me Up\" on the various people he had encountered at the parking lot of Uncle Charlie's, a bar the band used to play at frequently before they hit it big.<ref name=Char2>[http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&A: September 19, 2016]</ref><ref name=Char>[http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&A: October 17, 2016]</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = [[The Heart of Rock & Roll]]\n| writer1         = [[Johnny Colla]], [[Huey Lewis]]\n| length1         = 5:04\n| title2          = [[Heart and Soul (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Heart and Soul]]\n| writer2         = [[Mike Chapman]], [[Nicky Chinn]]\n| length2         = 4:13\n| title3          = Bad Is Bad\n| writer3         = Alex Call, John Ciambotti, Sean Hopper, Lewis, [[John McFee]], Michael Schriener\n| length3         = 3:48\n| title4          = [[I Want a New Drug]]\n| writer4         = Chris Hayes, Lewis\n| length4         = 4:46\n| title5          = [[Walking on a Thin Line (song)|Walking on a Thin Line]]\n| writer5         = Andre Pessis, Kevin Wells\n| length5         = 5:11\n| title6          = Finally Found a Home\n| writer6         = Bob Brown, Hayes, Lewis\n| length6         = 3:43\n| title7          = [[If This Is It (Huey Lewis and the News song)|If This Is It]]\n| writer7         = Colla, Lewis\n| length7         = 3:54\n| title8          = You Crack Me Up\n| writer8         = Mario Cipollina, Lewis\n| length8         = 3:42\n| title9          = [[Honky Tonk Blues]]\n| writer9         = [[Hank Williams]]\n| length9         = 3:26\n}}\n\n===1999 Expanded Edition===\nA remastered \"Expanded Edition\" of ''Sports'' was released on June 29, 1999, and included the following session takes and live versions of their hit singles as bonus tracks.\n\n{{tracklist\n| title10         = The Heart of Rock & Roll\n| note10          = Session Take\n| length10        = 5:12\n| title11         = Walking on a Thin Line\n| note11          = Session Take\n| length11        = 5:39\n| title12         = If This Is It\n| note12          = Live in San Francisco, 2/21/85\n| length12        = 4:25\n| title13         = Heart and Soul\n| note13          = Live in San Francisco, 2/21/85\n| length13        = 4:25\n| title14         = I Want a New Drug\n| note14          = Live in Los Angeles, 1/15/84\n| length14        = 5:27\n}}\n\n===30th Anniversary Edition===\nOn May 14, 2013, a two-disc 30th Anniversary Edition of ''Sports'' was released, the first disc being a digitally remastered version of the original ''Sports'' album.

The album's second release turned out to be the band's second best-selling single. \"[[I Want a New Drug]]\" peaked at number 6 on the Hot 100 and was certified gold with sales of 1 million copies in 1989  (by modern single certification standards this would be considered platinum).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-05-14/business/fi-188_1_singles-riaa-platinum|title=New Golden Rule: 500,000 Sales Mark for All Singles|first=PAUL|last=GREIN|date=14 May 1989|publisher=|via=LA Times}}</ref>  The track was also the center of a lawsuit against artist [[Ray Parker Jr.]], who was accused of plagiarizing the song for his 1984 hit, \"[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]\".

The accompanying video contained black & white footage of the band performing while legendary performers, Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Bill Haley & The Comets, Buddy Holly and Little Richard from the early rock era were shown.\n\nIn June 1984, ''Sports'' hit number 1 on the ''Billboard'' albums chart, and the fourth single from the album, \"[[If This Is It (Huey Lewis and the News song)|If This Is It]]\", was released shortly thereafter, also peaking at number 6 on the Hot 100.  The fifth and final single from the album, \"[[Walking on a Thin Line (song)|Walking on a Thin Line]]\", was released in December 1984 and peaked at number 18.  Other tracks from the album include, \"Bad Is Bad\", for which the band shot a video but never released as a single, and a cover of \"[[Honky Tonk Blues]]\", originally written and performed by [[Hank

The album has been certified 7\u00d7 Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. ''Sports'' was ranked number 2 on the ''Billboard'' year-end album chart for 1984. The album spawned four top-ten hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and a fifth went top 20. ''Sports'' did very well internationally where most of its singles charted in the top 40 or above in multiple countries.\n\nIn May 2013, a two-disc ''30th Anniversary Edition'' album of ''Sports'' was released. The album is now approaching 10 million sales in the U.S. according to the liner notes by Gary Graff and the press release issued prior to release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/huey-lewis-and-the-news-spring-2013-tour|title=Huey Lewis & The News Announce Sports 30th Anniversary Deluxe Edition Plus Spring/summer 2013 Tour|date=10 April 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Production and history==\nThe album was self-produced and recorded promptly after the modest breakthrough success of the band's second album, ''[[Picture This (Huey Lewis and the News album)|Picture This]]''. However, due to reorganization and internal issues at the band's label, [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], the band held back the master tapes, choosing to perform at small venues to showcase the new material while the matters were resolved. Once Chrysalis got their affairs in order and an agreement in place with the band's management, the master tapes were handed over for production. ''Sports'' was finally released in September 1983 and proceeded a slow climb up the charts throughout late 1983 and early 1984.\n\nLewis wrote \"Bad Is Bad\" in the late 1970s while working with [[Phil Lynott]] and [[Thin Lizzy]]. Lynott liked the song so much that he would sing it at some of his concerts in a fast pace.<ref name=Lynott>[http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&A: June 1, 2014]</ref> The band later recorded a music video for the song although it was not released as a single, filming the video on the streets of San Francisco in March 1985.<ref name=TourBook>''Huey Lewis and the News: World Tour'' 1986 tour book</ref> Huey Lewis based \"You Crack Me Up\" on the various people he had encountered at the parking lot of Uncle Charlie's, a bar the band used to play at frequently before they hit it big.<ref name=Char2>[http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&A: September 19, 2016]</ref><ref name=Char>[http://www.hueylewisandthenews.com/wp/?page_id=1038 Huey Lewis Fan Q&A: October 17, 2016]</ref>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{tracklist\n| title1          = [[The Heart of Rock & Roll]]\n| writer1         = [[Johnny Colla]], [[Huey Lewis]]\n| length1         = 5:04\n| title2          = [[Heart and Soul (Huey Lewis and the News song)|Heart and Soul]]\n| writer2         = [[Mike Chapman]], [[Nicky Chinn]]\n| length2         = 4:13\n| title3          = Bad Is Bad\n| writer3         = Alex Call, John Ciambotti, Sean Hopper, Lewis, [[John McFee]], Michael Schriener\n| length3         = 3:48\n| title4          = [[I Want a New Drug]]\n| writer4         = Chris Hayes, Lewis\n| length4         = 4:46\n| title5          = [[Walking on a Thin Line (song)|Walking on a Thin Line]]\n| writer5         = Andre Pessis, Kevin Wells\n| length5         = 5:11\n| title6          = Finally Found a Home\n| writer6         = Bob Brown, Hayes, Lewis\n| length6         = 3:43\n| title7          = [[If This Is It (Huey Lewis and the News song)|If This Is It]]\n| writer7         = Colla, Lewis\n| length7         = 3:54\n| title8          = You Crack Me Up\n| writer8         = Mario Cipollina, Lewis\n| length8         = 3:42\n| title9          = [[Honky Tonk Blues]]\n| writer9         = [[Hank Williams]]\n| length9         = 3:26\n}}\n\n===1999 Expanded Edition===\nA remastered \"Expanded Edition\" of ''Sports'' was released on June 29, 1999, and included the following session takes and live versions of their hit singles as bonus tracks.\n\n{{tracklist\n| title10         = The Heart of Rock & Roll\n| note10          = Session Take\n| length10        = 5:12\n| title11         = Walking on a Thin Line\n| note11          = Session Take\n| length11        = 5:39\n| title12         = If This Is It\n| note12          = Live in San Francisco, 2/21/85\n| length12        = 4:25\n| title13         = Heart and Soul\n| note13          = Live in San Francisco, 2/21/85\n| length13        = 4:25\n| title14         = I Want a New Drug\n| note14          = Live in Los Angeles, 1/15/84\n| length14        = 5:27\n}}\n\n===30th Anniversary Edition===\nOn May 14, 2013, a two-disc 30th Anniversary Edition of ''Sports'' was released, the first disc being a digitally remastered version of the original ''Sports'' album.

The fifth and final single from the album, \"[[Walking on a Thin Line (song)|Walking on a Thin Line]]\", was released in December 1984 and peaked at number 18.

The number of residents has been about 900 for ages. According to a [[legend]], the village got its name from [[Matthias Corvinus|King Matthias]] who spent a lot of time in [[V\u00e1rpalota]]. On one of these occasions, he located prisoners onto the hill that was supposedly the [[habitat]] of [[bear]]s in those days. While  selecting the prisoners, he kept repeating \u2019You too, you too\u2019 that is in Hungarian \u2019Te is m\u00e9sz, te is m\u00e9sz, te is, te is, te is.\u2019 The name of the village, T\u00e9s was born from the contraction of \u2019te is\u2019. Of course this is just a folktale, in point of fact the origin of the name of the village is unknown.\n\nThe first written document, which mentions the village under the name of Tehes, is from 1086. The settlement didn\u2019t have a constant landowner. It was the property of the Benedictine [[Bakonyb\u00e9l Abbey]], it also belonged to the Bakonyi Erd\u0151isp\u00e1ns\u00e1g and paid taxes to almost everybody who had ever been the master of the land.\n\nDuring the [[History of Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] the number of residents decreased incredibly, what\u2019s more, at the time of [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence]] it also fell, hence, hardly any residents remained alive in the village. In the 18th century there were resettlements in several cases from the [[Baden|Princedom of Baden]], [[Saxony]] and different parts of Hungary.\n\nIt was primarily the difficult traffic that prevented T\u00e9s from improvement. It was burdensome to get to the commanding plateau by animal-drawn vehicles. The construction of the Hungarian-Western railway line was finished in 1872. Thanks to this railway, whose distance was 15&nbsp;km from the village, people could reach the other parts of the country. At that time, the nearest villages could be approached on foot or by horse only. The first [[public transport]] vehicles started to operate in 1956, which meant two buses a day.\n\nIt was just the beginning of the development of the infrastructure of the village. First the open wire telephone line system was set up in 1886, then in 1996\u20131997 it was changed to [[optical fiber cable|optical cables]]. Postal services are available for the residents since the end of the 19th century.\n\nAt the same time the first shop was also opened. Shopkeepers transported the goods on foot, later by horse. The \u2019Hangya\u2019 co-op store was opened in 1925.\n\nThe education in the settlement has a 250-year-old history. The village had an own primary school from 1737 to 2005. The local government decided to close it due to the low number of students.\n\n== Sights ==\n\n=== The Windmills ===\n[[File:Windmill T\u00e9s Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|Windmill near T\u00e9s.]]\nThe six-shoveled [[windmill]]s are the main attractions of T\u00e9s. Once there were 4 windmills, but today there is no trace of the Rotter and Vaszlav windmills. Only one of the remaining two windmills is in operational status. The windmills are in the gardens of T\u00e1ncsics street.\n\nThe Helt windmill was built in 1840 by J\u00e1nos Pircher. This is a round-shaped, three-storey building, made of rock. It has tapered, shingle roof, which can be rotated, nice, small windows and it is pushed by a six-sailed pinwheel. There are two pairs of [[millstone]]s in the windmill and they can mill 4 [[quintal]]s a day.\n\nThe windmill, which was built in 1924 by J\u00e1nos Ozi, is 200 m away from the Helt windmill. The structure of the windmill is the same, the only difference is that in the Ozi windmill there is only one pair of millstones. The windmills are protected national monuments, and they can be visited all year long.\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe first church of the village was built before 1276 in pursuance of King Istv\u00e1n\u2019s command, which said: Every ten villages must have a church built by rock. T\u00e9s was a churched settlement, it had a church and also a priest, therefore it was called Egyh\u00e1zast\u00e9s until 1566. The village has a Catholic and an Evangelical church today.\n\n==== The Catholic church ====\nThe middle part of the present catholic church was renovated in 1725 by Earl Ferenc Bertram Nesszelrode. He was the provost of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The church proved close, so J\u00e1nos Horv\u00e1th, bishop of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, like a patron, started to expand it in 1834. After his dead, the bedchamber continued the construction. It was finished in 1837. In that year the church was re-sanctified, and St. Istv\u00e1n became its patron saint. The original vestry converted to a chapel, in which an altar was set up. Above the altar there was made an oratorio. Its furnishing consist of baroque altar-piece, plait pulpit, baroque crucifix, and a plait christening fount. Its oldest picture is in the right side of the nave. It shows Jesus hanging on the cross and it is from the 16th century.\n\n==== The Evangelical church ====\nThe construction of the Evangelical church begun in 1785 and it was finished in 1786. The organ was bought in 1806 and the bells in 1808. In 1864 the church was fully renovated,  and it was also at that time when the tower was built. Its furnishing consists of a baroque altarpiece and a marble-adorned pulpit. Gy\u00f6rgy Tarl\u00f3si was the first known evangelical clergyman of T\u00e9s.\n\n=== The Alba Regia cave ===\nThe Alba Regia cave is the third deepest cave in the country. Its exploration was begun in 1975 and due to the hostile environment it took for quite a long time. In October, the entrance test hole, which depth is almost five meters, was dug. Exploratories went along the next 30 metres through strait routes full of scree. Then, beyond some crannies, they reached the so-called \"Explorer branch\" of the cave in which the first stalagmites could be seen. At the bottom of the test hole, sunk in extremely difficult circumstances, the channel was opened on 24 October. The air temperature of the inner passages of Cave Alba Regia is about 7 degrees lower than the Hungarian average 8,1-8,5&nbsp;\u00b0C. During the exploration, the strong enrichment of carbon dioxide in some passages became apparent. It is Istvan Eszterhas who collects and converses the wildlife of the cave that was wholly closed until its discovery.  He started trapping in 1976, and even in that year he could differentiate between 21 species. In 1977, the number of cave creatures increased to 56, and in 1979, it was as high as 70. The cave can be visited only with a permission and a professional guide.\n\n=== \u2019R\u00f3mai f\u00fcrd\u0151\u2019 ===\nThe Gaja runnel cut the limestone face deep and created the breakthrough called \u2019R\u00f3mai f\u00fcrd\u0151\u2019, which like the other breakthroughs around here is very spectacular and romantic.

The number of residents has been about 900 for ages. According to a [[legend]], the village got its name from [[Matthias Corvinus|King Matthias]] who spent a lot of time in [[V\u00e1rpalota]]. On one of these occasions, he located prisoners onto the hill that was supposedly the [[habitat]] of [[bear]]s in those days. While  selecting the prisoners, he kept repeating \u2019You too, you too\u2019 that is in Hungarian \u2019Te is m\u00e9sz, te is m\u00e9sz, te is, te is, te is.\u2019 The name of the village, T\u00e9s was born from the contraction of \u2019te is\u2019. Of course this is just a folktale, in point of fact the origin of the name of the village is unknown.\n\nThe first written document, which mentions the village under the name of Tehes, is from 1086. The settlement didn\u2019t have a constant landowner. It was the property of the Benedictine [[Bakonyb\u00e9l Abbey]], it also belonged to the Bakonyi Erd\u0151isp\u00e1ns\u00e1g and paid taxes to almost everybody who had ever been the master of the land.\n\nDuring the [[History of Ottoman Hungary|Turkish occupation]] the number of residents decreased incredibly, what\u2019s more, at the time of [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War for Independence]] it also fell, hence, hardly any residents remained alive in the village. In the 18th century there were resettlements in several cases from the [[Baden|Princedom of Baden]], [[Saxony]] and different parts of Hungary.\n\nIt was primarily the difficult traffic that prevented T\u00e9s from improvement. It was burdensome to get to the commanding plateau by animal-drawn vehicles. The construction of the Hungarian-Western railway line was finished in 1872. Thanks to this railway, whose distance was 15&nbsp;km from the village, people could reach the other parts of the country. At that time, the nearest villages could be approached on foot or by horse only. The first [[public transport]] vehicles started to operate in 1956, which meant two buses a day.\n\nIt was just the beginning of the development of the infrastructure of the village. First the open wire telephone line system was set up in 1886, then in 1996\u20131997 it was changed to [[optical fiber cable|optical cables]]. Postal services are available for the residents since the end of the 19th century.\n\nAt the same time the first shop was also opened. Shopkeepers transported the goods on foot, later by horse. The \u2019Hangya\u2019 co-op store was opened in 1925.\n\nThe education in the settlement has a 250-year-old history. The village had an own primary school from 1737 to 2005. The local government decided to close it due to the low number of students.\n\n== Sights ==\n\n=== The Windmills ===\n[[File:Windmill T\u00e9s Hungary.jpg|thumb|left|Windmill near T\u00e9s.]]\nThe six-shoveled [[windmill]]s are the main attractions of T\u00e9s. Once there were 4 windmills, but today there is no trace of the Rotter and Vaszlav windmills. Only one of the remaining two windmills is in operational status. The windmills are in the gardens of T\u00e1ncsics street.\n\nThe Helt windmill was built in 1840 by J\u00e1nos Pircher. This is a round-shaped, three-storey building, made of rock. It has tapered, shingle roof, which can be rotated, nice, small windows and it is pushed by a six-sailed pinwheel. There are two pairs of [[millstone]]s in the windmill and they can mill 4 [[quintal]]s a day.\n\nThe windmill, which was built in 1924 by J\u00e1nos Ozi, is 200 m away from the Helt windmill. The structure of the windmill is the same, the only difference is that in the Ozi windmill there is only one pair of millstones. The windmills are protected national monuments, and they can be visited all year long.\n\n=== Churches ===\nThe first church of the village was built before 1276 in pursuance of King Istv\u00e1n\u2019s command, which said: Every ten villages must have a church built by rock. T\u00e9s was a churched settlement, it had a church and also a priest, therefore it was called Egyh\u00e1zast\u00e9s until 1566. The village has a Catholic and an Evangelical church today.\n\n==== The Catholic church ====\nThe middle part of the present catholic church was renovated in 1725 by Earl Ferenc Bertram Nesszelrode. He was the provost of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The church proved close, so J\u00e1nos Horv\u00e1th, bishop of Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r, like a patron, started to expand it in 1834. After his dead, the bedchamber continued the construction. It was finished in 1837. In that year the church was re-sanctified, and St. Istv\u00e1n became its patron saint. The original vestry converted to a chapel, in which an altar was set up. Above the altar there was made an oratorio. Its furnishing consist of baroque altar-piece, plait pulpit, baroque crucifix, and a plait christening fount. Its oldest picture is in the right side of the nave. It shows Jesus hanging on the cross and it is from the 16th century.\n\n==== The Evangelical church ====\nThe construction of the Evangelical church begun in 1785 and it was finished in 1786. The organ was bought in 1806 and the bells in 1808. In 1864 the church was fully renovated,  and it was also at that time when the tower was built. Its furnishing consists of a baroque altarpiece and a marble-adorned pulpit. Gy\u00f6rgy Tarl\u00f3si was the first known evangelical clergyman of T\u00e9s.\n\n=== The Alba Regia cave ===\nThe Alba Regia cave is the third deepest cave in the country. Its exploration was begun in 1975 and due to the hostile environment it took for quite a long time. In October, the entrance test hole, which depth is almost five meters, was dug. Exploratories went along the next 30 metres through strait routes full of scree. Then, beyond some crannies, they reached the so-called \"Explorer branch\" of the cave in which the first stalagmites could be seen. At the bottom of the test hole, sunk in extremely difficult circumstances, the channel was opened on 24 October. The air temperature of the inner passages of Cave Alba Regia is about 7 degrees lower than the Hungarian average 8,1-8,5\u00b0C. During the exploration, the strong enrichment of carbon dioxide in some passages became apparent. It is Istvan Eszterhas who collects and converses the wildlife of the cave that was wholly closed until its discovery.  He started trapping in 1976, and even in that year he could differentiate between 21 species. In 1977, the number of cave creatures increased to 56, and in 1979, it was as high as 70. The cave can be visited only with a permission and a professional guide.\n\n=== \u2019R\u00f3mai f\u00fcrd\u0151\u2019 ===\nThe Gaja runnel cut the limestone face deep and created the breakthrough called \u2019R\u00f3mai f\u00fcrd\u0151\u2019, which like the other breakthroughs around here is very spectacular and romantic. The runnel running through the canyon is the most spectacular at the time of snowbreak with the small riffles and falls.\nThis beautiful place is a bit farer from the village, in the middle of the forest. A resting place belongs to the excursion place and you can fry bacon here. \u2019R\u00f3mai f\u00fcrd\u0151\u2019 is a perfect destination of a family trip on a Sunday afternoon. You can get there easily on foot from T\u00e9s or Bakonyn\u00e1na.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tes}}\n[[Category:Populated places in Veszpr\u00e9m County]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%A9s"}
