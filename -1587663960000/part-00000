Formerly, the 71st Infantry was a regiment of the New York State Militia and then the Army National Guard from 1850 to 1993. The regiment was not renumbered during the 1918 national reorganization due to being broken up to staff other units from 1917\u20131919,<ref name=Sut1>Sutliffe, pp. 1-4, 34-39</ref> and never received a National Guard number.\n\n==History==\nIn the fall of 1849, the Order of United Americans, related to the [[Know Nothing Party]], held a meeting to organize a \"distinctively American regiment.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/04/01/archives/seventyfirsts-new-home-the-regiment-takes-possession-of-its-armory.html \"Seventy-First's New Home\"].

Parker, [[Hamilton Fish|Hamilton W. Fish, Sr]], Hamilton W. Fish, Jr. and William Kellock, had political links to the [[Know-Nothing Party]]. Initially there were six companies recruited. One officer in A Company, Captain Parker, resigned after hearing a \"foreigner\" paraded with the \"American Rifles.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nIn Spring 1852, the American Rifles had eight companies, enough to be enrolled as a regiment of the state militia, and were assigned the regimental number of 71st. Its first commander was Colonel Abraham S. Vosburgh, previously its quartermaster. Vosburgh would remain commanding officer until his death on May 20, 1861. Henry P. Martin, previously adjutant, became lieutenant colonel in 1854. He would remain with the 71st through the first years of the Civil War. Its arsenal was located at Seventh Avenue and 35th Street.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nThe regiment became the \"American Guard\" in 1853 when their Ogden long rifles were replaced with muskets, which could carry bayonets. These, in turn, were replaced with Minie rifles in 1857.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nOn July 4, 1857, the regiment, along with the seventh New York, served as riot control personnel during the riots in the Sixth Ward between the [[Dead Rabbits]] and the Bowery Boys. During this action, Dead Rabbit leader Mickey Free was killed and the regiment captured an 8-lb howitzer from the rioters. The regiment was called into action again during the [[Bayley Seton Hospital#History|quarantine riot]] of September 1858 in Staten Island.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\"/><ref name=\"DNMA\">{{cite web|url=http://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/spanAm/infantry/71stInf/71stInfMain.htm|title=71st Regiment Infantry, New York Volunteers during the Spanish\u2013American War \u2013 NY Military Museum and Veterans Research Center|website=dmna.ny.gov}}</ref>\n\nIn 1858, the \"Light Guard,\" New York's oldest military unit, detached from the 55th New York and became A Company.

The 71st militia served in the defense of Harrisburg during the battle of Gettysburg.\n\n====Return to New York====\nAfter the battle, the 71st was recalled to New York City to help suppress the 1863 draft riots (the militia unit that was mobilized to defend Harrisburg, not the volunteer unit that was involved with the actual battle at Gettysburg). The regiment was mustered out of service in 1864. Many members of the 71st joined the 124th New York, which carried on the name \"The American Guard.\" and took part in the Petersburg campaign. Others joined other regiments.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\n===State duty===\nThe 71st also served to control the Orange riots of 1871, the railroad riots of July 1877, the switchmen's strike in Buffalo of August 1892, and the motorman's strike of 1895 in [[Brooklyn]].<ref name=\"DNMA\" />\n\nIn 1884, under accusations of financial mismanagement by Colonel Vose, 15 company-grade officers resigned.

A week of confusion and quartermaster incompetence delayed their shipment to Cuba. The 71st was bivouacked along with the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry, the \"Rough Riders\", in Tampa, who then stole a march on the 71st to steal their transport on the ''Tampa.'' The 71st's sea trip took two weeks<ref name=\"DNMA\"/> The confusion of this organization was cited as one of the reasons for the 1903 reforms of the Army and National Guard.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nThere were ten companies of the regiment, with 1,000 soldiers, organized into three battalions.\n\nArriving at Siboney, Cuba, on June 23, the 71st was brigaded with two regular regiments, the 6th and 16th Infantry Regiments in the First Brigade under Regular Army Brigadier General [[Hamilton S. Hawkins]], as part of General [[Jacob Ford Kent]]'s division, as part of the Fifth Corps under General Shafter. Although the 71st was regarded as one of the best National Guard regiments, it was equipped with obsolescent black powder rifles, and its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Wallace A. Downs, reported that one-third of his men had never fired a rifle before.<ref name=millis>Millis, Walter. ''The Martial Spirit''. 1931, Ayer Publishing. p. 285.

Colonel Downs, testified at a court of inquiry in 1899 that he had received no orders to advance since 10 a.m. and therefore held his men in reserve. He said the attack by Lawton's brigade on the right had been delayed, and Downs' last orders had been to wait until Lawton's attack was successful before moving forward. Colonel Reade<ref name=\"times1900\"/>  testified that he had to \"shove\" the 71st into the fight, though Company F commander Captain Malcolm Rafferty and 3rd Battalion commander Major Frank Keck responded immediately.

Smith, noting he was present on the battlefield.<ref name=\"times1899\"/> However, Colonel Downs and Major John Whittle resigned their commissions. Two more officers were reprimanded. The board was reviewed by then Governor [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who noted \"the greater part of the Seventy-First of their own free will took part in the storming of San Juan hill, and showed that no matter how cowardly their officers might be, they were willing to obey their country's call.\"<ref>Harrison, W.B.

Formerly, the 71st Infantry was a regiment of the New York State Militia and then the Army National Guard from 1850 to 1993. The regiment was not renumbered during the 1918 national reorganization due to being broken up to staff other units from 1917\u20131919,<ref name=Sut1>Sutliffe, pp. 1-4, 34-39</ref> and never received a National Guard number.\n\n==History==\nIn the fall of 1849, the Order of United Americans, related to the [[Know Nothing Party]], held a meeting to organize a \"distinctively American regiment.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1894/04/01/archives/seventyfirsts-new-home-the-regiment-takes-possession-of-its-armory.html \"Seventy-First's New Home\"].

Parker, [[Hamilton Fish|Hamilton W. Fish, Sr]], Hamilton W. Fish, Jr. and William Kellock, had political links to the [[Know-Nothing Party]]. Initially there were six companies recruited. One officer in A Company, Captain Parker, resigned after hearing a \"foreigner\" paraded with the \"American Rifles.\"<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nIn Spring 1852, the American Rifles had eight companies, enough to be enrolled as a regiment of the state militia, and were assigned the regimental number of 71st. Its first commander was Colonel Abraham S. Vosburgh, previously its quartermaster. Vosburgh would remain commanding officer until his death on May 20, 1861. Henry P. Martin, previously adjutant, became lieutenant colonel in 1854. He would remain with the 71st through the first years of the Civil War. Its arsenal was located at Seventh Avenue and 35th Street.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nThe regiment became the \"American Guard\" in 1853 when their Ogden long rifles were replaced with muskets, which could carry bayonets. These, in turn, were replaced with Minie rifles in 1857.<ref name=\"New York Times, April 1, 1894\" />\n\nOn July 4, 1857, the regiment, along with the seventh New York, served as riot control personnel during the riots in the Sixth Ward between the [[Dead Rabbits]] and the Bowery Boys. During this action, Dead Rabbit leader Mickey Free was killed and the regiment captured an 8-lb howitzer from the rioters.

The regiment was mustered out of service in 1864. Many members of the 71st joined the 124th New York, which carried on the name \"The American Guard.\" and took part in the Petersburg campaign.

Hawkins]], as part of General [[Jacob Ford Kent]]'s division, as part of the Fifth Corps under General Shafter. Although the 71st was regarded as one of the best National Guard regiments, it was equipped with obsolescent black powder rifles, and its commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Wallace A.

Headquarters Company of the 1st Battalion was detached to take part in the [[Battle of Attu|retaking of Attu Island]] in the [[Aleutian campaign]].  The 102d Engr Bn (CBT) also had its Company C serving in the Pacific Campaign.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nSergeant [[Charles A. MacGillivary]] of the 71st received the [[Medal of Honor]] for actions during the German Ardennes offensive of December 1944 near Woelfling, France, near the German border. On January 1, 1944, Sergeant MacGillivary was serving as company commander because of casualties among the officers. Ammunition was low and the company was pinned down. MacGillivary set out on his own to destroy the German machine guns menacing his company. He carried a sub-machine gun and grenades; when his submachine gun ran out of ammunition, he picked up a discarded weapon and continued the attack. MacGillivary wiped out the German positions and killed or wounded all of the defenders, at the cost of his left arm.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/30/us/c-a-macgillivary-83-dies-won-medal-of-honor.html |work=The New York Times |first=Richard |last=Goldstein |title=C.

It was called to state active duty in April 1979 to serve as prison guards at Taconic and [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women|Bedford Hills prison]]s during a correctional officers' strike.\n\nThe regiment's original armory was located at Park Avenue and 34th Street in Manhattan. It later moved to 125 West 14th Street.\n\nIn 1984, the Governor of New York, [[Mario Cuomo]], proposed disbanding the 71st and 106th Infantry to use their armory spaces for civilian purposes. The 71st Infantry Veterans' Association sued the state in court, stating that such realignment would violate state affirmative action guidelines since the 71st Infantry was predominantly black. The 71st received a favorable ruling.<ref>\"Court Order Rescues Historic Guard Unit,\" ''New York Times'', February 2, 1984</ref>\n\nOn August 31, 1993, the 71st disbanded as a National Guard unit.<ref name=\"veteran\"/> A detachment of the battalion in Batavia, New York, was kept on active duty.<ref>\"136 Guardsmen to stay active despite units' status\", ''Buffalo News'', February 12, 1993</ref> The First Battalion became a [[State Guard]] unit, serving with the 14th Infantry Brigade.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/09/AR2006080900262_pf.html |accessdate=January 14, 2008|title=U.S. Forces Repel Raid on Afghan Base |last=Garwood|first=Paul |publisher=The Washington Post}}</ref>\n\n==Symbols and traditions==\nThe regimental nickname is \"The American Guard.\" The regimental motto is \"Pro aris et pro focis,\" which can be translated \"For our homes and our families\" but see '[[Pro aris et focis]]'.

{"title_page": "Justice delayed is justice denied", "text_new": "{{short description|Legal maxim}}\n'''\"Justice delayed is justice denied\"''' is a [[legal maxim]]. It means that if [[Legal remedy|legal redress]] or [[Equitable relief|equitable relief]] is available for a party that has suffered some injury, but is not forthcoming in a timely fashion, it is effectively the same as having no redress at all. This principle is the basis for the right to a [[speedy trial]] and similar rights which are meant to expedite the legal system, because it is unfair for the injured party to have to sustain the injury with little hope for resolution. The phrase has become a rallying cry for [[law reform|legal reformers]] who view [[court]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[Judge|judge]]s, [[arbitrator]]s, [[administrative law judge]]s, [[commission]]s{{efn-ua|Defined broadly to include [[government agency]], [[regulatory agency]] or [[statutory authority]] that operates under the authority of a board of commissioners, including [[Independent agencies of the United States government]].}} or [[government]]s as acting too slowly in resolving legal issues either because the existing system is too complex or overburdened, or because the issue or party in question lacks political favour. Individual cases may be impacted by judicial hesitancy to make a decision. When a court takes a matter \"under advisement\" {{ndash}} awaiting the issuance of a [[judicial opinion]], [[Court order|order]] or [[judgement]] and forestalls final [[Adjudication|adjudication]] or resolution of a [[Motion (legal)|motion]] {{ndash}} the issue of timeliness of the decision comes into play.\n\n== Origin ==\nThere are conflicting accounts of who first noted the phrase.

[[Nachmanides]] understands the advice given by [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 18:22, to judge the people at all times, as suggesting that Israel needed more judges because potential litigants would otherwise suffer injustice due to their inability to find a judge to hear their case.<ref>[http://tmt.urj.net/archives/4jewishethics/052605.htm 10 Minutes of Torah.

For myself, I am resolved that my decree shall come speedily, if not instantly, after the hearing, and my signed decree speedily upon my decree pronounced. For it hath been a manner much used of late in my last lord's time, of whom I learn much to imitate, and some what to avoid; that upon the solemn and full hearing of a cause nothing is pronounced in court, but breviates are required to be made; which I do not dislike in itself in causes perplexed. ... And it was my father's ordinary word, 'You must give me time.' But yet I find when such breviates were taken, the cause was sometimes forgotten a term or two, and then set down for a new hearing, three or four terms after. And in the meantime the subject's pulse beats swift, though the chancery pace be slow. Of which kind of intermission I see no use, and therefore I will promise regularly to pronounce my decree within few days after my hearing; and to sign my decree at the least in the vacation after the pronouncing. For fresh justice is the sweetest. And to the end that there be no delay of justice, nor any other means-making or labouring, but the labouring of the counsel at the bar. ... My endeavour shall be to hear patiently, and to cast my order into such a mould as may soonest bring the subject to the end of his journey.<ref>{{cite book |title=THE WORKS OF FRANCIS BACON, Lord Chancellor of England A NEW EDITION: \n|first1=Basil |last1=Montagu |authorlink1=Basil Montagu |volume=XVI.

As Chief Justice of the United States [[Warren E. Burger]] noted in an address to the [[American Bar Association]] in 1970:\n<blockquote>\"A sense of confidence in the courts is essential to maintain the fabric of ordered liberty for a free people and three things could destroy that confidence and do incalculable damage to society: that people come to believe that inefficiency and delay will drain even a just judgment of its value; that people who have long been exploited in the smaller transactions of daily life come to believe that courts cannot vindicate their legal rights from fraud and over-reaching; that people come to believe the law \u2013 in the larger sense \u2013 cannot fulfill its primary function to protect them and their families in their homes, at their work, and on the public streets.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Burger |first1=Warren E. |date=August 24, 1970 |title=What's Wrong With the Courts: The Chief Justice Speaks Out (address to ABA meeting, Aug. 10, 1970) |work=[[U.S. News & World Report]] |volume=69 |number=8 |pages=68, 71}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nLack of a speedy and effective resolution (amidst a bewildering multiplicity of statutes and forums with overlapping [[jurisdiction]]) can cause unwarranted delay.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position.

Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

''[[Patterson v. Alabama|Patterson v. State of Alabama]]'' [1934] 294 U.S. 600, illustrates this position. It is important that the party claiming the relief or change of relief must have the same right from which either the first or the modified remedy may flow. Subsequent events in the course of the case cannot be constitutive of substantive rights enforceable in that very litigation ... but may influence the equitable jurisdiction to mould reliefs. Conversely, where rights have already vested in a party, they cannot be nullified or negated by subsequent events save where there is a change in the law and it is made applicable at any stage. [Citation omitted] ... Courts of justice may, when the compelling equities of a case oblige them, shape reliefs - cannot deny rights - to make them justly relevant in the updated circumstances. Where the relief is discretionary, Courts may exercise this jurisdiction to avoid injustice. Likewise, where the right to the remedy depends, under the statute itself, on the presence or absence of certain basic facts at the time the relief is to be ultimately granted, the Court, even in appeal, can take note of such supervening facts with fundamental impact....Where a cause of action is deficient but later events have made up the deficiency, the Court may, in order to avoid multiplicity of litigation, permit amendment and continue the proceeding, provided no prejudice is caused to the other side.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/639383/board-control-cricket-india-vs-netaji-club |title=''Board of Control for Cricket, India and anr.

In Bleak House Dickens invented a fictional legal case named ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'' in order to caricature the legal system of England, and the iniquity of Chancery chiefly takes the form of procrastination: \"Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on.

During the colonial period, there was an increase in the number of Chinese immigrants into the Philippines. The Spaniards restricted the activities of the Chinese and confined them to the [[Pari\u00e1n]] which was located near [[Intramuros]]. Most of the Chinese residents earned their livelihood as traders.\n\nMany of the Chinese who arrived during the Spanish period were Cantonese, who worked as labourers, but there were also Fujianese, who entered the retail trade. The Chinese resident in the islands were encouraged to intermarry with Filipinos, convert to Roman Catholicism and adopt Hispanic names, surnames and customs through the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' introduced by the Spaniards in the mid-19th century.\n\nDuring the [[United States]] colonial period, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of the United States was also applied to the Philippines.<ref name=\"the Chinese Exclusion Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/USA/ChineseExclusion.html|title=Chinese Exclusion Act: 1882|work=thenagain.info}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]] and the victory of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], many refugees who fled from Mainland China settled in the Philippines.

For that purpose, the Spaniards of the country, the Chinese mestizos, and the Filipinos shall be admitted with perfect equality as cadets of the military corps; the personal-service tax shall be abolished, or an equal and general tax shall be imposed, to which all the Spaniards shall be subject. This last plan appears to me more advisable, as the poll-tax is already established, and it is not opportune to make a trial of new taxes when it is a question of allowing the country to be governed by itself. Since the annual tribute is unequal, the average shall be taken and shall be fixed, consequently, at fifteen or sixteen reals per whole tribute, or perhaps one peso fuerte annually from each adult tributary person. This regulation will produce an increase in the revenue of 200,000 or 300,000 pesos fuertes, and this sum shall be set aside to give the impulse for the amalgamation of the races, favoring crossed marriages by means of dowries granted to the single women in the following manner. To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, Ioo pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos. Some mestizo and Filipino alcaldes-mayor of the provinces shall be appointed.

Mestizos and [[mulatto]]es born in Hispanic America living in the Philippines kept their legal classification as such, and usually came as indentured servants to the ''americanos''. The Philippine-born children of ''americanos'' were classified as ''filipinos''. Philippine-born children of mestizos and mulattoes from Hispanic America were classified based on patrilineal descent.\n\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] were referred to as ''Indios'' (for those of pure Austronesian descent) and [[negrito]]s. ''Indio'' was a general term applied to native Austronesians as a legal classification; it was only applied to Christianised natives who lived in proximity to the Spanish colonies. Persons who lived outside of Manila, Cebu, and areas with a large Spanish concentration were classified as such: ''naturales'' were baptised Austronesians of the lowland and coastal towns. Unbaptised Austronesians and Aetas who lived in the towns were classified as ''salvajes'' (savages) or ''infieles'' (infidels). ''Remontados'' (\"those who went to the mountains\") and ''tulisanes'' (bandits) were Austronesians and Aetas who refused to live in towns and moved upland. They were considered to live outside the social order as [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholicism]] was a driving force in everyday life as well as determinant of social class.\n\nThe Spanish legally classified the Aetas as ''negritos'', based on their appearance. The word term would be misinterpreted and used by future European scholars as an ethnoracial term in and of itself. Both Christianised Aetas who lived in the colony and unbaptised Aetas who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified ''negrito''. Christianised Aetas who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for ''indios''. Persons of Aeta descent were also viewed as being outside the social order as they usually lived in tribes beyond settlements and resisted conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe fluid nature of racial integration in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period was recorded by many travelers and public figures at the time, who were favorably impressed by the lack of racial discrimination, as compared to the situation in other European colonies.\n\nAmong them was Sir [[John Bowring]], Governor General of British Hong Kong and a well-seasoned traveler who had written several books about the different cultures in Asia. He described the situation as \"admirable\" during a visit to the Philippines in the 1870s:\n<blockquote>\nThe lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.<ref>Chester L. Hunt (1954) ''Sociology in the Philippine setting: A modular approach'', p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAnother foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:\n<blockquote>\n\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives. Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the humblest Dutchman. Not in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.\"<ref>Frederic H.

During the colonial period, there was an increase in the number of Chinese immigrants into the Philippines. The Spaniards restricted the activities of the Chinese and confined them to the [[Pari\u00e1n]] which was located near [[Intramuros]]. Most of the Chinese residents earned their livelihood as traders.\n\nMany of the Chinese who arrived during the Spanish period were Cantonese, who worked as labourers, but there were also Fujianese, who entered the retail trade. The Chinese resident in the islands were encouraged to intermarry with Filipinos, convert to Roman Catholicism and adopt Hispanic names, surnames and customs through the ''[[Cat\u00e1logo alfab\u00e9tico de apellidos]]'' introduced by the Spaniards in the mid-19th century.\n\nDuring the [[United States]] colonial period, the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of the United States was also applied to the Philippines.<ref name=\"the Chinese Exclusion Act\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thenagain.info/WebChron/USA/ChineseExclusion.html|title=Chinese Exclusion Act: 1882|work=thenagain.info}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]] and the victory of the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]], many refugees who fled from Mainland China settled in the Philippines.

To a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Filipino shall be given 100 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, Ioo pesos; to a Chinese mestizo woman who marries a Spaniard, 1,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Chinese mestizo, 2,000 pesos; to a Filipino woman who marries a Spaniard, 2,000 pesos; to a Spanish woman who marries a Filipino chief, 3,000 or 4,000 pesos.

It shall be ordered that when a Filipino chief goes to the house of a Spaniard, he shall seat himself as the latter's equal. In a word, by these and other means, the idea that they and the Castilians are two kinds of distinct races shall be erased from the minds of the natives, and the families shall become related by marriage in such manner that when free of the Castilian dominion should any exalted Filipinos try to expel or enslave our race, they would find it so interlaced with their own that their plan would be practically impossible.\"<ref name=\"Blair19152\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FrJEAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA86|title=The Philippine Islands, 1493\u20131898: Relating to China and the Chinese|author=Emma Helen Blair|publisher=A.H.

Mestizos and [[mulatto]]es born in Hispanic America living in the Philippines kept their legal classification as such, and usually came as indentured servants to the ''americanos''. The Philippine-born children of ''americanos'' were classified as ''filipinos''. Philippine-born children of mestizos and mulattoes from Hispanic America were classified based on patrilineal descent.\n\nThe [[indigenous peoples of the Philippines]] were referred to as ''Indios'' (for those of pure Austronesian descent) and [[negrito]]s. ''Indio'' was a general term applied to native Austronesians as a legal classification; it was only applied to Christianised natives who lived in proximity to the Spanish colonies. Persons who lived outside of Manila, Cebu, and areas with a large Spanish concentration were classified as such: ''naturales'' were baptised Austronesians of the lowland and coastal towns. Unbaptised Austronesians and Aetas who lived in the towns were classified as ''salvajes'' (savages) or ''infieles'' (infidels). ''Remontados'' (\"those who went to the mountains\") and ''tulisanes'' (bandits) were Austronesians and Aetas who refused to live in towns and moved upland. They were considered to live outside the social order as [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Catholicism]] was a driving force in everyday life as well as determinant of social class.\n\nThe Spanish legally classified the Aetas as ''negritos'', based on their appearance. The word term would be misinterpreted and used by future European scholars as an ethnoracial term in and of itself. Both Christianised Aetas who lived in the colony and unbaptised Aetas who lived in tribes outside of the colony were classified ''negrito''. Christianised Aetas who lived in Manila were not allowed to enter Intramuros and lived in areas designated for ''indios''. Persons of Aeta descent were also viewed as being outside the social order as they usually lived in tribes beyond settlements and resisted conversion to Christianity.\n\nThe fluid nature of racial integration in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial period was recorded by many travelers and public figures at the time, who were favorably impressed by the lack of racial discrimination, as compared to the situation in other European colonies.\n\nAmong them was Sir [[John Bowring]], Governor General of British Hong Kong and a well-seasoned traveler who had written several books about the different cultures in Asia. He described the situation as \"admirable\" during a visit to the Philippines in the 1870s:\n<blockquote>\nThe lines separating entire classes and races, appeared to me less marked than in the Oriental colonies. I have seen on the same table, Spaniards, Mestizos (Chinos cristianos) and Indios, priests and military. There is no doubt that having one Religion forms great bonding. And more so to the eyes of one that has been observing the repulsion and differences due to race in many parts of Asia. And from one (like myself) who knows that race is the great divider of society, the admirable contrast and exception to racial discrimination so markedly presented by the people of the Philippines is indeed admirable.<ref>Chester L. Hunt (1954) ''Sociology in the Philippine setting: A modular approach'', p. 118, Phoenix Pub. House</ref>\n</blockquote>\nAnother foreign witness was English engineer, Frederic H. Sawyer, who had spent most of his life in different parts of Asia and lived in Luzon for fourteen years. His impression was that as far as racial integration and harmony was concerned, the situation in the Philippines was not equaled by any other colonial power:\n<blockquote>\n\"... Spaniards and natives lived together in great harmony, and do not know where I could find a colony in which Europeans mixes as much socially with the natives. Not in Java, where a native of position must dismount to salute the humblest Dutchman. Not in British India, where the Englishwoman has now made the gulf between British and native into a bottomless pit.\"<ref>Frederic H. Sawyer (1900) [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/38081/38081-h/38081-h.htm ''The Inhabitants of the Philippines''], p. 125, New York.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern term and usage==\n{{Redirect|Tisoy|the 2019 tropical cyclone named by [[PAGASA]] as \"Tisoy\"|Typhoon Kammuri (2019)}}\nToday, the word ''mestizo'' is shortened as ''tisoy'' just as is the word [[Pinoy]] for Filipino.
