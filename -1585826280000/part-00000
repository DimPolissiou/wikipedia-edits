Santa Barbara: ABC Clio 2006.</ref> They were both from the [[House of Trast\u00e1mara]] and were second cousins, being both descended from [[John I of Castile]]; on marriage they were given a [[Dispensation (canon law)|papal dispensation]] to deal with [[consanguinity]] by [[Sixtus IV]]. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of [[Valladolid]]; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger. It is generally accepted by most scholars that the unification of [[Spain]] can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Spain was formed as a [[dynastic union]] of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms until the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] of 1707\u20131716. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local [[Feudalism|feudal lords]]. The title of \"[[Catholic Majesty|Catholic King and Queen]]\" was officially bestowed on Ferdinand and Isabella by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in 1494,<ref>Kamen, H. (2005) Spain 1469\u20131714: A Society of Conflict.

They met for the first time in Valladolid in 1469 and married within a week. From the start, they had a close relationship and worked well together. Both knew that the crown of Castile was \"the prize, and that they were both jointly gambling for it\". However, it was a step toward the unification of the lands on the [[Iberian peninsula]], which would eventually become Spain.\n\nThey were second cousins, so in order to marry they needed a [[papal dispensation]] that [[Pope Paul II]], an Italian pope opposed to Aragon's influence on the Mediterranean and to the rise of monarchies strong enough to challenge the Pope, refused to grant,<ref>Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos: la conquista del trono. Madrid: Rialp, 1989. {{ISBN|84-321-2476-1}}. \"La llegada al trono\"</ref> so they falsified a [[papal bull]] of their own. Even though the bull is known to be false, it is uncertain who was the material author of the falsification. Some experts point at [[Carrillo de Acu\u00f1a]], [[Archbishop of Toledo]], and others point at Antonio Veneris.<ref>Edwards, John. Isabel la Cat\u00f3lica, edad y fama. Madrid: Marcial Pons, 2004</ref> Pope Paul II would remain a bitter enemy of Spain and the monarch for all his life, and is attributed the quote, \"May all Spaniards be cursed by God, schismatics and heretics, the seed of Jews and Moors.\"<ref>Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos: la conquista del trono. Madrid: Rialp, 1989. {{ISBN|84-321-2476-1}}. \"La llegada al trono\" (paraphrased)</ref>\n\nIsabella's claims to it were not secure, since her marriage to Ferdinand enraged her half-brother [[Henry IV of Castile]] and he withdrew his support for her being his heiress presumptive that had been codified in the [[Treaty of the Bulls of Guisando]]. Henry instead recognized [[Joanna la Beltraneja|Joanna of Castile]], born during his marriage to [[Joanna of Portugal]], but whose paternity was in doubt, since Henry was rumored to be impotent. When Henry died in 1474, Isabella asserted her claim to the throne, which was contested by thirteen-year-old Joanna. Joanna sought aid of her husband (who was also her uncle), [[Afonso V of Portugal]], to claim the throne. This dispute between rival claimants led to the [[War of Castilian Succession|War of 1475\u20131479]]. Isabella called on the aid of Aragon, with her husband, the heir apparent, and his father, [[Juan II of Aragon]] providing it. Although Aragon provided support for Isabella's cause, Isabella's supporters had extracted concessions, Isabella was acknowledged as the sole heir to the crown of Castile.<ref>Peggy K.

The inscription above identifies them as \"Lord Ferdinand and Lady Isabella, Monarchs of Castile and of Aragon\".]]\nThe establishment of [[Polysynodial System|System of Royal Councils]] to oversee discrete regions or areas was Isabella succeeded to the throne of Castile in 1474 when Ferdinand was still heir-apparent to Aragon, and with Aragon's aid, Isabella's claim to the throne was secured. As Isabella's husband was king of Castile by his marriage and his father still ruled in Aragon, Ferdinand spent more time in Castile than Aragon at the beginning of their marriage. His pattern of residence Castile persisted even when he succeeded to the throne in 1479, and the absenteeism caused problems for Aragon. These were remedied to an extent by the creation of the [[Council of Aragon]] in 1494, joining the [[Council of Castile]] established in 1480. The Council of Castile was intended \"to be the central governing body of Castile and the linch-pin of their governmental system\" with wide powers and with royal officials who were loyal to them and excluded the old nobility from exercising power in it.<ref>Elliott, J.H. ''Imperial Spain''. New York: New American Library 1963, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>   The monarchs created the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478 to ensure that individuals converting to Christianity did not revert to their old faith or continue practicing it.  The [[:es:Consejo y Comisar\u00eda de Cruzada|Council of the Crusade]] was created under their rule to administer funds from the sale of crusading bulls. In 1498 after Ferdinand had gained control of the revenues of the wealthy and powerful [[Spanish military orders]], he created the [[:es:Consejo de las \u00d3rdenes|Council of Military Orders]] to oversee them. The conciliar model was extended beyond the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, with their grandson, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] establishing the [[Council of the Indies]], the [[:es:Consejo de Hacienda|Council of Finance]], and the [[:es:Consejo de Estado (Espa\u00f1a)|Council of State]].\n\n==Domestic policy==\nThe Catholic Monarchs set out to restore royal authority in Spain.  To accomplish their goal, they first created a group named the [[Hermandad|Holy Brotherhood]]. These men were used as a judicial police force for Castile, as well as to attempt to keep Castilian nobles in check. To establish a more uniform [[Judiciary|judicial system]], the Catholic Monarchs created the [[Royal Council]], and appointed magistrates (judges) to run the towns and cities. This establishment of royal authority is known as the [[Pacification of Castile]], and can be seen as one of the crucial steps toward the creation of one of Europe's first strong nation-states. Isabella also sought various ways to diminish the influence of the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' in Castile, though Ferdinand was too thoroughly [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]] to do anything of the sort with the equivalent systems in the Crown of Aragon. Even after his death and the union of the crowns under one monarch, the Aragonese, Catalan, and Valencian ''Corts'' (parliaments) retained significant power in their respective regions. Further, the monarchs continued ruling through a form of medieval contractualism, which made their rule pre-modern in a few ways. One of those is that they traveled from town to town throughout the kingdom in order to promote loyalty, rather than possessing any single administrative center. Another is that each community and region was connected to them via loyalty to the crown, rather than bureaucratic ties.{{efn|The book ''Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance'' by Alexandra and Noble Cook provides a prime example of how loyalty to the crown was more important in that period than the specific governmental structure.}}\n\n==Religious policy==\n[[File:La Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos.jpg|thumb|upright|''Virgin of the Catholic Monarchs'', (painted ca. 1491\u20131493).

Painting of the 1900s.]]\nAlong with the desire of the Catholic Monarchs to extend their dominion to all the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, their reign was characterized by religious unification of the peninsula through militant Catholicism. Petitioning the pope for authority, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] issued a bull in 1478 to establish a [[Holy Office of the Inquisition]] in Castile. This was to ensure that Jews and Muslims who converted to Christianity did not revert to their previous faiths. The papal bull gave the sovereigns full powers to name inquisitors, but the papacy retained the right to formally appoint the royal nominees. The inquisition did not have jurisdiction over Jews and Muslims who did not convert. Since in the kingdom of Aragon it had existed since 1248, the Spanish Inquisition was the only common institution for the two kingdoms. Pope [[Innocent VIII]] confirmed Dominican [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]], a confessor of Isabella, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain, following in the tradition in Aragon of Dominican inquisitors. Torquemada pursued aggressive policies toward converted Jews ([[converso]]s) and [[moriscos]]. The pope also granted the Catholic Kings the right of [[Patronato real|patronage]] over the ecclesiastical establishment in Granada and the Canary Islands, which meant the control of the state in religious affairs.\n\nThe monarchs began a series of campaigns known as the [[Granada War]] (1482\u20131492), which was aided by Pope Sixtus IV's granting the tithe revenue and implementing a crusade tax so that the monarchs could finance the war. After 10 years of fighting the Granada War ended in 1492 when Emir [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Boabdil]] surrendered the keys of the Alhambra Palace in Granada to the Castilian soldiers. With the fall of Granada in January 1492, Isabella and Ferdinand pursued further policies of religious unification of their realms, in particular the expulsion of Jews who refused to convert to Christianity.\n\nAfter a number of revolts, Ferdinand and Isabella ordered the expulsion from Spain of all [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s.<ref>[http://users.mo-net.com/mlindste/alhambra.html Alhambra Decree] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416082647/http://users.mo-net.com/mlindste/alhambra.html |date=April 16, 2010 }}</ref> People who converted to Catholicism were not subject to expulsion, but between 1480 and 1492 hundreds of those who had converted (''[[conversos]]'' and ''[[moriscos]]'') were accused of secretly practicing their original religion ([[crypto-Judaism]] or [[crypto-Islam]]) and arrested, imprisoned, interrogated under torture, and in some cases [[Death by burning|burned to death]], in both Castile and Aragon.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe Inquisition had been created in the twelfth century by [[Pope Lucius III]] to fight [[heresy]] in the south of what is now France and was constituted in a number of European kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to Castile, and requested the Pope's assent. On 1 November 1478 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] published the [[Papal bull]] ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', by which the Inquisition was established in the Kingdom of Castile; it was later extended to all of Spain. The bull gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heresy in the Roman Catholic Church : a history|last=Thomsett|first=Michael|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|isbn=9780786444489|location=Jefferson, N.C|pages=139}}</ref> Many of these claims are thought to be exaggerated as a result of an anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic propaganda phenomenon known as [[Black legend (Spain)|The Black Legend]].\n\nDuring the reign of the Catholic Monarchs and long afterwards the Inquisition was active in prosecuting people for violations of Catholic orthodoxy such as crypto-Judaism, heresy, Protestantism, blasphemy, and bigamy. The last trial for crypto-Judaism was held in 1818.\n\nIn 1492 the monarchs issued a decree of expulsion of Jews, known formally as the [[Alhambra Decree]], which gave Jews in Spain four months to either convert to Catholicism or leave Spain.  Tens of thousands of Jews emigrated to other lands such as Portugal, North Africa, the Low Countries, Italy and the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n== Foreign policy ==\n{{Main|Spanish Empire}}\nAlthough the Catholic Monarchs pursued a partnership in many matters, because of the histories of their respective kingdoms, they did not always have unified viewpoint in foreign policy.  Despite that, they did have a successful expansionist foreign policy due to a number of factors. The victory over the Muslims in Granada allowed Ferdinand to involve himself in policy outside the Iberian peninsula.<ref>Edwards, ''The Spain of the Catholic Monarchs'', p. 241</ref>\n\nThe diplomatic initiative of King Ferdinand continued the traditional policy of the Crown of Aragon, with its interests set in the Mediterranean, with interests in Italy and sought conquests in North Africa.  Aragon had a traditional rivalry with [[France]], which had been traditional allies with Castile. Castile's foreign interests were focused on the Atlantic, making Castile's funding of the voyage of Columbus an extension of existing interests.<ref>Edwards. ''The Spain of the Catholic Monarchs'', p. 241</ref>\n\nCastile had traditionally had good relations with the neighboring Kingdom of Portugal, and after the Portuguese lost the [[War of the Castilian Succession]], Castile and Portugal concluded the [[Treaty of Alca\u00e7ovas]]. The treaty set boundaries for overseas expansion which were at the time disadvantageous to Castile, but the treaty resolved any further Portuguese claims on the crown of Castile. Portugal did not take advantage of Castile's and Aragon's focus on the reconquest of Granada. Following the reestablishment of good relations, the Catholic Monarchs made two strategic marriages to Portuguese royalty.\n\nThe matrimonial policy of the monarchs sought advantageous marriages for their five children, forging royal alliances for the long term benefit of Spain. Their first-born, a daughter named [[Isabella of Asturias|Isabella]], married [[Afonso, Prince of Portugal|Afonso of Portugal]], forging important ties between these two neighboring kingdoms that would lead to enduring peace and future alliance. [[Joanna of Castille|Joanna]], their second daughter, married [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]], the son of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. This ensured alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a powerful, far-reaching European territory which assured Spain's future political security. Their only son, [[John, Prince of Asturias|John]], married [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]], seeking to maintain ties with the Habsburg dynasty, on which Spain relied heavily. Their fourth child, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria]], married [[Manuel I of Portugal]], strengthening the link forged by Isabella's elder sister's marriage. Their fifth child, [[Catherine of Aragon|Catherine]], married [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] and heir to the throne of England, in 1501; he died at the age of 15 a few months later, and she married his younger brother shortly after he became King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1509. These alliances were not all long lasting, with their only son and heir-apparent John dying young; Catherine was divorced by Henry VIII; and Joanna's husband Philip dying young, with the widowed Joanna deemed mentally unfit to rule.\n \nUnder the Catholic Monarchs an efficient army loyal to the Crown was created, commanded by Castilian [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]], known as the '' Great Captain ''. Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba reorganized the military troops on a new combat unit, [[Tercio | tercios reales]], which entailed the creation of the first modern army dependent on the crown, regardless of pretensions of the nobles.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/crnicasdelgran00rodruoft '' Cr\u00f3nicas del Gran Capit\u00e1n ''] (1908), by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Villa.</ref>\n\n==Voyages of Columbus==\n[[File:Monumento a Col\u00f3n (Madrid) 02.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[:es:Monumento a Col\u00f3n (Madrid)|Monument to Columbus]], Statue commemorating [[New World]] discoveries.

[[:es:Plaza de Col\u00f3n|Plaza de Col\u00f3n]], Madrid (1881\u201385)]]\nThrough the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]], Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] received finances and was authorized to sail west and claim lands for Spain. The monarchs accorded him the title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and he was given broad privileges. His voyage west resulted in the European discovery of the [[New World|Americas]] and brought the knowledge of its existence to Europe. Columbus' first expedition to the supposed Indies actually landed in the [[Bahamas]] on October 12, 1492. Since Queen Isabella had provided the funding and authorization for the voyage, the benefits accrued to the Kingdom of Castile. \"Although the subjects of the Crown of Aragon played some part in the discovery and colonization of the New World, the Indies were formally annexed not to Spain but to the Crown of Castile.\"<ref>[[John Huxtable Elliott|Elliott, J.H.]] ''Imperial Spain 1479\u20131716''.

He continued onto [[Cuba]], naming it Juana, and finished his journey on the island of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, calling it [[Hispaniola]], or ''La Isla Espa\u00f1ola'' (\"the Spanish [Island]\" in Castilian).<ref name=\"McIntosh\">{{cite book |title=The Piri Reis Map of 1513 |first=Gregory C |last=McIntosh |publisher=[[University of Georgia Press]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-8203-2157-8 |page=88 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wgRXuOWah7MC&pg=PA88&dq=Hispaniola+Espa%C3%B1ola}}</ref>  On his second trip, begun in 1493, he found more Caribbean islands including [[Puerto Rico]]. His main goal was to colonize the existing discoveries with the 1500 men that he had brought the second time around. Columbus finished his last expedition in 1498, and discovered [[Trinidad]] and the coast of present-day [[Venezuela]]. The colonies Columbus established, and conquests in the Americas in later decades, generated an influx of wealth into the new unified state of [[Spain]], leading it to be the major power of Europe from the end of the sixteenth century until the mid-seventeenth century, and the largest empire until 1810.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Catholic Monarchs-Coffins.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Coffins of the Catholic Monarchs in the [[Royal Chapel of Granada|Capilla Real]], [[Granada]], Spain]]\nIsabella's death in 1504 ended the remarkably successful political partnership and personal relationship of their marriage. Ferdinand remarried [[Germaine of Foix]] in 1505, but they produced no living heir. Had there been one, Aragon would doubtless have been separated from Castile. The Catholic Monarchs' daughter Joanna succeeded to the crown of Castile, but was deemed unfit to rule and following the death of her husband Phillip the Fair, Ferdinand retained power in Castile as regent until his death. He died in 1516 and is buried alongside his first wife Isabella in Granada, the scene of their great triumph in 1492. Joanna's son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] (also Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) came to Spain, and until his mother's death she was nominal co-ruler of both Castile and Aragon. With her death, Charles succeeded to the territories that his grandparents had accumulated and brought the Habsburg territories in Europe to the expanding Spanish Empire.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spanish Empire]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{History of Spain}}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Catholic Monarchs}}\n* [http://countrystudies.us/spain/7.htm Country Studies]\n* Elliott, J.H., ''Imperial Spain, 1469\u20131716'' (1963; Pelican 1970)\n* Edwards, John.

Americas'', vol. 2, p. 725. Santa Barbara: ABC Clio 2006.</ref> They were both from the [[House of Trast\u00e1mara]] and were second cousins, being both descended from [[John I of Castile]]; on marriage they were given a [[Dispensation (canon law)|papal dispensation]] to deal with [[consanguinity]] by [[Sixtus IV]]. They married on October 19, 1469, in the city of [[Valladolid]]; Isabella was eighteen years old and Ferdinand a year younger. It is generally accepted by most scholars that the unification of [[Spain]] can essentially be traced back to the marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella. Spain was formed as a [[dynastic union]] of two crowns rather than a unitary state, as Castile and Aragon remained separate kingdoms until the [[Nueva Planta decrees]] of 1707\u20131716. The court of Ferdinand and Isabella was constantly on the move, in order to bolster local support for the crown from local [[Feudalism|feudal lords]]. The title of \"[[Catholic Majesty|Catholic King and Queen]]\" was officially bestowed on Ferdinand and Isabella by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in 1494,<ref>Kamen, H.

They met for the first time in Valladolid in 1469 and married within a week. From the start, they had a close relationship and worked well together. Both knew that the crown of Castile was \"the prize, and that they were both jointly gambling for it\". However, it was a step toward the unification of the lands on the [[Iberian peninsula]], which would eventually become Spain.\n\nThey were second cousins, so in order to marry they needed a [[papal dispensation]] that [[Pope Paul II]], an Italian pope opposed to Aragon's influence on the Mediterranean and to the rise of monarchies strong enough to challenge the Pope, refused to grant,<ref>Los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos: la conquista del trono. Madrid: Rialp, 1989. {{ISBN|84-321-2476-1}}. \"La llegada al trono\"</ref> so they falsified a [[papal bull]] of their own. Even though the bull is known to be false, it is uncertain who was the material author of the falsification. Some experts point at [[Carrillo de Acu\u00f1a]], [[Archbishop of Toledo]], and others point at Antonio Veneris.<ref>Edwards, John. Isabel la Cat\u00f3lica, edad y fama.

Henry instead recognized [[Joanna la Beltraneja|Joanna of Castile]], born during his marriage to [[Joanna of Portugal]], but whose paternity was in doubt, since Henry was rumored to be impotent. When Henry died in 1474, Isabella asserted her claim to the throne, which was contested by thirteen-year-old Joanna. Joanna sought aid of her husband (who was also her uncle), [[Afonso V of Portugal]], to claim the throne. This dispute between rival claimants led to the [[War of Castilian Succession|War of 1475\u20131479]]. Isabella called on the aid of Aragon, with her husband, the heir apparent, and his father, [[Juan II of Aragon]] providing it. Although Aragon provided support for Isabella's cause, Isabella's supporters had extracted concessions, Isabella was acknowledged as the sole heir to the crown of Castile.<ref>Peggy K.

As Isabella's husband was king of Castile by his marriage and his father still ruled in Aragon, Ferdinand spent more time in Castile than Aragon at the beginning of their marriage. His pattern of residence Castile persisted even when he succeeded to the throne in 1479, and the absenteeism caused problems for Aragon. These were remedied to an extent by the creation of the [[Council of Aragon]] in 1494, joining the [[Council of Castile]] established in 1480. The Council of Castile was intended \"to be the central governing body of Castile and the linch-pin of their governmental system\" with wide powers and with royal officials who were loyal to them and excluded the old nobility from exercising power in it.<ref>Elliott, J.H. ''Imperial Spain''. New York: New American Library 1963, pp. 88\u201389.</ref>   The monarchs created the [[Holy Office of the Inquisition|Spanish Inquisition]] in 1478 to ensure that individuals converting to Christianity did not revert to their old faith or continue practicing it.  The [[:es:Consejo y Comisar\u00eda de Cruzada|Council of the Crusade]] was created under their rule to administer funds from the sale of crusading bulls. In 1498 after Ferdinand had gained control of the revenues of the wealthy and powerful [[Spanish military orders]], he created the [[:es:Consejo de las \u00d3rdenes|Council of Military Orders]] to oversee them. The conciliar model was extended beyond the rule of the Catholic Monarchs, with their grandson, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] establishing the [[Council of the Indies]], the [[:es:Consejo de Hacienda|Council of Finance]], and the [[:es:Consejo de Estado (Espa\u00f1a)|Council of State]].\n\n==Domestic policy==\nThe Catholic Monarchs set out to restore royal authority in Spain.  To accomplish their goal, they first created a group named the [[Hermandad|Holy Brotherhood]]. These men were used as a judicial police force for Castile, as well as to attempt to keep Castilian nobles in check. To establish a more uniform [[Judiciary|judicial system]], the Catholic Monarchs created the [[Royal Council]], and appointed magistrates (judges) to run the towns and cities. This establishment of royal authority is known as the [[Pacification of Castile]], and can be seen as one of the crucial steps toward the creation of one of Europe's first strong nation-states. Isabella also sought various ways to diminish the influence of the ''[[Cortes Generales]]'' in Castile, though Ferdinand was too thoroughly [[Aragonese people|Aragonese]] to do anything of the sort with the equivalent systems in the Crown of Aragon. Even after his death and the union of the crowns under one monarch, the Aragonese, Catalan, and Valencian ''Corts'' (parliaments) retained significant power in their respective regions. Further, the monarchs continued ruling through a form of medieval contractualism, which made their rule pre-modern in a few ways. One of those is that they traveled from town to town throughout the kingdom in order to promote loyalty, rather than possessing any single administrative center. Another is that each community and region was connected to them via loyalty to the crown, rather than bureaucratic ties.{{efn|The book ''Good Faith and Truthful Ignorance'' by Alexandra and Noble Cook provides a prime example of how loyalty to the crown was more important in that period than the specific governmental structure.}}\n\n==Religious policy==\n[[File:La Virgen de los Reyes Cat\u00f3licos.jpg|thumb|upright|''Virgin of the Catholic Monarchs'', (painted ca. 1491\u20131493).

Painting of the 1900s.]]\nAlong with the desire of the Catholic Monarchs to extend their dominion to all the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula, their reign was characterized by religious unification of the peninsula through militant Catholicism. Petitioning the pope for authority, [[Pope Sixtus IV]] issued a bull in 1478 to establish a [[Holy Office of the Inquisition]] in Castile. This was to ensure that Jews and Muslims who converted to Christianity did not revert to their previous faiths. The papal bull gave the sovereigns full powers to name inquisitors, but the papacy retained the right to formally appoint the royal nominees. The inquisition did not have jurisdiction over Jews and Muslims who did not convert. Since in the kingdom of Aragon it had existed since 1248, the Spanish Inquisition was the only common institution for the two kingdoms. Pope [[Innocent VIII]] confirmed Dominican [[Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada]], a confessor of Isabella, as Grand Inquisitor of Spain, following in the tradition in Aragon of Dominican inquisitors. Torquemada pursued aggressive policies toward converted Jews ([[converso]]s) and [[moriscos]]. The pope also granted the Catholic Kings the right of [[Patronato real|patronage]] over the ecclesiastical establishment in Granada and the Canary Islands, which meant the control of the state in religious affairs.\n\nThe monarchs began a series of campaigns known as the [[Granada War]] (1482\u20131492), which was aided by Pope Sixtus IV's granting the tithe revenue and implementing a crusade tax so that the monarchs could finance the war. After 10 years of fighting the Granada War ended in 1492 when Emir [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Boabdil]] surrendered the keys of the Alhambra Palace in Granada to the Castilian soldiers. With the fall of Granada in January 1492, Isabella and Ferdinand pursued further policies of religious unification of their realms, in particular the expulsion of Jews who refused to convert to Christianity.\n\nAfter a number of revolts, Ferdinand and Isabella ordered the expulsion from Spain of all [[Jew]]s and [[Muslim]]s.<ref>[http://users.mo-net.com/mlindste/alhambra.html Alhambra Decree] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416082647/http://users.mo-net.com/mlindste/alhambra.html |date=April 16, 2010 }}</ref> People who converted to Catholicism were not subject to expulsion, but between 1480 and 1492 hundreds of those who had converted (''[[conversos]]'' and ''[[moriscos]]'') were accused of secretly practicing their original religion ([[crypto-Judaism]] or [[crypto-Islam]]) and arrested, imprisoned, interrogated under torture, and in some cases [[Death by burning|burned to death]], in both Castile and Aragon.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\nThe Inquisition had been created in the twelfth century by [[Pope Lucius III]] to fight [[heresy]] in the south of what is now France and was constituted in a number of European kingdoms. The Catholic Monarchs decided to introduce the Inquisition to Castile, and requested the Pope's assent. On 1 November 1478 [[Pope Sixtus IV]] published the [[Papal bull]] ''Exigit Sinceras Devotionis Affectus'', by which the Inquisition was established in the Kingdom of Castile; it was later extended to all of Spain. The bull gave the monarchs exclusive authority to name the inquisitors.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Heresy in the Roman Catholic Church : a history|last=Thomsett|first=Michael|publisher=McFarland|year=2011|isbn=9780786444489|location=Jefferson, N.C|pages=139}}</ref> Many of these claims are thought to be exaggerated as a result of an anti-Spanish and anti-Catholic propaganda phenomenon known as [[Black legend (Spain)|The Black Legend]].\n\nDuring the reign of the Catholic Monarchs and long afterwards the Inquisition was active in prosecuting people for violations of Catholic orthodoxy such as crypto-Judaism, heresy, Protestantism, blasphemy, and bigamy. The last trial for crypto-Judaism was held in 1818.\n\nIn 1492 the monarchs issued a decree of expulsion of Jews, known formally as the [[Alhambra Decree]], which gave Jews in Spain four months to either convert to Catholicism or leave Spain.  Tens of thousands of Jews emigrated to other lands such as Portugal, North Africa, the Low Countries, Italy and the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n== Foreign policy ==\n{{Main|Spanish Empire}}\nAlthough the Catholic Monarchs pursued a partnership in many matters, because of the histories of their respective kingdoms, they did not always have unified viewpoint in foreign policy.  Despite that, they did have a successful expansionist foreign policy due to a number of factors. The victory over the Muslims in Granada allowed Ferdinand to involve himself in policy outside the Iberian peninsula.<ref>Edwards, ''The Spain of the Catholic Monarchs'', p. 241</ref>\n\nThe diplomatic initiative of King Ferdinand continued the traditional policy of the Crown of Aragon, with its interests set in the Mediterranean, with interests in Italy and sought conquests in North Africa.  Aragon had a traditional rivalry with [[France]], which had been traditional allies with Castile. Castile's foreign interests were focused on the Atlantic, making Castile's funding of the voyage of Columbus an extension of existing interests.<ref>Edwards. ''The Spain of the Catholic Monarchs'', p. 241</ref>\n\nCastile had traditionally had good relations with the neighboring Kingdom of Portugal, and after the Portuguese lost the [[War of the Castilian Succession]], Castile and Portugal concluded the [[Treaty of Alca\u00e7ovas]]. The treaty set boundaries for overseas expansion which were at the time disadvantageous to Castile, but the treaty resolved any further Portuguese claims on the crown of Castile. Portugal did not take advantage of Castile's and Aragon's focus on the reconquest of Granada. Following the reestablishment of good relations, the Catholic Monarchs made two strategic marriages to Portuguese royalty.\n\nThe matrimonial policy of the monarchs sought advantageous marriages for their five children, forging royal alliances for the long term benefit of Spain. Their first-born, a daughter named [[Isabella of Asturias|Isabella]], married [[Afonso, Prince of Portugal|Afonso of Portugal]], forging important ties between these two neighboring kingdoms that would lead to enduring peace and future alliance. [[Joanna of Castille|Joanna]], their second daughter, married [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Handsome]], the son of Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]. This ensured alliance with the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a powerful, far-reaching European territory which assured Spain's future political security. Their only son, [[John, Prince of Asturias|John]], married [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]], seeking to maintain ties with the Habsburg dynasty, on which Spain relied heavily. Their fourth child, [[Maria of Aragon (1482-1517)|Maria]], married [[Manuel I of Portugal]], strengthening the link forged by Isabella's elder sister's marriage. Their fifth child, [[Catherine of Aragon|Catherine]], married [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] and heir to the throne of England, in 1501; he died at the age of 15 a few months later, and she married his younger brother shortly after he became King [[Henry VIII of England]] in 1509. These alliances were not all long lasting, with their only son and heir-apparent John dying young; Catherine was divorced by Henry VIII; and Joanna's husband Philip dying young, with the widowed Joanna deemed mentally unfit to rule.\n \nUnder the Catholic Monarchs an efficient army loyal to the Crown was created, commanded by Castilian [[Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]], known as the '' Great Captain ''. Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba reorganized the military troops on a new combat unit, [[Tercio | tercios reales]], which entailed the creation of the first modern army dependent on the crown, regardless of pretensions of the nobles.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/crnicasdelgran00rodruoft '' Cr\u00f3nicas del Gran Capit\u00e1n ''] (1908), by Antonio Rodr\u00edguez Villa.</ref>\n\n==Voyages of Columbus==\n[[File:Monumento a Col\u00f3n (Madrid) 02.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[:es:Monumento a Col\u00f3n (Madrid)|Monument to Columbus]], Statue commemorating [[New World]] discoveries.

[[:es:Plaza de Col\u00f3n|Plaza de Col\u00f3n]], Madrid (1881\u201385)]]\nThrough the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]], Genoese mariner [[Christopher Columbus]] received finances and was authorized to sail west and claim lands for Spain. The monarchs accorded him the title of Admiral of the Ocean Sea and he was given broad privileges. His voyage west resulted in the European discovery of the [[New World|Americas]] and brought the knowledge of its existence to Europe. Columbus' first expedition to the supposed Indies actually landed in the [[Bahamas]] on October 12, 1492. Since Queen Isabella had provided the funding and authorization for the voyage, the benefits accrued to the Kingdom of Castile. \"Although the subjects of the Crown of Aragon played some part in the discovery and colonization of the New World, the Indies were formally annexed not to Spain but to the Crown of Castile.\"<ref>[[John Huxtable Elliott|Elliott, J.H.]] ''Imperial Spain 1479\u20131716''.

His main goal was to colonize the existing discoveries with the 1500 men that he had brought the second time around. Columbus finished his last expedition in 1498, and discovered [[Trinidad]] and the coast of present-day [[Venezuela]]. The colonies Columbus established, and conquests in the Americas in later decades, generated an influx of wealth into the new unified state of [[Spain]], leading it to be the major power of Europe from the end of the sixteenth century until the mid-seventeenth century, and the largest empire until 1810.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Catholic Monarchs-Coffins.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Coffins of the Catholic Monarchs in the [[Royal Chapel of Granada|Capilla Real]], [[Granada]], Spain]]\nIsabella's death in 1504 ended the remarkably successful political partnership and personal relationship of their marriage. Ferdinand remarried [[Germaine of Foix]] in 1505, but they produced no living heir. Had there been one, Aragon would doubtless have been separated from Castile. The Catholic Monarchs' daughter Joanna succeeded to the crown of Castile, but was deemed unfit to rule and following the death of her husband Phillip the Fair, Ferdinand retained power in Castile as regent until his death. He died in 1516 and is buried alongside his first wife Isabella in Granada, the scene of their great triumph in 1492. Joanna's son [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] (also Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor) came to Spain, and until his mother's death she was nominal co-ruler of both Castile and Aragon. With her death, Charles succeeded to the territories that his grandparents had accumulated and brought the Habsburg territories in Europe to the expanding Spanish Empire.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spanish Empire]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{History of Spain}}\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Commons category|Catholic Monarchs}}\n* [http://countrystudies.us/spain/7.htm Country Studies]\n* Elliott, J.H., ''Imperial Spain, 1469\u20131716'' (1963; Pelican 1970)\n* Edwards, John.

Sarah becomes pregnant with Todd's baby, her second, at the age of sixteen. However, changes begin to show in Todd when he becomes infatuated with Sarah's older brother, Nick Tilsley. After a night out, Todd kisses a sleeping Nick, who wakes up and rebuffs him. Although Nick remains convinced that Todd is gay and insists that Sarah finish her relationship with him, Todd is able to pass the incident off as a misguided moment of drunken confusion. However, he later secretly embarks on a relationship with gay nurse, Karl Foster. They sleep together in Sarah's bed and Todd admits that he enjoys sneaking around behind Sarah's back. Karl ends their relationship when Todd refuses to break up with Sarah, wanting to have Sarah and his child at home and Karl as his \"bit on the side\". Todd then comes out as gay to Sarah. \n \t\t\nSarah then suffers a [[placental abruption]], caused by a pre-existing medical condition, and goes into premature labour. She has an emergency caesarean section and their son Billy is born, leaving them both on the critical list. Todd shows little concern for Sarah's wellbeing during this time and is only interested in Billy, demanding that Sarah take him to see him. Billy dies 24 hours after his birth and tensions escalate between the Platts and Grimshaws. Todd comes to terms with his sexuality, resumes his studies and is accepted to [[Oxford University]]. However, when Todd catches Sarah and his brother Jason together, he lashes out at Sarah, slapping her and throwing her out then fighting with Jason. In the aftermath, Todd moves to [[London]] and tells Sarah he hopes she finds someone who loves her as much as he did.\n \t\nTodd returns three years later for Jason's stag party. He tells Eileen he is in an open relationship with a man named Ben and has obtained his law degree and is doing temporary work. Jason informs Todd that Sarah's younger brother [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) sent Todd's invitation after forging Jason's handwriting. Todd is hurt as he thinks he has finally been accepted by Jason again, and is mortified about being tricked into returning. Before he can depart, Todd and Sarah cross paths when she arrives at the house and they argue. However, Jason convinces Sarah that Todd should stay otherwise David will have won. After Sarah throws a tantrum following Jason and Todd's drunken behaviour at the stag do, Todd confronts her and tells her to stop being selfish. They argue but work things out and promise to lay the past to rest. Todd attends the wedding and returns to London soon after. Todd later visits the street with his new wealthy boyfriend Jools and introduces him to Eileen. Eileen and Todd argue because he is ashamed of his working-class background. He leaves after making his apologies.\n\nTodd loses his job as a lawyer and returns to Weatherfield but fails to inform Eileen. A man named Alex then arrives and reveals Todd has stolen his money, cheated on Jools and is unemployed. Eileen is upset with Todd's lies but he manipulates Sean into helping reaffirm his place in the Grimshaw household. Todd enjoys causing trouble for Brian who has been keeping secrets from Julie. This annoys Marcus but Todd manipulates the situation and gains his trust. Todd tries to cause tension with Marcus and Maria, later attempts to kiss him but Eileen interrupts. Todd refuses to listen to her warnings revealing that he sees sleeping with Marcus as a challenge. He begins to disrupt Marcus and Maria's relationship and spends more time with them. Todd spreads a rumour that he is in love and Marcus becomes jealous. They sleep together, but Marcus warns Todd off, so Todd continues to manipulate him. He sets up a scenario in which Maria will catch them being intimate. Maria throws Marcus out, leaving Todd free to pursue Marcus for himself.\n\nTodd later starts a relationship with a gay vicar named Billy Mayhew, and they foster a girl named Summer, the daughter of Billy's ex-boyfriend who passed away.\n\nHe left Weatherfield in December 2017 and went on the run after assaulting a police officer.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2003, a survey was conducted to determine which fictional characters British landlords were like their tenants. 35% of landlords chose Todd and Sarah who represented teenagers struggling to pay rent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Midweek Home: Tenants from hell can take a terrible toll|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Midweek+Home%3a+Tenants+from+hell+can+take+a+terrible+toll.-a0107876506|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=17 September 2003}}</ref> A reporter from ''[[Hello (magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine has branded Todd a \"unlucky-in-love, relationship-challenged\" character whose life is blighted with problems.<ref name=ello>{{cite web|title=Corrie actor Todd Grimshaw revelling in his new role as dad|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2007/10/12/corrie-bruno-baby/|work=[[Hello (magazine)|HELLO!]]|publisher=(Hello Limited)|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=5 June 2013}}</ref> A [[Virgin Media]] writer branded him a \"sensitive hunk\".

The character's debut on-screen was broadcast on 14 January 2001. He was introduced as part of the Grimshaw family, formed around the established character [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]). Todd was the show's first ever gay character which generated much coverage in the British media. The [[coming out]] storyline was credited for helping ''Coronation Street'' portray a more accurate depiction of society in the 21st century.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nThe character's storylines have mainly focused on his relationships with [[Sarah-Louise Platt]] ([[Tina O'Brien]]), [[Karl Foster]] (Chris Finch), [[Marcus Dent]] ([[Charlie Condou]]) and [[Billy Mayhew]] ([[Daniel Brocklebank]]). Langley decided to leave the show in 2004 but returned for brief appearances in 2007 and 2011. The actor agreed to reprise the role on a permanent basis in 2013. Todd remained a part of the series until Langley's contract was terminated following personal issues.

Sarah becomes pregnant with Todd's baby, her second, at the age of sixteen. However, changes begin to show in Todd when he becomes infatuated with Sarah's older brother, Nick Tilsley. After a night out, Todd kisses a sleeping Nick, who wakes up and rebuffs him. Although Nick remains convinced that Todd is gay and insists that Sarah finish her relationship with him, Todd is able to pass the incident off as a misguided moment of drunken confusion. However, he later secretly embarks on a relationship with gay nurse, Karl Foster. They sleep together in Sarah's bed and Todd admits that he enjoys sneaking around behind Sarah's back. Karl ends their relationship when Todd refuses to break up with Sarah, wanting to have Sarah and his child at home and Karl as his \"bit on the side\". Todd then comes out as gay to Sarah. \n \t\t\nSarah then suffers a [[placental abruption]], caused by a pre-existing medical condition, and goes into premature labour. She has an emergency caesarean section and their son Billy is born, leaving them both on the critical list. Todd shows little concern for Sarah's wellbeing during this time and is only interested in Billy, demanding that Sarah take him to see him. Billy dies 24 hours after his birth and tensions escalate between the Platts and Grimshaws. Todd comes to terms with his sexuality, resumes his studies and is accepted to [[Oxford University]]. However, when Todd catches Sarah and his brother Jason together, he lashes out at Sarah, slapping her and throwing her out then fighting with Jason. In the aftermath, Todd moves to [[London]] and tells Sarah he hopes she finds someone who loves her as much as he did.\n \t\nTodd returns three years later for Jason's stag party. He tells Eileen he is in an open relationship with a man named Ben and has obtained his law degree and is doing temporary work. Jason informs Todd that Sarah's younger brother [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) sent Todd's invitation after forging Jason's handwriting. Todd is hurt as he thinks he has finally been accepted by Jason again, and is mortified about being tricked into returning. Before he can depart, Todd and Sarah cross paths when she arrives at the house and they argue. However, Jason convinces Sarah that Todd should stay otherwise David will have won. After Sarah throws a tantrum following Jason and Todd's drunken behaviour at the stag do, Todd confronts her and tells her to stop being selfish. They argue but work things out and promise to lay the past to rest. Todd attends the wedding and returns to London soon after. Todd later visits the street with his new wealthy boyfriend Jools and introduces him to Eileen. Eileen and Todd argue because he is ashamed of his working-class background. He leaves after making his apologies.\n\nTodd loses his job as a lawyer and returns to Weatherfield but fails to inform Eileen. A man named Alex then arrives and reveals Todd has stolen his money, cheated on Jools and is unemployed. Eileen is upset with Todd's lies but he manipulates Sean into helping reaffirm his place in the Grimshaw household. Todd enjoys causing trouble for Brian who has been keeping secrets from Julie. This annoys Marcus but Todd manipulates the situation and gains his trust. Todd tries to cause tension with Marcus and Maria, later attempts to kiss him but Eileen interrupts. Todd refuses to listen to her warnings revealing that he sees sleeping with Marcus as a challenge. He begins to disrupt Marcus and Maria's relationship and spends more time with them. Todd spreads a rumour that he is in love and Marcus becomes jealous. They sleep together, but Marcus warns Todd off, so Todd continues to manipulate him. He sets up a scenario in which Maria will catch them being intimate. Maria throws Marcus out, leaving Todd free to pursue Marcus for himself.\n\nTodd later starts a relationship with a gay vicar named Billy Mayhew, and they foster a girl named Summer, the daughter of Billy's ex-boyfriend who passed away.\n\nHe left Weatherfield in December 2017 and went on the run after assaulting a police officer.\n\n==Reception==\nIn 2003, a survey was conducted to determine which fictional characters British landlords were like their tenants. 35% of landlords chose Todd and Sarah who represented teenagers struggling to pay rent.<ref>{{cite web|title=Midweek Home: Tenants from hell can take a terrible toll|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Midweek+Home%3a+Tenants+from+hell+can+take+a+terrible+toll.-a0107876506|work=[[Liverpool Echo]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=17 September 2003}}</ref> A reporter from ''[[Hello (magazine)|Hello!]]'' magazine has branded Todd a \"unlucky-in-love, relationship-challenged\" character whose life is blighted with problems.<ref name=ello>{{cite web|title=Corrie actor Todd Grimshaw revelling in his new role as dad|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2007/10/12/corrie-bruno-baby/|work=[[Hello (magazine)|HELLO!]]|publisher=(Hello Limited)|date=12 October 2007|accessdate=5 June 2013}}</ref> A [[Virgin Media]] writer branded him a \"sensitive hunk\".

Under the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the [[Kwantung Army]] had the right to occupy southern Manchuria while the region fell into the Japanese economic sphere of influence.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=31}} The Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company had a market capitalization of 200 million yen, making it Asia's largest corporation, which went beyond just running the former Russian railroad network in southern Manchuria to owning the ports, mines, hotels, telephone lines, and sundry other businesses, dominating the economy of Manchuria.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=31}} With the growth of the South Manchuria Railroad (''Mantetsu'') company went growth in number of Japanese living in Manchuria from 16,612 Japanese civilians in 1906 to 233,749 in 1930.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=33}} The majority of blue collar employees for the ''Mantetsu'' were Chinese, and the Japanese employees were mostly white collar, meaning most of the Japanese living in Manchuria were middle-class people who saw themselves as an elite.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=34}} Between World War I and World War II Manchuria became a political and military battleground between Russia, Japan, and China.

The [[Japanese military]] commander appointed [[Puyi]] as [[regent]] ([[reign name]] Datong) for the time being, stating that he would become Emperor of Manchukuo but could not reign using the title of [[Emperor of China|Emperor of the Great Qing Empire]] as he once held. Manchukuo was proclaimed a monarchy on 1 March 1934, with Puyi assuming the throne under the reign name of Emperor Kang-de. Puyi was assisted in his executive duties by a [[Privy Council]] ({{zh|\u53c3\u8b70\u5e9c}}), and a [[General Affairs State Council]] ({{zh|\u570b\u52d9\u9662}}). This State Council was the center of political power, and consisted of several cabinet ministers, each assisted by a Japanese vice-minister.\n\nThe [[commanding officer]] of the [[Kwantung Army]] in Manchukuo was also the Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo. He functioned in a manner similar to that of a British [[Resident (title)|resident officer]] in British overseas [[protectorate]]s, with the power to veto decisions by the emperor. The [[Kwangtung Army]] leadership placed Japanese vice ministers in his cabinet, while all Chinese advisors gradually resigned or were dismissed.\n\nThe [[Legislative Council]] ({{zh|\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662}}) was largely a ceremonial body, existing to rubber-stamp decisions issued by the [[General Affairs State Council|State Council]]. The [[one-party state|only authorized political party]] was the government-sponsored [[Concordia Association]], although various \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups were permitted their own political associations.\n\nThe American historian Louise Young noted that one of the most striking aspects of Manchukuo was that many of the young Japanese civil servants who went to work in Manchukuo were on the left, or at least had once been.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=269}} In the 1920s, much of the younger ''intelligentsia'' in Japan had rejected their parents' values, and had become active in various left-wing movements. Starting with the [[Peace Preservataion Law|Peace Preservation Law of 1925]], which made the very act of thinking about \"altering the ''[[kokutai]]'' a crime, the government had embarked on a sustained campaign to stomp out all left-wing thought in Japan. However, many of the bright young university graduates active in left-wing movements in Japan were needed to serve as civil servants in Manchukuo, which Young noted led the Japanese state to embark upon a contradictory policy of recruiting the same people active in the movements that it was seeking to crush.\"{{sfn|Young|1998|p=269}} To rule Manchukuo, which right from the start had a very statist economy, the Japanese state needed university graduates who were fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and the 1920s\u201330s, many of the university graduates in Japan who knew Mandarin were \"progressives\" involved in left-wing causes.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=278}} The fact that young Japanese civil servants in Manchukuo with their degrees in economics, sociology, etc., who had once been active in left-wing movements helps explain the decidedly leftist thrust of social and economic policies in Manchukuo with the state playing an increasingly large role in society.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=278}} Likewise, much of the debate between Japanese civil servants about the sort of social-economic policies Japan should follow in Manchukuo in the 1930s was framed in Marxist terms, with the civil servants arguing over whatever Manchuria prior to September 1931 had a \"feudal\" or a \"capitalist\" economy.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=293}} The American historian [[Joshua Fogel]] wrote about the young servants of Manchukuo: \"Tremendous debates transpired on such things as the nature of the Chinese economy, and the [[lingua franca]] of these debates was always Marxism\".{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=125}} To resolve this debate, various research teams of five or six young civil servants, guarded by detachments from the Kwantung Army of about 20 or 30 men, went out to do field research in Manchukuo, gathering material about the life of ordinary people, to determine Manchukuo was in the \"feudal\" or \"capitalist\" stage of development.{{sfn|Young|1998|pp=296\u2013297}} Starting in 1936, the Manchukuo state launched Five Year Plans for economic development, which were closely modeled after the Five Year Plans in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=298}}\n\nIn Manchukuo, the Japanese were creating a brand new state that was in theory independent, which meant that there were no limits upon the sort of policies that the new state could carry out, and many university graduates in Japan, who despite being opposed to the social system that existed in Japan itself, went to work in Manchukuo, believing that they could carry out reforms there that might inspire similar reforms in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|pp=269\u2013270}} This was especially the case since it was impossible to effect any reforms in Japan itself as the very act of thinking about \"altering the ''kokutai''\" was a crime, which led many leftist Japanese university graduates to go work in Manchukuo, where they believed they could achieve the sort of social revolution that was impossible in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=282}} By 1933, the Japanese state had essentially destroyed both the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party via mass arrests and ''[[Tenk\u014d]]'' with both parties reduced down to mere rumps, which caused many Japanese student leftists to draw the conclusion that change was impossible in Japan, but still possible in Manchukuo, where paradoxically the Kwantung Army was sponsoring the sort of policies that were unacceptable in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=294}} Moreover, the Great Depression had made it very difficult for university graduates in Japan to find work, which made the prospect of a well-paying job in Manchukuo very attractive to otherwise underemployed Japanese university graduates.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=302}} In Manchukuo, the Japanese state was creating an entire state anew, which meant that Manchukuo had a desperate need for university graduates to work in its newly founded civil service.{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=126}} In addition, the Pan-Asian rhetoric of Manchukuo and the prospect of Japan helping ordinary people in Manchuria greatly appealed to the idealistic youth of Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=302}} Young wrote about the young Japanese people who went to work in Manchukuo: \"The men, and in some cases, the women, who answered the call of this land of opportunity, brought with them tremendous drive and ambition. In their efforts to remake their own lives, they remade an empire. They invested it with their preoccupations of modernity and their dreams of an Utopian future. They pushed it to embrace an idealist rhetoric of social reform and justified itself in terms of Chinese nationalist aspiration.

This was precisely at the time when Marxism had been all but banned in Japan, when (as Yamada G\u014dichi put) if the expression ''shakai'' (social) appeared in the title of a book, it was usually confiscated\".{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=126}}\n\nYoung also noted\u2014with reference to Lord Acton's dictum that \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\"\u2014that for many of the idealistic young Japanese civil servants, who believed that they could effect a \"revolution from above\" that would make the lives of ordinary people better, that the absolute power that they enjoyed over millions of people \"went to their heads\", causing them to behave with abusive arrogance towards the very people that they had gone to Manchukuo to help.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=298}} Young wrote that it was a \"monumental conceit\" of the part of the young idealists to believe that they could use the Kwantung Army to achieve a \"revolution from above\", when it was the Kwantung Army that was using them.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=298}} The ambitious plans for land reform in Manchukuo were vetoed by the Kwantung Army for precisely the reason that it might inspire similar reforms in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=299}} The landlords in Japan tended to come from families who once belonged to the samurai caste, and almost all of the officers in the Imperial Japanese Army came from samurai families, which made the Kwantung Army very hostile towards any sort of land reform which might serve as an example for Japanese peasants. In October 1941, the Soviet spy ring headed by [[Richard Sorge]] was uncovered in Tokyo, which caused the authorities to become paranoid about Soviet espionage, and led to new crackdown on the left. In November 1941, the Social Research Unit of the South Manchurian Railroad Company, which was well known as a hotbed of Marxism since the early 1930s, was raided by the ''[[Kenpeitai]]'', who arrested 50 of those working in the Social Research Unit.{{sfn|Hotta|2007|p=128}} At least 44 of those working in the Social Research Unit were convicted of violating the Peace Preservation Law, which made thinking about \"altering the ''kokutai''\" a crime in 1942\u201343 and were given long prison sentences, of whom four died due to the harsh conditions of prisons in Manchukuo.{{sfn|Hotta|2007|p=126}} As the men working in the Social Research Unit had played important roles in Manchukuo's economic policy and were university graduates from good families, the Japanese historian Hotta Eri wrote that the ''Kenpeitai'' were ordered to \"handle them with care\", meaning no torture of the sort that the ''Kenpeitai'' normally employed in its investigations.{{sfn|Hotta|2007|p=126}}\n\nWhen the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] was announced on 15 August 1945, Puyi agreed to abdicate.\n\n=== Head of State ===\n{{Infobox former monarchy\n|royal_title       = Emperor\n|realm             = Manchukuo\n|border            = imperial\n|coatofarms        = Flag of the Emperor of Manchukuo.svg\n|coatofarmssize    = 120px\n|coatofarmscaption = '''Imperial Standard'''\n|image             = Pu Yi, Qing dynasty, China, Last emperor.jpg\n|caption           = '''K\u0101ngd\u00e9'''\n|first_monarch     = [[Puyi]]\n|last_monarch      = [[Puyi]]\n|style             = [[Imperial Majesty (style)|His Imperial Majesty]]\n|residence         = [[Museum of the Imperial Palace of the Manchu State|Imperial Palace]]\n|appointer         = \n|began             = 1 March 1934\n|ended             = 15 August 1945\n}}\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Manchukuo''' 1932\u20131945\n|-\n!

Never in the chronicles of the human race was any State born with such high ideals, and never has any State accomplished so much in such a brief space of its existence as Manchukuo\".{{sfn|Behr|1987|p=218}}\n\nThe Japanese went out of their way to try to ensure that Manchukuo was the embodiment of modernity in all of its aspects, as it was intended to prove to the world what the Asian peoples could accomplish if they worked together. Manchukuo's legal system was based upon the Organic Law of 1932, which featured a 12 article Human Rights Protection Law and a supposedly independent judiciary to enforce the law.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=292}} The official ideology of Manchukuo was the ''wangdao'' (\"Kingly Way\") devised by a former mandarin under the Qing turned Prime Minister of Manchukuo [[Zheng Xiaoxu]] calling for an ordered Confucian society that would promote justice and harmony that was billed at the time as the beginning of a new era in world history.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=293}} The purpose of the law in Manchukuo was not the protection of the rights of the individual, as the ''wangdao'' ideology was expressly hostile towards individualism, which was seen as a decadent Western concept inimical to Asia, but rather the interests of the state by ensuring that subjects fulfilled their duties to the emperor.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=293\u2013294}} The ''wangdao'' favored the collective over the individual, as the ''wangdao'' called for all people to put the needs of society ahead of their own needs.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=293\u2013294}} Zheng together with the Japanese legal scholar Ishiwara Kanji in a joint statement attacked the Western legal tradition for promoting individualism, which they claimed led to selfishness, greed and materialism, and argued that the ''wangdao'' with its disregard for the individual was a morally superior system.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=751\u2013752}} The seemingly idealistic Human Rights Protection Law counterbalanced the \"rights\" of the subjects with their \"responsibilities\" to the state with a greater emphasis on the latter, just as was the case in Japan. The ''wangdao'' promoted Confucian morality and spirituality, which was seen as coming down from the Emperor Puyi, and as such the legal system existed to serve the needs of the state headed by Emperor Puyi, who could change the laws as he saw fit.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=294\u2013295}} In this regard it is noteworthy that Legislative Yuan had only the power of ''assisting'' the Emperor with making laws, being endowed with far less powers than even the Imperial Diet in Japan had, which had the power to reject or approve laws. It was often suggested at the time that the Legislative Yuan of Manchukuo was a model for the Imperial Diet in Japan, an idea [[Hirohito]], the Japanese emperor, was sympathetic to, but never took up.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=298}} Hirohito in the end preferred the Meiji constitution passed by his grandfather in 1889 as it gave the Emperor of Japan ultimate power while at the same time the fiction of the Imperial Diet together with a Prime Minister and his cabinet governing Japan gave the Emperor a scapegoat when things went wrong.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nInitially, the judges who had served the Zhangs were retained, but in 1934, the Judicial Law College headed by the Japanese judge Furuta Masatake was opened in Changchun, to be replaced by a larger Law University in 1937. Right from the start, the new applicants vastly exceeded the number of openings as the first class of the Law College numbered only 100, but 1,210 students had applied.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=752}} The legal system that the students were trained was closely modeled after the Japanese legal system, which in its turn was modeled after the French legal system, but there were a number of particularities unique to Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=753}} Law students were trained to write essays on such topics as the \"theory of the harmony of the five races [of Manchukuo]\", the \"political theory of the Kingly Way\", \"practical differences between consular jurisdiction and extraterritoriality\", and how best to \"realize the governance of the Kingly Way\".{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=753}} The Japanese professors were \"astonished\" by the \"enthusiasm\" which the students wrote their essays on these subjects as the students expressed the hope that the ''wangdao'' was a uniquely Asian solution to the problems of the modern world, and that Manchukuo represented nothing less than the beginning of a new civilization that would lead to a utopian society in the near-future.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=753}} The Japanese professors were greatly impressed with the Confucian idealism of their students, but noted that their students all used stock phrases to the extent it was hard to tell their essays apart, cited examples of wise judges from ancient China while ignoring more recent legal developments, and were long on expressing idealistic statements about how the ''wangdao'' would lead to a perfect society, but were short on how explaining just how this was to be done in practice.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=753\u2013754}}\n\nAn example of the extent of Japanese influence on the legal system of Manchukuo was that every issue of the ''Manchukuo Legal Advisory Journal'' always contained a summary of the most recent rulings by the Supreme Court of Japan, and the reasons why the Japanese Supreme Court had ruled in these cases.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=757}} However, there were some differences between the Manchukuo and Japanese legal systems. In Japan itself, corporal punishment had been abolished as part of the successful effort to end the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by citizens of the Western powers, but retained for the Japanese colonies of Korea and Taiwan.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=757}} However, corporal punishment, especially flogging, was a major part of the Manchukuo legal system with judges being very much inclined to impose floggings on low-income Chinese men convicted of minor offenses that would normally merit only a fine or a short prison sentence in Japan.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=757\u2013758}} Writing in a legal journal in 1936, Ono Jitsuo, a Japanese judge serving in Manchukuo, regretted having to impose floggings as a punishment for relatively minor crimes, but argued that it was necessary of Manchukuo's 30 million people \"more than half are ignorant and completely illiterate barbarians\" who were too poor to pay fines and too numerous to imprison.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=758}} In Taiwan and Korea, Japanese law was supreme, but judges in both colonies had to respect \"local customs\" in regards to family law.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=761}} In case of Manchukuo, a place with a Han majority, but those ideology proclaimed the \"five races\" of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus and Mongols as all equal, this led in effect to several family laws for each of the \"five races\" respecting their \"local customs\" plus the Russian and Hui Muslim minorities.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=762\u2013763}}\n\nThe Manchukuo police had the power to arrest without charge anyone who was engaged in the vaguely defined crime of \"undermining the state\".{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=300}} Manchukuo had an extensive system of courts at four levels staffed by a mixture of Chinese and Japanese judges. All of the courts had both two Japanese and two Chinese judges with the Chinese serving as the nominal superior judges and the Japanese the junior judges, but in practice the Japanese judges were the masters and the Chinese judges puppets.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=302}} Despite the claims that the legal system of Manchukuo was a great improvement over the legal system presided over by Marshal [[Zhang Xueliang]] the \"Young Marshal\", the courts in Manchukuo were inefficient and slow, and ignored by the authorities whenever it suited them.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=306}} In Asia, the rule of law and an advanced legal system are commonly seen as one of the marks of \"civilization\", which is why the chaotic and corrupt legal system run by Marshal Zhang was denigrated so much by the Japanese and Manchukuo media.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=306}} In the early 1930s, Manchukuo attracted much legal talent from Japan as Japanese Pan-Asian idealists went to Manchuria with the goal of establishing a world-class legal system.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}} As the Kwangtung Army had the ultimate power in Manchukuo, the best Japanese judges by the late 1930s preferred not to go to Manchukuo where their decisions could be constantly second-guessed, and instead only the second-rate judges went to Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}} By 1937 the Japanese judges and lawyers in Manchukuo were either disillusioned Pan-Asian idealists or more commonly cynical opportunists and mediocre hacks who lacked the talent to get ahead in Japan.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}} By contrast, the best of the ethnic Chinese law schools graduates in Manchukuo chose to work as part of Manchukuo's judicial system, suggesting many middle-class Chinese families were prepared to accept Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}}\n\nStarting with the Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely modeled after the Imperial cult in Japan where Hirohito was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=309}} Just as in Japan, schoolchildren began their classes by praying to a portrait of the emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=309}} As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=310}} As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=310}} In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed ''a priori''.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=310}}\n\nAnd again following the Japanese system, in 1937 a new category of \"thought crime\" was introduced declaring that certain thoughts were now illegal and those thinking these forbidden thoughts were \"thought criminals\".{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} People were thus convicted not for their actions, but merely for their thoughts.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} After the war with China began in July 1937, an \"emergency law\" was declared in Manchukuo, placing it under a type of martial law that suspended the theoretical civil liberties that existed up to that point, ordered the mobilization of society for total war, and increased the tempo of repression with the law on \"thought crimes\" being merely the most dramatic example.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} In April 1938, a new type of Special Security Courts were created for those charged with the five types of \"thought crime\".{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} On 26 August 1941, a new security law ruled that those tried before the Special Security Courts had no right of appeal or to a defense lawyer.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=312}} One Special Security Court in [[Jinzhou]] between 1942\u201345 sentenced about 1,700 people to death and another 2,600 for life imprisonment for \"thought crimes\", a figure that appears to be typical of the special courts.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=312\u2013313}} The police frequently used torture to obtain confessions and those tried in the Special Security Courts had no right to examine the evidence against them.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=312}} Starting in 1943 the number of those tried and convicted by the courts rose drastically, though the number of death sentences remained stable.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=313}} The rise in the number of convictions was due to the need for slave labor for the factories and mines of Manchukuo as the traditional supplies of slave labor from northern China were disturbed by World War II as most of those convicted were sentenced to work in the factories and mines.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=313\u2013314}} The American historian Thomas David Dubois wrote the legal system of Manchukuo went through two phrases: the first lasting from 1931 to 1937, when the Japanese wanted to show the world a state with an ultra-modern legal system that was meant to be a shining tribute to Asians working together in brotherhood; and the second from 1937 to 1945 when the legal system become more of a tool for the totalitarian mobilization of society for total war.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n== Economy ==\n{{Main|Economy of Manchukuo}}\n{{See also|Central Bank of Manchou|Manchukuo yuan|Manshukoku Hikoki Seizo KK|Manshukoku Koku KK|Showa Steel Works|Manchurian Industrial Development Company|Manchukuo Film Association}}\n[[File:Showa Steel Works.JPG|thumb|[[Showa Steel Works]] in the early 1940s]]\n\nManchukuo experienced rapid economic growth and progress in its social systems. During the 1920s, the Japanese Army under the influence of the ''Wehrstaat'' (Defense State) theories popular with the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had started to advocate their own version of the ''Wehrstaat'', the totalitarian \"national defense state\" which would mobilize an entire society for war in peacetime. An additional influence on the Japanese \"total war\" school who tended to be very anti-capitalist was the First Five Year Plan in the Soviet Union, which provided an example of rapid industrial growth achieved without capitalism. At least part of the reason why the Kwangtung Army seized Manchuria in 1931 was to use it as an laboratory for creating an economic system geared towards the \"national defense state\"; colonial Manchuria offered up possibilities for the army carrying out drastic economic changes that were not possible in Japan. From the beginning, the Army intended to turn Manchukuo into the industrial heartland of the empire, and starting in 1932, the Army sponsored a policy of forced industrialization that was closely modeled after the Five Year Plan in the Soviet Union. Reflecting a dislike of capitalism, the ''[[Zaibatsu]]'' were excluded from Manchukuo and all of the heavy industrial factories were built and owned by Army-owned corporations. In 1935, there was a change when the \"reform bureaucrat\" [[Nobusuke Kishi]] was appointed Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi persuaded the Army to allow the ''zaibatsu'' to invest in Manchukuo, arguing that having the state carry out the entire industrialization of Manchukuo was costing too much money. Kishi pioneered an etatist system where bureaucrats such as himself developed economic plans, which the ''zaibatsu'' had to then carry out.<ref name=\"Maiolo2010\">{{cite book | last=Maiolo | first=Joseph | title=Cry Havoc: How the Arms Race Drove the World to War, 1931\u20131941 | url=https://archive.org/details/cryhavochowarmsr0000maio | url-access=registration |location=New York | publisher=Basic Books | year=2010 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cryhavochowarmsr0000maio/page/28 28\u201330] |isbn=978-0465032297}}</ref> Kishi succeeded in marshaling private capital in a very strongly state-directed economy to achieve his goal of vastly increased industrial production while at the same time displaying utter indifference to the exploited Chinese workers toiling in Manchukuo's factories; the American historian Mark Driscoll described Kishi's system as a \"necropolitical\" system where the Chinese workers were literally treated as dehumanized cogs within a vast industrial machine.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite news|title =The Unquiet Past Seven decades on from the defeat of Japan, memories of war still divide East Asia|newspaper =The Economist|date =12 August 2015|url =https://www.economist.com/news/essays/en/asia-second-world-war-ghosts|accessdate =9 September 2015|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150906053333/http://www.economist.com/news/essays/en/asia-second-world-war-ghosts|archivedate =6 September 2015|df =dmy-all}}</ref> The system that Kishi pioneered in Manchuria of a state-guided economy where corporations made their investments on government orders later served as the model for Japan's post-1945 development, albeit not with same level of brutal exploitation as in Manchukuo.<ref name=\"The Economist\" /> By the 1930s, Manchukuo's industrial system was among the most advanced making it one of the industrial powerhouses in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Prasenjit-Duara/1715 |title=The New Imperialism and the Post-Colonial Developmental State: Manchukuo in comparative perspective |author=Prasenjit Duara |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616115234/http://japanfocus.org/-Prasenjit-Duara/1715 |archive-date=16 June 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Manchukuo's steel production exceeded Japan's in the late 1930s. Many Manchurian cities were modernised during the Manchukuo era. However, much of the country's economy was often subordinated to Japanese interests and, during the war, raw material flowed into Japan to support the war effort. Traditional lands were taken and redistributed to Japanese farmers with local farmers relocated and forced into [[collective farming]] units over smaller areas of land.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Transport ==\n{{Main|South Manchuria Railway}}\nThe Japanese built an efficient and impressive railway system that still functions well today. Known as the [[South Manchuria Railway]] or ''Mantetsu'', this large corporation came to own large stakes in many industrial projects throughout the region. ''Mantetsu'' personnel were active in the pacification of occupied China during World War II. However, most railway lines in Manchukuo were owned by the [[Manchukuo National Railway]], which, though theoretically independent, was managed and operated entirely by Mantetsu.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Military ==\n{{Main|Manchukuo Imperial Army|Manchukuo Imperial Air Force|Manchukuo Imperial Navy}}\n{{Further|Kwantung Army}}\n[[File:Manchukuo Imperial Army.JPG|thumb|Cavalry of the Manchukuo Imperial Army]]\n\nThe [[Manchukuo Imperial Army]] was the ground component of the Empire of Manchukuo's armed forces and consisted of as many as 170,000{{sfn|Glantz|2003|p=60}} to 220,000{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=35\u201338}} troops at its peak in 1945 by some estimates, having formally been established by the Army and Navy Act of 15 April 1932.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=7\u20139}} The force included members of all the major ethnic groups of Manchukuo, which were trained and led by Japanese instructors and advisors. Despite the numerous attempts by the Japanese to improve the combat capability of the Imperial Army and instill a Manchukuoan patriotic spirit among its troops, the majority of its units were regarded as unreliable by Japanese officers. Their main role was to fight [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] insurgents that continued to resist the Japanese occupation of northeastern China,{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=22\u201323}} and occasionally the Manchukuo Imperial Army took part in operations against the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the Soviet [[Red Army]] (usually in support of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]). Initially its members were former soldiers of Marshal [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s warlord army who had surrendered to Japan during the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=7\u20139}} But since the Young Marshal's former troops were largely not loyal to the new regime and performed poorly against partisans, the new government of Manchukuo took efforts to recruit\u2014and later draft\u2014new soldiers.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=27\u201328}} In 1934 a law was passed stating that only those that had been trained by the government of Manchukuo could serve as officers.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=7\u20139}} The Military Supplies Requisition Law of 13 May 1937 allowed Japanese and Manchukuo authorities to draft forced laborers.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=84}} The actual calling up of conscripts for the army did not begin until 1940, at which point all youths received a physical and 10% were to be selected for service.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=27\u201328}} Between 1938 and 1940, several military academies were established to provide a new officer corps for the Imperial Army, including a specific school for ethnic Mongols.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=11\u201313}}\n\n[[File:Manchukuo army artillery training.png|thumb|left|A [[Type 41 75 mm mountain gun]] during an Imperial Army exercise]]\n\nAfter fighting against insurgents during the early to mid-1930s, the Manchukuo Imperial Army played mainly a supporting role during the [[actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u201336)|actions in Inner Mongolia]] against Chinese forces, with news reports stating that some Manchukuoan units performed fairly well. Later it fought against the Soviet Red Army during the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]]. A skirmish between Manchukuoan and [[Mongolian People's Army|Mongolian]] cavalry in May 1939 escalated as both sides brought in reinforcements and began the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]]. Although they did not perform well in the battle overall, the Japanese considered their actions decent enough to warrant expansion of the Manchukuo Army.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=25\u201327}} Throughout the 1940s the only action it saw was against Communist guerrilla fighters and other insurgents, although the Japanese chose to rely only on the more elite units while the majority were used for garrison and security duty.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=36\u201338}} Although Japan took the effort of equipping the Manchukuoan forces with some artillery (in addition to the wide variety it had inherited from Zhang Xueliang's army) along with some elderly [[tankette]]s and armored cars,{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp= 15\u201317}} the cavalry was the Imperial Army's most effective and developed branch. This was the force that was confronted by 76 battle-hardened Red Army divisions transferred from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|European front]] in August 1945 during the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The cavalry branch saw the most action against the Red Army, but the Manchukuo Army and their depleted Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] allies were quickly swept aside by the Soviet offensive. While some units remained loyal to their Japanese allies and put up a resistance, many mutinied against their Japanese advisors while others simply melted away into the countryside. Many of these Manchukuo Army troops would later join the Communists since the Chinese Nationalists would execute former collaborators with Japan, which became an important source of manpower and equipment for the Communists in the region.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=36\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|Manchukuo Imperial Air Force pilots, 1942, with a [[Nakajima Ki-27]] behind]]\nThe other two branches, the [[Manchukuo Imperial Air Force]] and the [[Manchukuo Imperial Navy]], were small and underdeveloped, largely existing as token forces to give legitimacy to the Manchukuo regime. An Air Force was established in February 1937 with 30 men selected from the Manchukuo Imperial Army who were trained at the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft arsenal in Harbin (initially the Kwantung Army did not trust the Manchukuoans enough to train a native air force for them). The Imperial Air Force's predecessor was the [[Manchuria Aviation Company|Manchukuo Air Transport Company]] (later renamed the Manchukuo National Airways), a paramilitary airline formed in 1931, which undertook transport and reconnaissance missions for the Japanese military. The first air unit was based in [[Hsinking]] (Changchun) and equipped with just one [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29]] and was later expanded with [[Nakajima Army Type 91 Fighter]]s and [[Kawasaki Type 88]] light bombers. Two more air units were established, but they suffered a setback when one hundred pilots took their aircraft and defected to insurgents after murdering their Japanese instructors. Nonetheless three fighter squadrons were formed in 1942 from the first batch of cadets, being equipped with [[Nakajima Ki-27]] fighters in addition to [[Tachikawa Ki-9]]s and [[Tachikawa Ki-55]] trainers, along with some [[Mitsubishi Ki-57]] transports. In 1945, because of American bombing raids, they were issued with [[Nakajima Ki-43]] fighters to have a better chance of intercepting [[B-29 Superfortress]]es. Some pilots saw action against the American bombers and at least one Ki-27 pilot downed a B-29 by ramming his plane into it in a [[kamikaze]] attack. The air force practically ceased to exist by the Soviet invasion but there were isolated instances of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet forces.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=90\u201392}} The Imperial Navy of Manchukuo existed mainly as a small river flotilla and consisted mainly of small gunboats and patrol boats, both captured Chinese ships and some Japanese additions. The elderly [[Japanese destroyer Kashi (1916)|Japanese destroyer ''Kashi'']] was lent to the Manchukuoan fleet from 1937 to 1942 as the ''Hai Wei'' before returning to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. These ships were mostly crewed by Japanese{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\nIn addition to those, several special units that functioned outside of the main command structure of the military also existed. The [[Manchukuo Imperial Guard]] was formed out of soldiers of ethnic [[Manchus|Manchu]] descent, charged with the protection of the Kangde Emperor (Puyi) and senior officials, as well as to function as an [[honor guard]]. Despite this it took part in combat and was considered to be an effective unit. Throughout the 1930s a \"Mongolian Independence Army\" was established out of about 6,000 ethnic Mongolian recruits and fought its own war against bandits with some success. It was expanded in 1938 but merged with the regular Imperial Army in 1940, although Mongol units continued to perform well. A special Korean detachment was formed in 1937 on the personal initiative of a businessman of Korean descent. The unit was small but distinguished itself in combat against Communist guerrillas and was noted by the Japanese for its martial spirit, becoming one of the few puppet units to earn the respect of its Japanese superiors.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=31\u201335}}\n\n=== War crimes in Manchukuo ===\n{{Main|War crimes in Manchukuo}}\n\nAccording to a joint study by historians Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyochi Himeta, Toru Kubo and [[Mark Peattie]], more than 10&nbsp;million Chinese civilians were mobilized by the [[Kwangtung Army]] for slave labor in Manchukuo under the supervision of the [[East Asia Development Board|K\u014da-in]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Zhifen |last=Ju |title=Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war |year=2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese slave laborers often suffered illness due to high-intensity manual labor.

In 1937, the [[Manchukuo Film Association]] was established by the government and the South Manchurian Railway in a studio in Jilin province. It was founded by [[Masahiko Amakasu]], who also helped the career of [[Yoshiko Yamaguchi|Yoshiko \u014ctaka]], also known as Ri Koran. He also tried to ensure that Manchukuo would have its own industry and would be catering mainly to Manchurian audiences. The films for the most part usually promote pro-Manchukuo and pro-Japanese views. General Amakasu shot various \"documentaries\" showing carefully choreographed scenes worthy of Hollywood of the Emperor Puyi in his capital of Hsinking (modern Changchun) being cheered by thousands of subjects and reviewing his troops marching in parades that were intended to help legitimize Manchukuo's indepdendence.

It was similar to the National Clothes ''(kokumin-fuku)'' worn by Japanese civilians in World War II as well as the [[Zhongshan suit]].

a [[puppet state]] of the [[Empire of Japan]] in [[Northeast China]] and [[Inner Mongolia]] from 1932 until 1945. It was founded in 1932 after the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]], and in 1934 it became a [[constitutional monarchy]]. Under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of Japan, it had limited [[international recognition]].\n\nThe area was the homeland of the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], including the emperors of the [[Qing dynasty]]. In 1931, the region [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|was seized by Japan]] following the [[Mukden Incident]]. A pro-Japanese government was installed one year later with [[Puyi]], the [[List of emperors of the Qing dynasty|last Qing emperor]], as the nominal regent and later emperor.<ref>[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9371137/Manchukuo Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica article on Manchukuo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221081805/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9371137/Manchukuo |date = 21 December 2007 }}</ref> Manchukuo's government was dissolved in 1945 after the [[Surrender of Japan|surrender of Imperial Japan]] at the [[End of World War II in Asia|end]] of [[World War II]].

The population of [[Koreans]] increased during the Manchukuo period, and there were also [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Mongols]], [[White \u00e9migr\u00e9|White Russians]] and other minorities. The Mongol regions of western Manchukuo were ruled under a slightly different system in acknowledgement of the [[Mongolian culture|Mongolian traditions]] there. The southern tip of the [[Liaodong Peninsula]] (present-day [[Dalian]]) continued to be directly ruled by Japan as the [[Kwantung Leased Territory]].\n\n{{anchor|Name|Etymology|Terminology|Toponymy}}\n\n==Names==\n{{further|Etymology of Manchu|Etymology of Manchuria}}\n\"Manchukuo\" is a variant of the [[Wade-Giles]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] ''Man-chou-kuo'' of the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation ''M\u01cenzh\u014dugu\u00f3'' of the original [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name of the state, ''Mansh\u016bkoku'' {{nowrap|({{lang|ja|{{linktext|\u6e80\u5dde\u56fd}}}}).}} In Japanese, the name refers to the [[nation-state|state]] of [[Manchuria]], the ''region'' of the [[Manchus]]. The English name, adapted to incorporate the word ''Manchu'', would mean the state of the Manchu people. Indeed, Manchukuo was often referred to in English as simply \"Manchuria\", a name for [[Northeast China]] which had been particularly employed by the Imperial Japanese to promote its separation from the rest of the country.{{sfn|McCormack|1977|p=4}}{{sfn|P\u02bban|1938|p=8}} Other European languages used equivalent terms: Manchukuo was known to its allies as {{lang|it|Manciuku\u00f2}} in [[Italian language|Italian]] and {{lang|de|Mandschukuo}} or {{lang|de|Mandschureich}} in [[German language|German]]. In present-day Chinese, Manchukuo's name is still often prefaced by the word ''w\u011bi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u4f2a}}}}, \"so-called\", \"false\", \"[[pseudo-]]\", &c.) to stress its illegitimacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2013-09/23/content_30104678.htm|title=Top 10 attractions in Changchun, China \u2013 China.org.cn|website=www.china.org.cn|access-date=11 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180707212402/http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2013-09/23/content_30104678.htm|archive-date=7 July 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe formal name of the country was changed to the \"''Empire of Manchuria''\" (sometimes referred to as \"Manchutikuo\"), after the establishment of [[Puyi]] as the ''Kangde Emperor'' in 1934. In Chinese and Japanese, the names were ''D\u00e0 M\u01cenzh\u014du d\u00ecgu\u00f3'' and ''Dai Mansh\u016b teikoku''. The ''D\u00e0/Dai'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5927}}}} (\"big\", \"great\") were added after the model of the formal names of the ''Great'' [[Ming Empire#Name|Ming]] and [[Qing Empire#Name|Qing Empire]]s, but this was unused in English.\n\nThe Japanese had their own motive for deliberately spreading the usage of the term Manchuria.{{sfn|P\u02bban|1938|p=8}} The historian Norman Smith wrote that \"The term \"Manchuria\" is controversial\".{{sfn|Smith|2012|p=219}} Professor Mariko Asano Tamanoi said that she \"should use the term in quotation marks\", when referring to Manchuria.{{sfn|Tamanoi|2000|p=249}} [[Herbert Giles]] wrote that \"Manchuria\" was unknown to the Manchus themselves as a geographical expression.{{sfn|Giles|1912|p=8}} In his doctoral thesis of 2012, Professor Chad D. Garcia noted that usage of the term \"Manchuria\" was out of favor in \"current scholarly practice\" and preferred the term \"the northeast\".{{sfn|Garcia|2012|p=15}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|History of the Republic of China|Japanese nationalism|Japanese militarism|Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere}}\n\n[[File:Greater Asian Co-prosperity sphere.png|thumb|upright=1.25|Members of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere; territory controlled at maximum height.

The Manchu emperors separated their homeland in [[Jilin]] and [[Heilongjiang]] from the Han [[Liaoning]] province with the [[Willow Palisade]].

During the war with Russia, Japan had mobilized one million soldiers to fight in Manchuria, meaning that one in eight families in Japan had a member fighting the war.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=33}} During the Russo-Japanese War, the losses were heavy with Japan losing a half-million dead or wounded.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=33}} From the time of the Russian-Japanese war onward, many Japanese people came to have a proprietary attitude to Manchuria, taking the viewpoint that a land where so much Japanese blood had been lost in some way now belonged to them.{{clarify|reason=Is this the consensus interpretation, or just Young's commentary?|date=February 2018}}{{sfn|Young|1998|p=33}} In 1906, Japan established the [[South Manchurian Railway]] on the former [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] built by Russia from [[Manzhouli]] to [[Vladivostok]] via [[Harbin]] with a branch line from Harbin to [[L\u00fcshunkou District|Port Arthur]] (Japanese: Ryojun), today's [[Dalian]]. Under the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the [[Kwantung Army]] had the right to occupy southern Manchuria while the region fell into the Japanese economic sphere of influence.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=31}} The Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railroad company had a market capitalization of 200 million yen, making it Asia's largest corporation, which went beyond just running the former Russian railroad network in southern Manchuria to owning the ports, mines, hotels, telephone lines, and sundry other businesses, dominating the economy of Manchuria.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=31}} With the growth of the South Manchuria Railroad (''Mantetsu'') company went growth in number of Japanese living in Manchuria from 16,612 Japanese civilians in 1906 to 233,749 in 1930.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=33}} The majority of blue collar employees for the ''Mantetsu'' were Chinese, and the Japanese employees were mostly white collar, meaning most of the Japanese living in Manchuria were middle-class people who saw themselves as an elite.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=34}} Between World War I and World War II Manchuria became a political and military battleground between Russia, Japan, and China. Japan moved into [[Outer Manchuria]] as a result of the chaos following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].

The [[Japanese military]] commander appointed [[Puyi]] as [[regent]] ([[reign name]] Datong) for the time being, stating that he would become Emperor of Manchukuo but could not reign using the title of [[Emperor of China|Emperor of the Great Qing Empire]] as he once held. Manchukuo was proclaimed a monarchy on 1 March 1934, with Puyi assuming the throne under the reign name of Emperor Kang-de. Puyi was assisted in his executive duties by a [[Privy Council]] ({{zh|\u53c3\u8b70\u5e9c}}), and a [[General Affairs State Council]] ({{zh|\u570b\u52d9\u9662}}). This State Council was the center of political power, and consisted of several cabinet ministers, each assisted by a Japanese vice-minister.\n\nThe [[commanding officer]] of the [[Kwantung Army]] in Manchukuo was also the Japanese ambassador to Manchukuo. He functioned in a manner similar to that of a British [[Resident (title)|resident officer]] in British overseas [[protectorate]]s, with the power to veto decisions by the emperor. The [[Kwangtung Army]] leadership placed Japanese vice ministers in his cabinet, while all Chinese advisors gradually resigned or were dismissed.\n\nThe [[Legislative Council]] ({{zh|\u7acb\u6cd5\u9662}}) was largely a ceremonial body, existing to rubber-stamp decisions issued by the [[General Affairs State Council|State Council]]. The [[one-party state|only authorized political party]] was the government-sponsored [[Concordia Association]], although various \u00e9migr\u00e9 groups were permitted their own political associations.\n\nThe American historian Louise Young noted that one of the most striking aspects of Manchukuo was that many of the young Japanese civil servants who went to work in Manchukuo were on the left, or at least had once been.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=269}} In the 1920s, much of the younger ''intelligentsia'' in Japan had rejected their parents' values, and had become active in various left-wing movements. Starting with the [[Peace Preservataion Law|Peace Preservation Law of 1925]], which made the very act of thinking about \"altering the ''[[kokutai]]'' a crime, the government had embarked on a sustained campaign to stomp out all left-wing thought in Japan. However, many of the bright young university graduates active in left-wing movements in Japan were needed to serve as civil servants in Manchukuo, which Young noted led the Japanese state to embark upon a contradictory policy of recruiting the same people active in the movements that it was seeking to crush.\"{{sfn|Young|1998|p=269}} To rule Manchukuo, which right from the start had a very statist economy, the Japanese state needed university graduates who were fluent in Mandarin Chinese, and the 1920s\u201330s, many of the university graduates in Japan who knew Mandarin were \"progressives\" involved in left-wing causes.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=278}} The fact that young Japanese civil servants in Manchukuo with their degrees in economics, sociology, etc., who had once been active in left-wing movements helps explain the decidedly leftist thrust of social and economic policies in Manchukuo with the state playing an increasingly large role in society.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=278}} Likewise, much of the debate between Japanese civil servants about the sort of social-economic policies Japan should follow in Manchukuo in the 1930s was framed in Marxist terms, with the civil servants arguing over whatever Manchuria prior to September 1931 had a \"feudal\" or a \"capitalist\" economy.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=293}} The American historian [[Joshua Fogel]] wrote about the young servants of Manchukuo: \"Tremendous debates transpired on such things as the nature of the Chinese economy, and the [[lingua franca]] of these debates was always Marxism\".{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=125}} To resolve this debate, various research teams of five or six young civil servants, guarded by detachments from the Kwantung Army of about 20 or 30 men, went out to do field research in Manchukuo, gathering material about the life of ordinary people, to determine Manchukuo was in the \"feudal\" or \"capitalist\" stage of development.{{sfn|Young|1998|pp=296\u2013297}} Starting in 1936, the Manchukuo state launched Five Year Plans for economic development, which were closely modeled after the Five Year Plans in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=298}}\n\nIn Manchukuo, the Japanese were creating a brand new state that was in theory independent, which meant that there were no limits upon the sort of policies that the new state could carry out, and many university graduates in Japan, who despite being opposed to the social system that existed in Japan itself, went to work in Manchukuo, believing that they could carry out reforms there that might inspire similar reforms in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|pp=269\u2013270}} This was especially the case since it was impossible to effect any reforms in Japan itself as the very act of thinking about \"altering the ''kokutai''\" was a crime, which led many leftist Japanese university graduates to go work in Manchukuo, where they believed they could achieve the sort of social revolution that was impossible in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=282}} By 1933, the Japanese state had essentially destroyed both the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japanese Communist Party via mass arrests and ''[[Tenk\u014d]]'' with both parties reduced down to mere rumps, which caused many Japanese student leftists to draw the conclusion that change was impossible in Japan, but still possible in Manchukuo, where paradoxically the Kwantung Army was sponsoring the sort of policies that were unacceptable in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=294}} Moreover, the Great Depression had made it very difficult for university graduates in Japan to find work, which made the prospect of a well-paying job in Manchukuo very attractive to otherwise underemployed Japanese university graduates.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=302}} In Manchukuo, the Japanese state was creating an entire state anew, which meant that Manchukuo had a desperate need for university graduates to work in its newly founded civil service.{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=126}} In addition, the Pan-Asian rhetoric of Manchukuo and the prospect of Japan helping ordinary people in Manchuria greatly appealed to the idealistic youth of Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=302}} Young wrote about the young Japanese people who went to work in Manchukuo: \"The men, and in some cases, the women, who answered the call of this land of opportunity, brought with them tremendous drive and ambition. In their efforts to remake their own lives, they remade an empire. They invested it with their preoccupations of modernity and their dreams of an Utopian future. They pushed it to embrace an idealist rhetoric of social reform and justified itself in terms of Chinese nationalist aspiration. They turned it to architectural ostentation and the heady luxury of colonial consumption. They made it into a project of radical change, experimentation and possibility\".{{sfn|Young|1998|p=302}}\n[[File:Hokushin-ron-Map.svg|thumb|Map of Japanese ''Hokushin-ron'' plans for [[Kantokuen|a potential attack on the Soviet Union]]. Dates indicate the year that Japan gained control of the territory.]]\nThe Kwantung Army for its part tolerated the talk of social revolution in Manchukuo as the best way of gaining support from the Han majority of Manchukuo, who did not want Manchuria to be severed from China.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=287}} Even more active in going to Manchukuo were the products of ''[[Tenk\u014d]]'' (\"Changing directions\"), a process of brainwashing by the police of left-wing activists to make them accept that the Emperor was a god after all, whom they were best to serve.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=276}} ''Tenk\u014d'' was a very successful process that turned young Japanese who once been ardent liberals or leftists who rejected the idea that the Emperor was a god into fanatical rightists, who made up for their previous doubts about the divinity of the Emperor with militant enthusiasm.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=276}} One ''tenk\u014dsha'' was Tachibana Shiraki, who once been a Marxist Sinologist who after his arrest and undergoing ''Tenk\u014d'' become a fanatical right-winger.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=276}} Tachibana went to Manchukuo in 1932, proclaiming that the theory of the \"five races\" working together was the best solution to Asia's problems and argued in his writings that only Japan could save China from itself, which was a complete change from his previous policies, where he criticized Japan for exploiting China.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=276}} Other left-wing activists like \u014cgami Suehiro did not undergo ''Tenk\u014d'', but still went to work in Manchukuo, believing it was possible to effect social reforms that would end the \"semi-feudal\" condition of the Chinese peasants of Manchukuo, and that he could use the Kwantung Army to effect left-wing reforms in Manchukuo.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=276}} \u014cgami went to work in the \"agricultural economy\" desk of the Social Research Unit of the South Manchurian Railroad company, writing up reports about the rural economy of Manchukuo that were used by the Kwantung Army and the Manchukuo state.{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=124}} \u014cgami believed that his studies helped ordinary people, citing one study he did about water use in rural Manchukuo, where he noted a correlation between villages that were deprived of water and \"banditry\" (the codeword for anti-Japanese guerrillas), believing that the policy of improving water supply in villages was due to his study.{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=125}} The outbreak of the war with China in 1937 caused the state in Manchukuo to grow even bigger as a policy of \"total war\" came in, which meant there was a pressing demand for people with university degrees trained to think \"scientifically\".{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=126}} Fogel wrote that almost all of the university graduates from Japan who arrived in Manchukuo in the late 1930s were \"largely left-wing Socialists and Communists. This was precisely at the time when Marxism had been all but banned in Japan, when (as Yamada G\u014dichi put) if the expression ''shakai'' (social) appeared in the title of a book, it was usually confiscated\".{{sfn|Fogel|1995|p=126}}\n\nYoung also noted\u2014with reference to Lord Acton's dictum that \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\"\u2014that for many of the idealistic young Japanese civil servants, who believed that they could effect a \"revolution from above\" that would make the lives of ordinary people better, that the absolute power that they enjoyed over millions of people \"went to their heads\", causing them to behave with abusive arrogance towards the very people that they had gone to Manchukuo to help.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=298}} Young wrote that it was a \"monumental conceit\" of the part of the young idealists to believe that they could use the Kwantung Army to achieve a \"revolution from above\", when it was the Kwantung Army that was using them.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=298}} The ambitious plans for land reform in Manchukuo were vetoed by the Kwantung Army for precisely the reason that it might inspire similar reforms in Japan.{{sfn|Young|1998|p=299}} The landlords in Japan tended to come from families who once belonged to the samurai caste, and almost all of the officers in the Imperial Japanese Army came from samurai families, which made the Kwantung Army very hostile towards any sort of land reform which might serve as an example for Japanese peasants. In October 1941, the Soviet spy ring headed by [[Richard Sorge]] was uncovered in Tokyo, which caused the authorities to become paranoid about Soviet espionage, and led to new crackdown on the left. In November 1941, the Social Research Unit of the South Manchurian Railroad Company, which was well known as a hotbed of Marxism since the early 1930s, was raided by the ''[[Kenpeitai]]'', who arrested 50 of those working in the Social Research Unit.{{sfn|Hotta|2007|p=128}} At least 44 of those working in the Social Research Unit were convicted of violating the Peace Preservation Law, which made thinking about \"altering the ''kokutai''\" a crime in 1942\u201343 and were given long prison sentences, of whom four died due to the harsh conditions of prisons in Manchukuo.{{sfn|Hotta|2007|p=126}} As the men working in the Social Research Unit had played important roles in Manchukuo's economic policy and were university graduates from good families, the Japanese historian Hotta Eri wrote that the ''Kenpeitai'' were ordered to \"handle them with care\", meaning no torture of the sort that the ''Kenpeitai'' normally employed in its investigations.{{sfn|Hotta|2007|p=126}}\n\nWhen the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] was announced on 15 August 1945, Puyi agreed to abdicate.\n\n=== Head of State ===\n{{Infobox former monarchy\n|royal_title       = Emperor\n|realm             = Manchukuo\n|border            = imperial\n|coatofarms        = Flag of the Emperor of Manchukuo.svg\n|coatofarmssize    = 120px\n|coatofarmscaption = '''Imperial Standard'''\n|image             = Pu Yi, Qing dynasty, China, Last emperor.jpg\n|caption           = '''K\u0101ngd\u00e9'''\n|first_monarch     = [[Puyi]]\n|last_monarch      = [[Puyi]]\n|style             = [[Imperial Majesty (style)|His Imperial Majesty]]\n|residence         = [[Museum of the Imperial Palace of the Manchu State|Imperial Palace]]\n|appointer         = \n|began             = 1 March 1934\n|ended             = 15 August 1945\n}}\n<center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Manchukuo''' 1932\u20131945\n|-\n!

Never in the chronicles of the human race was any State born with such high ideals, and never has any State accomplished so much in such a brief space of its existence as Manchukuo\".{{sfn|Behr|1987|p=218}}\n\nThe Japanese went out of their way to try to ensure that Manchukuo was the embodiment of modernity in all of its aspects, as it was intended to prove to the world what the Asian peoples could accomplish if they worked together. Manchukuo's legal system was based upon the Organic Law of 1932, which featured a 12 article Human Rights Protection Law and a supposedly independent judiciary to enforce the law.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=292}} The official ideology of Manchukuo was the ''wangdao'' (\"Kingly Way\") devised by a former mandarin under the Qing turned Prime Minister of Manchukuo [[Zheng Xiaoxu]] calling for an ordered Confucian society that would promote justice and harmony that was billed at the time as the beginning of a new era in world history.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=293}} The purpose of the law in Manchukuo was not the protection of the rights of the individual, as the ''wangdao'' ideology was expressly hostile towards individualism, which was seen as a decadent Western concept inimical to Asia, but rather the interests of the state by ensuring that subjects fulfilled their duties to the emperor.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=293\u2013294}} The ''wangdao'' favored the collective over the individual, as the ''wangdao'' called for all people to put the needs of society ahead of their own needs.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=293\u2013294}} Zheng together with the Japanese legal scholar Ishiwara Kanji in a joint statement attacked the Western legal tradition for promoting individualism, which they claimed led to selfishness, greed and materialism, and argued that the ''wangdao'' with its disregard for the individual was a morally superior system.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=751\u2013752}} The seemingly idealistic Human Rights Protection Law counterbalanced the \"rights\" of the subjects with their \"responsibilities\" to the state with a greater emphasis on the latter, just as was the case in Japan. The ''wangdao'' promoted Confucian morality and spirituality, which was seen as coming down from the Emperor Puyi, and as such the legal system existed to serve the needs of the state headed by Emperor Puyi, who could change the laws as he saw fit.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=294\u2013295}} In this regard it is noteworthy that Legislative Yuan had only the power of ''assisting'' the Emperor with making laws, being endowed with far less powers than even the Imperial Diet in Japan had, which had the power to reject or approve laws. It was often suggested at the time that the Legislative Yuan of Manchukuo was a model for the Imperial Diet in Japan, an idea [[Hirohito]], the Japanese emperor, was sympathetic to, but never took up.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=298}} Hirohito in the end preferred the Meiji constitution passed by his grandfather in 1889 as it gave the Emperor of Japan ultimate power while at the same time the fiction of the Imperial Diet together with a Prime Minister and his cabinet governing Japan gave the Emperor a scapegoat when things went wrong.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nInitially, the judges who had served the Zhangs were retained, but in 1934, the Judicial Law College headed by the Japanese judge Furuta Masatake was opened in Changchun, to be replaced by a larger Law University in 1937. Right from the start, the new applicants vastly exceeded the number of openings as the first class of the Law College numbered only 100, but 1,210 students had applied.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=752}} The legal system that the students were trained was closely modeled after the Japanese legal system, which in its turn was modeled after the French legal system, but there were a number of particularities unique to Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=753}} Law students were trained to write essays on such topics as the \"theory of the harmony of the five races [of Manchukuo]\", the \"political theory of the Kingly Way\", \"practical differences between consular jurisdiction and extraterritoriality\", and how best to \"realize the governance of the Kingly Way\".{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=753}} The Japanese professors were \"astonished\" by the \"enthusiasm\" which the students wrote their essays on these subjects as the students expressed the hope that the ''wangdao'' was a uniquely Asian solution to the problems of the modern world, and that Manchukuo represented nothing less than the beginning of a new civilization that would lead to a utopian society in the near-future.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=753}} The Japanese professors were greatly impressed with the Confucian idealism of their students, but noted that their students all used stock phrases to the extent it was hard to tell their essays apart, cited examples of wise judges from ancient China while ignoring more recent legal developments, and were long on expressing idealistic statements about how the ''wangdao'' would lead to a perfect society, but were short on how explaining just how this was to be done in practice.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=753\u2013754}}\n\nAn example of the extent of Japanese influence on the legal system of Manchukuo was that every issue of the ''Manchukuo Legal Advisory Journal'' always contained a summary of the most recent rulings by the Supreme Court of Japan, and the reasons why the Japanese Supreme Court had ruled in these cases.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=757}} However, there were some differences between the Manchukuo and Japanese legal systems. In Japan itself, corporal punishment had been abolished as part of the successful effort to end the extraterritorial rights enjoyed by citizens of the Western powers, but retained for the Japanese colonies of Korea and Taiwan.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=757}} However, corporal punishment, especially flogging, was a major part of the Manchukuo legal system with judges being very much inclined to impose floggings on low-income Chinese men convicted of minor offenses that would normally merit only a fine or a short prison sentence in Japan.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=757\u2013758}} Writing in a legal journal in 1936, Ono Jitsuo, a Japanese judge serving in Manchukuo, regretted having to impose floggings as a punishment for relatively minor crimes, but argued that it was necessary of Manchukuo's 30 million people \"more than half are ignorant and completely illiterate barbarians\" who were too poor to pay fines and too numerous to imprison.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=758}} In Taiwan and Korea, Japanese law was supreme, but judges in both colonies had to respect \"local customs\" in regards to family law.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|p=761}} In case of Manchukuo, a place with a Han majority, but those ideology proclaimed the \"five races\" of Japanese, Chinese, Koreans, Manchus and Mongols as all equal, this led in effect to several family laws for each of the \"five races\" respecting their \"local customs\" plus the Russian and Hui Muslim minorities.{{sfn|DuBois|2010|pp=762\u2013763}}\n\nThe Manchukuo police had the power to arrest without charge anyone who was engaged in the vaguely defined crime of \"undermining the state\".{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=300}} Manchukuo had an extensive system of courts at four levels staffed by a mixture of Chinese and Japanese judges. All of the courts had both two Japanese and two Chinese judges with the Chinese serving as the nominal superior judges and the Japanese the junior judges, but in practice the Japanese judges were the masters and the Chinese judges puppets.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=302}} Despite the claims that the legal system of Manchukuo was a great improvement over the legal system presided over by Marshal [[Zhang Xueliang]] the \"Young Marshal\", the courts in Manchukuo were inefficient and slow, and ignored by the authorities whenever it suited them.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=306}} In Asia, the rule of law and an advanced legal system are commonly seen as one of the marks of \"civilization\", which is why the chaotic and corrupt legal system run by Marshal Zhang was denigrated so much by the Japanese and Manchukuo media.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=306}} In the early 1930s, Manchukuo attracted much legal talent from Japan as Japanese Pan-Asian idealists went to Manchuria with the goal of establishing a world-class legal system.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}} As the Kwangtung Army had the ultimate power in Manchukuo, the best Japanese judges by the late 1930s preferred not to go to Manchukuo where their decisions could be constantly second-guessed, and instead only the second-rate judges went to Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}} By 1937 the Japanese judges and lawyers in Manchukuo were either disillusioned Pan-Asian idealists or more commonly cynical opportunists and mediocre hacks who lacked the talent to get ahead in Japan.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}} By contrast, the best of the ethnic Chinese law schools graduates in Manchukuo chose to work as part of Manchukuo's judicial system, suggesting many middle-class Chinese families were prepared to accept Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=308}}\n\nStarting with the Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely modeled after the Imperial cult in Japan where Hirohito was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=309}} Just as in Japan, schoolchildren began their classes by praying to a portrait of the emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=309}} As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=310}} As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down to mere human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=310}} In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed ''a priori''.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=310}}\n\nAnd again following the Japanese system, in 1937 a new category of \"thought crime\" was introduced declaring that certain thoughts were now illegal and those thinking these forbidden thoughts were \"thought criminals\".{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} People were thus convicted not for their actions, but merely for their thoughts.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} After the war with China began in July 1937, an \"emergency law\" was declared in Manchukuo, placing it under a type of martial law that suspended the theoretical civil liberties that existed up to that point, ordered the mobilization of society for total war, and increased the tempo of repression with the law on \"thought crimes\" being merely the most dramatic example.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} In April 1938, a new type of Special Security Courts were created for those charged with the five types of \"thought crime\".{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=311}} On 26 August 1941, a new security law ruled that those tried before the Special Security Courts had no right of appeal or to a defense lawyer.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=312}} One Special Security Court in [[Jinzhou]] between 1942\u201345 sentenced about 1,700 people to death and another 2,600 for life imprisonment for \"thought crimes\", a figure that appears to be typical of the special courts.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=312\u2013313}} The police frequently used torture to obtain confessions and those tried in the Special Security Courts had no right to examine the evidence against them.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=312}} Starting in 1943 the number of those tried and convicted by the courts rose drastically, though the number of death sentences remained stable.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|p=313}} The rise in the number of convictions was due to the need for slave labor for the factories and mines of Manchukuo as the traditional supplies of slave labor from northern China were disturbed by World War II as most of those convicted were sentenced to work in the factories and mines.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=313\u2013314}} The American historian Thomas David Dubois wrote the legal system of Manchukuo went through two phrases: the first lasting from 1931 to 1937, when the Japanese wanted to show the world a state with an ultra-modern legal system that was meant to be a shining tribute to Asians working together in brotherhood; and the second from 1937 to 1945 when the legal system become more of a tool for the totalitarian mobilization of society for total war.{{sfn|DuBois|2008|pp=315\u2013316}}\n\n== Economy ==\n{{Main|Economy of Manchukuo}}\n{{See also|Central Bank of Manchou|Manchukuo yuan|Manshukoku Hikoki Seizo KK|Manshukoku Koku KK|Showa Steel Works|Manchurian Industrial Development Company|Manchukuo Film Association}}\n[[File:Showa Steel Works.JPG|thumb|[[Showa Steel Works]] in the early 1940s]]\n\nManchukuo experienced rapid economic growth and progress in its social systems. During the 1920s, the Japanese Army under the influence of the ''Wehrstaat'' (Defense State) theories popular with the ''[[Reichswehr]]'' had started to advocate their own version of the ''Wehrstaat'', the totalitarian \"national defense state\" which would mobilize an entire society for war in peacetime. An additional influence on the Japanese \"total war\" school who tended to be very anti-capitalist was the First Five Year Plan in the Soviet Union, which provided an example of rapid industrial growth achieved without capitalism. At least part of the reason why the Kwangtung Army seized Manchuria in 1931 was to use it as an laboratory for creating an economic system geared towards the \"national defense state\"; colonial Manchuria offered up possibilities for the army carrying out drastic economic changes that were not possible in Japan. From the beginning, the Army intended to turn Manchukuo into the industrial heartland of the empire, and starting in 1932, the Army sponsored a policy of forced industrialization that was closely modeled after the Five Year Plan in the Soviet Union. Reflecting a dislike of capitalism, the ''[[Zaibatsu]]'' were excluded from Manchukuo and all of the heavy industrial factories were built and owned by Army-owned corporations. In 1935, there was a change when the \"reform bureaucrat\" [[Nobusuke Kishi]] was appointed Deputy Minister of Industrial Development. Kishi persuaded the Army to allow the ''zaibatsu'' to invest in Manchukuo, arguing that having the state carry out the entire industrialization of Manchukuo was costing too much money. Kishi pioneered an etatist system where bureaucrats such as himself developed economic plans, which the ''zaibatsu'' had to then carry out.<ref name=\"Maiolo2010\">{{cite book | last=Maiolo | first=Joseph | title=Cry Havoc: How the Arms Race Drove the World to War, 1931\u20131941 | url=https://archive.org/details/cryhavochowarmsr0000maio | url-access=registration |location=New York | publisher=Basic Books | year=2010 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cryhavochowarmsr0000maio/page/28 28\u201330] |isbn=978-0465032297}}</ref> Kishi succeeded in marshaling private capital in a very strongly state-directed economy to achieve his goal of vastly increased industrial production while at the same time displaying utter indifference to the exploited Chinese workers toiling in Manchukuo's factories; the American historian Mark Driscoll described Kishi's system as a \"necropolitical\" system where the Chinese workers were literally treated as dehumanized cogs within a vast industrial machine.<ref name=\"The Economist\">{{cite news|title =The Unquiet Past Seven decades on from the defeat of Japan, memories of war still divide East Asia|newspaper =The Economist|date =12 August 2015|url =https://www.economist.com/news/essays/en/asia-second-world-war-ghosts|accessdate =9 September 2015|url-status =live|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20150906053333/http://www.economist.com/news/essays/en/asia-second-world-war-ghosts|archivedate =6 September 2015|df =dmy-all}}</ref> The system that Kishi pioneered in Manchuria of a state-guided economy where corporations made their investments on government orders later served as the model for Japan's post-1945 development, albeit not with same level of brutal exploitation as in Manchukuo.<ref name=\"The Economist\" /> By the 1930s, Manchukuo's industrial system was among the most advanced making it one of the industrial powerhouses in the region.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Prasenjit-Duara/1715 |title=The New Imperialism and the Post-Colonial Developmental State: Manchukuo in comparative perspective |author=Prasenjit Duara |accessdate=25 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616115234/http://japanfocus.org/-Prasenjit-Duara/1715 |archive-date=16 June 2010 |url-status=live  }}</ref> Manchukuo's steel production exceeded Japan's in the late 1930s. Many Manchurian cities were modernised during the Manchukuo era. However, much of the country's economy was often subordinated to Japanese interests and, during the war, raw material flowed into Japan to support the war effort.

Despite the numerous attempts by the Japanese to improve the combat capability of the Imperial Army and instill a Manchukuoan patriotic spirit among its troops, the majority of its units were regarded as unreliable by Japanese officers. Their main role was to fight [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] insurgents that continued to resist the Japanese occupation of northeastern China,{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=22\u201323}} and occasionally the Manchukuo Imperial Army took part in operations against the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the Soviet [[Red Army]] (usually in support of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]). Initially its members were former soldiers of Marshal [[Zhang Xueliang]]'s warlord army who had surrendered to Japan during the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]].{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=7\u20139}} But since the Young Marshal's former troops were largely not loyal to the new regime and performed poorly against partisans, the new government of Manchukuo took efforts to recruit\u2014and later draft\u2014new soldiers.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=27\u201328}} In 1934 a law was passed stating that only those that had been trained by the government of Manchukuo could serve as officers.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=7\u20139}} The Military Supplies Requisition Law of 13 May 1937 allowed Japanese and Manchukuo authorities to draft forced laborers.{{sfn|Holland|2008|p=84}} The actual calling up of conscripts for the army did not begin until 1940, at which point all youths received a physical and 10% were to be selected for service.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=27\u201328}} Between 1938 and 1940, several military academies were established to provide a new officer corps for the Imperial Army, including a specific school for ethnic Mongols.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=11\u201313}}\n\n[[File:Manchukuo army artillery training.png|thumb|left|A [[Type 41 75 mm mountain gun]] during an Imperial Army exercise]]\n\nAfter fighting against insurgents during the early to mid-1930s, the Manchukuo Imperial Army played mainly a supporting role during the [[actions in Inner Mongolia (1933\u201336)|actions in Inner Mongolia]] against Chinese forces, with news reports stating that some Manchukuoan units performed fairly well. Later it fought against the Soviet Red Army during the [[Soviet\u2013Japanese border conflicts]]. A skirmish between Manchukuoan and [[Mongolian People's Army|Mongolian]] cavalry in May 1939 escalated as both sides brought in reinforcements and began the [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol]]. Although they did not perform well in the battle overall, the Japanese considered their actions decent enough to warrant expansion of the Manchukuo Army.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=25\u201327}} Throughout the 1940s the only action it saw was against Communist guerrilla fighters and other insurgents, although the Japanese chose to rely only on the more elite units while the majority were used for garrison and security duty.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=36\u201338}} Although Japan took the effort of equipping the Manchukuoan forces with some artillery (in addition to the wide variety it had inherited from Zhang Xueliang's army) along with some elderly [[tankette]]s and armored cars,{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp= 15\u201317}} the cavalry was the Imperial Army's most effective and developed branch. This was the force that was confronted by 76 battle-hardened Red Army divisions transferred from the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|European front]] in August 1945 during the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]]. The cavalry branch saw the most action against the Red Army, but the Manchukuo Army and their depleted Japanese [[Kwantung Army]] allies were quickly swept aside by the Soviet offensive. While some units remained loyal to their Japanese allies and put up a resistance, many mutinied against their Japanese advisors while others simply melted away into the countryside. Many of these Manchukuo Army troops would later join the Communists since the Chinese Nationalists would execute former collaborators with Japan, which became an important source of manpower and equipment for the Communists in the region.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=36\u201338}}\n\n[[File:Manchukuo Air Force.JPG|thumb|Manchukuo Imperial Air Force pilots, 1942, with a [[Nakajima Ki-27]] behind]]\nThe other two branches, the [[Manchukuo Imperial Air Force]] and the [[Manchukuo Imperial Navy]], were small and underdeveloped, largely existing as token forces to give legitimacy to the Manchukuo regime. An Air Force was established in February 1937 with 30 men selected from the Manchukuo Imperial Army who were trained at the Japanese Kwantung Army aircraft arsenal in Harbin (initially the Kwantung Army did not trust the Manchukuoans enough to train a native air force for them). The Imperial Air Force's predecessor was the [[Manchuria Aviation Company|Manchukuo Air Transport Company]] (later renamed the Manchukuo National Airways), a paramilitary airline formed in 1931, which undertook transport and reconnaissance missions for the Japanese military. The first air unit was based in [[Hsinking]] (Changchun) and equipped with just one [[Nieuport-Delage NiD 29]] and was later expanded with [[Nakajima Army Type 91 Fighter]]s and [[Kawasaki Type 88]] light bombers. Two more air units were established, but they suffered a setback when one hundred pilots took their aircraft and defected to insurgents after murdering their Japanese instructors. Nonetheless three fighter squadrons were formed in 1942 from the first batch of cadets, being equipped with [[Nakajima Ki-27]] fighters in addition to [[Tachikawa Ki-9]]s and [[Tachikawa Ki-55]] trainers, along with some [[Mitsubishi Ki-57]] transports. In 1945, because of American bombing raids, they were issued with [[Nakajima Ki-43]] fighters to have a better chance of intercepting [[B-29 Superfortress]]es. Some pilots saw action against the American bombers and at least one Ki-27 pilot downed a B-29 by ramming his plane into it in a [[kamikaze]] attack. The air force practically ceased to exist by the Soviet invasion but there were isolated instances of Manchukuoan planes attacking Soviet forces.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=90\u201392}} The Imperial Navy of Manchukuo existed mainly as a small river flotilla and consisted mainly of small gunboats and patrol boats, both captured Chinese ships and some Japanese additions. The elderly [[Japanese destroyer Kashi (1916)|Japanese destroyer ''Kashi'']] was lent to the Manchukuoan fleet from 1937 to 1942 as the ''Hai Wei'' before returning to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. These ships were mostly crewed by Japanese{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\nIn addition to those, several special units that functioned outside of the main command structure of the military also existed. The [[Manchukuo Imperial Guard]] was formed out of soldiers of ethnic [[Manchus|Manchu]] descent, charged with the protection of the Kangde Emperor (Puyi) and senior officials, as well as to function as an [[honor guard]]. Despite this it took part in combat and was considered to be an effective unit. Throughout the 1930s a \"Mongolian Independence Army\" was established out of about 6,000 ethnic Mongolian recruits and fought its own war against bandits with some success. It was expanded in 1938 but merged with the regular Imperial Army in 1940, although Mongol units continued to perform well. A special Korean detachment was formed in 1937 on the personal initiative of a businessman of Korean descent. The unit was small but distinguished itself in combat against Communist guerrillas and was noted by the Japanese for its martial spirit, becoming one of the few puppet units to earn the respect of its Japanese superiors.{{sfn|Jowett|2004|pp=31\u201335}}\n\n=== War crimes in Manchukuo ===\n{{Main|War crimes in Manchukuo}}\n\nAccording to a joint study by historians Zhifen Ju, Mitsuyochi Himeta, Toru Kubo and [[Mark Peattie]], more than 10&nbsp;million Chinese civilians were mobilized by the [[Kwangtung Army]] for slave labor in Manchukuo under the supervision of the [[East Asia Development Board|K\u014da-in]].<ref>{{Citation |first=Zhifen |last=Ju |title=Japan's atrocities of conscripting and abusing north China draftees after the outbreak of the Pacific war |year=2002 }}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese slave laborers often suffered illness due to high-intensity manual labor.
