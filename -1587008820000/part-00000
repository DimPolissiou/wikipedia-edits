Likewise, a group of players are in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible, taking into account the decisions of the others in the game as long as the other parties' decisions remain unchanged.\n\nNash showed that there is a Nash equilibrium for every finite game: see further the article on [[Strategy (game theory)|strategy]].\n\n==Applications==\nGame theorists use the Nash equilibrium concept to analyze the outcome of the [[strategy|strategic interaction]] of several [[decision making|decision makers]]. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome for each of them depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.\n\nThe concept has been used to analyze hostile situations like wars and arms races<ref>Schelling, Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&dq=thoma+schelling+strategy+of+conflict&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=xuSjSbK-I4-O_gai_ticBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPP13,M1 The Strategy of Conflict]'', copyright 1960, 1980, Harvard University Press, {{isbn|0-674-84031-3}}.</ref> (see [[prisoner's dilemma]]), and also how conflict may be mitigated by repeated interaction (see [[tit-for-tat]]).

A version of the Nash equilibrium concept was first known to be used in 1838 by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in his theory of [[oligopoly]].<ref>Cournot A. (1838) Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth</ref> In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A [[Cournot equilibrium]] occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of [[best response]] dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. However, Nash's definition of equilibrium is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient equilibrium, since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the equilibrium being generated.\n\nThe modern game-theoretic concept of Nash equilibrium is instead defined in terms of [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]], where players choose a probability distribution over possible actions. The concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in their 1944 book ''The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior''. However, their analysis was restricted to the special case of [[zero-sum]] games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions.<ref>J. Von Neumann, O. Morgenstern, ''[https://archive.org/stream/theoryofgamesand030098mbp#page/n5/mode/2up Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]'', copyright 1944, 1953, Princeton University Press</ref> The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article \"Non-Cooperative Games\" was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash's ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, \"an equilibrium point is an n-tuple such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes his payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others.\" Just putting the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the [[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]] in his 1950 paper, and a variant upon it in his 1951 paper used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] to prove that there had to exist at least one mixed strategy profile that mapped back into itself for finite-player (not necessarily zero-sum) games; namely, a strategy profile that did not call for a shift in strategies that could improve payoffs.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Carmona |first=Guilherme |first2=Konrad |last2=Podczeck |year=2009|title=On the Existence of Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria in Large Games |ssrn=882466 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=1300\u20131319 |doi=10.1016/j.jet.2008.11.009 |url=http://fesrvsd.fe.unl.pt/WPFEUNL/WP2008/wp531.pdf }}</ref>\n\nSince the development of the Nash equilibrium concept, game theorists have discovered that it makes misleading predictions (or fails to make a unique prediction) in certain circumstances. They have proposed many related [[solution concept]]s (also called 'refinements' of Nash equilibria) designed to overcome perceived flaws in the Nash concept. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not '[[credibility|credible]]'. In 1965 [[Reinhard Selten]] proposed [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on [[non-credible threats]]. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is [[Repeated game|repeated]], or what happens if a game is played in the [[Global game|absence of complete information]]. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept share the main insight on which Nash's concept rests: all equilibrium concepts analyze what choices will be made when each player takes into account the decision-making of others.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Nash Equilibrium===\nInformally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing his or her strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks themselves: \"Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?\"\n\nIf any player could answer \"Yes\", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a [[best response]] to all other strategies in that equilibrium.<ref name=\"preliminaries\">{{cite web\n| last = von Ahn\n| first = Luis\n| title = Preliminaries of Game Theory\n| url = http://www.scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures_f11/lecture09.pdf\n| accessdate = 2008-11-07\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111018035629/http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures_f11/lecture09.pdf\n| archive-date = 2011-10-18\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimal]].\n\nThe Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in [[sequential game]]s because players may \"threaten\" each other with non-rational moves. For such games the [[subgame perfect Nash equilibrium]] may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.\n\n=== Strict/Weak Equilibrium ===\nSuppose that in the Nash equilibrium, each player asks themselves: \"Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, would I suffer a loss by changing my strategy?\"\n\nIf every player's answer is \"Yes\", then the equilibrium is classified as a ''strict Nash equilibrium''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hoylab.cornell.edu/nash.html|title=Nash Equilibria|website=hoylab.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> \n\nIf instead, for some player, there is exact equality between the strategy in Nash equilibrium and some other strategy that gives the exactly same payout (i.e. this player is indifferent between switching and not), then the equilibrium is classified as a ''weak Nash equilibrium''.\n\nA game can have a [[Pure strategy|pure-strategy]] or a [[Mixed strategy|mixed-strategy]] Nash equilibrium. (In the latter a pure strategy is chosen [[stochastic]]ally with a fixed [[probability]]).\n\n===Nash's Existence Theorem===\nNash proved that if we allow [[strategy (game theory)#Pure and mixed strategies|mixed strategies]] (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then every game with a finite number of players in which each player can choose from finitely many pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium.\n\nNash equilibria need not exist if the set of choices is infinite and noncompact.  An example is a game where two players simultaneously name a natural number and the player naming the larger number wins. However, a Nash equilibrium exists if the set of choices is [[compact space|compact]] with continuous payoff.<ref>MIT OpenCourseWare. 6.254: Game Theory with Engineering Applications, Spring 2010. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT6_254S10_lec06.pdf Lecture 6: Continuous and Discontinuous Games].</ref>  An example, in which the equilibrium is a mixture of continuously many pure strategies, is a game where two players simultaneously pick a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and player one's winnings (paid by the second player) equal the square root of the distance between the two numbers.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Coordination game ===\n{{Main|Coordination game}}\n\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A sample coordination game showing relative payoff for player 1 (row) / player 2 (column) with each combination\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!style=\"width: 90px\"|Player 2 adopts strategy A\n!style=\"width: 90px\"|Player 2 adopts strategy B\n|-\n!style=\"width: 90px\"|Player 1 adopts strategy A\n|{{diagonal split header|''4'' | ''4''|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|''1'' | ''3''|transparent}}\n|-\n!Player 1 adopts strategy B\n|{{diagonal split header|''3'' | ''1''|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|''2'' | ''2''|transparent}}\n|-\n|}\n\nThe ''coordination game'' is a classic ([[symmetric game|symmetric]]) two player, two [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]] game, with an example [[payoff matrix]] shown to the right. The players should thus coordinate, both adopting strategy A, to receive the highest payoff; i.e., 4. If both players chose strategy B though, there is still a Nash equilibrium. Although each player is awarded less than optimal payoff, neither player has incentive to change strategy due to a reduction in the immediate payoff (from 2 to 1).\n\nA famous example of this type of game was called the [[stag hunt]]; in the game two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the former providing more meat (4 utility units) than the latter (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, he will fail in hunting (0 utility units), whereas if they both hunt it they will split the payload (2, 2). The game hence exhibits two equilibria at (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit) and hence the players' optimal strategy depend on their expectation on what the other player may do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they suspect that the other will hunt the rabbit, they should hunt the rabbit. This game was used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.\n\nAnother example of a coordination game is the setting where two technologies are available to two firms with comparable products, and they have to elect a strategy to become the market standard. If both firms agree on the chosen technology, high sales are expected for both firms. If the firms do not agree on the standard technology, few sales result. Both strategies are Nash equilibria of the game.\n\nDriving on a road against an oncoming car, and having to choose either to swerve on the left or to swerve on the right of the road, is also a coordination game. For example, with payoffs 10 meaning no crash and 0 meaning a crash, the coordination game can be defined with the following payoff matrix:\n\n{| align=left border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom |''The driving game''\n! {{diagonal split header|Driver 1 | Driver 2}}\n!Drive on the Left\n!Drive on the Right\n|-\n!Drive on the Left\n|{{diagonal split header|10| 10|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|0| 0|transparent}}\n|-\n!Drive on the Right\n|{{diagonal split header|0| 0|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|10| 10|transparent}}\n|-\n|}\n\nIn this case there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]] (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%, 100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player are (50%, 50%).\n\n{{Clear left}}\n\n=== Prisoner's dilemma ===\n{{Main|Prisoner's dilemma}}\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom | ''Example PD payoff matrix\n! {{diagonal split header|Prisoner 1 | Prisoner 2}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900\"|Cooperate (with other)\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900\"|Defect (betray other)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"color: #009\"|Cooperate (with other)\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">\u22121</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">\u22121</span>\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">\u22123</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">0</span>\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"color: #009\"|Defect (betray other)\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">0</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">\u22123</span>\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">\u22122</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">\u22122</span>\n|}\nImagine two prisoners held in separate cells, interrogated simultaneously, and offered deals (lighter jail sentences) for betraying their fellow criminal. They can \"cooperate\" (with the other prisoner) by not snitching, or \"defect\" by betraying the other. However, there is a catch; if both players defect, then they both serve a longer sentence than if neither said anything. Lower jail sentences are interpreted as higher payoffs (shown in the table).\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma has a similar matrix as depicted for the coordination game, but the maximum reward for each player (in this case, a minimum loss of 0) is obtained only when the players' decisions are different. Each player improves their own situation by switching from \"cooperating\" to \"defecting\", given knowledge that the other player's best decision is to \"defect\". The prisoner's dilemma thus has a single Nash equilibrium: both players choosing to defect.\n\nWhat has long made this an interesting case to study is the fact that this scenario is globally inferior to \"both cooperating\". That is, both players would be better off if they both chose to \"cooperate\" instead of both choosing to defect. However, each player could improve their own situation by breaking the mutual cooperation, no matter how the other player possibly (or certainly) changes their decision.\n\n=== Network traffic ===\n{{See also|Braess's paradox}}\n[[File:Nash graph equilibrium.png|thumb|250px|Sample network graph. Values on edges are the travel time experienced by a 'car' traveling down that edge. {{mvar|x}} is the number of cars traveling via that edge.]]\nAn application of Nash equilibria is in determining the expected flow of traffic in a network. Consider the graph on the right. If we assume that there are {{mvar|x}} \"cars\" traveling from A to D, what is the expected distribution of traffic in the network?\n\nThis situation can be modeled as a \"game\" where every traveler has a choice of 3 strategies, where each strategy is a route from A to D (either {{math|ABD}}, {{math|ABCD}}, or {{math|ACD}}). The \"payoff\" of each strategy is the travel time of each route. In the graph on the right, a car travelling via {{math|ABD}} experiences travel time of {{math|(1+''x''/100)+2}}, where {{mvar|x}} is the number of cars traveling on edge {{math|AB}}. Thus, payoffs for any given strategy depend on the choices of the other players, as is usual. However, the goal, in this case, is to minimize travel time, not maximize it. Equilibrium will occur when the time on all paths is exactly the same. When that happens, no single driver has any incentive to switch routes, since it can only add to their travel time. For the graph on the right, if, for example, 100 cars are travelling from A to D, then equilibrium will occur when 25 drivers travel via {{math|ABD}}, 50 via {{math|ABCD}}, and 25 via {{math|ACD}}. Every driver now has a total travel time of 3.75 (to see this, note that a total of 75 cars take the {{math|AB}} edge, and likewise, 75 cars take the {{math|CD}} edge).<!-- 25 drivers travel via ABD and 50 via ABCD, so 75 cars travel on edge AB. Similarly, 75 cars travel on edge CD. It takes (1 + 75/100) + 2 = 3.75 to travel via ABD. The travel time of the other routes is the same. -->\n\nNotice that this distribution is not, actually, socially optimal. If the 100 cars agreed that 50 travel via {{math|ABD}} and the other 50 through {{math|ACD}}, then travel time for any single car would actually be 3.5, which is less than 3.75. This is also the Nash equilibrium if the path between B and C is removed, which means that adding another possible route can decrease the efficiency of the system, a phenomenon known as [[Braess's paradox]].\n\n=== Competition game ===\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A competition game''\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!

In addition, if one player chooses a larger number than the other, then they have to give up two points to the other.\n\nThis game has a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium: both players choosing 0 (highlighted in light red). Any other strategy can be improved by a player switching their number to one less than that of the other player. In the adjacent table, if the game begins at the green square, it is in player 1's interest to move to the purple square and it is in player 2's interest to move to the blue square. Although it would not fit the definition of a competition game, if the game is modified so that the two players win the named amount if they both choose the same number, and otherwise win nothing, then there are 4 Nash equilibria: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).\n\n=== Nash equilibria in a payoff matrix ===\nThere is an easy numerical way to identify Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule does not apply to the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. '''The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in the payoff pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum of the row of the cell - then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.'''\n\n{| align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|++ align=bottom |''A payoff matrix \u2013 Nash equilibria in bold''\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!Option A\n!Option B\n!Option C\n|-\n!Option A\n|align=center|0, 0\n|align=center|'''25, 40'''\n|align=center|5, 10\n|-\n!Option B\n|align=center|'''40, 25'''\n|align=center|0, 0\n|align=center|5, 15\n|-\n!Option C\n|align=center|10, 5\n|align=center|15, 5\n|align=center|'''10, 10'''\n|-\n|}\n\nWe can apply this rule to a 3\u00d73 matrix:\n\nUsing the rule, we can very quickly (much faster than with formal analysis) see that the Nash equilibria cells are (B,A), (A,B), and (C,C). Indeed, for cell (B,A) 40 is the maximum of the first column and 25 is the maximum of the second row. For (A,B) 25 is the maximum of the second column and 40 is the maximum of the first row. Same for cell (C,C). For other cells, either one or both of the duplet members are not the maximum of the corresponding rows and columns.\n\nThis said, the actual mechanics of finding equilibrium cells is obvious: find the maximum of a column and check if the second member of the pair is the maximum of the row. If these conditions are met, the cell represents a Nash equilibrium. Check all columns this way to find all NE cells. An N\u00d7N matrix may have between 0 and N\u00d7N [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] Nash equilibria.\n\n{{clear}}<!-- layout fix for wide screens -->\n\n== Stability ==\nThe concept of [[Stability theory|stability]], useful in the analysis of many kinds of equilibria, can also be applied to Nash equilibria.\n\nA Nash equilibrium for a mixed-strategy game is stable if a small change (specifically, an infinitesimal change) in probabilities for one player leads to a situation where two conditions hold:\n\n# the player who did not change has no better strategy in the new circumstance\n# the player who did change is now playing with a strictly worse strategy.\n\nIf these cases are both met, then a player with the small change in their mixed strategy will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium is said to be stable. If condition one does not hold then the equilibrium is unstable. If only condition one holds then there are likely to be an infinite number of optimal strategies for the player who changed.\n\nIn the \"driving game\" example above there are both stable and unstable equilibria. The equilibria involving mixed strategies with 100% probabilities are stable. If either player changes their probabilities slightly, they will be both at a disadvantage, and their opponent will have no reason to change their strategy in turn. The (50%,50%) equilibrium is unstable. If either player changes their probabilities (which would neither benefit or damage the [[Expected value|expectation]] of the player who did the change, if the other player's mixed strategy is still (50%,50%)), then the other player immediately has a better strategy at either (0%, 100%) or (100%, 0%).\n\nStability is crucial in practical applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but has to be inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game. In this case unstable equilibria are very unlikely to arise in practice, since any minute change in the proportions of each strategy seen will lead to a change in strategy and the breakdown of the equilibrium.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium defines stability only in terms of unilateral deviations. In cooperative games such a concept is not convincing enough. [[Strong Nash equilibrium]] allows for deviations by every conceivable coalition.<ref name=\"CoalitionProof\">{{Citation|doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(87)90099-8|title = Coalition-Proof Equilibria I.

CPNE is related to the [[Core (economics)|theory of the core]].\n\nFinally in the eighties, building with great depth on such ideas [[Mertens-stable equilibria]] were introduced as a [[solution concept]]. Mertens stable equilibria satisfy both [[forward induction]] and [[backward induction]]. In a [[game theory]] context [[stable equilibria]] now usually refer to Mertens stable equilibria.\n\n== Occurrence ==\nIf a game has a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] Nash equilibrium and is played among players under certain conditions, then the NE strategy set will be adopted. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that the Nash equilibrium is played are:\n# The players all will do their utmost to maximize their expected payoff as described by the game.\n# The players are flawless in execution.\n# The players have sufficient intelligence to deduce the solution.\n# The players know the planned equilibrium strategy of all of the other players.\n# The players believe that a deviation in their own strategy will not cause deviations by any other players.\n# There is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that they all know that they meet them, and know that they know that they know that they meet them, and so on.\n\n=== Where the conditions are not met ===\nExamples of [[game theory]] problems in which these conditions are not met:\n# The first condition is not met if the game does not correctly describe the quantities a player wishes to maximize. In this case there is no particular reason for that player to adopt an equilibrium strategy. For instance, the prisoner's dilemma is not a dilemma if either player is happy to be jailed indefinitely.\n# Intentional or accidental imperfection in execution. For example, a computer capable of flawless logical play facing a second flawless computer will result in equilibrium. Introduction of imperfection will lead to its disruption either through loss to the player who makes the mistake, or through negation of the [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] criterion leading to possible victory for the player. (An example would be a player suddenly putting the car into reverse in the [[game of chicken]], ensuring a no-loss no-win scenario).\n# In many cases, the third condition is not met because, even though the equilibrium must exist, it is unknown due to the complexity of the game, for instance in [[Chinese chess]].<ref>T.

Players wrongly distrusting each other's rationality may adopt counter-strategies to expected irrational play on their opponents\u2019 behalf. This is a major consideration in \"[[Game of chicken|chicken]]\" or an [[arms race]], for example.\n\n=== Where the conditions are met ===\nIn his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash proposed two interpretations of his equilibrium concept, with the objective of showing how equilibrium points\n\n{{quote|(...) can be connected with observable phenomenon. ''One interpretation is rationalistic: if we assume that players are rational, know the full structure of'' the game, the game is played just once, and there is just one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium. This idea was formalized by Aumann, R. and A. Brandenburger, 1995, ''Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium'', Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).}}\n\nA second interpretation, that Nash referred to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players:\n\n{{quote|[i]t is unnecessary to assume that the participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. ''What is assumed is that there is a population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the ''average member'' of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.''}}\n\nFor a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, \"The Work of John Nash in Game Theory,\" ''Journal of Economic Theory'', 69, 153\u2013185.\n\nDue to the limited conditions in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated as a guide to day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in [[economics]] and [[evolutionary biology]], the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology is gene transmission; both are the fundamental bottom line of survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the \"[[Nash equilibrium#Stability|stability]]\" theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research.<ref>J. C. Cox, M. Walker, ''[http://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/learnplay.pdf Learning to Play Cournot Duoploy Strategies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211182058/http://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/learnplay.pdf |date=2013-12-11 }}'', copyright 1997, Texas A&M University,  University of Arizona, pages 141-144</ref>\n\n== NE and non-credible threats ==\n[[File:SGPNEandPlainNE explainingexample.svg|300px|thumb|Extensive and Normal form illustrations that show the difference between SPNE and other NE. The blue equilibrium is not subgame perfect because player two makes a non-credible threat at 2(2) to be unkind (U).]]\nThe Nash equilibrium is a superset of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The subgame perfect equilibrium in addition to the Nash equilibrium requires that the strategy also is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of that game. This eliminates all [[non-credible threats]], that is, strategies that contain non-rational moves in order to make the counter-player change their strategy.\n\nThe image to the right shows a simple sequential game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be a more meaningful solution concept when such [[dynamic inconsistency|dynamic inconsistencies]] arise.\n\n==Proof of existence==\n\n=== Proof using the Kakutani fixed-point theorem ===\nNash's original proof (in his thesis) used Brouwer's fixed-point theorem (e.g., see below for a variant). We give a simpler proof via the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, following Nash's 1950 paper (he credits [[David Gale]] with the observation that such a simplification is possible).\n\nTo prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, let <math>r_i(\\sigma_{-i})</math> be the best response of player i to the strategies of all other players.\n:<math> r_i(\\sigma_{-i}) = \\mathop{\\underset{\\sigma_i}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}}} u_i (\\sigma_i,\\sigma_{-i}) </math>\n\nHere, <math>\\sigma \\in \\Sigma</math>, where <math>\\Sigma = \\Sigma_i \\times \\Sigma_{-i}</math>, is a mixed-strategy profile in the set of all mixed strategies and <math> u_i </math> is the payoff function for player i. Define a [[Multivalued function|set-valued function]] <math>r\\colon \\Sigma \\rightarrow 2^\\Sigma </math> such that <math>r = r_i(\\sigma_{-i})\\times r_{-i}(\\sigma_{i}) </math>. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is equivalent to <math>r</math> having a fixed point.\n\n[[Kakutani fixed-point theorem|Kakutani's fixed point theorem]] guarantees the existence of a fixed point if the following four conditions are satisfied.\n# <math> \\Sigma</math> is compact, convex, and nonempty.\n# <math>r(\\sigma)</math> is nonempty.\n# <math>r(\\sigma)</math> is [[Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]]\n# <math>r(\\sigma)</math> is convex.\n\nCondition 1. is satisfied from the fact that <math>\\Sigma</math> is a simplex and thus compact. Convexity follows from players' ability to mix strategies.   <math>\\Sigma</math> is nonempty as long as players have strategies.\n\nCondition 2. and 3. are satisfied by way of Berge's [[maximum theorem]]. Because <math> u_i </math> is continuous and compact, <math> r(\\sigma_i) </math> is non-empty and [[Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]].\n\nCondition 4. is satisfied as a result of mixed strategies. Suppose  <math> \\sigma_i, \\sigma'_i \\in r(\\sigma_{-i}) </math>, then  <math> \\lambda \\sigma_i + (1-\\lambda) \\sigma'_i \\in r(\\sigma_{-i}) </math>. i.e. if two strategies maximize payoffs, then a mix between the two strategies will yield the same payoff.\n\nTherefore, there exists a fixed point in  <math> r </math> and a Nash equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fudenburg |first=Drew |first2=Jean |last2=Tirole |title=Game Theory |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-262-06141-4 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Nash made this point to [[John von Neumann]] in 1949, von Neumann famously dismissed it with the words, \"That's trivial, you know. That's just a [[fixed-point theorem]].\" (See Nasar, 1998, p.&nbsp;94.)\n\n=== Alternate proof using the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] ===\n\nWe have a game <math>G=(N,A,u)</math> where <math>N</math> is the number of players and <math>A = A_1 \\times \\cdots \\times A_N</math> is the action set for the players. All of the action sets <math>A_i</math> are finite. Let <math>\\Delta = \\Delta_1 \\times \\cdots \\times \\Delta_N</math> denote the set of mixed strategies for the players. The finiteness of the <math>A_i</math>s ensures the compactness of <math>\\Delta</math>.\n\nWe can now define the gain functions. For a mixed strategy <math>\\sigma \\in \\Delta</math>, we let the gain for player <math>i</math> on action <math>a \\in A_i</math> be\n\n:<math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a) = \\max \\{0, u_i(a, \\sigma_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma_{i}, \\sigma_{-i})\\}.</math>\n\nThe gain function represents the benefit a player gets by unilaterally changing their strategy. We now define <math>g = (g_1,\\dotsc,g_N)</math> where\n\n:<math>g_i(\\sigma)(a) = \\sigma_i(a) + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\sigma \\in \\Delta, a \\in A_i</math>. We see that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma)(a) = \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma_i(a) + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a) = 1 + \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a) > 0.</math>\n\nNext we define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f = (f_1, \\cdots, f_N)  : \\Delta \\to \\Delta \\\\ f_i(\\sigma)(a) = \\frac{g_i(\\sigma)(a)}{\\sum_{b \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma)(b)} & a \\in A_i \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIt is easy to see that each <math>f_i</math> is a valid mixed strategy in <math>\\Delta_i</math>. It is also easy to check that each <math>f_i</math> is a continuous function of <math>\\sigma</math>, and hence <math>f</math> is a continuous function. As the cross product of a finite number of compact convex sets, <math>\\Delta</math> is also compact and convex. Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem to <math>f</math> and <math>\\Delta</math> we conclude that <math>f</math> has a fixed point in <math>\\Delta</math>, call it <math>\\sigma^*</math>. We claim that <math>\\sigma^*</math> is a Nash equilibrium in <math>G</math>. For this purpose, it suffices to show that\n\n:<math> \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, N\\}, \\forall a \\in A_i: \\quad \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,a) = 0.</math>\n\nThis simply states that each player gains no benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, which is exactly the necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium.\n\nNow assume that the gains are not all zero. Therefore, <math>\\exists i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, N\\},</math> and <math>a \\in A_i</math> such that <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) > 0</math>. Note then that\n\n:<math> \\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma^*, a) = 1 + \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,a) > 1.</math>\n\nSo let\n\n:<math>C = \\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma^*, a).</math>\n\nAlso we shall denote <math>\\text{Gain}(i,\\cdot)</math> as the gain vector indexed by actions in <math>A_i</math>. Since <math>\\sigma^*</math> is the fixed point we have:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sigma^* = f(\\sigma^*)  &\\Rightarrow  \\sigma^*_i =  f_i(\\sigma^*) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\sigma^*_i = \\frac{g_i(\\sigma^*)}{\\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma^*)(a)} \\\\ [6pt]\n&\\Rightarrow \\sigma^*_i = \\frac{1}{C} \\left (\\sigma^*_i + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot) \\right ) \\\\ [6pt]\n&\\Rightarrow C\\sigma^*_i = \\sigma^*_i + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\left(C-1\\right)\\sigma^*_i = \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\sigma^*_i = \\left(\\frac{1}{C-1}\\right)\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince <math>C > 1</math> we have that <math>\\sigma^*_i</math> is some positive scaling of the vector <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot)</math>. Now we claim that\n\n:<math>\\forall a \\in A_i: \\quad  \\sigma^*_i(a)(u_i(a_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i})) = \\sigma^*_i(a)\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) </math>\n\nTo see this, we first note that if <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) > 0</math> then this is true by definition of the gain function.  Now assume that <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) = 0</math>. By our previous statements we have that\n\n:<math>\\sigma^*_i(a) = \\left(\\frac{1}{C-1}\\right)\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) = 0 </math>\n\nand so the left term is zero, giving us that the entire expression is <math>0</math> as needed.\n\nSo we finally have that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0 &= u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) \\\\\n  &=  \\left(\\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma^*_i(a)u_i(a_i, \\sigma^*_{-i})\\right) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) \\\\\n & =  \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma^*_i(a) (u_i(a_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i})) \\\\ \n & = \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma^*_i(a) \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) && \\text{ by the previous statements } \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\left( C -1 \\right) \\sigma^*_i(a)^2 > 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the last inequality follows since <math>\\sigma^*_i</math> is a non-zero vector. But this is a clear contradiction, so all the gains must indeed be zero. Therefore, <math>\\sigma^*</math> is a Nash equilibrium for <math>G</math> as needed.\n\n== Computing Nash equilibria ==\nIf a player A has a [[dominant strategy]] <math>s_A</math> then there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays <math>s_A</math>. In the case of two players A and B, there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays <math>s_A</math> and B plays a best response to <math>s_A</math>. If <math>s_A</math> is a strictly dominant strategy, A plays <math>s_A</math> in all Nash equilibria. If both A and B have strictly dominant strategies, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in which each plays their strictly dominant strategy.\n\nIn games with mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the probability of a player choosing any particular strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing to randomize, their expected payoff for each strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.<ref name=\"preliminaries\" />\n\n=== Examples ===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ align=bottom |''Matching pennies''\n! {{diagonal split header|Player A|Player B}}\n!Player B plays H\n!Player B plays T\n|-\n!Player A plays H\n|align=center|\u22121, +1\n|align=center|+1, \u22121\n|-\n!Player A plays T\n|align=center|+1, \u22121\n|align=center|\u22121, +1\n|-\n|}\n\nIn the matching pennies game, player A loses a point to B if A and B play the same strategy and wins a point from B if they play different strategies.

Likewise, a group of players are in Nash equilibrium if each one is making the best decision possible, taking into account the decisions of the others in the game as long as the other parties' decisions remain unchanged.\n\nNash showed that there is a Nash equilibrium for every finite game: see further the article on [[Strategy (game theory)|strategy]].\n\n==Applications==\nGame theorists use the Nash equilibrium concept to analyze the outcome of the [[strategy|strategic interaction]] of several [[decision making|decision makers]]. In other words, it provides a way of predicting what will happen if several people or several institutions are making decisions at the same time, and if the outcome for each of them depends on the decisions of the others. The simple insight underlying Nash's idea is that one cannot predict the result of the choices of multiple decision makers if one analyzes those decisions in isolation. Instead, one must ask what each player would do, taking into account the decision-making of the others.\n\nThe concept has been used to analyze hostile situations like wars and arms races<ref>Schelling, Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=7RkL4Z8Yg5AC&dq=thoma+schelling+strategy+of+conflict&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=en&ei=xuSjSbK-I4-O_gai_ticBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPP13,M1 The Strategy of Conflict]'', copyright 1960, 1980, Harvard University Press, {{isbn|0-674-84031-3}}.</ref> (see [[prisoner's dilemma]]), and also how conflict may be mitigated by repeated interaction (see [[tit-for-tat]]). It has also been used to study to what extent people with different preferences can cooperate (see [[Battle of the sexes (game theory)|battle of the sexes]]), and whether they will take risks to achieve a cooperative outcome (see [[stag hunt]]).

A version of the Nash equilibrium concept was first known to be used in 1838 by [[Antoine Augustin Cournot]] in his theory of [[oligopoly]].<ref>Cournot A. (1838) Researches on the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth</ref> In Cournot's theory, firms choose how much output to produce to maximize their own profit. However, the best output for one firm depends on the outputs of others. A [[Cournot equilibrium]] occurs when each firm's output maximizes its profits given the output of the other firms, which is a [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] Nash equilibrium. Cournot also introduced the concept of [[best response]] dynamics in his analysis of the stability of equilibrium. However, Nash's definition of equilibrium is broader than Cournot's. It is also broader than the definition of a Pareto-efficient equilibrium, since the Nash definition makes no judgements about the optimality of the equilibrium being generated.\n\nThe modern game-theoretic concept of Nash equilibrium is instead defined in terms of [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]], where players choose a probability distribution over possible actions. The concept of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium was introduced by [[John von Neumann]] and [[Oskar Morgenstern]] in their 1944 book ''The Theory of Games and Economic Behavior''. However, their analysis was restricted to the special case of [[zero-sum]] games. They showed that a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium will exist for any zero-sum game with a finite set of actions.<ref>J. Von Neumann, O. Morgenstern, ''[https://archive.org/stream/theoryofgamesand030098mbp#page/n5/mode/2up Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]'', copyright 1944, 1953, Princeton University Press</ref> The contribution of Nash in his 1951 article \"Non-Cooperative Games\" was to define a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium for any game with a finite set of actions and prove that at least one (mixed-strategy) Nash equilibrium must exist in such a game. The key to Nash's ability to prove existence far more generally than von Neumann lay in his definition of equilibrium. According to Nash, \"an equilibrium point is an n-tuple such that each player's mixed strategy maximizes his payoff if the strategies of the others are held fixed. Thus each player's strategy is optimal against those of the others.\" Just putting the problem in this framework allowed Nash to employ the [[Kakutani fixed-point theorem]] in his 1950 paper, and a variant upon it in his 1951 paper used the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] to prove that there had to exist at least one mixed strategy profile that mapped back into itself for finite-player (not necessarily zero-sum) games; namely, a strategy profile that did not call for a shift in strategies that could improve payoffs.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Carmona |first=Guilherme |first2=Konrad |last2=Podczeck |year=2009|title=On the Existence of Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria in Large Games |ssrn=882466 |journal=[[Journal of Economic Theory]] |volume=144 |issue=3 |pages=1300\u20131319 |doi=10.1016/j.jet.2008.11.009 |url=http://fesrvsd.fe.unl.pt/WPFEUNL/WP2008/wp531.pdf }}</ref>\n\nSince the development of the Nash equilibrium concept, game theorists have discovered that it makes misleading predictions (or fails to make a unique prediction) in certain circumstances. They have proposed many related [[solution concept]]s (also called 'refinements' of Nash equilibria) designed to overcome perceived flaws in the Nash concept. One particularly important issue is that some Nash equilibria may be based on threats that are not '[[credibility|credible]]'. In 1965 [[Reinhard Selten]] proposed [[subgame perfect equilibrium]] as a refinement that eliminates equilibria which depend on [[non-credible threats]]. Other extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept have addressed what happens if a game is [[Repeated game|repeated]], or what happens if a game is played in the [[Global game|absence of complete information]]. However, subsequent refinements and extensions of the Nash equilibrium concept share the main insight on which Nash's concept rests: all equilibrium concepts analyze what choices will be made when each player takes into account the decision-making of others.\n\n==Definitions==\n\n===Nash Equilibrium===\nInformally, a strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing his or her strategy. To see what this means, imagine that each player is told the strategies of the others. Suppose then that each player asks themselves: \"Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, can I benefit by changing my strategy?\"\n\nIf any player could answer \"Yes\", then that set of strategies is not a Nash equilibrium. But if every player prefers not to switch (or is indifferent between switching and not) then the strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium. Thus, each strategy in a Nash equilibrium is a [[best response]] to all other strategies in that equilibrium.<ref name=\"preliminaries\">{{cite web\n| last = von Ahn\n| first = Luis\n| title = Preliminaries of Game Theory\n| url = http://www.scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures_f11/lecture09.pdf\n| accessdate = 2008-11-07\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111018035629/http://scienceoftheweb.org/15-396/lectures_f11/lecture09.pdf\n| archive-date = 2011-10-18\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto optimal]].\n\nThe Nash equilibrium may also have non-rational consequences in [[sequential game]]s because players may \"threaten\" each other with non-rational moves. For such games the [[subgame perfect Nash equilibrium]] may be more meaningful as a tool of analysis.\n\n=== Strict/Weak Equilibrium ===\nSuppose that in the Nash equilibrium, each player asks themselves: \"Knowing the strategies of the other players, and treating the strategies of the other players as set in stone, would I suffer a loss by changing my strategy?\"\n\nIf every player's answer is \"Yes\", then the equilibrium is classified as a ''strict Nash equilibrium''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hoylab.cornell.edu/nash.html|title=Nash Equilibria|website=hoylab.cornell.edu|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> \n\nIf instead, for some player, there is exact equality between the strategy in Nash equilibrium and some other strategy that gives the exactly same payout (i.e. this player is indifferent between switching and not), then the equilibrium is classified as a ''weak Nash equilibrium''.\n\nA game can have a [[Pure strategy|pure-strategy]] or a [[Mixed strategy|mixed-strategy]] Nash equilibrium. (In the latter a pure strategy is chosen [[stochastic]]ally with a fixed [[probability]]).\n\n===Nash's Existence Theorem===\nNash proved that if we allow [[strategy (game theory)#Pure and mixed strategies|mixed strategies]] (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then every game with a finite number of players in which each player can choose from finitely many pure strategies has at least one Nash equilibrium.\n\nNash equilibria need not exist if the set of choices is infinite and noncompact.  An example is a game where two players simultaneously name a natural number and the player naming the larger number wins. However, a Nash equilibrium exists if the set of choices is [[compact space|compact]] with continuous payoff.<ref>MIT OpenCourseWare. 6.254: Game Theory with Engineering Applications, Spring 2010. [https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-254-game-theory-with-engineering-applications-spring-2010/lecture-notes/MIT6_254S10_lec06.pdf Lecture 6: Continuous and Discontinuous Games].</ref>  An example, in which the equilibrium is a mixture of continuously many pure strategies, is a game where two players simultaneously pick a real number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) and player one's winnings (paid by the second player) equal the square root of the distance between the two numbers.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Coordination game ===\n{{Main|Coordination game}}\n\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A sample coordination game showing relative payoff for player 1 (row) / player 2 (column) with each combination\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!style=\"width: 90px\"|Player 2 adopts strategy A\n!style=\"width: 90px\"|Player 2 adopts strategy B\n|-\n!style=\"width: 90px\"|Player 1 adopts strategy A\n|{{diagonal split header|''4'' | ''4''|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|''1'' | ''3''|transparent}}\n|-\n!Player 1 adopts strategy B\n|{{diagonal split header|''3'' | ''1''|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|''2'' | ''2''|transparent}}\n|-\n|}\n\nThe ''coordination game'' is a classic ([[symmetric game|symmetric]]) two player, two [[strategy (game theory)|strategy]] game, with an example [[payoff matrix]] shown to the right. The players should thus coordinate, both adopting strategy A, to receive the highest payoff; i.e., 4. If both players chose strategy B though, there is still a Nash equilibrium. Although each player is awarded less than optimal payoff, neither player has incentive to change strategy due to a reduction in the immediate payoff (from 2 to 1).\n\nA famous example of this type of game was called the [[stag hunt]]; in the game two players may choose to hunt a stag or a rabbit, the former providing more meat (4 utility units) than the latter (1 utility unit). The caveat is that the stag must be cooperatively hunted, so if one player attempts to hunt the stag, while the other hunts the rabbit, he will fail in hunting (0 utility units), whereas if they both hunt it they will split the payload (2, 2). The game hence exhibits two equilibria at (stag, stag) and (rabbit, rabbit) and hence the players' optimal strategy depend on their expectation on what the other player may do. If one hunter trusts that the other will hunt the stag, they should hunt the stag; however if they suspect that the other will hunt the rabbit, they should hunt the rabbit. This game was used as an analogy for social cooperation, since much of the benefit that people gain in society depends upon people cooperating and implicitly trusting one another to act in a manner corresponding with cooperation.\n\nAnother example of a coordination game is the setting where two technologies are available to two firms with comparable products, and they have to elect a strategy to become the market standard. If both firms agree on the chosen technology, high sales are expected for both firms. If the firms do not agree on the standard technology, few sales result. Both strategies are Nash equilibria of the game.\n\nDriving on a road against an oncoming car, and having to choose either to swerve on the left or to swerve on the right of the road, is also a coordination game. For example, with payoffs 10 meaning no crash and 0 meaning a crash, the coordination game can be defined with the following payoff matrix:\n\n{| align=left border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom |''The driving game''\n! {{diagonal split header|Driver 1 | Driver 2}}\n!Drive on the Left\n!Drive on the Right\n|-\n!Drive on the Left\n|{{diagonal split header|10| 10|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|0| 0|transparent}}\n|-\n!Drive on the Right\n|{{diagonal split header|0| 0|transparent}}\n|{{diagonal split header|10| 10|transparent}}\n|-\n|}\n\nIn this case there are two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, when both choose to either drive on the left or on the right. If we admit [[mixed strategy|mixed strategies]] (where a pure strategy is chosen at random, subject to some fixed probability), then there are three Nash equilibria for the same case: two we have seen from the pure-strategy form, where the probabilities are (0%, 100%) for player one, (0%, 100%) for player two; and (100%, 0%) for player one, (100%, 0%) for player two respectively. We add another where the probabilities for each player are (50%, 50%).\n\n{{Clear left}}\n\n=== Prisoner's dilemma ===\n{{Main|Prisoner's dilemma}}\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%; text-align:center\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom | ''Example PD payoff matrix\n! {{diagonal split header|Prisoner 1 | Prisoner 2}}\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900\"|Cooperate (with other)\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"color: #900\"|Defect (betray other)\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"color: #009\"|Cooperate (with other)\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">\u22121</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">\u22121</span>\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">\u22123</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">0</span>\n|-\n!scope=\"row\" style=\"color: #009\"|Defect (betray other)\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">0</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">\u22123</span>\n|<span style=\"color: #009\">\u22122</span>, <span style=\"color: #900\">\u22122</span>\n|}\nImagine two prisoners held in separate cells, interrogated simultaneously, and offered deals (lighter jail sentences) for betraying their fellow criminal. They can \"cooperate\" (with the other prisoner) by not snitching, or \"defect\" by betraying the other. However, there is a catch; if both players defect, then they both serve a longer sentence than if neither said anything. Lower jail sentences are interpreted as higher payoffs (shown in the table).\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma has a similar matrix as depicted for the coordination game, but the maximum reward for each player (in this case, a minimum loss of 0) is obtained only when the players' decisions are different. Each player improves their own situation by switching from \"cooperating\" to \"defecting\", given knowledge that the other player's best decision is to \"defect\". The prisoner's dilemma thus has a single Nash equilibrium: both players choosing to defect.\n\nWhat has long made this an interesting case to study is the fact that this scenario is globally inferior to \"both cooperating\". That is, both players would be better off if they both chose to \"cooperate\" instead of both choosing to defect. However, each player could improve their own situation by breaking the mutual cooperation, no matter how the other player possibly (or certainly) changes their decision.\n\n=== Network traffic ===\n{{See also|Braess's paradox}}\n[[File:Nash graph equilibrium.png|thumb|250px|Sample network graph. Values on edges are the travel time experienced by a 'car' traveling down that edge. {{mvar|x}} is the number of cars traveling via that edge.]]\nAn application of Nash equilibria is in determining the expected flow of traffic in a network. Consider the graph on the right. If we assume that there are {{mvar|x}} \"cars\" traveling from A to D, what is the expected distribution of traffic in the network?\n\nThis situation can be modeled as a \"game\" where every traveler has a choice of 3 strategies, where each strategy is a route from A to D (either {{math|ABD}}, {{math|ABCD}}, or {{math|ACD}}). The \"payoff\" of each strategy is the travel time of each route. In the graph on the right, a car travelling via {{math|ABD}} experiences travel time of {{math|(1+''x''/100)+2}}, where {{mvar|x}} is the number of cars traveling on edge {{math|AB}}. Thus, payoffs for any given strategy depend on the choices of the other players, as is usual. However, the goal, in this case, is to minimize travel time, not maximize it. Equilibrium will occur when the time on all paths is exactly the same. When that happens, no single driver has any incentive to switch routes, since it can only add to their travel time. For the graph on the right, if, for example, 100 cars are travelling from A to D, then equilibrium will occur when 25 drivers travel via {{math|ABD}}, 50 via {{math|ABCD}}, and 25 via {{math|ACD}}. Every driver now has a total travel time of 3.75 (to see this, note that a total of 75 cars take the {{math|AB}} edge, and likewise, 75 cars take the {{math|CD}} edge).<!-- 25 drivers travel via ABD and 50 via ABCD, so 75 cars travel on edge AB. Similarly, 75 cars travel on edge CD. It takes (1 + 75/100) + 2 = 3.75 to travel via ABD. The travel time of the other routes is the same. -->\n\nNotice that this distribution is not, actually, socially optimal. If the 100 cars agreed that 50 travel via {{math|ABD}} and the other 50 through {{math|ACD}}, then travel time for any single car would actually be 3.5, which is less than 3.75. This is also the Nash equilibrium if the path between B and C is removed, which means that adding another possible route can decrease the efficiency of the system, a phenomenon known as [[Braess's paradox]].\n\n=== Competition game ===\n{| align=right border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ align=bottom |''A competition game''\n! {{diagonal split header|<br />Player 1|Player 2}}\n!

In addition, if one player chooses a larger number than the other, then they have to give up two points to the other.\n\nThis game has a unique pure-strategy Nash equilibrium: both players choosing 0 (highlighted in light red). Any other strategy can be improved by a player switching their number to one less than that of the other player. In the adjacent table, if the game begins at the green square, it is in player 1's interest to move to the purple square and it is in player 2's interest to move to the blue square. Although it would not fit the definition of a competition game, if the game is modified so that the two players win the named amount if they both choose the same number, and otherwise win nothing, then there are 4 Nash equilibria: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).\n\n=== Nash equilibria in a payoff matrix ===\nThere is an easy numerical way to identify Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule does not apply to the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest.

Indeed, for cell (B,A) 40 is the maximum of the first column and 25 is the maximum of the second row. For (A,B) 25 is the maximum of the second column and 40 is the maximum of the first row. Same for cell (C,C). For other cells, either one or both of the duplet members are not the maximum of the corresponding rows and columns.\n\nThis said, the actual mechanics of finding equilibrium cells is obvious: find the maximum of a column and check if the second member of the pair is the maximum of the row. If these conditions are met, the cell represents a Nash equilibrium. Check all columns this way to find all NE cells. An N\u00d7N matrix may have between 0 and N\u00d7N [[pure strategy|pure-strategy]] Nash equilibria.\n\n{{clear}}<!-- layout fix for wide screens -->\n\n== Stability ==\nThe concept of [[Stability theory|stability]], useful in the analysis of many kinds of equilibria, can also be applied to Nash equilibria.\n\nA Nash equilibrium for a mixed-strategy game is stable if a small change (specifically, an infinitesimal change) in probabilities for one player leads to a situation where two conditions hold:\n\n# the player who did not change has no better strategy in the new circumstance\n# the player who did change is now playing with a strictly worse strategy.\n\nIf these cases are both met, then a player with the small change in their mixed strategy will return immediately to the Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium is said to be stable. If condition one does not hold then the equilibrium is unstable. If only condition one holds then there are likely to be an infinite number of optimal strategies for the player who changed.\n\nIn the \"driving game\" example above there are both stable and unstable equilibria. The equilibria involving mixed strategies with 100% probabilities are stable. If either player changes their probabilities slightly, they will be both at a disadvantage, and their opponent will have no reason to change their strategy in turn. The (50%,50%) equilibrium is unstable. If either player changes their probabilities (which would neither benefit or damage the [[Expected value|expectation]] of the player who did the change, if the other player's mixed strategy is still (50%,50%)), then the other player immediately has a better strategy at either (0%, 100%) or (100%, 0%).\n\nStability is crucial in practical applications of Nash equilibria, since the mixed strategy of each player is not perfectly known, but has to be inferred from statistical distribution of their actions in the game. In this case unstable equilibria are very unlikely to arise in practice, since any minute change in the proportions of each strategy seen will lead to a change in strategy and the breakdown of the equilibrium.\n\nThe Nash equilibrium defines stability only in terms of unilateral deviations. In cooperative games such a concept is not convincing enough. [[Strong Nash equilibrium]] allows for deviations by every conceivable coalition.<ref name=\"CoalitionProof\">{{Citation|doi = 10.1016/0022-0531(87)90099-8|title = Coalition-Proof Equilibria I.

In fact, strong Nash equilibrium has to be [[Pareto efficient]]. As a result of these requirements, strong Nash is too rare to be useful in many branches of game theory. However, in games such as elections with many more players than possible outcomes, it can be more common than a stable equilibrium.\n\nA refined Nash equilibrium known as [[coalition-proof Nash equilibrium]] (CPNE)<ref name=\"CoalitionProof\"/> occurs when players cannot do better even if they are allowed to communicate and make \"self-enforcing\" agreement to deviate. Every correlated strategy supported by [[Dominance (game theory)|iterated strict dominance]] and on the [[Pareto frontier]] is a CPNE.<ref name=\"CPNE\">{{Citation|title = Coalition-Proof Equilibrium|author1=D.

CPNE is related to the [[Core (economics)|theory of the core]].\n\nFinally in the eighties, building with great depth on such ideas [[Mertens-stable equilibria]] were introduced as a [[solution concept]]. Mertens stable equilibria satisfy both [[forward induction]] and [[backward induction]]. In a [[game theory]] context [[stable equilibria]] now usually refer to Mertens stable equilibria.\n\n== Occurrence ==\nIf a game has a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] Nash equilibrium and is played among players under certain conditions, then the NE strategy set will be adopted. Sufficient conditions to guarantee that the Nash equilibrium is played are:\n# The players all will do their utmost to maximize their expected payoff as described by the game.\n# The players are flawless in execution.\n# The players have sufficient intelligence to deduce the solution.\n# The players know the planned equilibrium strategy of all of the other players.\n# The players believe that a deviation in their own strategy will not cause deviations by any other players.\n# There is [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that they all know that they meet them, and know that they know that they know that they meet them, and so on.\n\n=== Where the conditions are not met ===\nExamples of [[game theory]] problems in which these conditions are not met:\n# The first condition is not met if the game does not correctly describe the quantities a player wishes to maximize. In this case there is no particular reason for that player to adopt an equilibrium strategy. For instance, the prisoner's dilemma is not a dilemma if either player is happy to be jailed indefinitely.\n# Intentional or accidental imperfection in execution. For example, a computer capable of flawless logical play facing a second flawless computer will result in equilibrium. Introduction of imperfection will lead to its disruption either through loss to the player who makes the mistake, or through negation of the [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]] criterion leading to possible victory for the player. (An example would be a player suddenly putting the car into reverse in the [[game of chicken]], ensuring a no-loss no-win scenario).\n# In many cases, the third condition is not met because, even though the equilibrium must exist, it is unknown due to the complexity of the game, for instance in [[Chinese chess]].<ref>T.

Players wrongly distrusting each other's rationality may adopt counter-strategies to expected irrational play on their opponents\u2019 behalf. This is a major consideration in \"[[Game of chicken|chicken]]\" or an [[arms race]], for example.\n\n=== Where the conditions are met ===\nIn his Ph.D. dissertation, John Nash proposed two interpretations of his equilibrium concept, with the objective of showing how equilibrium points\n\n{{quote|(...) can be connected with observable phenomenon. ''One interpretation is rationalistic: if we assume that players are rational, know the full structure of'' the game, the game is played just once, and there is just one Nash equilibrium, then players will play according to that equilibrium. This idea was formalized by Aumann, R. and A. Brandenburger, 1995, ''Epistemic Conditions for Nash Equilibrium'', Econometrica, 63, 1161-1180 who interpreted each player's mixed strategy as a conjecture about the behaviour of other players and have shown that if the game and the rationality of players is mutually known and these conjectures are commonly know, then the conjectures must be a Nash equilibrium (a common prior assumption is needed for this result in general, but not in the case of two players. In this case, the conjectures need only be mutually known).}}\n\nA second interpretation, that Nash referred to by the mass action interpretation, is less demanding on players:\n\n{{quote|[i]t is unnecessary to assume that the participants have full knowledge of the total structure of the game, or the ability and inclination to go through any complex reasoning processes. ''What is assumed is that there is a population of participants for each position in the game, which will be played throughout time by participants drawn at random from the different populations. If there is a stable average frequency with which each pure strategy is employed by the ''average member'' of the appropriate population, then this stable average frequency constitutes a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.''}}\n\nFor a formal result along these lines, see Kuhn, H. and et al., 1996, \"The Work of John Nash in Game Theory,\" ''Journal of Economic Theory'', 69, 153\u2013185.\n\nDue to the limited conditions in which NE can actually be observed, they are rarely treated as a guide to day-to-day behaviour, or observed in practice in human negotiations. However, as a theoretical concept in [[economics]] and [[evolutionary biology]], the NE has explanatory power. The payoff in economics is utility (or sometimes money), and in evolutionary biology is gene transmission; both are the fundamental bottom line of survival. Researchers who apply games theory in these fields claim that strategies failing to maximize these for whatever reason will be competed out of the market or environment, which are ascribed the ability to test all strategies. This conclusion is drawn from the \"[[Nash equilibrium#Stability|stability]]\" theory above. In these situations the assumption that the strategy observed is actually a NE has often been borne out by research.<ref>J. C. Cox, M. Walker, ''[http://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/learnplay.pdf Learning to Play Cournot Duoploy Strategies] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211182058/http://excen.gsu.edu/jccox/research/learnplay.pdf |date=2013-12-11 }}'', copyright 1997, Texas A&M University,  University of Arizona, pages 141-144</ref>\n\n== NE and non-credible threats ==\n[[File:SGPNEandPlainNE explainingexample.svg|300px|thumb|Extensive and Normal form illustrations that show the difference between SPNE and other NE. The blue equilibrium is not subgame perfect because player two makes a non-credible threat at 2(2) to be unkind (U).]]\nThe Nash equilibrium is a superset of the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium. The subgame perfect equilibrium in addition to the Nash equilibrium requires that the strategy also is a Nash equilibrium in every subgame of that game. This eliminates all [[non-credible threats]], that is, strategies that contain non-rational moves in order to make the counter-player change their strategy.\n\nThe image to the right shows a simple sequential game that illustrates the issue with subgame imperfect Nash equilibria. In this game player one chooses left(L) or right(R), which is followed by player two being called upon to be kind (K) or unkind (U) to player one, However, player two only stands to gain from being unkind if player one goes left. If player one goes right the rational player two would de facto be kind to him in that subgame. However, The non-credible threat of being unkind at 2(2) is still part of the blue (L, (U,U)) Nash equilibrium. Therefore, if rational behavior can be expected by both parties the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium may be a more meaningful solution concept when such [[dynamic inconsistency|dynamic inconsistencies]] arise.\n\n==Proof of existence==\n\n=== Proof using the Kakutani fixed-point theorem ===\nNash's original proof (in his thesis) used Brouwer's fixed-point theorem (e.g., see below for a variant). We give a simpler proof via the Kakutani fixed-point theorem, following Nash's 1950 paper (he credits [[David Gale]] with the observation that such a simplification is possible).\n\nTo prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, let <math>r_i(\\sigma_{-i})</math> be the best response of player i to the strategies of all other players.\n:<math> r_i(\\sigma_{-i}) = \\mathop{\\underset{\\sigma_i}{\\operatorname{arg\\,max}}} u_i (\\sigma_i,\\sigma_{-i}) </math>\n\nHere, <math>\\sigma \\in \\Sigma</math>, where <math>\\Sigma = \\Sigma_i \\times \\Sigma_{-i}</math>, is a mixed-strategy profile in the set of all mixed strategies and <math> u_i </math> is the payoff function for player i. Define a [[Multivalued function|set-valued function]] <math>r\\colon \\Sigma \\rightarrow 2^\\Sigma </math> such that <math>r = r_i(\\sigma_{-i})\\times r_{-i}(\\sigma_{i}) </math>. The existence of a Nash equilibrium is equivalent to <math>r</math> having a fixed point.\n\n[[Kakutani fixed-point theorem|Kakutani's fixed point theorem]] guarantees the existence of a fixed point if the following four conditions are satisfied.\n# <math> \\Sigma</math> is compact, convex, and nonempty.\n# <math>r(\\sigma)</math> is nonempty.\n# <math>r(\\sigma)</math> is [[Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]]\n# <math>r(\\sigma)</math> is convex.\n\nCondition 1. is satisfied from the fact that <math>\\Sigma</math> is a simplex and thus compact. Convexity follows from players' ability to mix strategies.   <math>\\Sigma</math> is nonempty as long as players have strategies.\n\nCondition 2. and 3. are satisfied by way of Berge's [[maximum theorem]]. Because <math> u_i </math> is continuous and compact, <math> r(\\sigma_i) </math> is non-empty and [[Hemicontinuity|upper hemicontinuous]].\n\nCondition 4. is satisfied as a result of mixed strategies. Suppose  <math> \\sigma_i, \\sigma'_i \\in r(\\sigma_{-i}) </math>, then  <math> \\lambda \\sigma_i + (1-\\lambda) \\sigma'_i \\in r(\\sigma_{-i}) </math>. i.e. if two strategies maximize payoffs, then a mix between the two strategies will yield the same payoff.\n\nTherefore, there exists a fixed point in  <math> r </math> and a Nash equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fudenburg |first=Drew |first2=Jean |last2=Tirole |title=Game Theory |location= |publisher=MIT Press |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-262-06141-4 }}</ref>\n\nWhen Nash made this point to [[John von Neumann]] in 1949, von Neumann famously dismissed it with the words, \"That's trivial, you know. That's just a [[fixed-point theorem]].\" (See Nasar, 1998, p.&nbsp;94.)\n\n=== Alternate proof using the [[Brouwer fixed-point theorem]] ===\n\nWe have a game <math>G=(N,A,u)</math> where <math>N</math> is the number of players and <math>A = A_1 \\times \\cdots \\times A_N</math> is the action set for the players. All of the action sets <math>A_i</math> are finite. Let <math>\\Delta = \\Delta_1 \\times \\cdots \\times \\Delta_N</math> denote the set of mixed strategies for the players. The finiteness of the <math>A_i</math>s ensures the compactness of <math>\\Delta</math>.\n\nWe can now define the gain functions. For a mixed strategy <math>\\sigma \\in \\Delta</math>, we let the gain for player <math>i</math> on action <math>a \\in A_i</math> be\n\n:<math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a) = \\max \\{0, u_i(a, \\sigma_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma_{i}, \\sigma_{-i})\\}.</math>\n\nThe gain function represents the benefit a player gets by unilaterally changing their strategy. We now define <math>g = (g_1,\\dotsc,g_N)</math> where\n\n:<math>g_i(\\sigma)(a) = \\sigma_i(a) + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a)</math>\n\nfor <math>\\sigma \\in \\Delta, a \\in A_i</math>. We see that\n\n:<math>\\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma)(a) = \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma_i(a) + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a) = 1 + \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma,a) > 0.</math>\n\nNext we define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f = (f_1, \\cdots, f_N)  : \\Delta \\to \\Delta \\\\ f_i(\\sigma)(a) = \\frac{g_i(\\sigma)(a)}{\\sum_{b \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma)(b)} & a \\in A_i \\end{cases}</math>\n\nIt is easy to see that each <math>f_i</math> is a valid mixed strategy in <math>\\Delta_i</math>. It is also easy to check that each <math>f_i</math> is a continuous function of <math>\\sigma</math>, and hence <math>f</math> is a continuous function. As the cross product of a finite number of compact convex sets, <math>\\Delta</math> is also compact and convex. Applying the Brouwer fixed point theorem to <math>f</math> and <math>\\Delta</math> we conclude that <math>f</math> has a fixed point in <math>\\Delta</math>, call it <math>\\sigma^*</math>. We claim that <math>\\sigma^*</math> is a Nash equilibrium in <math>G</math>. For this purpose, it suffices to show that\n\n:<math> \\forall i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, N\\}, \\forall a \\in A_i: \\quad \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,a) = 0.</math>\n\nThis simply states that each player gains no benefit by unilaterally changing their strategy, which is exactly the necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium.\n\nNow assume that the gains are not all zero. Therefore, <math>\\exists i \\in \\{1, \\cdots, N\\},</math> and <math>a \\in A_i</math> such that <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) > 0</math>. Note then that\n\n:<math> \\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma^*, a) = 1 + \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,a) > 1.</math>\n\nSo let\n\n:<math>C = \\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma^*, a).</math>\n\nAlso we shall denote <math>\\text{Gain}(i,\\cdot)</math> as the gain vector indexed by actions in <math>A_i</math>. Since <math>\\sigma^*</math> is the fixed point we have:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\sigma^* = f(\\sigma^*)  &\\Rightarrow  \\sigma^*_i =  f_i(\\sigma^*) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\sigma^*_i = \\frac{g_i(\\sigma^*)}{\\sum_{a \\in A_i} g_i(\\sigma^*)(a)} \\\\ [6pt]\n&\\Rightarrow \\sigma^*_i = \\frac{1}{C} \\left (\\sigma^*_i + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot) \\right ) \\\\ [6pt]\n&\\Rightarrow C\\sigma^*_i = \\sigma^*_i + \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\left(C-1\\right)\\sigma^*_i = \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot) \\\\\n&\\Rightarrow \\sigma^*_i = \\left(\\frac{1}{C-1}\\right)\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSince <math>C > 1</math> we have that <math>\\sigma^*_i</math> is some positive scaling of the vector <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*,\\cdot)</math>. Now we claim that\n\n:<math>\\forall a \\in A_i: \\quad  \\sigma^*_i(a)(u_i(a_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i})) = \\sigma^*_i(a)\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) </math>\n\nTo see this, we first note that if <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) > 0</math> then this is true by definition of the gain function.  Now assume that <math>\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) = 0</math>. By our previous statements we have that\n\n:<math>\\sigma^*_i(a) = \\left(\\frac{1}{C-1}\\right)\\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) = 0 </math>\n\nand so the left term is zero, giving us that the entire expression is <math>0</math> as needed.\n\nSo we finally have that\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n0 &= u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) \\\\\n  &=  \\left(\\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma^*_i(a)u_i(a_i, \\sigma^*_{-i})\\right) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) \\\\\n & =  \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma^*_i(a) (u_i(a_i, \\sigma^*_{-i}) - u_i(\\sigma^*_i, \\sigma^*_{-i})) \\\\ \n & = \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\sigma^*_i(a) \\text{Gain}_i(\\sigma^*, a) && \\text{ by the previous statements } \\\\\n  &= \\sum_{a \\in A_i} \\left( C -1 \\right) \\sigma^*_i(a)^2 > 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the last inequality follows since <math>\\sigma^*_i</math> is a non-zero vector. But this is a clear contradiction, so all the gains must indeed be zero. Therefore, <math>\\sigma^*</math> is a Nash equilibrium for <math>G</math> as needed.\n\n== Computing Nash equilibria ==\nIf a player A has a [[dominant strategy]] <math>s_A</math> then there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays <math>s_A</math>. In the case of two players A and B, there exists a Nash equilibrium in which A plays <math>s_A</math> and B plays a best response to <math>s_A</math>. If <math>s_A</math> is a strictly dominant strategy, A plays <math>s_A</math> in all Nash equilibria. If both A and B have strictly dominant strategies, there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in which each plays their strictly dominant strategy.\n\nIn games with mixed-strategy Nash equilibria, the probability of a player choosing any particular strategy can be computed by assigning a variable to each strategy that represents a fixed probability for choosing that strategy. In order for a player to be willing to randomize, their expected payoff for each strategy should be the same. In addition, the sum of the probabilities for each strategy of a particular player should be 1. This creates a system of equations from which the probabilities of choosing each strategy can be derived.<ref name=\"preliminaries\" />\n\n=== Examples ===\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|+ align=bottom |''Matching pennies''\n! {{diagonal split header|Player A|Player B}}\n!Player B plays H\n!Player B plays T\n|-\n!Player A plays H\n|align=center|\u22121, +1\n|align=center|+1, \u22121\n|-\n!Player A plays T\n|align=center|+1, \u22121\n|align=center|\u22121, +1\n|-\n|}\n\nIn the matching pennies game, player A loses a point to B if A and B play the same strategy and wins a point from B if they play different strategies.

{"title_page": "United States Army uniforms in World War II", "text_new": "The [[United States Army]] in World War II used a variety of standard and non-standard dress and battle uniforms, which often changed depending upon the theater of war, climatic environment, and supply exigencies.\n\n==Men's service uniforms ==\nU.S. Army basic service uniforms consisted of a winter service uniform of [[olive drab]] wool worn in temperate weather and a summer service uniform of [[khaki (color)|khaki]] (tan) fabric. In addition to the service uniforms worn for ordinary duty and dress purposes there were a variety of fatigue and combat uniforms. Summer and winter service uniforms were during their respective seasons in the continental U.S. During World War II the European theater of operations (Northwestern Europe) was considered a year-round temperate uniform zone and the Pacific theater of operations a year-round tropical uniform zone. In the Mediterranean theater U.S. soldiers wore both seasonal uniforms.<ref>Table of Equipment No. 21 1 September 1945 Part II (theater clothing zones).</ref>\n\n===Enlisted men's service uniforms===\n====Winter uniforms====\n[[File:Andersoncoat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Army Enlisted Men's Winter Service Uniform]]\nThe issue enlisted men's winter service uniform in 1941 consisted of a four pocket coat in olive drab shade 33 (light shade) 16&nbsp;oz wool [[Serge (fabric)|serge]] and matching trousers. Shirts, which featured two patch pockets and no shoulder straps, were either olive drab shade No. 33. 10.5&nbsp;oz wool flannel or 8.2&nbsp;oz [[khaki]] shade No. 1 cotton [[chino cloth]]. Either shirt could be worn under the coat; however, the cotton shirt could not be worn as an outer garment with the wool trousers. Whenever a shirt was worn as an outer garment the necktie was tucked between the second and third button of the shirt.<ref>AR 600-40 (Section 3, para. 39).</ref> The initial shirt had a standup collar like a typical dress shirt. In 1941 the shirt was redesigned with the collar band removed so the collar would lay flat when worn in the field.<ref>Stanton p.52</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 18).</ref> In 1941 the wool necktie for the winter uniform was black and the summer necktie was khaki cotton.<ref>AR 600-35 10 November 1941</ref> In February 1942 a universal mohair wool necktie in olive drab shade 3 replaced both previous neckties. The OD shade 3 necktie was shortly superseded by a khaki shade 5 cotton\u2013wool blend necktie. The single color khaki shade 5 necktie was mandated for both summer and winter service uniforms.<ref>Risch and Pitkin, p. 47.</ref><ref name=\"AR 600-35 Section I, para. 2a3\">AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a3).</ref> An overcoat of OD shade 33 [[Melton Mowbray#Melton cloth|Melton wool]] was worn in cold weather.\n\n====Summer uniforms====\nThe enlisted man's summer service uniform consisted of the cotton khaki shade No. 1 uniform shirt with matching trousers; the coat for this uniform was discontinued for enlisted men in the 1930s. The necktie was tucked between the second and third button of the shirt.<ref>AR 600-40 (Section 3, para. 39).</ref> Although originally used as a summer combat uniform as well as a summer dress uniform, after the invasion of the Philippines in 1942 the khaki uniform was largely replaced as a summer combat uniform by the herringbone twill uniforms.\n\n====Headgear====\nThe enlisted soldier's round crown visor caps were no longer issued to enlisted troops after 1942. Thereafter, only the garrison cap in either olive drab for winter or khaki tan for summer with piping in the color of the soldiers basic specialty branch remained as the universal enlisted service headgear. The soldiers distinctive unit insignia was worn on the left front if the unit issued the DUI. However, after 1943 the manufacture of DUIs were suspended for the duration of the war.<ref>War Department Circular Number No. 6, January 2, 1943</ref>\n\n====Footwear====\nIssue footwear consisted of low quarter russet brown leather cap toe boots. For more on Army footwear see Combat Uniforms chapter below. \n\n===Officer's service uniforms===\n====Winter uniforms====\nThe male officer's winter service uniform in 1941 consisted of a 4 button 4 pocket coat of finer wool fabric in olive drab shade No. 51 (\"dark-shade\" i.e. a very dark forest green with brownish hue), nicknamed \"greens\". The coat was worn with a russet brown leather Sam Brown belt until 1942 when the leather belt was replaced by a cloth belt of matching fabric to the coat. Officers could wear trousers matching the color and fabric of the coat, or optionally they were allowed taupe colored, trousers, officially called \"drab shade 54\", of the same material as the coat, nicknamed \"pinks\", leading to the nickname \"pinks and greens\" for the iconic combination.<ref>AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 9, 19).</ref> Officers were also authorized to use the more durable olive drab shade 33 enlisted serge uniforms, except for the enlisted men's four pocket service coat, as long as they were not mixed with olive drab shade 51 or drab shade 54 clothing.<ref>Army Officers Guide 1942, pp. 132.</ref> Officer's OD light shade heavy melton wool long and short overcoats were authorized as well as a taupe rain coat. \n\nBy 1941 officers shirts consisted of khaki shade 1 cotton or tropical wool shirts to be worn with either the summer or winter uniforms and olive drab wool shirts in light or dark shade with the addition of shoulder straps depending on the uniform worn. Officers also had additional shirt color and fabric options, OD dark shade No. 50 or No. 51 and in 1944 drab shade No. 54 taupe shirts were authorized.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>Officers wore black and khaki neckties with winter and summer uniforms respectively, like enlisted soldiers, until after February 1942 when the universal neckties were changed to khaki shade 5 for all ranks.<ref name=\"AR 600-35 Section I, para. 2a3\"/> As with enlisted men, officers could only wear the olive drab shirt as an outer garment with the wool uniform. The shirt had to be either the same shade OD as the trousers or dark shade with the taupe trousers. \n\n====Summer uniforms====\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}} \n[[File:Audie Murphy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Audie Murphy]] photographed in 1948 wearing the U.S. Army khaki summer service uniform with full-size medals.]]\nMale officer's summer service uniforms usually consisted of the wash-and-wear cotton khaki shade 1 uniforms like those of the enlisted men, the main difference being that the shirts had shoulder straps added. An OD dark shade wool shirt and cotton khaki trouser combination was also authorized for officers in tropical zones. However, for dress purposes officer's also had the option of purchasing a khaki shade 1 summer service uniform of tropical weight suiting fabric. This uniform was identical in cut to the winter officers' uniform. However, the cloth belt of the winter service coat was omitted.<ref>AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a2).</ref>\n\n====Headgear====\nOfficer's headgear for the winter uniform consisted of either an Olive Drab (OD-51) [[Peaked cap#United States Army|peaked cap]] with a russet leather visor or a garrison cap matching the OD fabric shade worn. The garrison cap for officers was piped around the curtain with black and gold cord except for general officers whose piping was all gold. the officer's rank insignia was worn on the left front side of the garrison cap. The peak cap was also available in khaki tan with a removable top to be worn with the khaki summer uniform. Optionally khaki garrison caps were worn with the summer khaki uniform with the same piping as the winter OD version.\n\n====Footwear==== \nFootwear normally consisted of russet-brown leather Type I (leather-soled) service shoes. For more on Army footwear see Combat Uniforms chapter below.\n\n===Eisenhower jacket===\n[[File:Eisenhower jacket 88122.jpg|left|thumb|One of General Eisenhower's personal jackets]]\nDuring the war in Europe a short jacket was adopted by General Eisenhower as an option to the 4 pocket service coat. The \"[[Eisenhower jacket]]\", or \"Ike jacket\", was popular. It closely resembled the short [[Battle Dress|British Battle Dress jacket]] that inspired it. However, development and approval by the Army was slow. Except for small runs of jackets made for soldiers in England, the U.S Army did not provide the jacket as an issue item to enlisted soldiers until the war in Europe was almost over. \n\nThere were several versions. Two Ike jackets were manufactured in England and issued to troops in Europe before the jackets were approved Army wide. Both of these were essentially wool versions of the 1941 pattern poplin field jacket.<ref>Enjames, Henri-Paul, \"Government Issue:U.S. Army European Theater of Operations collectors Guide\",Histoire & Collections p.37</ref> These jackets were authorized only in the ETO. There were also non-standard conversions made for GIs particularly officers by tailors in the United Kingdom with degrees of variation. \n\nThe standard-issue '''M44 (Model 1944)''' Wool Field Jacket, made of fine-quality Olive Drab (OD 33) wool, was originally designed as a liner to be worn under the M1943 combat jacket. While originally intended as a field or combat jacket, it was nearly always reserved for service or dress wear. The M44 ultimately replaced the four button service dress jacket for enlisted troops. However, the phase out of the enlisted service coat was only completed after the war was over.<ref>Stanton, Shelby L., \"U.S. Army uniforms of the Korean War\", Stackpole Books (1992) p.104.</ref>\n\n===Wear of insignia and badges with the service uniform===\nWith the service uniform the enlisted arm- and branch-of-service insignia was embossed on circular pins, while the officer's insignia was \"free work\" (i.e., open design with no backing). Officer's arm-of-service pins (\"U.S.\" for the Regular Army) were worn on the upper lapels and their branch of service pins were worn on their lower lapels. EM wore the US disk on the right and the branch disk on the left upper lapel. The rank of officers was worn on the outer edge of the shoulder loops whereas enlisted soldiers wore rank chevrons three inches wide points up on both upper arms. Organizational patches were worn on the left upper shoulder only.\n\nWhen the coat was worn no insignia was worn on the shirts except sew on patches. When the shirt was worn as an outer garment officer's wore pin on insignia on the shirt. Until 1942 the officer's US pin was worn on the right collar point and the officer's branch insignia was worn on the left. The officer's rank was worn on the outer ends of the officer's shoulder loops as on the coat. After, September 1942 the US pin was deleted and the rank of the wearer was displayed on the right collar point. \n\nDistinctive Unit Insignia pins (featuring the unit's coat-of-arms) were worn in the center of the epaulet for officers and on lower lapels for enlisted men. These devices were rarely seen during the war as a metal conservation measure. \n\n[[Wound Chevron]]s (awarded from 1918 to 1932 for wounds in combat) were worn on the lower right sleeve between the cuff and the elbow. [[Service stripe|Service Stripes]], or \"Hash Marks\", (awarded for every 3 years of service) were worn on the lower left sleeve. World War I [[Overseas Chevron]]s [created 1918] and/or World War II [[Overseas Service Bar|Overseas Bar]]s [created 1944] (awarded for each six months combat service overseas) were worn on the lower left sleeve between the elbow and lower sleeve, but above the Service Stripes. The World War II Bars were worn over the World War I Chevrons. After 1953 the Service Stripes were kept on the lower left sleeve and the Overseas Service Stripes were moved to the lower right sleeve.\n\n[[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist's Wings]], [[Aviator Badge#United States Army|Pilot's Wings]], the [[Expert Infantryman Badge]], the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]], or the [[Combat Medical Badge]] are worn above the left top tunic pocket. Discharged soldiers returning home wore the embroidered [[Honorable Service Lapel Button|Honorable Discharge Emblem]] (or \"[[Honorable Service Lapel Button|Ruptured duck]]\") on the uniform over the right top tunic pocket on a diamond-shaped Olive Drab cloth backing. American and foreign medals or medal ribbons are worn above the left top tunic pocket. American and foreign Unit citation ribbons are worn over the right top tunic pocket. The [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] patch [created 1944] (awarded to a unit for at least 6 months of exemplary combat service or combat support) is worn on the lower right sleeve above the cuff and below the Wound Chevrons.\n\n==Women's service uniforms==\nFemale members of the U.S. Army during WWII were assigned to either the [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army Nurse Corps]] (ANC) or the [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Auxiliary Army Corps]] (WAAC/WAC). The ANC preceded the WAAC/WAC so the two branches had separate uniform distinctions.  \n\n===Army Nurse Corps uniforms===\nPrior to 1943, the ANC winter service uniform consisted of the ANC pattern dark blue cap or garrison cap with maroon piping, suit jacket with maroon cuff braid and gold army buttons, light blue or white shirt, black tie and light blue skirt, shoes were black or white. The ANC summer service uniform consisted of a similar suit in beige with maroon shoulder strap piping and cuff braid, beige ANC cap or beige garrison cap with maroon piping, white shirt, and black four-in-hand tie. During World War II the first flight nurses uniform consisted of a blue wool battle dress jacket, blue wool trousers and a blue wool men's style maroon piped garrison cap. The uniform was worn with either the ANC light blue or white shirt and black tie. After 1943 the ANC adopted olive drab service uniforms similar to the newly formed WAC. Nurses wore Army hospital whites on ward duty.<ref>Smith, Jill H. (2001). Dressed for Duty: America's Women in Uniform 1898\u20131973. San Jose, California: R. James Bender Publishing, {{ISBN|0-912138-81-5}} p. 241-244.</ref>\n\n[[File:Women's Army Corps, Randolph Field, Texas, 1944.jpg|upright|thumb|Female service dress in OD shade 33 at [[Randolph Air Force Base|Randolph Field]], 1944]]\n\n===WAAC and WAC Uniforms===\nIn May 1942 Congress approved the creation of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps.<ref>Creation of the Women's Army Corps. U.S. Army. Retrieved from https://www.army.mil/women/history/wac.html</ref> Although the ANC were actual service members of the U.S. Army, the members of the WAAC were not, so they wore Army style uniforms with distinctly different insignia than U.S. Army service members. In the summer of 1943 the WAAC was converted to the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC). From that point the WAC were U.S. Army service members and their insignia was changed to that of the regular army.<ref>Bellafaire, Judith A. \u201c The Women's Army Corps: A Commemoration of WWII Service.\u201d The Women's Army Corps, Center of Military History, 17 Feb. 2005, history.army.mil/brochures/WAC/WAC.HTM.</ref>\n\nFemale service dress went through an evolution of patterns over the course of the war years, however throughout the period the service uniforms both summer and winter generally consisted of the WAC pattern \"Hobby\" hat or women's garrison cap, a women's suit coat, shirtwaist, four-in-hand tie, skirt, russet leather women's service shoes and hand bag. The women's olive drab wool \"Ike jacket\" was also worn as were women's service trousers. The colors essentially mirrored those of their male counterparts of corresponding rank in the equivalent service uniform although fabrics differed. There were also special off-duty dresses of summer beige and winter tan. \n\nAfter the WAC were established the ANC adopted the WAC officer's uniforms, except for the ANC pattern hat and the ANC pattern handbag. However, those items were changed to olive drab and russet leather respectively. The ANC off duty dress was a separate ANC pattern in olive drab shade 51 or beige. The previous ANC beige summer service uniform with maroon trim was retained except that the tie was changed to maroon.<ref>AR 600-37 16 April 1945</ref> \n\n==Combat and utility uniform==\nThe [[United States Army]] during the inter-war period followed the previous model of having a standard uniform that combined elements of both the ''Class A'' (basic service uniform) and ''Class B'' (basic field uniform). By combining the uniforms, it was thought that time and money could be saved. Included in the clothing system was an [[olive drab]] (OD) wool [[garrison cap]], olive drab wool trousers, an olive drab wool [[Shirt|collared shirt]] worn with a black tie, an olive drab wool four button coat, and russet brown Type I (leather-soled) or Type II (rubber-soled) service shoes. An outer jacket or coat, either the Model 1938 \"Overcoat, [[Mackinaw cloth|Mackinaw]], Roll Collar\" or the [[M1941 Field Jacket]], nicknamed the \"Parson jacket\" after its designer, in olive drab shade No. 3 (OD3) was issued. The basic field or combat uniform for temperate or cool climates consisted of the basic wool uniform, without tie, along with a field jacket or wool overcoat, leggings, helmet and web gear.\n\nIn the European theater of operations (ETO), the basic wool uniform saw the most use and had the greatest functionality, being able to keep the soldier warm in the winter with its insulation and relatively cool and breathable in Northern European summer weather. However, the M-1941 field jacket came in for considerable criticism; it was poorly insulated and the light cotton shell provided little protection from wind or rain. In addition, the OD3 coloring was deemed inappropriate for use in northern Europe, as it stood out against most backdrops, making soldiers more visible targets.\n\n[[File:Infantryman in 1942 with M1 Garand, Fort Knox, KY.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Infantryman wearing HBT first pattern uniform]]\n\n===Herringbone twill uniform===\nAdditionally, a fatigue uniform was issued, made of 8.2-ounce heavy cotton [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone twill]] (HBT) cloth. The uniform consisted of a shirt, trousers, and a hat. Initially, this was a circular-brimmed \"clamdigger\"-style hat which was later replaced by a billed cap that was based on a design used by railroad workers. Initially it was meant to be worn over the basic wool or cotton uniforms to provide protection during fatigue duties, but it proved to be much better material than the primary will uniform for hot weather, as so it saw use as a combat uniform in nearly all of the major theaters of combat in which the US was involved.<ref>Stanton, Shelby L., ''U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II'', Stackpole Books (1995), {{ISBN|0-8117-2595-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8117-2595-8}}, p. 101</ref>\n\nThe original 1941 version came in a light sage green color that faded with repeated washing. The later 1943 version had small changes in tailoring and came in a darker olive drab shade No. 7, matching the new M1943 version of the field jacket.\n\n===The M-1943 field uniform===\nThe [[M-1943 uniform]] came into service in the later half of World War II. The uniform was designed as a layered system, meant to be worn over the wool shirt and trousers and in conjunction with a wool sweater and liners in colder weather.\n \nThe most recognizable part of the uniform is the standardized M-1943 field jacket. It was longer than the earlier 1941 field jacket, coming down to the upper thighs. It was made of windproof cotton sateen and was issued in a new darker olive drab color, OD7. The jacket also had a detachable hood, drawstring waist, two large angled breast pockets, and two lower skirt pockets.\n\nThe trousers were made out of the same OD7 cotton sateen material and white cotton twill inner lining, and were equipped with both front and rear pockets. They also had buttoned tabs at the waist in order to cinch the waist. For airborne troops, treated canvas cargo pockets were added to the trousers.\n\nIn the ETO, initial issuance of the M-1943 was slowed as a consequence of opposition by some U.S. commanders. However, as U.S. and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops pushed into Germany, more M-1943 uniforms or components of the uniform were issued as the supply situation (including replacements directly from stateside arrived) and the weather became harsher as winter arrived.\n\nIn use, the M-1943 was very popular with the men in the field, being relatively comfortable and having large amounts of pocket space\n\n===Experimental tropical uniform===\nIn 1943, after extensive testing in the swamplands and jungles of Florida and Panama, the U.S. Army determined that an experimental tropical uniform made of ''Byrd Cloth'' (known in Britain as ''[[Grenfell Cloth]]''), would best protect soldiers from insects and disease while cooling the body and minimizing losses from perspiration.<ref name=\"Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 191-195\">Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 191-195</ref> Byrd Cloth, as used in the Experimental Tropical Uniform, was a single-layer uniform of untreated OD long-staple [[Egyptian cotton]], made in a tightly woven herringbone twill to prevent mosquito bites. In use, the uniform was intended to cool the wearer even when continuously wetted, as might be expected in a humid, rainy jungle environment.<ref name=\"Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 191-195\"/> The uniform featured a short-tailed shirt, trousers with cuffs fitted with half-inch boottop fastening tapes, and a flap-protected fly to keep out crawling insects such as leeches, ticks, and chiggers.<ref name=\"Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 191-195\"/><ref name=\"Stanton, Shelby L. 1995 pp. 88-89\">Stanton, Shelby L., ''U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II'', Stackpole Books (1995), {{ISBN|0-8117-2595-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8117-2595-8}}, pp. 88-89</ref> Pockets were shallow and kept to a minimum to increase cooling; users carried all their gear in load-bearing belts, suspenders, or in low-mounted field packs designed to minimize body contact (jungle packs). The uniform, always in short supply because of a shortage of Byrd Cloth, was used in combat by members of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS)<ref>Jowett, Philip S. and Walsh, Stephen, ''The Chinese Army 1937-49: World War II and Civil War'', Osprey Publishing (2005), {{ISBN|1-84176-904-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-84176-904-2}}, p. 45</ref> and the Mars Task Force (Army 5332nd Brigade-Provisional) in Burma.<ref>Mars Task Force: A Short History'' http://cbi-theater-8.home.comcast.net/~cbi-theater-8/mars/marstaskforce.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415161500/http://cbi-theater-8.home.comcast.net/~cbi-theater-8/mars/marstaskforce.html |date=2009-04-15 }}</ref><ref>Kearny, Cresson H.

This dress was inspired by a WAC seersucker version the same color. Sage green fatigue uniforms of [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] cotton [[twill]] for women, along with women's combat boots, field jackets and flight clothing, were manufactured by the U.S. Army during World War II. However, when women's versions of these items were not available, as was often the case in overseas areas, men's issue work/fatigue clothing was used instead.<ref>Smith, Jill H. (2001).

They wore it with the back of the brim flipped up and the front of the brim pulled down and nicknamed it the \"[[Li'l Abner#Main characters|Daisy Mae]] Cap\". It replaced the WAACs' distinctive \"Hobby Hat\" kepi for field use and fatigue duties.\n\n==Footwear==\nArmy combat footwear in World War II originally consisted of a basic tanned leather shoe, used with heavy canvas leggings, the Model 1939 \"Shoes, Service, Composition Sole\", or '''Type I Service Shoe'''. This was an ankle-high field shoe made of tanned leather in a dark red or russet color, originally with leather soles. The sole was changed to a rubber composition after 1940 and designated as the '''Type II Service Shoe'''. Soon after the US entry into the war these shoes, which were also used as part of the Class A dress uniform, were replaced with a \"roughout\" field shoe made from leather uppers with a sueded outer finish, and designated the '''Type III Service Shoe'''. The Marine Corps version of these shoes were commonly referred to as \"boondockers\". In November 1943, the Type II and III service shoes were in turn replaced by a boot, the '''M43 Combat Boot''' or \"Two-Buckle Boot\". This boot had a permanently attached a two-buckled leather ankle flap, which was designed to replace the unpopular canvas [[leggings]]. The sole was made of synthetic or reclaimed rubber. Due to supply issues, soldiers can be seen wearing both the service shoes with the leggings and the newer combat boot.\n\n===Specialized combat footwear===\nA rubber-soled, canvas-top [[Jungle boot]] was issued during the war for use by soldiers in the tropical and jungle environments typically encountered in the China-Burma-India (CBI) and the Pacific theaters. The 10th Mountain Division's troopers occasionally wore the Mountain Boot, a low-quarter brown leather boot with a square toe and rocker-type sole, though this boot was phased out in favor of the Type III Combat Boot in the last year of the war. In 1944, the M-44 Combat Boot, a high-top leather boot with full laces was adopted for service, but for the duration it was primarily worn by soldiers on stateside duty.\n\nParachute troops beginning in 1942 were issued [[Jump boots]] \u2013 high-lacing rubber-soled leather boots which were intended to provide additional ankle support when landing by parachute. Although these boots were to be replaced by the new M43 combat boots, jump boots continued to be worn throughout the war. Nicknamed \"Corcorans\", from the name of the first contractor to manufacture them, they have become a status symbol as the footwear of paratroopers and Rangers.\n\nOvershoes were normally issued to Army units during winter operations. In January 1945, some Army units operating in the ETO received [[shoepac]]s for wet winter wear. The shoepac was a leather boot with rubberized lower top and sole, worn in conjunction with the wool ski sock. While it was effective in keeping feet protected from soaking and freezing ground, the shoepac lacked foot support and tended to wear quickly; it also resulted in incidents of foot injuries when a soldier wearing shoepacs on a march in freezing weather stopped to rest, allowing perspiration-soaked socks inside the boot to freeze.<ref>Stanton, Shelby L., ''U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II'', Stackpole Books (1995), {{ISBN|0-8117-2595-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8117-2595-8}}, p. 242</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Leggings#Military leggings|Leggings]]\n*[[Uniforms of the United States Army]]\n*[[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps]]\n*[[History of the United States Army]]\n*[[United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=6U4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 Military Uniforms Color Catalog] Life Magazine, May 19, 1941\n*[http://www.hardscrabblefarm.com/ww2/ World War II Living History and Reenacting Information]\n*[http://90thidpg.us/Equipment/Articles/index.html 90th Infantry Division Preservation Group Uniform and Equipment Section]\n<br>\n{{US Army uniforms}}\n\n{{USWWII}}\n\n[[Category:World War II military equipment of the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Army uniforms]]\n[[Category:History of the United States Army]]\n", "text_old": "The [[United States Army]] in World War II used a variety of standard and non-standard dress and battle uniforms, which often changed depending upon the theater of war, climatic environment, and supply exigencies.\n\n==Men's service uniforms ==\nU.S. Army basic service uniforms consisted of a winter service uniform of [[olive drab]] wool worn in temperate weather and a summer service uniform of [[khaki (color)|khaki]] (tan) fabric. In addition to the service uniforms worn for ordinary duty and dress purposes there were a variety of fatigue and combat uniforms. Summer and winter service uniforms were during their respective seasons in the continental U.S. During World War II the European theater of operations (Northwestern Europe) was considered a year-round temperate uniform zone and the Pacific theater of operations a year-round tropical uniform zone. In the Mediterranean theater U.S. soldiers wore both seasonal uniforms. <ref>Table of Equipment No. 21 1 September 1945 Part II (theater clothing zones).</ref>\n\n===Enlisted men's service uniforms===\n====Winter uniforms====\n[[File:Andersoncoat.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Army Enlisted Men's Winter Service Uniform]]\nThe issue enlisted men's winter service uniform in 1941 consisted of a four pocket coat in olive drab shade 33 (light shade) 16&nbsp;oz wool [[Serge (fabric)|serge]] and matching trousers. Shirts, which featured two patch pockets and no shoulder straps, were either olive drab shade No. 33. 10.5&nbsp;oz wool flannel or 8.2&nbsp;oz [[khaki]] shade No. 1 cotton [[chino cloth]]. Either shirt could be worn under the coat; however, the cotton shirt could not be worn as an outer garment with the wool trousers. Whenever a shirt was worn as an outer garment the necktie was tucked between the second and third button of the shirt.<ref>AR 600-40 (Section 3, para. 39).</ref> The initial shirt had a standup collar like a typical dress shirt. In 1941 the shirt was redesigned with the collar band removed so the collar would lay flat when worn in the field.<ref>Stanton p.52</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 18).</ref> In 1941 the wool necktie for the winter uniform was black and the summer necktie was khaki cotton.<ref>AR 600-35 10 November 1941</ref> In February 1942 a universal mohair wool necktie in olive drab shade 3 replaced both previous neckties. The OD shade 3 necktie was shortly superseded by a khaki shade 5 cotton\u2013wool blend necktie. The single color khaki shade 5 necktie was mandated for both summer and winter service uniforms.<ref>Risch and Pitkin, p. 47.</ref><ref name=\"AR 600-35 Section I, para. 2a3\">AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a3).</ref> An overcoat of OD shade 33 [[Melton Mowbray#Melton cloth|Melton wool]] was worn in cold weather.\n\n====Summer uniforms====\nThe enlisted man's summer service uniform consisted of the cotton khaki shade No. 1 uniform shirt with matching trousers; the coat for this uniform was discontinued for enlisted men in the 1930s. The necktie was tucked between the second and third button of the shirt.<ref>AR 600-40 (Section 3, para. 39).</ref> Although originally used as a summer combat uniform as well as a summer dress uniform, after the invasion of the Philippines in 1942 the khaki uniform was largely replaced as a summer combat uniform by the herringbone twill uniforms.\n\n====Headgear====\nThe enlisted soldier's round crown visor caps were no longer issued to enlisted troops after 1942. Thereafter, only the garrison cap in either olive drab for winter or khaki tan for summer with piping in the color of the soldiers basic specialty branch remained as the universal enlisted service headgear. The soldiers distinctive unit insignia was worn on the left front if the unit issued the DUI. However, after 1943 the manufacture of DUIs were suspended for the duration of the war.<ref>War Department Circular Number No. 6, January 2, 1943</ref>\n\n====Footwear====\nIssue footwear consisted of low quarter russet brown leather cap toe boots. For more on Army footwear see Combat Uniforms chapter below. \n\n===Officer's service uniforms===\n====Winter uniforms====\nThe male officer's winter service uniform in 1941 consisted of a 4 button 4 pocket coat of finer wool fabric in olive drab shade No. 51 (\"dark-shade\" i.e. a very dark forest green with brownish hue), nicknamed \"greens\". The coat was worn with a russet brown leather Sam Brown belt until 1942 when the leather belt was replaced by a cloth belt of matching fabric to the coat. Officers could wear trousers matching the color and fabric of the coat, or optionally they were allowed taupe colored, trousers, officially called \"drab shade 54\", of the same material as the coat, nicknamed \"pinks\", leading to the nickname \"pinks and greens\" for the iconic combination.<ref>AR 600-35 31 March 1944 (Section I, para. 2; Section II, para. 9, 19).</ref> Officers were also authorized to use the more durable olive drab shade 33 enlisted serge uniforms, except for the enlisted men's four pocket service coat, as long as they were not mixed with olive drab shade 51 or drab shade 54 clothing.<ref>Army Officers Guide 1942, pp. 132.</ref> Officer's OD light shade heavy melton wool long and short overcoats were authorized as well as a taupe rain coat. \n\nBy 1941 officers shirts consisted of khaki shade 1 cotton or tropical wool shirts to be worn with either the summer or winter uniforms and olive drab wool shirts in light or dark shade with the addition of shoulder straps depending on the uniform worn. Officers also had additional shirt color and fabric options, OD dark shade No. 50 or No. 51 and in 1944 drab shade No. 54 taupe shirts were authorized.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>Officers wore black and khaki neckties with winter and summer uniforms respectively, like enlisted soldiers, until after February 1942 when the universal neckties were changed to khaki shade 5 for all ranks.<ref name=\"AR 600-35 Section I, para. 2a3\"/> As with enlisted men, officers could only wear the olive drab shirt as an outer garment with the wool uniform. The shirt had to be either the same shade OD as the trousers or dark shade with the taupe trousers. \n\n====Summer uniforms====\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}} \n[[File:Audie Murphy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Audie Murphy]] photographed in 1948 wearing the U.S. Army khaki summer service uniform with full-size medals.]]\nMale officer's summer service uniforms usually consisted of the wash-and-wear cotton khaki shade 1 uniforms like those of the enlisted men, the main difference being that the shirts had shoulder straps added. An OD dark shade wool shirt and cotton khaki trouser combination was also authorized for officers in tropical zones. However, for dress purposes officer's also had the option of purchasing a khaki shade 1 summer service uniform of tropical weight suiting fabric. This uniform was identical in cut to the winter officers' uniform. However, the cloth belt of the winter service coat was omitted.<ref>AR 600-35 (Section I, para. 2a2).</ref>\n\n====Headgear====\nOfficer's headgear for the winter uniform consisted of either an Olive Drab (OD-51) [[Peaked cap#United States Army|peaked cap]] with a russet leather visor or a garrison cap matching the OD fabric shade worn. The garrison cap for officers was piped around the curtain with black and gold cord except for general officers whose piping was all gold. the officer's rank insignia was worn on the left front side of the garrison cap. The peak cap was also available in khaki tan with a removable top to be worn with the khaki summer uniform. Optionally khaki garrison caps were worn with the summer khaki uniform with the same piping as the winter OD version.\n\n====Footwear==== \nFootwear normally consisted of russet-brown leather Type I (leather-soled) service shoes. For more on Army footwear see Combat Uniforms chapter below.\n\n===Eisenhower jacket===\n[[File:Eisenhower jacket 88122.jpg|left|thumb|One of General Eisenhower's personal jackets]]\nDuring the war in Europe a short jacket was adopted by General Eisenhower as an option to the 4 pocket service coat. The \"[[Eisenhower jacket]]\", or \"Ike jacket\", was popular. It closely resembled the short [[Battle Dress|British Battle Dress jacket]] that inspired it. However, development and approval by the Army was slow. Except for small runs of jackets made for soldiers in England, the U.S Army did not provide the jacket as an issue item to enlisted soldiers until the war in Europe was almost over. \n\nThere were several versions. Two Ike jackets were manufactured in England and issued to troops in Europe before the jackets were approved Army wide. Both of these were essentially wool versions of the 1941 pattern poplin field jacket.<ref>Enjames, Henri-Paul, \"Government Issue:U.S. Army European Theater of Operations collectors Guide\",Histoire & Collections p.37</ref> These jackets were authorized only in the ETO. There were also non-standard conversions made for GIs particularly officers by tailors in the United Kingdom with degrees of variation. \n\nThe standard-issue '''M44 (Model 1944)''' Wool Field Jacket, made of fine-quality Olive Drab (OD 33) wool, was originally designed as a liner to be worn under the M1943 combat jacket. While originally intended as a field or combat jacket, it was nearly always reserved for service or dress wear. The M44 ultimately replaced the four button service dress jacket for enlisted troops. However, the phase out of the enlisted service coat was only completed after the war was over.<ref>Stanton, Shelby L., \"U.S. Army uniforms of the Korean War\", Stackpole Books (1992) p.104.</ref>\n\n===Wear of insignia and badges with the service uniform===\nWith the service uniform the enlisted arm- and branch-of-service insignia was embossed on circular pins, while the officer's insignia was \"free work\" (i.e., open design with no backing). Officer's arm-of-service pins (\"U.S.\" for the Regular Army) were worn on the upper lapels and their branch of service pins were worn on their lower lapels. EM wore the US disk on the right and the branch disk on the left upper lapel. The rank of officers was worn on the outer edge of the shoulder loops whereas enlisted soldiers wore rank chevrons three inches wide points up on both upper arms. Organizational patches were worn on the left upper shoulder only.\n\nWhen the coat was worn no insignia was worn on the shirts except sew on patches. When the shirt was worn as an outer garment officer's wore pin on insignia on the shirt. Until 1942 the officer's US pin was worn on the right collar point and the officer's branch insignia was worn on the left. The officer's rank was worn on the outer ends of the officer's shoulder loops as on the coat. After, September 1942 the US pin was deleted and the rank of the wearer was displayed on the right collar point. \n\nDistinctive Unit Insignia pins (featuring the unit's coat-of-arms) were worn in the center of the epaulet for officers and on lower lapels for enlisted men. These devices were rarely seen during the war as a metal conservation measure. \n\n[[Wound Chevron]]s (awarded from 1918 to 1932 for wounds in combat) were worn on the lower right sleeve between the cuff and the elbow. [[Service stripe|Service Stripes]], or \"Hash Marks\", (awarded for every 3 years of service) were worn on the lower left sleeve. World War I [[Overseas Chevron]]s [created 1918] and/or World War II [[Overseas Service Bar|Overseas Bar]]s [created 1944] (awarded for each six months combat service overseas) were worn on the lower left sleeve between the elbow and lower sleeve, but above the Service Stripes. The World War II Bars were worn over the World War I Chevrons. After 1953 the Service Stripes were kept on the lower left sleeve and the Overseas Service Stripes were moved to the lower right sleeve.\n\n[[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist's Wings]], [[Aviator Badge#United States Army|Pilot's Wings]], the [[Expert Infantryman Badge]], the [[Combat Infantryman Badge]], or the [[Combat Medical Badge]] are worn above the left top tunic pocket. Discharged soldiers returning home wore the embroidered [[Honorable Service Lapel Button|Honorable Discharge Emblem]] (or \"[[Honorable Service Lapel Button|Ruptured duck]]\") on the uniform over the right top tunic pocket on a diamond-shaped Olive Drab cloth backing. American and foreign medals or medal ribbons are worn above the left top tunic pocket. American and foreign Unit citation ribbons are worn over the right top tunic pocket. The [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]] patch [created 1944] (awarded to a unit for at least 6 months of exemplary combat service or combat support) is worn on the lower right sleeve above the cuff and below the Wound Chevrons.\n\n==Women's service uniforms==\nFemale members of the U.S. Army during WWII were assigned to either the [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army Nurse Corps]] (ANC) or the [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Auxiliary Army Corps]] (WAAC/WAC). The ANC preceded the WAAC/WAC so the two branches had separate uniform distinctions.  \n\n===Army Nurse Corps uniforms===\nPrior to 1943, the ANC winter service uniform consisted of the ANC pattern dark blue cap or garrison cap with maroon piping, suit jacket with maroon cuff braid and gold army buttons, light blue or white shirt, black tie and light blue skirt, shoes were black or white. The ANC summer service uniform consisted of a similar suit in beige with maroon shoulder strap piping and cuff braid, beige ANC cap or beige garrison cap with maroon piping, white shirt, and black four-in-hand tie. During World War II the first flight nurses uniform consisted of a blue wool battle dress jacket, blue wool trousers and a blue wool men's style maroon piped garrison cap. The uniform was worn with either the ANC light blue or white shirt and black tie. After 1943 the ANC adopted olive drab service uniforms similar to the newly formed WAC. Nurses wore Army hospital whites on ward duty.<ref>Smith, Jill H. (2001). Dressed for Duty: America's Women in Uniform 1898\u20131973. San Jose, California: R.

U.S. Army. Retrieved from https://www.army.mil/women/history/wac.html</ref> Although the ANC were actual service members of the U.S. Army, the members of the WAAC were not, so they wore Army style uniforms with distinctly different insignia than U.S. Army service members. In the summer of 1943 the WAAC was converted to the [[Women's Army Corps]] (WAC). From that point the WAC were U.S. Army service members and their insignia was changed to that of the regular army.<ref>Bellafaire, Judith A. \u201c The Women's Army Corps: A Commemoration of WWII Service.\u201d The Women's Army Corps, Center of Military History, 17 Feb. 2005, history.army.mil/brochures/WAC/WAC.HTM.</ref>\n\nFemale service dress went through an evolution of patterns over the course of the war years, however throughout the period the service uniforms both summer and winter generally consisted of the WAC pattern \"Hobby\" hat or women's garrison cap, a women's suit coat, shirtwaist, four-in-hand tie, skirt, russet leather women's service shoes and hand bag. The women's olive drab wool \"Ike jacket\" was also worn as were women's service trousers. The colors essentially mirrored those of their male counterparts of corresponding rank in the equivalent service uniform although fabrics differed. There were also special off-duty dresses of summer beige and winter tan. \n\nAfter the WAC were established the ANC adopted the WAC officer's uniforms, except for the ANC pattern hat and the ANC pattern handbag. However, those items were changed to olive drab and russet leather respectively. The ANC off duty dress was a separate ANC pattern in olive drab shade 51 or beige. The previous ANC beige summer service uniform with maroon trim was retained except that the tie was changed to maroon.<ref>AR 600-37 16 April 1945</ref> \n\n==Combat and utility uniform==\nThe [[United States Army]] during the inter-war period followed the previous model of having a standard uniform that combined elements of both the ''Class A'' (basic service uniform) and ''Class B'' (basic field uniform). By combining the uniforms, it was thought that time and money could be saved. Included in the clothing system was an [[olive drab]] (OD) wool [[garrison cap]], olive drab wool trousers, an olive drab wool [[Shirt|collared shirt]] worn with a black tie, an olive drab wool four button coat, and russet brown Type I (leather-soled) or Type II (rubber-soled) service shoes. An outer jacket or coat, either the Model 1938 \"Overcoat, [[Mackinaw cloth|Mackinaw]], Roll Collar\" or the [[M1941 Field Jacket]], nicknamed the \"Parson jacket\" after its designer, in olive drab shade No. 3 (OD3) was issued. The basic field or combat uniform for temperate or cool climates consisted of the basic wool uniform, without tie, along with a field jacket or wool overcoat, leggings, helmet and web gear.\n\nIn the European theater of operations (ETO), the basic wool uniform saw the most use and had the greatest functionality, being able to keep the soldier warm in the winter with its insulation and relatively cool and breathable in Northern European summer weather. However, the M-1941 field jacket came in for considerable criticism; it was poorly insulated and the light cotton shell provided little protection from wind or rain. In addition, the OD3 coloring was deemed inappropriate for use in northern Europe, as it stood out against most backdrops, making soldiers more visible targets.\n\n[[File:Infantryman in 1942 with M1 Garand, Fort Knox, KY.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Infantryman wearing HBT first pattern uniform]]\n\n===Herringbone twill uniform===\nAdditionally, a fatigue uniform was issued, made of 8.2-ounce heavy cotton [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone twill]] (HBT) cloth. The uniform consisted of a shirt, trousers, and a hat. Initially, this was a circular-brimmed \"clamdigger\"-style hat which was later replaced by a billed cap that was based on a design used by railroad workers. Initially it was meant to be worn over the basic wool or cotton uniforms to provide protection during fatigue duties, but it proved to be much better material than the primary will uniform for hot weather, as so it saw use as a combat uniform in nearly all of the major theaters of combat in which the US was involved.<ref>Stanton, Shelby L., ''U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II'', Stackpole Books (1995), {{ISBN|0-8117-2595-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8117-2595-8}}, p. 101</ref>\n\nThe original 1941 version came in a light sage green color that faded with repeated washing. The later 1943 version had small changes in tailoring and came in a darker olive drab shade No. 7, matching the new M1943 version of the field jacket.\n\n===The M-1943 field uniform===\nThe [[M-1943 uniform]] came into service in the later half of World War II. The uniform was designed as a layered system, meant to be worn over the wool shirt and trousers and in conjunction with a wool sweater and liners in colder weather.\n \nThe most recognizable part of the uniform is the standardized M-1943 field jacket. It was longer than the earlier 1941 field jacket, coming down to the upper thighs. It was made of windproof cotton sateen and was issued in a new darker olive drab color, OD7. The jacket also had a detachable hood, drawstring waist, two large angled breast pockets, and two lower skirt pockets.\n\nThe trousers were made out of the same OD7 cotton sateen material and white cotton twill inner lining, and were equipped with both front and rear pockets. They also had buttoned tabs at the waist in order to cinch the waist. For airborne troops, treated canvas cargo pockets were added to the trousers.\n\nIn the ETO, initial issuance of the M-1943 was slowed as a consequence of opposition by some U.S. commanders. However, as U.S. and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops pushed into Germany, more M-1943 uniforms or components of the uniform were issued as the supply situation (including replacements directly from stateside arrived) and the weather became harsher as winter arrived.\n\nIn use, the M-1943 was very popular with the men in the field, being relatively comfortable and having large amounts of pocket space\n\n===Experimental tropical uniform===\nIn 1943, after extensive testing in the swamplands and jungles of Florida and Panama, the U.S. Army determined that an experimental tropical uniform made of ''Byrd Cloth'' (known in Britain as ''[[Grenfell Cloth]]''), would best protect soldiers from insects and disease while cooling the body and minimizing losses from perspiration.<ref name=\"Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 191-195\">Kearny, Cresson H. (Maj), ''Jungle Snafus...And Remedies'', Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine (1996), pp. 191-195</ref> Byrd Cloth, as used in the Experimental Tropical Uniform, was a single-layer uniform of untreated OD long-staple [[Egyptian cotton]], made in a tightly woven herringbone twill to prevent mosquito bites. In use, the uniform was intended to cool the wearer even when continuously wetted, as might be expected in a humid, rainy jungle environment.<ref name=\"Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 191-195\"/> The uniform featured a short-tailed shirt, trousers with cuffs fitted with half-inch boottop fastening tapes, and a flap-protected fly to keep out crawling insects such as leeches, ticks, and chiggers.<ref name=\"Kearny, Cresson H. 1996 pp. 191-195\"/><ref name=\"Stanton, Shelby L. 1995 pp. 88-89\">Stanton, Shelby L., ''U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II'', Stackpole Books (1995), {{ISBN|0-8117-2595-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8117-2595-8}}, pp. 88-89</ref> Pockets were shallow and kept to a minimum to increase cooling; users carried all their gear in load-bearing belts, suspenders, or in low-mounted field packs designed to minimize body contact (jungle packs).

This dress was inspired by a WAC seersucker version the same color. Sage green fatigue uniforms of [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]] cotton [[twill]] for women, along with women's combat boots, field jackets and flight clothing, were manufactured by the U.S. Army during World War II. However, when women's versions of these items were not available, as was often the case in overseas areas, men's issue work/fatigue clothing was used instead.<ref>Smith, Jill H. (2001).

James Bender Publishing, {{ISBN|0-912138-81-5}} p. 241.</ref> The M1942 HBT \"clamdigger\" utility hat was used extensively by the [[Women's Army Corps|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]]. They wore it with the back of the brim flipped up and the front of the brim pulled down and nicknamed it the \"[[Li'l Abner#Main characters|Daisy Mae]] Cap\". It replaced the WAACs' distinctive \"Hobby Hat\" kepi for field use and fatigue duties.\n\n==Footwear==\nArmy combat footwear in World War II originally consisted of a basic tanned leather shoe, used with heavy canvas leggings, the Model 1939 \"Shoes, Service, Composition Sole\", or '''Type I Service Shoe'''. This was an ankle-high field shoe made of tanned leather in a dark red or russet color, originally with leather soles. The sole was changed to a rubber composition after 1940 and designated as the '''Type II Service Shoe'''. Soon after the US entry into the war these shoes, which were also used as part of the Class A dress uniform, were replaced with a \"roughout\" field shoe made from leather uppers with a sueded outer finish, and designated the '''Type III Service Shoe'''. The Marine Corps version of these shoes were commonly referred to as \"boondockers\". In November 1943, the Type II and III service shoes were in turn replaced by a boot, the '''M43 Combat Boot''' or \"Two-Buckle Boot\". This boot had a permanently attached a two-buckled leather ankle flap, which was designed to replace the unpopular canvas [[leggings]]. The sole was made of synthetic or reclaimed rubber. Due to supply issues, soldiers can be seen wearing both the service shoes with the leggings and the newer combat boot.\n\n===Specialized combat footwear===\nA rubber-soled, canvas-top [[Jungle boot]] was issued during the war for use by soldiers in the tropical and jungle environments typically encountered in the China-Burma-India (CBI) and the Pacific theaters. The 10th Mountain Division's troopers occasionally wore the Mountain Boot, a low-quarter brown leather boot with a square toe and rocker-type sole, though this boot was phased out in favor of the Type III Combat Boot in the last year of the war. In 1944, the M-44 Combat Boot, a high-top leather boot with full laces was adopted for service, but for the duration it was primarily worn by soldiers on stateside duty.\n\nParachute troops beginning in 1942 were issued [[Jump boots]] \u2013 high-lacing rubber-soled leather boots which were intended to provide additional ankle support when landing by parachute. Although these boots were to be replaced by the new M43 combat boots, jump boots continued to be worn throughout the war. Nicknamed \"Corcorans\", from the name of the first contractor to manufacture them, they have become a status symbol as the footwear of paratroopers and Rangers.\n\nOvershoes were normally issued to Army units during winter operations. In January 1945, some Army units operating in the ETO received [[shoepac]]s for wet winter wear. The shoepac was a leather boot with rubberized lower top and sole, worn in conjunction with the wool ski sock. While it was effective in keeping feet protected from soaking and freezing ground, the shoepac lacked foot support and tended to wear quickly; it also resulted in incidents of foot injuries when a soldier wearing shoepacs on a march in freezing weather stopped to rest, allowing perspiration-soaked socks inside the boot to freeze.<ref>Stanton, Shelby L., ''U.S. Army Uniforms of World War II'', Stackpole Books (1995), {{ISBN|0-8117-2595-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8117-2595-8}}, p. 242</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Leggings#Military leggings|Leggings]]\n*[[Uniforms of the United States Army]]\n*[[Uniforms of the United States Marine Corps]]\n*[[History of the United States Army]]\n*[[United States Army enlisted rank insignia of World War II]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=6U4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 Military Uniforms Color Catalog] Life Magazine, May 19, 1941\n*[http://www.hardscrabblefarm.com/ww2/ World War II Living History and Reenacting Information]\n*[http://90thidpg.us/Equipment/Articles/index.html 90th Infantry Division Preservation Group Uniform and Equipment Section]\n<br>\n{{US Army uniforms}}\n\n{{USWWII}}\n\n[[Category:World War II military equipment of the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Army uniforms]]\n[[Category:History of the United States Army]]\n", "name_user": "ZappaOMatic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMen's service uniforms:Tweak", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_uniforms_in_World_War_II"}

One vendor said, \"We'd send them a list of products we can deliver within 24, 48 hours\", but on average it took 72 hours for the agency to place an order. He added \"the city just moves so slow\" when there was very high demand coming from hospitals and the private sector. According to the contractor, eight out of 10 supply orders could not be filled because DCAS did not pay on time, which a spokeswoman for New York City denied. The office of the comptroller approved 12 contracts with a total value of $150 million before the mayor's office took over the process on March 16. Mayor [[Bill de Blasio]] said that the city may run out of supplies by April if the federal government does not send 3 million N95 masks, 50 million surgical masks, 15,000 ventilators, and 45 million surgical gowns, gloves, and face shields.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/city-hall-didnt-order-covid-19-supplies-for-nyc-until-march-6/|title=City Hall didn't secure 1st order of COVID-19 supplies for NYC until March 6|date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321141728/https://nypost.com/2020/03/20/city-hall-didnt-order-covid-19-supplies-for-nyc-until-march-6/|archive-date=March 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOne [[Emergency medical services|EMS]] worker expressed frustration at being asked to wear the less-effective [[surgical mask]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2020/03/21/nyc-first-responders-resent-lack-of-coronavirus-equipment/|title=NYC first responders resent lack of coronavirus equipment|date=March 21, 2020|access-date=March 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200322123408/https://nypost.com/2020/03/21/nyc-first-responders-resent-lack-of-coronavirus-equipment/|archive-date=March 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The police union filed a complaint on March 13 due to NYPD officers not being given masks and other protective gear.

Humans have four types of [[tooth|teeth]]: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each have a specific function. The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food and the molars and premolars crush the food.  The roots of teeth are embedded in the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw) or the [[Human mandible|mandible]] (lower jaw) and are covered by [[gums]]. Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.\n\nHumans, like other mammals, are [[diphyodont]], meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set (called the \"baby\", \"milk\", \"primary\", or \"[[deciduous teeth|deciduous]]\" set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as [[neonatal teeth|natal teeth]]. Normal [[tooth eruption]] at about six months is known as [[teething]] and can be painful.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:3D Medical Animation Still Showing Types of Teeth.jpg|thumb|350px|right|There are four main types of teeth in humans, shown labelled here.]]\n{{Main|Dental anatomy}}\n[[Dental anatomy]] is a field of [[anatomy]] dedicated to the study of tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though [[occlusion (dentistry)|dental occlusion]], or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.\n\nThe anatomic [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of a tooth is the area covered in enamel above the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ) or \"neck\" of the tooth.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clemente | first = Carmine | title = Anatomy, a regional atlas of the human body | publisher = Urban & Schwarzenberg | location = Baltimore | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-8067-0323-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/anatomyregionala00clem }}</ref><ref name=\"ash6\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=6}}</ref> Most of the crown is composed of [[dentin]] (\"dentine\" in British English) with the pulp chamber inside.<ref name=\"Cate3\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=3}}</ref> The crown is within bone before [[tooth eruption|eruption]].<ref name=\"ash9\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=9}}</ref> After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with [[cementum]]. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has [[root canal|pulp canals]]. Canines and most premolars, except for [[maxillary (disambiguation)|maxillary]] first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and [[mandible|mandibular]] molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots are referred to as [[supernumerary roots]].\n\nHumans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, \"baby\" or \"milk\") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. Teeth are classified as [[incisor]]s, [[Canine tooth|canines]], [[premolar]]s (also called ''bicuspids''), and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]. Incisors are primarily used for cutting, canines are for tearing, and molars serve for grinding.\n\nMost teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others. There are several different [[Dental notation|notation systems]] to refer to a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal numbering system]], and [[Palmer Notation Method|Palmer notation method]]. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.\n\n===Primary teeth===\nAmong [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous (primary) teeth]], ten are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and ten in the mandible (lower jaw), for a total of 20. The [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] for primary teeth in humans is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.0.2|lower=2.1.0.2}}.\n\nIn the primary set of teeth, there are two types of incisors \u2013 centrals and laterals\u2014 and two types of molars \u2013 first and second. All primary teeth are normally later replaced with their permanent counterparts.\n\n===Permanent teeth===\n[[File:Universal Numbering System.svg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Universal Numbering System]] for adult human teeth. The view is from a dental practitioner's perspective, meaning tooth 1 is the upper right rear (third) molar.]]\nAmong [[permanent teeth]], 16 are found in the maxilla and 16 in the mandible, for a total of 32. The dental formula is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}.\n\nThe maxillary teeth are the [[maxillary central incisor]]s (teeth 8 and 9 in the diagram), [[maxillary lateral incisor]]s (7 and 10), [[maxillary canine]]s (6 and 11), [[maxillary first premolar]]s (5 and 12), [[maxillary second premolar]]s (4 and 13), [[maxillary first molar]]s (3 and 14), [[maxillary second molar]]s (2 and 15), and [[maxillary third molar]]s (1 and 16). The mandibular teeth are the [[mandibular central incisor]]s (24 and 25), [[mandibular lateral incisor]]s (23 and 26), [[mandibular canine]]s (22 and 27), [[mandibular first premolar]]s (21 and 28), [[mandibular second premolar]]s (20 and 29), [[mandibular first molar]]s (19 and 30), [[mandibular second molar]]s (18 and 31), and [[mandibular third molar]]s (17 and 32). Third molars are commonly called \"[[wisdom teeth]]\" and may never erupt into the mouth or form at all. When they do form, they often must be [[Dental extraction|removed]]. If any additional teeth form\u2014for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare\u2014they are referred to as [[Hyperdontia|supernumerary teeth]] (hyperdontia).{{cn|date=March 2020}} Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called [[hypodontia]].\n\nThere are small differences between the teeth of males and females, with male teeth along with the male jaw tending to be larger on average than female teeth and jaw. There are also differences in the internal dental tissue proportions, with male teeth consisting of proportionately more dentine while female teeth have proportionately more enamel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sorenti|first=Mark|last2=Martin\u00f3n\u2010Torres|first2=Mar\u00eda|last3=Mart\u00edn\u2010Franc\u00e9s|first3=Laura|last4=Perea\u2010P\u00e9rez|first4=Bernardo|title=Sexual dimorphism of dental tissues in modern human mandibular molars|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=0|issue=2|pages=332\u2013340|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23822|pmid=30866041|issn=1096-8644|year=2019}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Human tooth diagram-en.svg|480px|thumb]]\n\n===Enamel===\n{{Main|Tooth enamel}}\n\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly [[mineralized tissues|mineralized substance]] of the body.

At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]], up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ.<ref name=\"Cate, A.

It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.<ref name = \"ross448\"/> The formation of dentin is known as [[dentinogenesis]]. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.\n\nDentin is a mineralized [[connective tissue]] with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.<ref name=\"ross450\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=450}}</ref> The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 \u03bcm near the pulp, to 1.2 \u03bcm in the midportion, and 900&nbsp;nm near the dentino-enamel junction.<ref name=\"Cate152\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=152}}</ref> Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other.

Cementum is excreted by [[cementoblast]]s within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the [[periodontal ligament]]s can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cement to enamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least \u2154 of the root.<ref name=\"Cate236\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=236}}</ref> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about \u2153 of the root apex.<ref name=\"Cate241\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Dental pulp ===\n{{Main|Pulp (tooth)}}\nThe dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root.<ref name=\"Ross451\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=451}}</ref> Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin.<ref name=\"Cate150\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=150}}</ref> Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, [[macrophage]]s and [[T cells|T lymphocytes]].<ref name=\"Walton11thru13\">Walton, Richard E. and Mahmoud Torabinejad.

Although many diverse [[species]] have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For [[human]] teeth to have a healthy [[Human mouth|oral]] environment, [[tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and the [[periodontium]] must all develop during appropriate stages of [[fetal development]]. [[Deciduous teeth|Primary teeth]] start to form in [[human embryogenesis|the development of the embryo]] between the sixth and eighth weeks, and [[permanent teeth]] begin to form in the twentieth week.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=95}}</ref> If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.\n\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first [[pharyngeal arch]] that is necessary for the development of teeth.<ref name = \"cate81\"/>\n\nTooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.<ref name=\"cate81\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=81}}</ref> This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.\n\nThe [[tooth bud]] (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of [[cell (biology)|cells]] that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the [[enamel organ]], the [[dental papilla]] and the [[dental follicle]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> The ''enamel organ'' is composed of the [[outer enamel epithelium]], [[inner enamel epithelium]], [[stellate reticulum]] and [[stratum intermedium]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> These cells give rise to [[ameloblast]]s, which produce enamel and the [[reduced enamel epithelium]]. The growth of [[cervical loop]] cells into the deeper tissues forms [[Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath]], which determines a tooth's root shape. The ''dental papilla'' contains cells that develop into [[odontoblast]]s, which are dentin-forming cells.<ref name=\"utmb\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050136/http://cellbio.utmb.edu/microanatomy/digestive/tooth.htm Lab Exercises: Tooth development].

Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the [[Alveolar process of maxilla|alveolar bone]] around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the [[periodontal ligament]]s which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.<ref name = \"ross453\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=453}}</ref>\n\n=== Eruption ===\n{{Main|Tooth eruption}}\n\n[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|right|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth ''(left)'', a lost primary tooth ''(middle)'', and a permanent tooth ''(right)'']]\nTooth eruption in humans is a process in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments play an important role in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.\n\nThere have been many theories about the cause of tooth eruption. One theory proposes that the developing root of a tooth pushes it into the mouth. Another, known as the cushioned hammock theory, resulted from microscopic study of teeth, which was thought to show a [[ligament]] around the root. It was later discovered that the \"ligament\" was merely an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide. Currently, the most widely held belief is that the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.\n\nThe onset of primary tooth loss has been found to correlate strongly with somatic and psychological criteria of school readiness.<ref>Kranich, Ernst-Michael (1990) \"Anthropologie\", in F.

Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an [[Dental alveolus|alveolus]], or \"socket\". Lying over the bone is the [[gingiva]] or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.\n\n===Periodontal ligaments===\nThe [[periodontal ligament]] is a specialized [[connective tissue]] that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15\u20130.38mm, but this size decreases over time.<ref name=\"Cate256\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=256}}</ref> The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and [[Bone resorption|resorption]] of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and [[epithelial cell rests of Malassez]].<ref name=\"Cate260\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=260}}</ref> Consisting of mostly Type I and III [[collagen]], the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location.

An area of bone receiving [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.\n\n===Gingiva===\nThe [[gingiva]] (\"gums\") is the [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.<ref name=\"Cate247and248\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|pages=247 and 248}}</ref> The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth.

[[Saliva]] gradually neutralises the [[acid]]s which cause the pH of the tooth surface to rise above the critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes '[[remineralisation]]', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.\n\n===Caries (cavities)===\n[[File:Toothdecay.png|right|thumb|150px|Advanced tooth decay on a premolar]]\n{{Main|Dental caries}}\nDental caries (cavities), described as \"tooth decay\", is an infectious disease which damages the structures of teeth.<ref name=\"medline\">[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001055.htm Dental Cavities], ''MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia''.</ref> The disease can lead to [[pain]], [[tooth loss]], and infection.

It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful [[tooth brushing|brushing]] and [[Dental Floss|flossing]]. Professional cleaning includes [[tooth scaling]], using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.\n\nThe purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.<ref>[http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html Introduction to Dental Plaque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094040/http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html |date=2011-08-27 }}. Leeds Dental Institute.</ref> Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar.<ref name=\"adaoralhealth\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222223237/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/cleaning.asp Oral Health Topics: Cleaning your teeth and gums]. American Dental Association.</ref> A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the [[gum line]], where [[periodontal disease]] often begins and could develop caries.\n\nElectric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: \"Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems.\" <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2679175.stm Thumbs down for electric toothbrush], BBC News, January 21, 2003.</ref> The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].\n\n===Protective treatments===\n[[Fluoride therapy]] is often recommended to protect against dental caries. [[Water fluoridation]] and [[fluoride]] supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=223}}</ref> The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride [[toothpaste]] or [[mouthwash]], is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.\n\n[[Dental sealant]]s are another preventive therapy often used to provide a barrier to bacteria and decay on the surface of teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in a procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.\n\n==Restorations==\n[[File:dent,tooth,zub.jpg|right|thumb|A restored premolar]]\nAfter a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, [[Dental restoration|restoration]] of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of [[Dental restorative materials|materials]], including [[Glass ionomer cement|glass ionomer]], [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[gold]], [[Dental porcelain|porcelain]], and [[Dental composite|composite]].<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090830062420/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fillings.asp Oral Health Topics: Dental Filling Options]\". ada.org.</ref> Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as \"intracoronal restorations\". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the [[lost-wax casting|lost-wax technique]], such as for some [[inlays and onlays]].

Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a [[removable partial denture|partial]] number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support.<ref name=\"aaomsimplants\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925181506/http://www.aaoms.org/dental_implants.php Dental Implants]\", American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.</ref>\n\n==Abnormalities==\n[[File:Fracturedtooth.jpg|thumb|A broken upper front tooth showing the pink of the pulp]]\nTooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes.<ref name=\"neville50\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=50.}}</ref> While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.\n\n===Environmental===\n\n==== Alteration during tooth development ====\nTooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. [[Enamel hypoplasia]] is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate.<ref>{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=31}}</ref> This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color.

In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis.<ref name=NIH /> Enamel hypoplasia resulting from [[syphilis]] is frequently referred to as [[Hutchinson's teeth]], which is considered one part of [[Hutchinson's triad]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/syphilis/DS00374/DSECTION=6 Syphilis: Complications], Mayo Clinic.</ref> [[Turner's hypoplasia]] is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from [[antineoplastic]] therapy.\n\n====Destruction after development====\nTooth destruction from processes other than [[dental caries]] is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. [[Attrition (dental)|Attrition]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth.<ref>\"[http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course9/loss_of_structure.htm Loss of Tooth Structure]\", American Dental Hygiene Association.</ref> Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. [[Abrasion (dental)|Abrasion]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801114913/http://dentistry.umkc.edu/practition/assets/AbnormalitiesofTeeth.pdf Abnormalities of Teeth]\", University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry.</ref> If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. [[Erosion (dental)|Erosion]] is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |pmid=15055615 |year=2003 |last1=Yip |first1=KH |last2=Smales |first2=RJ |last3=Kaidonis |first3=JA |title=The diagnosis and control of extrinsic acid erosion of tooth substance |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=350\u20133; quiz 354 |journal=General Dentistry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907094153/http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |archivedate=September 7, 2006 }}</ref> Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with [[bulimia]] since [[vomiting]] results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of [[lemon juice]]. [[Abfraction]] is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under [[pressure]], the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]], causes [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] on one side of the tooth and [[compression (physical)|compression]] on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as [[internal resorption]], when caused by cells within the pulp, or [[external resorption]], when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.\n\n====Discoloration====\n{{Main|Tooth discoloration}}\n[[File:Tired teeth.jpg|thumb|Discolored teeth]]\nDiscoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of [[chlorophyll]], restorative materials, and medications.<ref name=\"neville63\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 63}}</ref> Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of [[chlorhexidine]], a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. [[Congenital erythropoietic porphyria]] causes [[porphyrin]]s to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with [[alkaptonuria]] and rarely with [[Parkinson's disease]]. [[Erythroblastosis fetalis]] and [[biliary atresia]] are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of [[biliverdin]]. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with [[leprosy|lepromatous leprosy]]. Some medications, such as [[tetracycline]] antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.\n\n====Alteration of eruption====\nTooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be [[Wisdom teeth#Impaction|impacted]]. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth.<ref name=\"neville66\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=66}}</ref> Other causes may be [[tumor]]s, [[cyst]]s, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. [[Tooth ankylosis]] occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.\n\nA technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by [[orthodontist]]s who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches \u2153 of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than \u2154 complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between \u2153 and \u2154, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.\n\n===Developmental===\n\n==== Abnormality in number ====\n* [[Anodontia]] is the total lack of tooth development.\n* [[Hyperdontia]] is the presence of a higher-than-normal number of teeth.\n* [[Hypodontia]] is the lack of development of one or more teeth.\n** Oligodontia may be used to describe the absence of 6 or more teeth.\nSome systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include [[Apert syndrome]], [[cleidocranial dysostosis]], [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]], [[Gardner's syndrome]], and [[Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville70\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=70}}</ref> Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, [[Ectodermal dysplasia]], Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and [[Gorlin syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville69\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=69}}</ref>\n\n====Abnormality in size====\n* [[Microdontia]] is a condition where teeth are smaller than the usual size.\n* [[Macrodontia (tooth)|Macrodontia]] is where teeth are larger than the usual size.\n\nMicrodontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a [[maxillary lateral incisor]]. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are [[wisdom teeth|third molars]]. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in [[Gigantism|pituitary gigantism]] and [[Pineal gland|pineal]] [[hyperplasia]]. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of [[hemifacial hyperplasia]].\n\n====Abnormality in shape====\n[[File:Milk.teeth.fusion.jpg|thumb|The fusion of two deciduous teeth]]\n* [[Tooth Gemination|Gemination]] occurs when a developing tooth incompletely splits into the formation of two teeth.\n* [[Tooth fusion|Fusion]] is the union of two adjacent teeth during development.\n* [[Concrescence]] is the fusion of two separate teeth only in their cementum.\n* Accessory [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] are additional cusps on a tooth and may manifest as a [[Talon cusp]], [[Cusp of Carabelli]], or [[Dens evaginatus]].\n* [[Dens invaginatus]], also called Dens in dente, is a deep invagination in a tooth causing the appearance of a tooth within a tooth.\n* [[Ectopic enamel]] is enamel found in an unusual location, such as the root of a tooth.\n* [[Taurodontism]] is a condition where the body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged, and is associated with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome]], [[Triple X syndrome]], and [[XYY syndrome]].<ref name = \"neville85\"/>\n* [[Hypercementosis]] is excessive formation of cementum, which may result from trauma, inflammation, [[acromegaly]], [[rheumatic fever]], and [[Paget's disease of bone]].<ref name=\"neville85\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=85}}</ref>\n* A [[dilaceration]] is a bend in the root which may have been caused by trauma to the tooth during formation.\n* [[Supernumerary roots]] is the presence of a greater number of roots on a tooth than expected\n\n==== Cleft lip and palate and association with dental anomalies ====\nThere are many types of dental anomalies seen in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Both sets of dentition may be affected however they are commonly seen in the affected side. Most frequently, missing teeth, supernumerary or discoloured teeth can be seen however enamel dysplasia, discolouration and delayed root development is also common. In children with cleft lip and palate, the lateral incisor in the alveolar cleft region has the highest prevalence of dental developmental disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Tortora C, Meazzini MC, Garattini G, Brusati R|date=March 2008|title=Prevalence of abnormalities in dental structure, position and eruption pattern in population of unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate patients|pmid=18333651|doi=10.1597/06-218.1|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|volume=45|issue=2|pages=154\u2013162}}</ref> This is important to consider in order to correctly plan treatment keeping in mind considerations for function and aesthetics.

It is essential to assess the patient both clinically and radiographically in order to correctly treat and prevent progression of any dental problems. It is also useful to note that patients with a cleft lip and palate automatically score a 5 on the IOTN ( index for orthodontic need) and therefore are eligible for orthodontic treatment, liaising with an orthodontist is vital in order coordinate and plan treatment successfully.\n\n====Abnormality in structure====\n* [[Amelogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which enamel does not form properly or at all.<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=amelogenesisimperfecta Amelogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentinogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which dentin does not form properly and is sometimes associated with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]].<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=dentinogenesisimperfecta Dentinogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentin dysplasia]] is a disorder in which the roots and pulp of teeth may be affected.\n* [[Regional odontodysplasia]] is a disorder affecting enamel, dentin, and pulp and causes the teeth to appear \"ghostly\" on radiographs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cho, Shiu-yin|url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-72/issue-8/vol72_issue8.pdf |title=Conservative Management of Regional Odontodysplasia: Case Report|volume=72|issue =8|pages=735\u20138|pmid=17049109|year=2006|journal=J Can Dent Assoc}}</ref>\n* [[Diastema]] is a condition in which there is a gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth.<ref>''ASDC Journal of Dentistry for Children, Volume 48''.

Humans have four types of [[tooth|teeth]]: incisors, canines, premolars, and molars, which each have a specific function. The incisors cut the food, the canines tear the food and the molars and premolars crush the food.  The roots of teeth are embedded in the [[maxilla]] (upper jaw) or the [[Human mandible|mandible]] (lower jaw) and are covered by [[gums]]. Teeth are made of multiple tissues of varying density and hardness.\n\nHumans, like other mammals, are [[diphyodont]], meaning that they develop two sets of teeth. The first set (called the \"baby\", \"milk\", \"primary\", or \"[[deciduous teeth|deciduous]]\" set) normally starts to appear at about six months of age, although some babies are born with one or more visible teeth, known as [[neonatal teeth|natal teeth]]. Normal [[tooth eruption]] at about six months is known as [[teething]] and can be painful.\n\n==Anatomy==\n[[File:3D Medical Animation Still Showing Types of Teeth.jpg|thumb|350px|right|There are four main types of teeth in humans, shown labelled here.]]\n{{Main|Dental anatomy}}\n[[Dental anatomy]] is a field of [[anatomy]] dedicated to the study of tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though [[occlusion (dentistry)|dental occlusion]], or contact between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.\n\nThe anatomic [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of a tooth is the area covered in enamel above the [[cementoenamel junction]] (CEJ) or \"neck\" of the tooth.<ref>{{cite book | last = Clemente | first = Carmine | title = Anatomy, a regional atlas of the human body | publisher = Urban & Schwarzenberg | location = Baltimore | year = 1987 | isbn = 978-0-8067-0323-7 | url = https://archive.org/details/anatomyregionala00clem }}</ref><ref name=\"ash6\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=6}}</ref> Most of the crown is composed of [[dentin]] (\"dentine\" in British English) with the pulp chamber inside.<ref name=\"Cate3\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=3}}</ref> The crown is within bone before [[tooth eruption|eruption]].<ref name=\"ash9\">{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=9}}</ref> After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with [[cementum]]. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has [[root canal|pulp canals]]. Canines and most premolars, except for [[maxillary (disambiguation)|maxillary]] first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and [[mandible|mandibular]] molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots are referred to as [[supernumerary roots]].\n\nHumans usually have 20 primary (deciduous, \"baby\" or \"milk\") teeth and 32 permanent (adult) teeth. Teeth are classified as [[incisor]]s, [[Canine tooth|canines]], [[premolar]]s (also called ''bicuspids''), and [[Molar (tooth)|molars]]. Incisors are primarily used for cutting, canines are for tearing, and molars serve for grinding.\n\nMost teeth have identifiable features that distinguish them from others. There are several different [[Dental notation|notation systems]] to refer to a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the [[FDI World Dental Federation notation]], the [[Universal numbering system (dental)|universal numbering system]], and [[Palmer Notation Method|Palmer notation method]]. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.\n\n===Primary teeth===\nAmong [[Deciduous teeth|deciduous (primary) teeth]], ten are found in the maxilla (upper jaw) and ten in the mandible (lower jaw), for a total of 20. The [[Dentition#Dental formula|dental formula]] for primary teeth in humans is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.0.2|lower=2.1.0.2}}.\n\nIn the primary set of teeth, there are two types of incisors \u2013 centrals and laterals\u2014 and two types of molars \u2013 first and second. All primary teeth are normally later replaced with their permanent counterparts.\n\n===Permanent teeth===\n[[File:Universal Numbering System.svg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Universal Numbering System]] for adult human teeth. The view is from a dental practitioner's perspective, meaning tooth 1 is the upper right rear (third) molar.]]\nAmong [[permanent teeth]], 16 are found in the maxilla and 16 in the mandible, for a total of 32. The dental formula is {{DentalFormula|upper=2.1.2.3|lower=2.1.2.3}}.\n\nThe maxillary teeth are the [[maxillary central incisor]]s (teeth 8 and 9 in the diagram), [[maxillary lateral incisor]]s (7 and 10), [[maxillary canine]]s (6 and 11), [[maxillary first premolar]]s (5 and 12), [[maxillary second premolar]]s (4 and 13), [[maxillary first molar]]s (3 and 14), [[maxillary second molar]]s (2 and 15), and [[maxillary third molar]]s (1 and 16). The mandibular teeth are the [[mandibular central incisor]]s (24 and 25), [[mandibular lateral incisor]]s (23 and 26), [[mandibular canine]]s (22 and 27), [[mandibular first premolar]]s (21 and 28), [[mandibular second premolar]]s (20 and 29), [[mandibular first molar]]s (19 and 30), [[mandibular second molar]]s (18 and 31), and [[mandibular third molar]]s (17 and 32). Third molars are commonly called \"[[wisdom teeth]]\" and may never erupt into the mouth or form at all. When they do form, they often must be [[Dental extraction|removed]]. If any additional teeth form\u2014for example, fourth and fifth molars, which are rare\u2014they are referred to as [[Hyperdontia|supernumerary teeth]] (hyperdontia).{{cn|date=March 2020}} Development of fewer than the usual number of teeth is called [[hypodontia]].\n\nThere are small differences between the teeth of males and females, with male teeth along with the male jaw tending to be larger on average than female teeth and jaw. There are also differences in the internal dental tissue proportions, with male teeth consisting of proportionately more dentine while female teeth have proportionately more enamel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sorenti|first=Mark|last2=Martin\u00f3n\u2010Torres|first2=Mar\u00eda|last3=Mart\u00edn\u2010Franc\u00e9s|first3=Laura|last4=Perea\u2010P\u00e9rez|first4=Bernardo|title=Sexual dimorphism of dental tissues in modern human mandibular molars|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=0|issue=2|pages=332\u2013340|doi=10.1002/ajpa.23822|pmid=30866041|issn=1096-8644|year=2019}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Human tooth diagram-en.svg|480px|thumb]]\n\n===Enamel===\n{{Main|Tooth enamel}}\n\nEnamel is the hardest and most highly [[mineralized tissues|mineralized substance]] of the body.

At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]], up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ.<ref name=\"Cate, A.

It is secreted by the odontoblasts of the dental pulp.<ref name = \"ross448\"/> The formation of dentin is known as [[dentinogenesis]]. The porous, yellow-hued material is made up of 70% inorganic materials, 20% organic materials, and 10% water by weight.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but dentin still acts as a protective layer and supports the crown of the tooth.\n\nDentin is a mineralized [[connective tissue]] with an organic matrix of collagenous proteins. Dentin has microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp cavity to the exterior cementum or enamel border.<ref name=\"ross450\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=450}}</ref> The diameter of these tubules range from 2.5 \u03bcm near the pulp, to 1.2 \u03bcm in the midportion, and 900&nbsp;nm near the dentino-enamel junction.<ref name=\"Cate152\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=152}}</ref> Although they may have tiny side-branches, the tubules do not intersect with each other.

Cementum is excreted by [[cementoblast]]s within the root of the tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the [[periodontal ligament]]s can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cement to enamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least \u2154 of the root.<ref name=\"Cate236\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=236}}</ref> The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about \u2153 of the root apex.<ref name=\"Cate241\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=241}}</ref>\n\n===Dental pulp ===\n{{Main|Pulp (tooth)}}\nThe dental pulp is the central part of the tooth filled with soft connective tissue.<ref name = \"Cate150\"/> This tissue contains blood vessels and nerves that enter the tooth from a hole at the apex of the root.<ref name=\"Ross451\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=451}}</ref> Along the border between the dentin and the pulp are odontoblasts, which initiate the formation of dentin.<ref name=\"Cate150\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=150}}</ref> Other cells in the pulp include fibroblasts, preodontoblasts, [[macrophage]]s and [[T cells|T lymphocytes]].<ref name=\"Walton11thru13\">Walton, Richard E. and Mahmoud Torabinejad.

Although many diverse [[species]] have teeth, their development is largely the same as in humans. For [[human]] teeth to have a healthy [[Human mouth|oral]] environment, [[tooth enamel|enamel]], [[dentin]], [[cementum]], and the [[periodontium]] must all develop during appropriate stages of [[fetal development]]. [[Deciduous teeth|Primary teeth]] start to form in [[human embryogenesis|the development of the embryo]] between the sixth and eighth weeks, and [[permanent teeth]] begin to form in the twentieth week.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=95}}</ref> If teeth do not start to develop at or near these times, they will not develop at all.\n\nA significant amount of research has focused on determining the processes that initiate tooth development. It is widely accepted that there is a factor within the tissues of the first [[pharyngeal arch]] that is necessary for the development of teeth.<ref name = \"cate81\"/>\n\nTooth development is commonly divided into the following stages: the bud stage, the cap, the bell, and finally maturation. The staging of tooth development is an attempt to categorize changes that take place along a continuum; frequently it is difficult to decide what stage should be assigned to a particular developing tooth.<ref name=\"cate81\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=81}}</ref> This determination is further complicated by the varying appearance of different histologic sections of the same developing tooth, which can appear to be different stages.\n\nThe [[tooth bud]] (sometimes called the tooth germ) is an aggregation of [[cell (biology)|cells]] that eventually forms a tooth. It is organized into three parts: the [[enamel organ]], the [[dental papilla]] and the [[dental follicle]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> The ''enamel organ'' is composed of the [[outer enamel epithelium]], [[inner enamel epithelium]], [[stellate reticulum]] and [[stratum intermedium]].<ref name = \"utmb\"/> These cells give rise to [[ameloblast]]s, which produce enamel and the [[reduced enamel epithelium]]. The growth of [[cervical loop]] cells into the deeper tissues forms [[Hertwig's Epithelial Root Sheath]], which determines a tooth's root shape. The ''dental papilla'' contains cells that develop into [[odontoblast]]s, which are dentin-forming cells.<ref name=\"utmb\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070203050136/http://cellbio.utmb.edu/microanatomy/digestive/tooth.htm Lab Exercises: Tooth development].

Cementoblasts form the cementum of a tooth. Osteoblasts give rise to the [[Alveolar process of maxilla|alveolar bone]] around the roots of teeth. Fibroblasts develop the [[periodontal ligament]]s which connect teeth to the alveolar bone through cementum.<ref name = \"ross453\">{{harvnb|Ross|2002|page=453}}</ref>\n\n=== Eruption ===\n{{Main|Tooth eruption}}\n\n[[File:ToothLost-2917.jpg|thumb|right|Bottom teeth of a seven-year-old, showing primary teeth ''(left)'', a lost primary tooth ''(middle)'', and a permanent tooth ''(right)'']]\nTooth eruption in humans is a process in tooth development in which the teeth enter the mouth and become visible. Current research indicates that the periodontal ligaments play an important role in tooth eruption. Primary teeth erupt into the mouth from around six months until two years of age. These teeth are the only ones in the mouth until a person is about six years old. At that time, the first permanent tooth erupts. This stage, during which a person has a combination of primary and permanent teeth, is known as the mixed stage. The mixed stage lasts until the last primary tooth is lost and the remaining permanent teeth erupt into the mouth.\n\nThere have been many theories about the cause of tooth eruption. One theory proposes that the developing root of a tooth pushes it into the mouth. Another, known as the cushioned hammock theory, resulted from microscopic study of teeth, which was thought to show a [[ligament]] around the root. It was later discovered that the \"ligament\" was merely an [[Artifact (observational)|artifact]] created in the process of preparing the slide. Currently, the most widely held belief is that the periodontal ligaments provide the main impetus for the process.\n\nThe onset of primary tooth loss has been found to correlate strongly with somatic and psychological criteria of school readiness.<ref>Kranich, Ernst-Michael (1990) \"Anthropologie\", in F.

Of these, cementum is the only one that is a part of a tooth. Periodontal ligaments connect the alveolar bone to the cementum. Alveolar bone surrounds the roots of teeth to provide support and creates what is commonly called an [[Dental alveolus|alveolus]], or \"socket\". Lying over the bone is the [[gingiva]] or gum, which is readily visible in the mouth.\n\n===Periodontal ligaments===\nThe [[periodontal ligament]] is a specialized [[connective tissue]] that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers the root of the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15\u20130.38mm, but this size decreases over time.<ref name=\"Cate256\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=256}}</ref> The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and [[Bone resorption|resorption]] of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and [[epithelial cell rests of Malassez]].<ref name=\"Cate260\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=260}}</ref> Consisting of mostly Type I and III [[collagen]], the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location.

An area of bone receiving [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] from periodontal ligaments attached to a tooth moving away from it has a high number of osteoblasts, resulting in bone formation.\n\n===Gingiva===\nThe [[gingiva]] (\"gums\") is the [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] tissue that overlays the jaws. There are three different types of epithelium associated with the gingiva: gingival, junctional, and sulcular epithelium. These three types form from a mass of epithelial cells known as the epithelial cuff between the tooth and the mouth.<ref name=\"Cate247and248\">{{harvnb|Cate|1998|pages=247 and 248}}</ref> The gingival epithelium is not associated directly with tooth attachment and is visible in the mouth.

[[Saliva]] gradually neutralises the [[acid]]s which cause the pH of the tooth surface to rise above the critical pH, typically considered to be 5.5. This causes '[[remineralisation]]', the return of the dissolved minerals to the enamel. If there is sufficient time between the intake of foods then the impact is limited and the teeth can repair themselves. Saliva is unable to penetrate through plaque, however, to neutralize the acid produced by the bacteria.\n\n===Caries (cavities)===\n[[File:Toothdecay.png|right|thumb|150px|Advanced tooth decay on a premolar]]\n{{Main|Dental caries}}\nDental caries (cavities), described as \"tooth decay\", is an infectious disease which damages the structures of teeth.<ref name=\"medline\">[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001055.htm Dental Cavities], ''MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia''.</ref> The disease can lead to [[pain]], [[tooth loss]], and infection.

It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove [[Calculus (dental)|tartar]] (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful [[tooth brushing|brushing]] and [[Dental Floss|flossing]]. Professional cleaning includes [[tooth scaling]], using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.\n\nThe purpose of cleaning teeth is to remove plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria.<ref>[http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html Introduction to Dental Plaque] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094040/http://www.dentistry.leeds.ac.uk/OROFACE/PAGES/micro/micro2.html |date=2011-08-27 }}. Leeds Dental Institute.</ref> Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) in order to prevent formation of plaque and tartar.<ref name=\"adaoralhealth\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080222223237/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/cleaning.asp Oral Health Topics: Cleaning your teeth and gums]. American Dental Association.</ref> A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain oral hygiene. When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the [[gum line]], where [[periodontal disease]] often begins and could develop caries.\n\nElectric toothbrushes are a popular aid to oral hygiene. A user without disabilities, with proper training in manual brushing, and with good motivation, can achieve standards of oral hygiene at least as satisfactory as the best electric brushes, but untrained users rarely achieve anything of the kind. Not all electric toothbrushes are equally effective and even a good design needs to be used properly for best effect, but: \"Electric toothbrushes tend to help people who are not as good at cleaning teeth and as a result have had oral hygiene problems.\" <ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2679175.stm Thumbs down for electric toothbrush], BBC News, January 21, 2003.</ref> The most important advantage of electric toothbrushes is their ability to aid people with dexterity difficulties, such as those associated with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].\n\n===Protective treatments===\n[[Fluoride therapy]] is often recommended to protect against dental caries. [[Water fluoridation]] and [[fluoride]] supplements decrease the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride helps prevent dental decay by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals in enamel.<ref>{{harvnb|Cate|1998|page=223}}</ref> The incorporated fluoride makes enamel more resistant to demineralization and thus more resistant to decay.<ref name = \"ross453\"/> Topical fluoride, such as a fluoride [[toothpaste]] or [[mouthwash]], is also recommended to protect teeth surfaces. Many dentists include application of topical fluoride solutions as part of routine cleanings.\n\n[[Dental sealant]]s are another preventive therapy often used to provide a barrier to bacteria and decay on the surface of teeth. Sealants can last up to ten years and are primarily used on the biting surfaces of molars of children and young adults, especially those who may have difficulty brushing and flossing effectively. Sealants are applied in a dentist's office, sometimes by a dental hygienist, in a procedure similar in technique and cost to a fluoride application.\n\n==Restorations==\n[[File:dent,tooth,zub.jpg|right|thumb|A restored premolar]]\nAfter a tooth has been damaged or destroyed, [[Dental restoration|restoration]] of the missing structure can be achieved with a variety of treatments. Restorations may be created from a variety of [[Dental restorative materials|materials]], including [[Glass ionomer cement|glass ionomer]], [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[gold]], [[Dental porcelain|porcelain]], and [[Dental composite|composite]].<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090830062420/http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fillings.asp Oral Health Topics: Dental Filling Options]\". ada.org.</ref> Small restorations placed inside a tooth are referred to as \"intracoronal restorations\". These restorations may be formed directly in the mouth or may be cast using the [[lost-wax casting|lost-wax technique]], such as for some [[inlays and onlays]].

Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or only a [[removable partial denture|partial]] number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants may be used as support.<ref name=\"aaomsimplants\">\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20060925181506/http://www.aaoms.org/dental_implants.php Dental Implants]\", American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.</ref>\n\n==Abnormalities==\n[[File:Fracturedtooth.jpg|thumb|A broken upper front tooth showing the pink of the pulp]]\nTooth abnormalities may be categorized according to whether they have environmental or developmental causes.<ref name=\"neville50\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=50.}}</ref> While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may not appear to be any known cause for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.\n\n===Environmental===\n\n==== Alteration during tooth development ====\nTooth abnormalities caused by environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. [[Enamel hypoplasia]] is a condition in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate.<ref>{{harvnb|Ash|2003|page=31}}</ref> This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency than the rest of the tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color.

In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis.<ref name=NIH /> Enamel hypoplasia resulting from [[syphilis]] is frequently referred to as [[Hutchinson's teeth]], which is considered one part of [[Hutchinson's triad]].<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/syphilis/DS00374/DSECTION=6 Syphilis: Complications], Mayo Clinic.</ref> [[Turner's hypoplasia]] is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from [[antineoplastic]] therapy.\n\n====Destruction after development====\nTooth destruction from processes other than [[dental caries]] is considered a normal physiologic process but may become severe enough to become a pathologic condition. [[Attrition (dental)|Attrition]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from opposing teeth.<ref>\"[http://www.adha.org/CE_courses/course9/loss_of_structure.htm Loss of Tooth Structure]\", American Dental Hygiene Association.</ref> Attrition initially affects the enamel and, if unchecked, may proceed to the underlying dentin. [[Abrasion (dental)|Abrasion]] is the loss of tooth structure by mechanical forces from a foreign element.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20100801114913/http://dentistry.umkc.edu/practition/assets/AbnormalitiesofTeeth.pdf Abnormalities of Teeth]\", University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Dentistry.</ref> If this force begins at the cementoenamel junction, then progression of tooth loss can be rapid since enamel is very thin in this region of the tooth. A common source of this type of tooth wear is excessive force when using a toothbrush. [[Erosion (dental)|Erosion]] is the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution by acids not of bacterial origin.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |pmid=15055615 |year=2003 |last1=Yip |first1=KH |last2=Smales |first2=RJ |last3=Kaidonis |first3=JA |title=The diagnosis and control of extrinsic acid erosion of tooth substance |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=350\u20133; quiz 354 |journal=General Dentistry |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907094153/http://www.agd.org/library/2003/aug/200308_yip.pdf |archivedate=September 7, 2006 }}</ref> Signs of tooth destruction from erosion is a common characteristic in the mouths of people with [[bulimia]] since [[vomiting]] results in exposure of the teeth to gastric acids. Another important source of erosive acids are from frequent sucking of [[lemon juice]]. [[Abfraction]] is the loss of tooth structure from flexural forces. As teeth flex under [[pressure]], the arrangement of teeth touching each other, known as [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusion]], causes [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] on one side of the tooth and [[compression (physical)|compression]] on the other side of the tooth. This is believed to cause V-shaped depressions on the side under tension and C-shaped depressions on the side under compression. When tooth destruction occurs at the roots of teeth, the process is referred to as [[internal resorption]], when caused by cells within the pulp, or [[external resorption]], when caused by cells in the periodontal ligament.\n\n====Discoloration====\n{{Main|Tooth discoloration}}\n[[File:Tired teeth.jpg|thumb|Discolored teeth]]\nDiscoloration of teeth may result from bacteria stains, tobacco, tea, coffee, foods with an abundance of [[chlorophyll]], restorative materials, and medications.<ref name=\"neville63\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page= 63}}</ref> Stains from bacteria may cause colors varying from green to black to orange. Green stains also result from foods with chlorophyll or excessive exposure to copper or nickel. Amalgam, a common dental restorative material, may turn adjacent areas of teeth black or gray. Long term use of [[chlorhexidine]], a mouthwash, may encourage extrinsic stain formation near the gingiva on teeth. This is usually easy for a hygienist to remove. Systemic disorders also can cause tooth discoloration. [[Congenital erythropoietic porphyria]] causes [[porphyrin]]s to be deposited in teeth, causing a red-brown coloration. Blue discoloration may occur with [[alkaptonuria]] and rarely with [[Parkinson's disease]]. [[Erythroblastosis fetalis]] and [[biliary atresia]] are diseases which may cause teeth to appear green from the deposition of [[biliverdin]]. Also, trauma may change a tooth to a pink, yellow, or dark gray color. Pink and red discolorations are also associated in patients with [[leprosy|lepromatous leprosy]]. Some medications, such as [[tetracycline]] antibiotics, may become incorporated into the structure of a tooth, causing intrinsic staining of the teeth.\n\n====Alteration of eruption====\nTooth eruption may be altered by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth is said to be [[Wisdom teeth#Impaction|impacted]]. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth.<ref name=\"neville66\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=66}}</ref> Other causes may be [[tumor]]s, [[cyst]]s, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. [[Tooth ankylosis]] occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of having it replaced by a permanent one.\n\nA technique for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by [[orthodontist]]s who wish to delay or speed up the eruption of certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches \u2153 of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if the roots of the permanent tooth are more than \u2154 complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between \u2153 and \u2154, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.\n\n===Developmental===\n\n==== Abnormality in number ====\n* [[Anodontia]] is the total lack of tooth development.\n* [[Hyperdontia]] is the presence of a higher-than-normal number of teeth.\n* [[Hypodontia]] is the lack of development of one or more teeth.\n** Oligodontia may be used to describe the absence of 6 or more teeth.\nSome systemic disorders which may result in hyperdontia include [[Apert syndrome]], [[cleidocranial dysostosis]], [[Crouzon syndrome]], [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]], [[Gardner's syndrome]], and [[Sturge\u2013Weber syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville70\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=70}}</ref> Some systemic disorders which may result in hypodontia include Crouzon syndrome, [[Ectodermal dysplasia]], Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, and [[Gorlin syndrome]].<ref name=\"neville69\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=69}}</ref>\n\n====Abnormality in size====\n* [[Microdontia]] is a condition where teeth are smaller than the usual size.\n* [[Macrodontia (tooth)|Macrodontia]] is where teeth are larger than the usual size.\n\nMicrodontia of a single tooth is more likely to occur in a [[maxillary lateral incisor]]. The second most likely tooth to have microdontia are [[wisdom teeth|third molars]]. Macrodontia of all the teeth is known to occur in [[Gigantism|pituitary gigantism]] and [[Pineal gland|pineal]] [[hyperplasia]]. It may also occur on one side of the face in cases of [[hemifacial hyperplasia]].\n\n====Abnormality in shape====\n[[File:Milk.teeth.fusion.jpg|thumb|The fusion of two deciduous teeth]]\n* [[Tooth Gemination|Gemination]] occurs when a developing tooth incompletely splits into the formation of two teeth.\n* [[Tooth fusion|Fusion]] is the union of two adjacent teeth during development.\n* [[Concrescence]] is the fusion of two separate teeth only in their cementum.\n* Accessory [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusps]] are additional cusps on a tooth and may manifest as a [[Talon cusp]], [[Cusp of Carabelli]], or [[Dens evaginatus]].\n* [[Dens invaginatus]], also called Dens in dente, is a deep invagination in a tooth causing the appearance of a tooth within a tooth.\n* [[Ectopic enamel]] is enamel found in an unusual location, such as the root of a tooth.\n* [[Taurodontism]] is a condition where the body of the tooth and pulp chamber is enlarged, and is associated with [[Klinefelter syndrome]], [[Tricho-dento-osseous syndrome]], [[Triple X syndrome]], and [[XYY syndrome]].<ref name = \"neville85\"/>\n* [[Hypercementosis]] is excessive formation of cementum, which may result from trauma, inflammation, [[acromegaly]], [[rheumatic fever]], and [[Paget's disease of bone]].<ref name=\"neville85\">{{harvnb|Neville|2002|page=85}}</ref>\n* A [[dilaceration]] is a bend in the root which may have been caused by trauma to the tooth during formation.\n* [[Supernumerary roots]] is the presence of a greater number of roots on a tooth than expected\n\n==== Cleft lip and palate and association with dental anomalies ====\nThere are many types of dental anomalies seen in cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients. Both sets of dentition may be affected however they are commonly seen in the affected side. Most frequently, missing teeth, supernumerary or discoloured teeth can be seen however enamel dysplasia, discolouration and delayed root development is also common. In children with cleft lip and palate, the lateral incisor in the alveolar cleft region has the highest prevalence of dental developmental disorders.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Tortora C, Meazzini MC, Garattini G, Brusati R|date=March 2008|title=Prevalence of abnormalities in dental structure, position and eruption pattern in population of unilateral and bilateral cleft lip and palate patients|pmid=18333651|doi=10.1597/06-218.1|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|volume=45|issue=2|pages=154\u2013162}}</ref> This is important to consider in order to correctly plan treatment keeping in mind considerations for function and aesthetics. By correctly coordinating management invasive treatment procedures can be prevented resulting in successful and conservative treatment.\n\nThere have been a plethora of research studies to calculate prevalence of certain dental anomalies in CLP populations however a variety of results have been obtained.\n\nIn a study evaluating dental anomalies in Brazilian cleft patients, male patients had a higher incidence of CLP, agenesis, and supernumerary teeth than did female patients. In cases of complete CLP, the left maxillary lateral incisor was the most commonly absent tooth. Supernumerary teeth were typically located distal to the cleft.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Characteristics and distribution of dental anomalies in a Brazilian cleft population|author1=Luciane Macedo de Menezes |author2=Susana Maria Deon Rizzatto |author3=Fabiane Azeredo |author4=Diogo Antunes Vargas|journal=Revista Odonto Ci\u00eancia|volume=25|issue=2|pages=137\u2013141 |year=2010|doi=10.1590/S1980-65232010000200006|doi-access=free}}</ref> In a study of Jordanian subjects, the prevalence of dental anomaly was higher in CLP patients than in normal subjects. Missing teeth were observed in 66.7% of patients, with maxillary lateral incisor as the most frequently affected tooth. Supernumerary teeth were observed in 16.7% of patients; other findings included microdontia (37%), taurodontism (70.5%), transposition or ectopic teeth (30.8%), dilacerations (19.2%), and hypoplasia (30.8%). The incidence of microdontia, dilaceration, and hypoplasia was significantly higher in bilateral CLP patients than in unilateral CLP patients, and none of the anomalies showed any significant sexual dimorphism.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Al Jamal GA, Hazza'a AM, Rawashdeh MA|year=2010|title=Prevalence of dental anomalies in a population of cleft lip and palate patients|journal=The Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Journal|volume=47|issue=4|pages=413\u2013420|doi=10.1597/08-275.1|pmid=    20590463}}</ref>\n\nIt is therefore evident that patients with cleft lip and palate may present with a variety of dental anomalies. It is essential to assess the patient both clinically and radiographically in order to correctly treat and prevent progression of any dental problems. It is also useful to note that patients with a cleft lip and palate automatically score a 5 on the IOTN ( index for orthodontic need) and therefore are eligible for orthodontic treatment, liaising with an orthodontist is vital in order coordinate and plan treatment successfully.\n\n====Abnormality in structure====\n* [[Amelogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which enamel does not form properly or at all.<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=amelogenesisimperfecta Amelogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentinogenesis imperfecta]] is a condition in which dentin does not form properly and is sometimes associated with [[osteogenesis imperfecta]].<ref>[http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition=dentinogenesisimperfecta Dentinogenesis imperfecta], Genetics Home Reference, a service of the U.S. National Library of Medicine.</ref>\n* [[Dentin dysplasia]] is a disorder in which the roots and pulp of teeth may be affected.\n* [[Regional odontodysplasia]] is a disorder affecting enamel, dentin, and pulp and causes the teeth to appear \"ghostly\" on radiographs.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Cho, Shiu-yin|url=http://www.cda-adc.ca/jcda/vol-72/issue-8/vol72_issue8.pdf |title=Conservative Management of Regional Odontodysplasia: Case Report|volume=72|issue =8|pages=735\u20138|pmid=17049109|year=2006|journal=J Can Dent Assoc}}</ref>\n* [[Diastema]] is a condition in which there is a gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of teeth.<ref>''ASDC Journal of Dentistry for Children, Volume 48''.
