Its capital is [[Hartford]] and its most populous city is [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]. It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states. It is known as the \"Constitution State\", the \"Nutmeg State\", the \"Provisions State\", and the \"Land of Steady Habits\".<ref name=\"SOTS\" /> It was influential in development of the federal government of the United States (see [[Connecticut Compromise]]).\n\nThe Connecticut River, [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]], and ports along Long Island Sound have given Connecticut a strong maritime tradition which continues today. The state also has a long history of hosting the financial services industry, including insurance companies in Hartford and hedge funds in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]].\n\n==Geography==\n\n{{Main|Geology of Connecticut}}\n{{Further|Geology of New England}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landmarks and cities of Connecticut\" widths=\"120\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:BridgeportCityHall.jpg|[[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\nFile:New Haven from East Rock.jpg|[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]\nFile:Hartford Connecticut Skyline.JPG|[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]\nFile:StamfordCTRRstaLookingNE11112007.jpg|[[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]]\nFile:NewLondon 2016 Cropped.jpg|[[New London, Connecticut|New London]]\nFile:Willimantic.JPG|[[Willimantic, Connecticut|Willimantic]]\nFile:Amtrak's Thames River Bridge.jpg|[[Gold Star Bridge]] and [[Amtrak Thames River Bridge]]\nFile:Highest Point here.JPG|[[Mount Frissell]] is the highest point in the state.\nFile:LakeMcdonoughFromTunxisTrail.jpg|[[Barkhamsted, Connecticut#Notable locations|Lake McDonough]] reservoir\nFile:NASACandlewoodLakeConnecticut.jpg|[[Candlewood Lake]], Connecticut's largest\nFile:Connecticut River, Connecticut LCCN2012631727.tif|The [[Connecticut River]] near [[Connecticut Route 82]]\n</gallery>\n\nConnecticut is bordered on the south by [[Long Island Sound]], on the west by [[New York (state)|New York]], on the north by [[Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Rhode Island]]. The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton).

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>\n\nThere are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs.

All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/>\n\n===Legislative===\n\nThe legislature is the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The General Assembly is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name=\"AboutCT\"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides.

It is part of New England, although portions of it are often grouped with New York and [[New Jersey]] as the [[tri-state area]]. The state is named for the [[Connecticut River]] which approximately bisects the state. The word \"Connecticut\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] word for \"long tidal river\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Trumbull|first=James Hammond|title=Indian Names of Places, Etc., in and on the Borders of Connecticut: With Interpretations of Some of Them|year=1881 |location=Harford, Connecticut |publisher=Press of the Case, Lockwood & Brainard Company |url={{google books|JS8TAAAAYAAJ|plainurl=yes|page=60}} |page=60}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut's first European settlers were Dutchmen who established a small, short-lived settlement called [[Fort Hoop]] in Hartford at the confluence of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park]] and Connecticut Rivers. Half of Connecticut was initially part of the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River]]s, although the first major settlements were established in the 1630s by the English. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and founded the [[Connecticut Colony]]; other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]. The Connecticut and New Haven colonies established documents of [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]], considered the first constitutions in America. In 1662, the three colonies were merged under a royal charter, making Connecticut a [[crown colony]]. This was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] which rejected British rule in the [[American Revolution]].\n\nConnecticut is the third smallest state by area,<ref name=\"census table 18\">{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 18, Area Measurements: 2010; and Population and Housing Unit Density: 1990 to 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=41 |access-date=May 16, 2014}}</ref> the 29th most populous,<ref>{{cite report |url = https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf |title=Table 19, Population by Urban and Rural and Type of Urban Area: 2010 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=September 2012 |work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts |page=42 |access-date=May 16, 2014 }}</ref> and the fourth most densely populated<ref name=\"census table 18\" /> of the fifty states.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. Connecticut is slightly larger than the country of [[Montenegro]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut.\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|upright=1.25|thumb| ]]\n\nThe highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42\u00b03\u2032 N, 73\u00b029\u2032 W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts}}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than 20 feet (6 m) above sea level.\n\nConnecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history\u2014yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the \"race\" near Rhode Island). This situation provides many safe harbors from ocean storms, and many transatlantic ships seek anchor inside Long Island Sound when [[tropical cyclones]] pass off the upper East Coast.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.\n\n{{further|List of Connecticut rivers}}\n\nConnecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]], such as the Litchfield Green, Lebanon Green (the largest in New England), Milford Green (second largest in New England) and Wethersfield Green (the oldest in the state). Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.\n\nThe northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archivedate=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's \"Panhandle\" |website=Connecticut State Library |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archivedate=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n{{further|Connecticut panhandle}}\n\nAreas maintained by the [[National Park Service]] include [[Appalachian National Scenic Trail]], [[Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley National Heritage Corridor]], and [[Weir Farm National Historic Site]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecticut |website=National Park Service |accessdate=July 15, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ct/index.htm}}</ref>\n\n{{Rivers of Connecticut}}\n{{Mountains of Connecticut}}\n{{Waterbodies of Connecticut}}\n{{Islands and Peninsulas of Connecticut}}\n\n===Climate===\n\n[[File:Connecticut K\u00f6ppen.png|upright=1.35|thumb|left|K\u00f6ppen climate types in Connecticut]]\n[[File:Barndoor Hills original.JPG|thumb|Scenery upon [[Barndoor Hills]] in [[Granby, Connecticut|Granby]] in autumn]]\n[[File:Stamford Harbor Point Marina.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Harbor Point Marina in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] during summer]]\n\nConnecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the temperate zone (or [[subtropical]] in some climate classifications). Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix or rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].\n\nConnecticut sees a fairly even precipitation pattern with rainfall/snowfall spread throughout the 12 months. Connecticut averages 56% of possible sunshine (higher than the U.S. national average), averaging 2,400 hours of [[sunshine]] annually.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |title=United States Annual Sunshine Map |website=HowStuffWorks |access-date=March 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429042722/http://maps.howstuffworks.com/united-states-annual-sunshine-map.htm |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nEarly spring (April) can range from slightly cool (40s to low 50s F) to warm (65 to 70 F), while mid and late spring (late April/May) is warm. By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state, with average highs in New London of {{convert|81|F|C}} and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut. Although summers are sunny in Connecticut, quick moving summer thunderstorms can bring brief downpours with thunder and lightning. Occasionally these thunderstorms can be severe, and the state usually averages one tornado per year.<ref name=\"tornadoes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|title=Annual average number of tornadoes|publisher=NOAA National Climatic Data Center|format=[[GIF]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030012752/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif|archive-date=October 30, 2008|url-status=|access-date=June 2, 2019}}</ref> During hurricane season, the remains of tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region, though a direct hit is rare.\n\nWeather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s \u00baF for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.\n\nWinters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania\u2013Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Snow usually falls from late November to late March in the northern part of the state, and from early December to mid-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.\n\nConnecticut's record high temperature is {{convert|106|F|C}} which occurred in [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]] on July 15, 1995; the record low is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which occurred in the Northwest Hills [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/scec/getextreme.php?elem=ALL&state=CT| title = All-Time Climate Extremes for CT|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|Monthly normal high and low temperatures for various Connecticut cities (\u00b0F)\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; color:#000;\"| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Bridgeport\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0ff; color:#000;\"| 37/23\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0fe; color:#000;\"| 40/25\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffae; color:#000;\"| 47/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff5e; color:#000;\"| 58/41\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f1; color:#000;\"| 68/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 77/60\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#7f0; color:#000;\"| 82/66\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#6eff00; color:#000;\"| 81/65\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#3f0; color:#000;\"| 74/58\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff2f; color:#000;\"| 63/46\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff7b; color:#000;\"| 53/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffd4; color:#000;\"| 42/28\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; color:#000; height:16px;\"| Hartford\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00d9ff; color:#000;\"| 35/16\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00f7ff; color:#000;\"| 39/19\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ffc3; color:#000;\"| 47/27\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff62; color:#000;\"| 59/38\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff08; color:#000;\"| 70/48\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#4f0; color:#000;\"| 79/57\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#73ff00; color:#000;\"| 84/63\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#62ff00; color:#000;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#1aff00; color:#000;\"| 74/51\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00ff48; color:#000;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#0f9; color:#000;\"| 52/32\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00fff7; color:#000;\"| 40/22\n|-\n| colspan=\"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\"|<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Bridgeport, CT |publisher = [[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/06604 |title=Monthly Averages for Hartford, CT |publisher=[[The Weather Channel]] |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===Flora===\n\n{{main|Flora of Connecticut}}\n{{see also|List of Connecticut tree species}}\n\nForests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of Oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state.

The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.\n\nThe nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638\u201339. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.\n\nSeparate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.\n\n===Executive===\n\nThe governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2019}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | accessdate=October 25, 2015}}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut.

The governor can veto the bill, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in each house. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years.

Resultant [[employment reference]]s, compared to a standard military conscription reference, among many [[blue-collar worker|blue-]] and [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] employers, outside of mining, tended to regarded as slightly inferior. Many of the early intake were not released from service until well over two years after the [[Second World War]] ended; others, especially those who integrated into mining communities with sufficient demand were offered, and accepted, continued work in the [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|country's coal mining industry]].\n[[File:Bevin Boy- Mining Training at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945 D23736.jpg|thumb|Bevin Boys receiving training from an experienced miner at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945]]\n\n==Creation of programme==\nThe programme was named after [[Ernest Bevin]], a former [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] official and then [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] politician who was [[Minister of Labour and National Service]] in the wartime coalition government. At the beginning of the war the Government, underestimating the value of strong younger coal miners, conscripted them into the armed forces. By mid-1943 the coal mines had lost 36,000&nbsp;workers, and they were generally not replaced, because other likely young men were also being conscripted to the armed forces. The government made a plea to men liable to conscription, asking them to volunteer to work in the mines, instead, but few responded, and the manpower shortage continued.\n\nBy October 1943 Britain was becoming desperate for a continued supply of coal, both for the industrial war effort and for keeping homes warm throughout the winter. On 12 October [[Gwilym Lloyd George]], [[Minister of Fuel and Power]], announced in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that some conscripts would be directed to the mines. On 2 December Ernest Bevin explained the scheme in more detail. The colloquial name \"Bevin Boys\" came from a further speech Bevin made:\n\n''{{quote|We need 720,000 men continuously employed in this industry. This is where you boys come in. Our fighting men will not be able to achieve their purpose unless we get an adequate supply of coal.}}''\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945 one in ten of young men called up was sent to work in the mines. This caused a deal of upset, as many young men wanted to join the fighting forces and felt that as miners they would not be valued. Many Bevin Boys suffered taunts as they wore no uniform, and there were accusations by some people that they were deliberately avoiding military conscription.\n\n==Programme==\n\n===Selection of conscripts===\nTo make the process random, one of Bevin's secretaries each week, from 14 December 1943, pulled a digit from a hat containing all ten digits, 0\u20139, and all men liable for call-up that week whose National Service registration number ended in that digit were directed to work in the mines, with the exception of any selected for highly skilled war work such as flying planes and in submarines, and men found physically unfit for mining. Conscripted miners came from many different trades and professions, from desk work to heavy manual labour, and included some who might otherwise have become [[commissioned officer]]s.\n\n===Working conditions===\n[[File:Bevin Boy- Mining Training at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945 D23732.jpg|thumb|A classroom lecture where Bevin Boys are learning about the [[Davy lamp]] at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in February 1945]]\nBoys when they were nearly 18 years old received an official [[postcard]] instructing them in five days time to report to a training centre such as at [[Cresswell, Derbyshire|Cresswell Colliery]], Derbyshire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interview 29 August 2019 with ex-Bevin Boy Kenneth Jones born 1926.</ref>\n\nThe Bevin Boys were first given six weeks' training (four off-site, two on). The work was typical coal mining, largely a mile or more down dark, dank tunnels, and conscripts were supplied with helmets and steel-capped safety boots. Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the oldest clothes they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.<ref>Called Up Sent Down : The Bevin Boys' War \u2013 Tom Hickman Pub. The History Press 2008 {{ISBN|0-7509-4547-8}}</ref>\n\nSince a number of [[conscientious objectors]] were sent to work down the mines as an alternative to military service (under a system wholly separate from the Bevin Boy programme), there was sometimes an assumption that Bevin Boys were \"Conchies\". The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War.

Resultant [[employment reference]]s, compared to a standard military conscription reference, among many [[blue-collar worker|blue-]] and [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] employers, outside of mining, tended to regarded as slightly inferior. Many of the early intake were not released from service until well over two years after the [[Second World War]] ended; others, especially those who integrated into mining communities with sufficient demand were offered, and accepted, continued work the [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|country's coal mining industry]].\n[[File:Bevin Boy- Mining Training at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945 D23736.jpg|thumb|Bevin Boys receiving training from an experienced miner at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945]]\n\n==Creation of programme==\nThe programme was named after [[Ernest Bevin]], a former [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] official and then [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] politician who was [[Minister of Labour and National Service]] in the wartime coalition government. At the beginning of the war the Government, underestimating the value of strong younger coal miners, conscripted them into the armed forces. By mid-1943 the coal mines had lost 36,000&nbsp;workers, and they were generally not replaced, because other likely young men were also being conscripted to the armed forces. The government made a plea to men liable to conscription, asking them to volunteer to work in the mines, instead, but few responded, and the manpower shortage continued.\n\nBy October 1943 Britain was becoming desperate for a continued supply of coal, both for the industrial war effort and for keeping homes warm throughout the winter. On 12 October [[Gwilym Lloyd George]], [[Minister of Fuel and Power]], announced in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that some conscripts would be directed to the mines. On 2 December Ernest Bevin explained the scheme in more detail. The colloquial name \"Bevin Boys\" came from a further speech Bevin made:\n\n''{{quote|We need 720,000 men continuously employed in this industry. This is where you boys come in. Our fighting men will not be able to achieve their purpose unless we get an adequate supply of coal.}}''\n\nFrom 1943 to 1945 one in ten of young men called up was sent to work in the mines. This caused a deal of upset, as many young men wanted to join the fighting forces and felt that as miners they would not be valued. Many Bevin Boys suffered taunts as they wore no uniform, and there were accusations by some people that they were deliberately avoiding military conscription.\n\n==Programme==\n\n===Selection of conscripts===\nTo make the process random, one of Bevin's secretaries each week, from 14 December 1943, pulled a digit from a hat containing all ten digits, 0\u20139, and all men liable for call-up that week whose National Service registration number ended in that digit were directed to work in the mines, with the exception of any selected for highly skilled war work such as flying planes and in submarines, and men found physically unfit for mining. Conscripted miners came from many different trades and professions, from desk work to heavy manual labour, and included some who might otherwise have become [[commissioned officer]]s.\n\n===Working conditions===\n[[File:Bevin Boy- Mining Training at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, February 1945 D23732.jpg|thumb|A classroom lecture where Bevin Boys are learning about the [[Davy lamp]] at Ollerton, Nottinghamshire, in February 1945]]\nBoys when they were nearly 18 years old received an official [[postcard]] instructing them in five days time to report to a training centre such as at [[Cresswell, Derbyshire|Cresswell Colliery]], Derbyshire.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Interview 29 August 2019 with ex-Bevin Boy Kenneth Jones born 1926.</ref>\n\nThe Bevin Boys were first given six weeks' training (four off-site, two on). The work was typical coal mining, largely a mile or more down dark, dank tunnels, and conscripts were supplied with helmets and steel-capped safety boots. Bevin Boys did not wear uniforms or badges, but the oldest clothes they could find. Being of military age and without uniform caused many to be stopped by police and questioned about avoiding call-up.<ref>Called Up Sent Down : The Bevin Boys' War \u2013 Tom Hickman Pub.

The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys.

His maternal great-grandmother, Hester Argo, had escaped from [[Saint-Domingue]] (today [[Haiti]]) during the revolutionary upheaval in 1802, along with her three young children, including James' grandfather Stephen Dillet (1797\u20131880). Although originally headed to Cuba, their boat was intercepted by privateers and they were taken to Nassau, where they permanently settled. In 1833 Stephen Dillet became the first man of color to win election to the Bahamian legislature (ref: James Weldon Johnson, ''Along This Way,'' his autobiography).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Book of American Negro Poetry|last=Weldon|first=James|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2016|isbn=1539030962|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nJames' brother was [[John Rosamond Johnson]], who became a [[composer]]. The boys were first educated by their mother, a musician and a public school teacher, before attending [[Edwin M. Stanton School (Jacksonville, Florida)|Edwin M. Stanton School]]. Their mother imparted to them her great love and knowledge of English literature and the European tradition in music.<ref name=\"gates\"/>  At the age of 16, Johnson enrolled at [[Atlanta University]], a [[historically black college]], from which he graduated in 1894. In addition to his studies for the bachelor's degree, he also completed some graduate coursework.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/harmon/johnharm.htm |title=James Weldon Johnson |work=Harmon Collection |publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>\n\nThe achievement of his father, headwaiter at the St. James Hotel, a luxury establishment built when Jacksonville was one of Florida's first winter resort destinations, inspired young James to pursue a professional career. Molded by the classical education for which Atlanta University was best known, Johnson regarded his academic training as a trust. He knew he was expected to devote himself to helping black people advance. Johnson was a prominent member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.<ref name=\"gates\">{{cite book |title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature |editor-first1=Henry Louis |editor-last1=Gates Jr. |editor-first2=Nellie Y. |editor-last2=McKay |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=2004 |pages=791\u2013792}}</ref>\n\nJohnson and his brother Rosamond moved to [[New York City]] as young men, joining the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South in the first half of the 20th century. They collaborated on songwriting and achieved some success on Broadway in the early 1900s.\n\nOver the next 40 years Johnson served in several public capacities, working in education, the diplomatic corps, and [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|civil rights]] activism. In 1904 he participated in [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s successful presidential campaign. After becoming president, Roosevelt appointed Johnson as [[United States consul]] at [[Puerto Cabello]]. [[Venezuela]] from 1906 to 1908, and to [[Nicaragua]] from 1909 to 1913.\n\nIn 1910, Johnson married [[Grace Nail Johnson|Grace Nail]], whom he had met in New York City several years earlier while working as a songwriter. A cultured and well-educated New Yorker, Grace Nail Johnson later collaborated with her husband on a screenwriting project.<ref name=\"USC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/amlit/johnson/johnson4.html |title=James Weldon Johnson, 1871\u20131938 |website=University of South Carolina}}</ref>\n\nAfter their return to New York from Nicaragua, Johnson became increasingly involved in the [[Harlem Renaissance]], a great flourishing of art and writing. He wrote his own poetry and supported work by others, also compiling and publishing anthologies of spirituals and poetry. Owing to his influence and his innovative poetry, Johnson became a leading voice in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] of the 1920s.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>\n\n==Civil rights activism==\nHe became involved in civil rights activism, especially the campaign to pass the federal [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], as Southern states did not prosecute perpetrators. He was a speaker at the 1919 [[National Conference on Lynching]]. Starting as a field secretary for the [[NAACP]] in 1917, Johnson rose to become one of the most successful officials in the organization. He traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for example, to investigate a brutal lynching that was witnessed by thousands.<ref name=\"southernhollows.com\">[http://www.southernhollows.com/episodes/a-city-suspends-law-enforcement-in-1917-to-execute-a-harrowing-display-of-vengeance Southern Hollows, ''Broad Daylight: A City Suspends Law Enforcement in 1917 to Execute a Harrowing Display of Vengeance ''] Retrieved October 18, 2017.</ref> His report on the carnival-like atmosphere surrounding the burning-to-death of [[Ell Persons]] was published nationally as a supplement to the July 1917 issue of the NAACP's ''Crisis'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1292427315695375.pdf\n|title=Memphis\n|date=July 1917\n|publisher=Supplement to [[The Crisis]]}}</ref> and during his visit there he chartered the Memphis chapter of the NAACP.<ref>[http://www.naacpmemphis.org/history.php NAACP Memphis website, ''Memphis Branch History''] Retrieved October 18, 2017.</ref> His 1920 report about \"the economic corruption, forced labor, press censorship, racial segregation, and wanton violence introduced to Haiti by the US occupation encouraged numerous African Americans to flood the State Department and the offices of Republican Party officials with letters\" calling for an end to the abuses and to remove troops.<ref name=\"byrd\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/20065193/_To_Start_Something_to_Help_These_People_African_American_Women_and_the_Occupation_of_Haiti_1915-1934?auto=download&campaign=weekly_digest |first=Brandon |last=Byrd |title=\"To Start Something to Help These People:\" African American Women and the Occupation of Haiti, 1915\u20131934 |journal=The Journal of Haitian Studies |volume=21 |number=2 |year=2015 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref> The US finally ended its occupation in 1934, long after the threat of Germany in the area had been ended by its defeat in the First World War.\n\nAppointed in 1920 as the first executive secretary of the NAACP, Johnson helped increase membership and extended the movement's reach by organizing numerous new chapters in the South.<ref name=\"oxford\"/> During this period the NAACP was mounting frequent legal challenges to the southern states' [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of African Americans, which had been established at the turn of the century by such legal devices as [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]es, [[literacy test]]s, and [[white primaries]].\n\nJohnson died in 1938 while vacationing in [[Wiscasset, Maine]], when the car his wife was driving was hit by a train.

In 1906, at the young age of 35, he was promoted to principal. In the segregated system, Johnson was paid less than half of what white colleagues earned. He improved black education by adding the [[ninth grade|ninth]] and [[tenth grade]]s to the school, to extend the years of schooling. He later resigned from this job to pursue other goals.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n\nWhile working as a teacher, Johnson also read the law to prepare for the bar. In 1897, he was the first African American admitted to the [[Bar Exam|Florida Bar Exam]] since the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] ended. He was also the first black in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] to seek admission to the state bar. In order to be accepted, Johnson had a two-hour oral examination before three attorneys and a judge. He later recalled that one of the examiners, not wanting to see a black man admitted, left the room.<ref name=\"Levy\" /> Johnson drew on his law background especially during his years as a civil rights activist and leading the NAACP.\n\nIn 1930 at the age of 59, Johnson returned to education after his many years leading the [[NAACP]]. He accepted the Spence Chair of Creative Literature at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The university created the position for him, in recognition of his achievements as a poet, editor, and critic during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. In addition to discussing literature, he lectured on a wide range of issues related to the lives and civil rights of black Americans. He held this position until his death. In 1934 he also was appointed as the first African-American professor at [[New York University]], where he taught several classes in literature and culture.<ref name=\"bobst\"/>\n\n==Music==\n[[File:UnderTheBambooTree1902PurpleMCahill.jpg|thumb|Famously performed in the film ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), the song \"Under the Bamboo Tree\" was written by the Johnson brothers and Bob Cole for the Broadway show ''Sally in Our Alley'' (1902)]]\nAs noted above, in 1901 Johnson had moved to [[New York, New York|New York City]] with his brother [[J. Rosamond Johnson]] to work in [[musical theater]]. They collaborated on such hits as \"Tell Me, Dusky Maiden\" and \"Nobody's Looking but the Owl and the Moon,\" for which Johnson wrote the lyrics and his brother the music. Johnson composed the lyrics of \"[[Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing]]\" to honor renowned educator [[Booker T. Washington]] who was visiting Stanton School, when the poem was recited by 500 school children as a tribute to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s birthday. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://blackexcellence.com/the-story-behind-the-black-national-anthem/ |title=The story behind the Black national anthem |website=Black Excellence}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Be Still, My Soul: The Inspiring Stories behind 175 of the Most-Loved Hymns|last=Petersen|first=Randy|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|year=2014|isbn=9781414379722|location=|pages=}}</ref> This song became widely popular and has become known as the \"Negro National Anthem,\" a title that the [[NAACP]] adopted and promoted.

Johnson proved an effective diplomat in such times of strain.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n\nHis positions also provided time and stimulation to pursue his literary career. He wrote substantial portions of his novel, ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]],'' and his poetry collection, ''Fifty Years,'' during this period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Brian |title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era |year=2013 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |isbn=0813933684 |page=3}}</ref> His poetry was published in major journals such as ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' and in ''The Independent.''<ref name=\"aap\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/72 |title=James Weldon Johnson |website=The Academy of America Poets}}</ref>\n\n==Literary writing==\nJohnson's first success as a writer was the poem \"[[Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing]]\" (1899), which his brother Rosamond set to music; the song became unofficially known as the \"Negro National Anthem.\" During his time in the diplomatic service, Johnson completed what became his most well-known book, ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]],'' which he published anonymously in 1912.

He had a broad appreciation for black artists, musicians and writers, and worked to heighten awareness in the wider society of their creativity. In 1922, he published a landmark anthology ''The Book of American Negro Poetry,'' with a \"Preface\" that celebrated the power of black expressive culture. He compiled and edited the anthology ''The Book of American Negro Spirituals,'' which was published in 1925.\n\nHe continued to publish his own poetry as well. Johnson's collection ''[[God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse]]'' (1927) is considered most important. He demonstrated that black folk life could be the material of serious poetry. He also comments on the violence of racism in poems such as \"Fragment,\" which portrays slavery as against both God's love and God's law.\n\nFollowing the flourishing of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, Johnson reissued his anthology of poetry by black writers, ''The Book of American Negro Poetry,'' in 1931, including many new poets. This established the African-American poetic tradition for a much wider audience and also inspired younger poets.\n\nIn 1930, he published a sociological study, ''Black Manhattan.'' (1930) His ''Negro Americans, What Now?'' (1934) was a book-length address advocating fuller civil rights for African Americans. By this time, tens of thousands of African Americans had left the South for northern and midwestern cities in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], but the majority still lived in the South. There they were politically disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws and white supremacy. Outside the South, many faced discrimination but had more political rights and chances for education and work.\n\n==Film==\n\nAt least one of Mr. Johnson\u2019s works was credited as leading to a movie. \u201cGo Down, Death!\u201d was a Harlemwood Studios production, directed by Spencer Williams. In the film credits, it states, \u201cAlfred N. Sack Reverently Presents....\u201d (the film), with hymns playing in the background.  The film opens:\n\n\u201cForward:\nThis Story of Love and Simple Faith and Triumph of Good Over Evil was inspired by the Poem \u201cGO DOWN, DEATH!\u201d from the Pen of the Celebrated Negro Author James Weldon Johnson, Now of Sainted Memory.\u201d\n\nThe film (recently shown on Turner Classic Movies (January 4, 2020) as a filler piece) featured an all African-American cast, including Myra D. Hemings, Samuel H. James, and Eddie L. Houston, Spencer Williams, and Amos Droughan, among others. It also included a dancing and band sequence, depicting a fun looking, middle class oriented club with drinks and gambling, as its opening backdrop.  \n\n==Civil rights activism==\n[[File:1333 R Street, N.W..JPG|thumb|Johnson lived here in the [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], while serving as national organizer for the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).]]\nWhile attending Atlanta University, Johnson became known as an influential campus speaker. In 1892 he won the Quiz Club Contest in English Composition and Oratory. He founded and edited the ''Daily American'' newspaper in 1895. At a time when southern legislatures were passing laws and constitutions that [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] blacks and [[Jim Crow]] laws to impose racial segregation, the newspaper covered both political and racial topics. It was terminated a year later due to financial difficulty. These early endeavors were the start of Johnson's long period of activism.\n\nIn 1904 he accepted a position as the treasurer of the [[Colored Republican Club]], started by [[Charles W. Anderson]]. A year later he was elected as president of the club. He organized political rallies.<ref name=\"Levy\" /> During 1914 Johnson became editor of the editorial page of the ''[[New York Age]]'', an influential African-American weekly newspaper based in New York City. In the early 20th century, it had supported [[Booker T. Washington]]'s position for racial advancement by industrious work within the racial community, against the arguments of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] for development of a \"[[talented tenth]]\" and political activism to challenge white supremacy. Johnson's writing for the ''Age'' displayed the political gift that soon made him famous.\n\nIn 1916, Johnson started working as a field secretary and organizer for the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which had been founded in 1910. In this role, he built and revived local chapters. Opposing [[race riots]] in northern cities and the [[lynchings]] frequent in the South during and immediately after the end of [[World War I]], Johnson engaged the NAACP in mass demonstrations. He organized a [[Silent Parade|silent protest parade]] of more than 10,000 African Americans down New York City's Fifth Avenue on July 28, 1917 to protest the still-frequent [[lynching]]s of blacks in the South.\n\nSocial tensions erupted after veterans returned from the First World War, and tried to find work. In 1919, Johnson coined the term \"[[Red Summer of 1919|Red Summer]]\" and organized peaceful protests against the white racial violence against blacks that broke out that year in numerous industrial cities of the North and Midwest. There was fierce competition for housing and jobs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Red Summer |first=Alana J. |last=Erickson |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History |year=1960 |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |pages=2293\u20132294 |isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=James Weldon Johnson |first=George P. |last=Cunningham |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History |year=1960 |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |pages=1459\u20131461 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nJohnson traveled to [[Haiti]] to investigate conditions on the island, which had been occupied by [[U.S. Marines]] since 1915, ostensibly because of political unrest. As a result of this trip, Johnson published a series of articles in ''The Nation'' in 1920 in which he described the American occupation as brutal. He offered suggestions for the economic and social development of Haiti. These articles were later collected and reprinted as a book under the title ''Self-Determining Haiti.''<ref name=\"USC\" />\n\nIn 1920 Johnson was chosen as the first black executive secretary of the NAACP, effectively the operating officer position.<ref name=\"gates\"/> He served in this role through 1930. He lobbied for the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]] of 1921, which was passed easily by the House, but repeatedly defeated by the white Southern bloc in the Senate. \n\nThroughout the 1920s, Johnson supported and promoted the [[Harlem Renaissance]], trying to help young black authors to get published. Shortly before his death in 1938, Johnson supported efforts by [[Ignatz Waghalter]], a Polish-Jewish composer who had escaped the [[Nazis]] of Germany, to establish a classical orchestra of African-American musicians.\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n* 1904, Honorary master's degree from Atlanta University.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n* 1925, [[Spingarn Medal]] from the NAACP for outstanding achievement by an American Negro.<ref name=\"Reuben\">{{cite book |last=Reuben |first=Paul P. |url=http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap9/jwjohnson.html |chapter=Chapter 9: James Weldon Johnson (1871-1938) |title=PAL: Perspectives in American Literature: A Research and Reference Guide |publisher=[[California State University, Stanislaus]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302161444/http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap9/jwjohnson.html |archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n* 1928, Harmon Gold Award for ''God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse'' (1927).<ref name=\"Reuben\" />\n* 1929, [[Julius Rosenwald Fund]] Grant.<ref name=\"Reuben\" />\n* 1933, [[W.

He was married to civil rights activist [[Grace Nail Johnson]]. Johnson was a leader of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), where he started working in 1917. In 1920, he was the first African American to be chosen as executive secretary of the organization, effectively the operating officer.<ref name=\"gates\"/> He served in that position from 1920 to 1930. Johnson established his reputation as a writer, and was known during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] for his poems, novels, and anthologies collecting both poems and [[spirituals]] of black culture.\n\nHe was appointed under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as US consul in Venezuela and Nicaragua for most of the period from 1906 to 1913. In 1934 he was the first [[African-American]] professor to be hired at [[New York University]].<ref name=\"bobst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/jwj.htm |title=175 Facts about NYU: James Weldon Johnson |website=New York University |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421035552/http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/arch/175/pages/jwj.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2016}}</ref> Later in life, he was a professor of creative literature and writing at [[Fisk University]], a [[historically black university]].\n\n==Life==\nJohnson was born in 1871 in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], the son of Helen Louise Dillet, a native of [[Nassau, Bahamas]], and James Johnson. His maternal great-grandmother, Hester Argo, had escaped from [[Saint-Domingue]] (today [[Haiti]]) during the revolutionary upheaval in 1802, along with her three young children, including James' grandfather Stephen Dillet (1797\u20131880). Although originally headed to Cuba, their boat was intercepted by privateers and they were taken to Nassau, where they permanently settled. In 1833 Stephen Dillet became the first man of color to win election to the Bahamian legislature (ref: James Weldon Johnson, ''Along This Way,'' his autobiography).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Book of American Negro Poetry|last=Weldon|first=James|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2016|isbn=1539030962|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nJames' brother was [[John Rosamond Johnson]], who became a [[composer]]. The boys were first educated by their mother, a musician and a public school teacher, before attending [[Edwin M. Stanton School (Jacksonville, Florida)|Edwin M. Stanton School]]. Their mother imparted to them her great love and knowledge of English literature and the European tradition in music.<ref name=\"gates\"/>  At the age of 16, Johnson enrolled at [[Atlanta University]], a [[historically black college]], from which he graduated in 1894. In addition to his studies for the bachelor's degree, he also completed some graduate coursework.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/harmon/johnharm.htm |title=James Weldon Johnson |work=Harmon Collection |publisher=Smithsonian Institution}}</ref>\n\nThe achievement of his father, headwaiter at the St. James Hotel, a luxury establishment built when Jacksonville was one of Florida's first winter resort destinations, inspired young James to pursue a professional career. Molded by the classical education for which Atlanta University was best known, Johnson regarded his academic training as a trust. He knew he was expected to devote himself to helping black people advance. Johnson was a prominent member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.<ref name=\"gates\">{{cite book |title=The Norton Anthology of African American Literature |editor-first1=Henry Louis |editor-last1=Gates Jr. |editor-first2=Nellie Y. |editor-last2=McKay |edition=2nd |location=New York |publisher=Norton |year=2004 |pages=791\u2013792}}</ref>\n\nJohnson and his brother Rosamond moved to [[New York City]] as young men, joining the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of the South in the first half of the 20th century. They collaborated on songwriting and achieved some success on Broadway in the early 1900s.\n\nOver the next 40 years Johnson served in several public capacities, working in education, the diplomatic corps, and [[Civil rights movement (1896\u20131954)|civil rights]] activism. In 1904 he participated in [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s successful presidential campaign. After becoming president, Roosevelt appointed Johnson as [[United States consul]] at [[Puerto Cabello]]. [[Venezuela]] from 1906 to 1908, and to [[Nicaragua]] from 1909 to 1913.\n\nIn 1910, Johnson married [[Grace Nail Johnson|Grace Nail]], whom he had met in New York City several years earlier while working as a songwriter. A cultured and well-educated New Yorker, Grace Nail Johnson later collaborated with her husband on a screenwriting project.<ref name=\"USC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sc.edu/library/spcoll/amlit/johnson/johnson4.html |title=James Weldon Johnson, 1871\u20131938 |website=University of South Carolina}}</ref>\n\nAfter their return to New York from Nicaragua, Johnson became increasingly involved in the [[Harlem Renaissance]], a great flourishing of art and writing. He wrote his own poetry and supported work by others, also compiling and publishing anthologies of spirituals and poetry. Owing to his influence and his innovative poetry, Johnson became a leading voice in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] of the 1920s.<ref name=\"oxford\"/>\n\n==Civil rights activism==\nHe became involved in civil rights activism, especially the campaign to pass the federal [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]], as Southern states did not prosecute perpetrators. He was a speaker at the 1919 [[National Conference on Lynching]]. Starting as a field secretary for the [[NAACP]] in 1917, Johnson rose to become one of the most successful officials in the organization. He traveled to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for example, to investigate a brutal lynching that was witnessed by thousands.<ref name=\"southernhollows.com\">[http://www.southernhollows.com/episodes/a-city-suspends-law-enforcement-in-1917-to-execute-a-harrowing-display-of-vengeance Southern Hollows, ''Broad Daylight: A City Suspends Law Enforcement in 1917 to Execute a Harrowing Display of Vengeance ''] Retrieved October 18, 2017.</ref> His report on the carnival-like atmosphere surrounding the burning-to-death of [[Ell Persons]] was published nationally as a supplement to the July 1917 issue of the NAACP's ''Crisis'' magazine,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://library.brown.edu/pdfs/1292427315695375.pdf\n|title=Memphis\n|date=July 1917\n|publisher=Supplement to [[The Crisis]]}}</ref> and during his visit there he chartered the Memphis chapter of the NAACP.<ref>[http://www.naacpmemphis.org/history.php NAACP Memphis website, ''Memphis Branch History''] Retrieved October 18, 2017.</ref> His 1920 report about \"the economic corruption, forced labor, press censorship, racial segregation, and wanton violence introduced to Haiti by the US occupation encouraged numerous African Americans to flood the State Department and the offices of Republican Party officials with letters\" calling for an end to the abuses and to remove troops.<ref name=\"byrd\">{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/20065193/_To_Start_Something_to_Help_These_People_African_American_Women_and_the_Occupation_of_Haiti_1915-1934?auto=download&campaign=weekly_digest |first=Brandon |last=Byrd |title=\"To Start Something to Help These People:\" African American Women and the Occupation of Haiti, 1915\u20131934 |journal=The Journal of Haitian Studies |volume=21 |number=2 |year=2015 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref> The US finally ended its occupation in 1934, long after the threat of Germany in the area had been ended by its defeat in the First World War.\n\nAppointed in 1920 as the first executive secretary of the NAACP, Johnson helped increase membership and extended the movement's reach by organizing numerous new chapters in the South.<ref name=\"oxford\"/> During this period the NAACP was mounting frequent legal challenges to the southern states' [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchisement]] of African Americans, which had been established at the turn of the century by such legal devices as [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]]es, [[literacy test]]s, and [[white primaries]].\n\nJohnson died in 1938 while vacationing in [[Wiscasset, Maine]], when the car his wife was driving was hit by a train.

In 1906, at the young age of 35, he was promoted to principal. In the segregated system, Johnson was paid less than half of what white colleagues earned. He improved black education by adding the [[ninth grade|ninth]] and [[tenth grade]]s to the school, to extend the years of schooling. He later resigned from this job to pursue other goals.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n\nWhile working as a teacher, Johnson also read the law to prepare for the bar. In 1897, he was the first African American admitted to the [[Bar Exam|Florida Bar Exam]] since the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction era]] ended. He was also the first black in [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] to seek admission to the state bar. In order to be accepted, Johnson had a two-hour oral examination before three attorneys and a judge. He later recalled that one of the examiners, not wanting to see a black man admitted, left the room.<ref name=\"Levy\" /> Johnson drew on his law background especially during his years as a civil rights activist and leading the NAACP.\n\nIn 1930 at the age of 59, Johnson returned to education after his many years leading the [[NAACP]]. He accepted the Spence Chair of Creative Literature at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. The university created the position for him, in recognition of his achievements as a poet, editor, and critic during the [[Harlem Renaissance]]. In addition to discussing literature, he lectured on a wide range of issues related to the lives and civil rights of black Americans. He held this position until his death. In 1934 he also was appointed as the first African-American professor at [[New York University]], where he taught several classes in literature and culture.<ref name=\"bobst\"/>\n\n==Music==\n[[File:UnderTheBambooTree1902PurpleMCahill.jpg|thumb|Famously performed in the film ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]]'' (1944), the song \"Under the Bamboo Tree\" was written by the Johnson brothers and Bob Cole for the Broadway show ''Sally in Our Alley'' (1902)]]\nAs noted above, in 1901 Johnson had moved to [[New York, New York|New York City]] with his brother [[J. Rosamond Johnson]] to work in [[musical theater]]. They collaborated on such hits as \"Tell Me, Dusky Maiden\" and \"Nobody's Looking but the Owl and the Moon,\" for which Johnson wrote the lyrics and his brother the music. Johnson composed the lyrics of \"[[Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing]]\" to honor renowned educator [[Booker T. Washington]] who was visiting Stanton School, when the poem was recited by 500 school children as a tribute to [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s birthday. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://blackexcellence.com/the-story-behind-the-black-national-anthem/ |title=The story behind the Black national anthem |website=Black Excellence}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Be Still, My Soul: The Inspiring Stories behind 175 of the Most-Loved Hymns|last=Petersen|first=Randy|publisher=Tyndale House Publishers|year=2014|isbn=9781414379722|location=|pages=}}</ref> This song became widely popular and has become known as the \"Negro National Anthem,\" a title that the [[NAACP]] adopted and promoted.

In 1909, he transferred to [[Corinto, Nicaragua]].<ref name=\"Levy\">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=2380 |title=James Weldon Johnson |encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia}}</ref> During his stay at Corinto, [[Nicaragua#United States intervention (1909\u201333)|a rebellion erupted]] against President [[Adolfo Diaz]]. Johnson proved an effective diplomat in such times of strain.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n\nHis positions also provided time and stimulation to pursue his literary career. He wrote substantial portions of his novel, ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]],'' and his poetry collection, ''Fifty Years,'' during this period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Brian |title=Artistic Ambassadors: Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era |year=2013 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville |isbn=0813933684 |page=3}}</ref> His poetry was published in major journals such as ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' and in ''The Independent.''<ref name=\"aap\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/72 |title=James Weldon Johnson |website=The Academy of America Poets}}</ref>\n\n==Literary writing==\nJohnson's first success as a writer was the poem \"[[Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing]]\" (1899), which his brother Rosamond set to music; the song became unofficially known as the \"Negro National Anthem.\" During his time in the diplomatic service, Johnson completed what became his most well-known book, ''[[The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man]],'' which he published anonymously in 1912. He chose anonymity to avoid any controversy that might endanger his diplomatic career.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Brian Russell |title=Artistic Ambassadors : Literary and International Representation of the New Negro Era |location=Charlottesville |publisher=University of Virginia Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-81393-369-6 |pages=57\u201359}}</ref>  It was not until 1927 that Johnson acknowledged writing the novel, stressing that it was not a work of autobiography but mostly fictional.\n\nIn this period, he also published his first poetry collection, ''Fifty Years and Other Poems'' (1917). It showed his increasing politicization and adoption of the [[African American Vernacular English|black vernacular]] influences that characterize his later work.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=M\u00fcller |first=Timo |title=James Weldon Johnson and the Genteel Tradition |journal=Arizona Quarterly |volume=69 |issue=2 |year=2013 |pages=85\u2013102}}</ref>\n\nJohnson returned to New York, where he was involved in the [[Harlem Renaissance]] of the 1920s. He had a broad appreciation for black artists, musicians and writers, and worked to heighten awareness in the wider society of their creativity. In 1922, he published a landmark anthology ''The Book of American Negro Poetry,'' with a \"Preface\" that celebrated the power of black expressive culture. He compiled and edited the anthology ''The Book of American Negro Spirituals,'' which was published in 1925.\n\nHe continued to publish his own poetry as well. Johnson's collection ''[[God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse]]'' (1927) is considered most important. He demonstrated that black folk life could be the material of serious poetry. He also comments on the violence of racism in poems such as \"Fragment,\" which portrays slavery as against both God's love and God's law.\n\nFollowing the flourishing of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, Johnson reissued his anthology of poetry by black writers, ''The Book of American Negro Poetry,'' in 1931, including many new poets. This established the African-American poetic tradition for a much wider audience and also inspired younger poets.\n\nIn 1930, he published a sociological study, ''Black Manhattan.'' (1930) His ''Negro Americans, What Now?'' (1934) was a book-length address advocating fuller civil rights for African Americans. By this time, tens of thousands of African Americans had left the South for northern and midwestern cities in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], but the majority still lived in the South. There they were politically disenfranchised and subject to Jim Crow laws and white supremacy. Outside the South, many faced discrimination but had more political rights and chances for education and work.\n\n==Film==\n\nAt least one of Mr. Johnson\u2019s works was credited as leading to a movie. \u201cGo Down, Death!\u201d was a Harlemwood Studios production, directed by Spencer Williams. In the film credits, it states, \u201cAlfred N. Sack Reverently Presents....\u201d (the film), with hymns playing in the background.  The film opens:\n\n\u201cForward:\nThis Story of Love and Simple Faith and Triumph of Good Over Evil was inspired by the Poem \u201cGO DOWN, DEATH!\u201d from the Pen of the Celebrated Negro Author James Weldon Johnson, Now of Sainted Memory.\u201d\n\nThe film (recently shown on Turner Classic Movies (January 4, 2020) as a filler piece) featured an all African-American cast, including Myra D. Hemings, Samuel H. James, and Eddie L. Houston, Spencer Williams, and Amos Droughan, among others. It also included a dancing and band sequence, depicting a fun looking, middle class oriented club with drinks and gambling, as its opening backdrop.  \n\n==Civil rights activism==\n[[File:1333 R Street, N.W..JPG|thumb|Johnson lived here in the [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], while serving as national organizer for the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).]]\nWhile attending Atlanta University, Johnson became known as an influential campus speaker. In 1892 he won the Quiz Club Contest in English Composition and Oratory. He founded and edited the ''Daily American'' newspaper in 1895. At a time when southern legislatures were passing laws and constitutions that [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] blacks and [[Jim Crow]] laws to impose racial segregation, the newspaper covered both political and racial topics. It was terminated a year later due to financial difficulty. These early endeavors were the start of Johnson's long period of activism.\n\nIn 1904 he accepted a position as the treasurer of the [[Colored Republican Club]], started by [[Charles W. Anderson]]. A year later he was elected as president of the club. He organized political rallies.<ref name=\"Levy\" /> During 1914 Johnson became editor of the editorial page of the ''[[New York Age]]'', an influential African-American weekly newspaper based in New York City. In the early 20th century, it had supported [[Booker T. Washington]]'s position for racial advancement by industrious work within the racial community, against the arguments of [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] for development of a \"[[talented tenth]]\" and political activism to challenge white supremacy. Johnson's writing for the ''Age'' displayed the political gift that soon made him famous.\n\nIn 1916, Johnson started working as a field secretary and organizer for the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which had been founded in 1910. In this role, he built and revived local chapters. Opposing [[race riots]] in northern cities and the [[lynchings]] frequent in the South during and immediately after the end of [[World War I]], Johnson engaged the NAACP in mass demonstrations. He organized a [[Silent Parade|silent protest parade]] of more than 10,000 African Americans down New York City's Fifth Avenue on July 28, 1917 to protest the still-frequent [[lynching]]s of blacks in the South.\n\nSocial tensions erupted after veterans returned from the First World War, and tried to find work. In 1919, Johnson coined the term \"[[Red Summer of 1919|Red Summer]]\" and organized peaceful protests against the white racial violence against blacks that broke out that year in numerous industrial cities of the North and Midwest. There was fierce competition for housing and jobs.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Red Summer |first=Alana J. |last=Erickson |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History |year=1960 |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |pages=2293\u20132294 |isbn=}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=James Weldon Johnson |first=George P. |last=Cunningham |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History |year=1960 |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |pages=1459\u20131461 |isbn=}}</ref>\n\nJohnson traveled to [[Haiti]] to investigate conditions on the island, which had been occupied by [[U.S. Marines]] since 1915, ostensibly because of political unrest. As a result of this trip, Johnson published a series of articles in ''The Nation'' in 1920 in which he described the American occupation as brutal. He offered suggestions for the economic and social development of Haiti. These articles were later collected and reprinted as a book under the title ''Self-Determining Haiti.''<ref name=\"USC\" />\n\nIn 1920 Johnson was chosen as the first black executive secretary of the NAACP, effectively the operating officer position.<ref name=\"gates\"/> He served in this role through 1930. He lobbied for the [[Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill]] of 1921, which was passed easily by the House, but repeatedly defeated by the white Southern bloc in the Senate. \n\nThroughout the 1920s, Johnson supported and promoted the [[Harlem Renaissance]], trying to help young black authors to get published. Shortly before his death in 1938, Johnson supported efforts by [[Ignatz Waghalter]], a Polish-Jewish composer who had escaped the [[Nazis]] of Germany, to establish a classical orchestra of African-American musicians.\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n* 1904, Honorary master's degree from Atlanta University.<ref name=\"Levy\" />\n* 1925, [[Spingarn Medal]] from the NAACP for outstanding achievement by an American Negro.<ref name=\"Reuben\">{{cite book |last=Reuben |first=Paul P. |url=http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap9/jwjohnson.html |chapter=Chapter 9: James Weldon Johnson (1871-1938) |title=PAL: Perspectives in American Literature: A Research and Reference Guide |publisher=[[California State University, Stanislaus]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302161444/http://www.csustan.edu/english/reuben/pal/chap9/jwjohnson.html |archivedate=March 2, 2014}}</ref>\n* 1928, Harmon Gold Award for ''God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse'' (1927).<ref name=\"Reuben\" />\n* 1929, [[Julius Rosenwald Fund]] Grant.<ref name=\"Reuben\" />\n* 1933, [[W.

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997.

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters.

The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier.

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly \u00a346&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to \u00a31&nbsp;billion\".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}} [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]] stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that [[Tony Blair]]'s legacy appeared to be in decline.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=In Depth BBC Interview: Ken Clarke|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox24s3NylMI&t=1808s|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence. The stamps were therefore to be [[commemorative stamp|commemoratives]], but they were also intended as [[Definitive stamp|definitives]] for regular use over an extended period of time.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe Maltese wanted to issue the new stamps by the time the new parliament was inaugurated on 1 November 1921. There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]]. Caruana Dingli's design was used for ten denominations: the [[Penny|pence]] values ranging from \u00bcd to 6d, and also the highest value of the set, the [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]1. Vella's design was used for the five [[shilling]] values ranging from 1/- to 10/-.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nCaruana Dingli's design depicts [[Melita (personification)|Melita]] as a robed and helmeted figure holding a [[rudder]], representing Malta as being in control of her own destiny.<ref name=\"cbm-bullion\"/> The background contains a seascape, with the lighthouse near [[Fort Saint Elmo]] and a [[Gozo boat]] visible. Shields depicting the [[Union Jack]] and a colonial badge representing Malta are located at the bottom of the design.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nVella's design contains two figures representing Malta and the United Kingdom, Melita and [[Britannia]].

The typographed stamps were printed on chalk-surfaced paper. Each stamp was printed in two operations, with a [[Key type stamp|key plate and a duty plate]]. In most cases each plate was printed in a different colour, but for some of the low values both plates were printed in the same colour.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe [[watermark]] used on the stamps is known as ''Multiple Script CA'', since it consists of the letters \"CA\" (referring to the [[Crown Agents]]) in a script typeface, beneath a representation of the [[Tudor Crown (heraldry)|Tudor crown]], arranged multiple times next to each other. The watermark was sideways for the pence values and upright for the shilling values. The \u00a31 was initially printed with an upright watermark but in 1925 it was also issued with a sideways watermark.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nThe pence values were printed in sheets of 160 stamps (consisting of two panes, each containing 8 rows of 10 stamps, separated by a [[Gutter (philately)|gutter]]), the shilling values were printed in sheets of 80 (one pane of 8 rows of 10 stamps) and the \u00a31 value was printed in sheets of 40 (one pane of 4 rows of 10 stamps).<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The stamps were perforated with [[Perforation gauge|gauge]] 14.2 by 14 comb perforations.<ref name=\"bephila\"/>\n\nA number of [[Die proof (philately)|die proofs]] and plate proofs of stamps from the Melita issue exist. Die proofs are individual prints from the stamps' original [[Die (philately)|die]]s made at various stages of production, and are impressions of either the key die or the duty die of each value, or composite die proofs of both dies together. Plate proofs, which are test printings made from the stamps' printings plates, exist of the \u00bcd, \u00bdd, 1d, 3d and \u00a31 values in unissued colours. A wide range of versions of these exist, either perforated or imperforate, on unwatermarked or watermarked paper, and with or without a [[Specimen stamp|specimen overprint]].

It is believed that only two sheets of the error were printed, and they were allegedly acquired on the first day of issue by Alfredo Caruana Gatto, a [[Maltese Political Union]] politician who was a member of the Senate and who had been Minister for Justice in 1921\u201322. The exact circumstances of their issue remain unclear, and it is not known whether they were acquired over the Post Office counter or not. Caruana Gatto is said to have immediately sold the two sheets to Carol Saliba and Pio Grech, and the sheets were eventually broken down and sold to stamp dealers and collectors. A small amount of the error stamps were used on mail by philatelists, but the vast majority were retained in [[Mint stamp|mint condition]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nIn 1930, uncertainty about the stamp's issue formed the basis of a political campaign by the [[Constitutional Party (Malta)|Constitutional Party]] against the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] which became known as the \"Postage Stamps Scandal\". The matter was brought up in the Legislative Assembly on 31 March 1930 when Constitutional Party member Alfred Gera De Petri asked Robert Hamilton, the Minister for Posts, about the circumstances of the stamp's issue. A committee was later appointed to investigate the matter, and it included [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Gerald Strickland]], Hamilton, Walter Salomone, [[Paul Boffa]] and [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nThe committee members belonging to the Constitutional Party produced a report in which they stated that there was no evidence that the error was ever sold at a Post Office or that Caruana Gatto (who had died in 1926) had sold the stamps. They concluded that the inverted overprint was applied at the Government Printing Office without authorisation to sheets of genuine stamps which were not part of the Post Office stock, meaning that the overprints were forged. Boffa mentioned that the overprinting might have even been done outside the Government Printing Office, while Mifsud only agreed with the conclusion that there was no evidence of Caruana Gatto's involvement in the matter. There were gaps in the evidence collected by the committee, and it did not produce any arguments which countered various opinions that the overprints were the result of a genuine mistake, making its findings inconclusive.

They were [[commemorative stamp]]s since they celebrated the islands' new status as a [[self-governing colony]] following a new constitution in 1921, but also a [[Definitive stamp|definitive issue]] intended for regular use over an extended period of time.\n\nDesigned by two leading Maltese artists, [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and [[Gianni Vella]], the issue consisted of stamps in various denominations from \u00bc[[pence|d]] to [[\u00a3sd|\u00a3]]1; Caruana Dingli's designs were used on the pence and pound values and Vella's design on the shilling values. The designs were poorly received when they were issued, and Caruana Dingli himself criticized the execution of the design. In subsequent years, however, Caruana Dingli's design came to be regarded as one of the most iconic Malta stamps, and his design for the figure of Melita formed the basis of the [[Maltese lira]] banknotes of 1989\u20132008 and gold [[bullion coin]]s minted since 2018.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Malta 1899 Melita 2s6d olive-grey.jpg|thumb|left|The 1899 Melita stamp]]\n\nThe oldest known depiction of a personification of Malta dates back to 1481.

This divided control of Malta between two governments: the Maltese Government and the Maltese Imperial Government. The former included a [[Bicameralism|bicameral legislature]] with a [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]], while the Imperial Government was led by the [[List of Governors of Malta|Governor of Malta]], a British colonial official who retained direct responsibility of certain reserved matters such as defence and maintaining public order.<ref name=\"bephila\">{{cite web|title=Melita Issue of Malta Stamps: 1922\u201326|url=http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|website=British Empire Philately|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113650/http://www.bephila.com/articles/melita-issue-of-malta-stamps-1922-26|archivedate=16 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cassar |first1=Carmel |title=A Concise History of Malta |date=2000 |publisher=Mireva Publications |location=[[Msida]] |isbn=1870579526 |page=204}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 June 1921, a [[design competition|competition]] was announced calling for the design of a set of stamps to commemorate Malta's partial independence.

There was not enough time for the stamps to be produced and delivered within that timeframe, however, since the printers [[De La Rue]] had to deal with a large workload, causing delays. The Malta Post Office therefore decided to overprint the then-current definitives (which depicted King [[George V]] and some pictorial scenes, including the 1919 reprint of the 1899 Melita design) with the words \"SELF-GOVERNMENT\" diagonally to commemorate the new constitution.<ref name=\"bephila\"/> The overprinting was carried out by the Government Printing Office in the capital [[Valletta]], and the stamps were released between 12 January and 29 April 1922.<ref name=\"sg\"/>\n\n==Design==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Malta -mix- 2019 by-RaBoe 260.jpg\n | alt1 = A lighthouse\n | image2 = Gozo boat cropped.jpg\n | alt2 = Painting of a boat\n | footer = The St Elmo lighthouse and a [[Gozo boat]] (painting pictured) are depicted in the background of Caruana Dingli's design\n}}\n\nTwo designs were chosen from the competition, one by [[Edward Caruana Dingli (artist)|Edward Caruana Dingli]] and one by [[Gianni Vella]].

Despite this, some stamps with errors still ended up in circulation, including the 3d value with the overprint inverted, and various denominations with the overprints misplaced to varying degrees, the most notable being a variety of the 4d in which the overprint reads \"AGE POST\".<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\n===3d with inverted overprint===\n[[File:Malta 1926 Melita Postage 3d black on yellow overprint inverted.jpg|thumb|The 3d with the \"POSTAGE\" overprint inverted]]\n\nThe 3d black on yellow is known with the [[Invert error|overprint inverted]], and it is one of Malta's best-known error stamps. It is believed that only two sheets of the error were printed, and they were allegedly acquired on the first day of issue by Alfredo Caruana Gatto, a [[Maltese Political Union]] politician who was a member of the Senate and who had been Minister for Justice in 1921\u201322. The exact circumstances of their issue remain unclear, and it is not known whether they were acquired over the Post Office counter or not. Caruana Gatto is said to have immediately sold the two sheets to Carol Saliba and Pio Grech, and the sheets were eventually broken down and sold to stamp dealers and collectors. A small amount of the error stamps were used on mail by philatelists, but the vast majority were retained in [[Mint stamp|mint condition]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nIn 1930, uncertainty about the stamp's issue formed the basis of a political campaign by the [[Constitutional Party (Malta)|Constitutional Party]] against the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] which became known as the \"Postage Stamps Scandal\". The matter was brought up in the Legislative Assembly on 31 March 1930 when Constitutional Party member Alfred Gera De Petri asked Robert Hamilton, the Minister for Posts, about the circumstances of the stamp's issue. A committee was later appointed to investigate the matter, and it included [[Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland|Gerald Strickland]], Hamilton, Walter Salomone, [[Paul Boffa]] and [[Ugo Pasquale Mifsud]].<ref name=\"invert\"/>\n\nThe committee members belonging to the Constitutional Party produced a report in which they stated that there was no evidence that the error was ever sold at a Post Office or that Caruana Gatto (who had died in 1926) had sold the stamps. They concluded that the inverted overprint was applied at the Government Printing Office without authorisation to sheets of genuine stamps which were not part of the Post Office stock, meaning that the overprints were forged. Boffa mentioned that the overprinting might have even been done outside the Government Printing Office, while Mifsud only agreed with the conclusion that there was no evidence of Caruana Gatto's involvement in the matter. There were gaps in the evidence collected by the committee, and it did not produce any arguments which countered various opinions that the overprints were the result of a genuine mistake, making its findings inconclusive.

The design by [[Emvin Cremona]] depicts Melita holding a spear and a shield with Malta's 1943\u201364 coat of arms (including the [[George Cross]]), and she is shown sitting among ruins as if after a battle.<ref name=\"sg\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Casingena |first1=Mario |title=Melita |journal=The Melite Post |date=March 2018 |issue=6 |pages=3\u20134 |url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/32002/1/The%20Melite%20Post%20-%20Issue%206.pdf |publisher=\u017bejtun Philatelic Society |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20200418135622/https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/32002/1/The%20Melite%20Post%20-%20Issue%206.pdf |archivedate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn allegorical figure with a pose similar to Caruana Dingli's Melita design was used on the fifth and final series of [[Maltese lira]] banknotes. These banknotes were introduced by the [[Central Bank of Malta]] on 18 September 1989, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of independence, and they had four denominations: Lm2, Lm5, Lm10 and Lm20. Another series of banknotes with the same design but with amended security features was issued on 1 June 1994. Versions with signatures of different Governors of the Central Bank were issued in 1997, 1999 and 2001, and there was also a special issue for collectors in 2000.<ref>{{cite book |title=Said Malta Coin & Banknote Catalogue 2010 |date=2010 |publisher=Said International Ltd |pages=180\u2013193}}</ref> These banknotes remained in use until Malta adopted the [[euro]] on 1 January 2008, and remained legal tender until 31 January 2008; they were demonetized ten years later on 31 January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maltese banknotes \u2013 5th Series and enhanced version (not legal tender after 31 January 2008)|url=http://www.centralbankmalta.org/site/currency2e.html|publisher=[[Central Bank of Malta]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227162525/http://www.centralbankmalta.org/site/currency2e.html|archivedate=27 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Timeline Banknotes |url=https://www.centralbankmalta.org/timeline-banknotes |website=[[Central Bank of Malta]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122163451/https://www.centralbankmalta.org/timeline-banknotes |archivedate=22 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 December 2011, MaltaPost issued a [[miniature sheet]] containing a \u20ac4.16 stamp to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the establishment of Malta's [[Senate of Malta|Senate]] and [[Parliament of Malta|Legislative Assembly]].

According to the OECD, the UK is in the lower half of developed country rankings for poverty rates, doing better than [[Italy]] and the [[US]] but less well than [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and the [[Nordic countries]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,3343,en_2649_33933_41460917_1_1_1_1,00.html| title=Growing unequal? | work=OECD website |year=2008 | accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> [[Eurostat]] figures show that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty has fallen to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social transfers were taken into account).<ref name=Eurostat>\n{{cite web|title=People at risk of poverty after social transfers | publisher=Eurostat| url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do;jsessionid=9dOzCK6faudvGXEUauSxnZee7WnnEncGCh9i1A5wNyHpOODu4VUk!-1393835901?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=t2020_52&language=en}}\n</ref>\nPoverty is countered in United Kingdom with the [[welfare state]].  There have been protests over the recent welfare changes of introducing Universal Credit.  The aim of the government was to simplify the welfare state.  People have protested sanctioning of people on Universal Credit, as well as disabled people protesting changes.\n\nThe poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. In 2007\u20132008, this was calculated to be \u00a3115 per week for single adults with no dependent children; \u00a3199 per week for couples with no dependent children; \u00a3195 per week for single adults with two dependent children under 14; and \u00a3279 per week for couples with two dependent children under 14. In 2007\u20132008, 13.5&nbsp;million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this line.

According to the OECD, the UK is in the lower half of developed country rankings for poverty rates, doing better than [[Italy]] and the [[US]] but less well than [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovakia]] and the [[Nordic countries]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.oecd.org/document/4/0,3343,en_2649_33933_41460917_1_1_1_1,00.html| title=Growing unequal? | work=OECD website |year=2008 | accessdate=20 September 2010}}</ref> [[Eurostat]] figures show that the numbers of Britons at risk of poverty has fallen to 15.9% in 2014, down from 17.1% in 2010 and 19% in 2005 (after social transfers were taken into account).<ref name=Eurostat>\n{{cite web|title=People at risk of poverty after social transfers | publisher=Eurostat| url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/refreshTableAction.do;jsessionid=9dOzCK6faudvGXEUauSxnZee7WnnEncGCh9i1A5wNyHpOODu4VUk!-1393835901?tab=table&plugin=1&pcode=t2020_52&language=en}}\n</ref>\nPoverty is countered in United Kingdom with the [[welfare state]].  There have been protests over the recent welfare changes of introducing Universal Credit.  The aim of the government was to simplify the welfare state.  People have protested sanctioning of people on Universal Credit, as well as disabled people protesting changes.\n\nThe poverty line in the UK is commonly defined as being 60% of the median household income. In 2007\u20132008, this was calculated to be \u00a3115 per week for single adults with no dependent children; \u00a3199 per week for couples with no dependent children; \u00a3195 per week for single adults with two dependent children under 14; and \u00a3279 per week for couples with two dependent children under 14. In 2007\u20132008, 13.5&nbsp;million people, or 22% of the population, lived below this line. This is a higher level of relative poverty than all but four EU members.<ref>{{cite web|title= United Kingdom: Numbers in low income|url= http://www.poverty.org.uk/01/index.shtml|publisher= The Poverty Site|accessdate= 25 September 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100713230703/http://www.poverty.org.uk/01/index.shtml|archivedate= 13 July 2010|df= dmy-all}}</ref> In the same year, 4.0&nbsp;million children, 31% of the total, lived in households below the poverty line, after housing costs were taken into account.
