It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Network|Fox]] in the United States on December 2, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nAs they are leaving the grocery store, Bob decides to teach Tina how to drive in the parking lot. Unfortunately, Tina accidentally hits another car which turns out to be Jimmy Pesto's, Bob's rival. Bob decides to lie about the accident, saying that it was him who was driving the car at the time. Tina becomes extremely uncomfortable about the lying, and she starts to believe that she is a jinx.\n\nMort the [[mortician]] offers to drive the family around while their car is at the shop. This proves inconvenient for him however, as the family goes to lots of places and is consuming a lot of gas. He tries to confront the Belchers about this, but always fails to do so. Mort then finally finds the courage to tell the family how he feels, but then finds out that the car will be back tomorrow and Linda has already left a thank you package on his doorstep for his help.\n\nThe family meets Chase, an [[insurance adjuster]] who at first seemed like he believes the story Bob and Tina invented in order to get their insurance claim. He invites the family to cater a party at his house, where Tina (who was manning the grill) accidentally sets the house on fire. Tina gets nightmares from the lies and Bob finally decides to come clean to Chase and the rest of the family. When they arrive at his office however, Chase reveals that he knew the story was just invented, but he figured that if he helped the Belchers get their insurance claim, they could help him earn money by committing [[insurance fraud]]. He then admits that the fire was no accident: he used unscented gas to burn down the house. After refusing to go along with his crimes, Chase blackmails the two of them and he tells Tina that Bob could go to jail. He then says that they should flood their basement in order to file another insurance claim. The family then tries to trick Chase by making it look like the children drowned in the basement so he would leave them alone, but he sees through their lies and tells them that he wasn't letting go of them, since restaurants are magnets for accidents.\n\nBob thinks they will never be able to escape Chase, until Tina reveals that she used Gene's Casio keyboard to record Chase implicating himself in all the crimes. They send the keyboard to the [[FBI]], and Chase gets caught.

It aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Network|Fox]] in the United States on December 2, 2012.\n\n==Plot==\nAs they are leaving the grocery store, Bob decides to teach Tina how to drive in the parking lot. Unfortunately, Tina accidentally hits another car which turns out to be Jimmy Pesto's, Bob's rival. Bob decides to lie about the accident, saying that it was him who was driving the car at the time. Tina becomes extremely uncomfortable about the lying, and she starts to believe that she is a jinx.\n\nMort the [[mortician]] offers to drive the family around while their car is at the shop. This proves inconvenient for him however, as the family goes to lots of places and is consuming a lot of gas. He tries to confront the Belchers about this, but always fails to do so. Mort then finally finds the courage to tell the family how he feels, but then finds out that the car will be back tomorrow and Linda has already left a thank you package on his doorstep for his help.\n\nThe family meets Chase, an [[insurance adjuster]] who at first seemed like he believes the story Bob and Tina invented in order to get their insurance claim. He invites the family to cater a party at his house, where Tina (who was manning the grill) accidentally sets the house on fire. Tina gets nightmares from the lies and Bob finally decides to come clean to Chase and the rest of the family. When they arrive at his office however, Chase reveals that he knew the story was just invented, but he figured that if he helped the Belchers get their insurance claim, they could help him earn money by committing [[insurance fraud]]. He then admits that the fire was no accident: he used unscented gas to burn down the house. After refusing to go along with his crimes, Chase blackmails the two of them and he tells Tina that Bob could go to jail. He then says that they should flood their basement in order to file another insurance claim. The family then tries to trick Chase by making it look like the children drowned in the basement so he would leave them alone, but he sees through their lies and tells them that he wasn't letting go of them, since restaurants are magnets for accidents.\n\nBob thinks they will never be able to escape Chase, until Tina reveals that she used Gene's Casio keyboard to record Chase implicating himself in all the crimes. They send the keyboard to the [[FBI]], and Chase gets caught. Tina finally lets go of the idea that she is a jinx, after she saves the family from Chase.\n\n==Reception==\nRowan Kaiser of ''[[The A.V.

However, her former troop leader, Ginny, recruits her to return to the troop as a spy. She needs Tina to help her figure out which girl in the troop is a mole for their rivals, Troop 257. Every year, Troop 119's [[Girl Scout cookies|Thundergirl cookie]] sales are terrible and Ginny has learned that it is due to someone giving Troop 257 all of their planned cookie sale locations ahead of time. She is certain now, because she told Troop 119 that her new workplace would be perfect, only to have Troop 257 appear and sell all her coworkers cookies before Troop 119 was able to arrive. Ginny spoke to all the girls in the troop\u2014Katie, Julie, Rena, Jodi, and Molly\u2014and cannot determine which one is the mole; she knows it cannot be Tina, because Tina quit before the sabotage at her workplace happened. Tina agrees to help her.\n\nLouise learns about Tina's mission and tells Tina she will need her help if she wants to solve the case. When Tina refuses, Louise surprises her by joining Troop 119. Louise dubs her and Tina the \"Mole Patrol\". Tina's plan is to gain the mole's trust slowly and carefully, but Louise thinks a better idea would be to spread rumors to turn the girls against one another until the mole is revealed. Louise's plan sends the troop into chaos and when she threatens Jodi for a confession, Tina has enough and tells Louise that Mole Patrol is over and that she should leave the troop. Louise is angered and joins Troop 257 on her own under the name \"Alanis\" to determine who the mole is from the other end. She finds that Troop 257 is made up of extreme and hard edged girls who use a secret handshake involving farting noises when their finger is pulled.\n\nMeanwhile, in a subplot, Gretchen convinces Linda to dye her hair blonde. At first, Linda is enamored with her new look and aspires to play the \"[[Marilyn Monroe|dumb, sexy blonde]]\", but begins to fear that she truly is losing her intelligence because of her hair color. After seeing Gretchen dye her hair brunette, Linda changes her hair color back and feels secure that her intelligence has returned.\n\nBeing no closer to solving the mystery, Tina loses hope and concludes that perhaps her adherence to the old manual indeed makes her too dated for the Thundergirls. However, looking into her old manual, she gets an idea. Meanwhile, Louise is forced to go with Troop 257 to sell cookies at their latest lead and sees that they have arrived at Bob's Burgers. Bob and Linda inadvertently reveal Louise's identity to Troop 257 just as Troop 119 enter, as summoned by Tina. Tina reveals that she used a Thundergirl survival trapping strategy of setting multiple traps for prey: she privately told each of the girls in her troop a different cookie lead location and waited to see which location Troop 257 went to, allowing her to know which girl was the mole based on the lead she gave her. She reveals that she gave Rena the restaurant location, and that Rena is the mole. Rena counters that the mole could be Tina since she also knew the location, but Louise pulls on Rena's finger and she reflexively makes the telltale Troop 257 farting noise handshake, confirming her as the mole. Rena coldly explains that she joined Troop 257 first and was selected after her first year to infiltrate their rival Troop 119 as a mole. She and Troop 257 then leave.\n\nAfterward, Tina states that she has decided to stay with Troop 119, and Louise is unimpressed, calling it a waste of time. Linda suggests that Louise only helped Tina and created the Mole Patrol because she wanted to spend time with her big sister and felt jealous that the Thundergirls monopolized her time. Louise reluctantly admits this to be the case. Tina invites her to join Troop 119, but Louise tells her she is not interested. Regardless, Tina gives her a friendship bracelet she made in Thundergirls and Louise quickly takes it and tells her that she will wear it forever.\n\n==Reception==\nAlasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an A-, praising the character development for Tina from an initially weird and awkward teenager into a weird, but outgoing girl. However, Wilkins also noted that the episode specifically allowed more emotional insight into Louise as a character, stating, \"Yes, this is a Thundergirl espionage story, but it\u2019s also, as the once-again dark-haired Linda recognizes at episode\u2019s end, a sweet little story about a little sister who is jealous of the organization that monopolizes so much of her big sister\u2019s time.

However, her former troop leader, Ginny, recruits her to return to the troop as a spy. She needs Tina to help her figure out which girl in the troop is a mole for their rivals, Troop 257. Every year, Troop 119's [[Girl Scout cookies|Thundergirl cookie]] sales are terrible and Ginny has learned that it is due to someone giving Troop 257 all of their planned cookie sale locations ahead of time. She is certain now, because she told Troop 119 that her new workplace would be perfect, only to have Troop 257 appear and sell all her coworkers cookies before Troop 119 was able to arrive. Ginny spoke to all the girls in the troop\u2014Katie, Julie, Rena, Jodi, and Molly\u2014and cannot determine which one is the mole; she knows it cannot be Tina, because Tina quit before the sabotage at her workplace happened. Tina agrees to help her.\n\nLouise learns about Tina's mission and tells Tina she will need her help if she wants to solve the case. When Tina refuses, Louise surprises her by joining Troop 119. Louise dubs her and Tina the \"Mole Patrol\". Tina's plan is to gain the mole's trust slowly and carefully, but Louise thinks a better idea would be to spread rumors to turn the girls against one another until the mole is revealed. Louise's plan sends the troop into chaos and when she threatens Jodi for a confession, Tina has enough and tells Louise that Mole Patrol is over and that she should leave the troop. Louise is angered and joins Troop 257 on her own under the name \"Alanis\" to determine who the mole is from the other end. She finds that Troop 257 is made up of extreme and hard edged girls who use a secret handshake involving farting noises when their finger is pulled.\n\nMeanwhile, in a subplot, Gretchen convinces Linda to dye her hair blonde. At first, Linda is enamored with her new look and aspires to play the \"[[Marilyn Monroe|dumb, sexy blonde]]\", but begins to fear that she truly is losing her intelligence because of her hair color. After seeing Gretchen dye her hair brunette, Linda changes her hair color back and feels secure that her intelligence has returned.\n\nBeing no closer to solving the mystery, Tina loses hope and concludes that perhaps her adherence to the old manual indeed makes her too dated for the Thundergirls. However, looking into her old manual, she gets an idea. Meanwhile, Louise is forced to go with Troop 257 to sell cookies at their latest lead and sees that they have arrived at Bob's Burgers. Bob and Linda inadvertently reveal Louise's identity to Troop 257 just as Troop 119 enter, as summoned by Tina. Tina reveals that she used a Thundergirl survival trapping strategy of setting multiple traps for prey: she privately told each of the girls in her troop a different cookie lead location and waited to see which location Troop 257 went to, allowing her to know which girl was the mole based on the lead she gave her. She reveals that she gave Rena the restaurant location, and that Rena is the mole. Rena counters that the mole could be Tina since she also knew the location, but Louise pulls on Rena's finger and she reflexively makes the telltale Troop 257 farting noise handshake, confirming her as the mole. Rena coldly explains that she joined Troop 257 first and was selected after her first year to infiltrate their rival Troop 119 as a mole. She and Troop 257 then leave.\n\nAfterward, Tina states that she has decided to stay with Troop 119, and Louise is unimpressed, calling it a waste of time. Linda suggests that Louise only helped Tina and created the Mole Patrol because she wanted to spend time with her big sister and felt jealous that the Thundergirls monopolized her time. Louise reluctantly admits this to be the case. Tina invites her to join Troop 119, but Louise tells her she is not interested. Regardless, Tina gives her a friendship bracelet she made in Thundergirls and Louise quickly takes it and tells her that she will wear it forever.\n\n==Reception==\nAlasdair Wilkins of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode an A-, praising the character development for Tina from an initially weird and awkward teenager into a weird, but outgoing girl. However, Wilkins also noted that the episode specifically allowed more emotional insight into Louise as a character, stating, \"Yes, this is a Thundergirl espionage story, but it\u2019s also, as the once-again dark-haired Linda recognizes at episode\u2019s end, a sweet little story about a little sister who is jealous of the organization that monopolizes so much of her big sister\u2019s time.

However, the exterminator claims the basement is haunted and refuses to treat the infestation, claiming they need to make contact with the spirit to get rid of it. Linda and the kids decide to use a [[Ouija board]] to communicate with the ghost and trap it in a shoebox to get rid of it. Using the board, they learn that the ghost is a 13-year-old boy named Jeff, which piques TIna's interest. After \"trapping\" Jeff in the box, Tina refuses to throw \"him\" out and brings him with her to school. Tammy, Jocelyn, Zeke, and Jimmy Jr. taunt Tina about the box, until Louise has them all use the Ouija board to communicate with Jeff. They become convinced Jeff is real, and through the board, learn that Jeff is cool and that he has a crush on Tina. Meanwhile, word of the ghost sends two \"[[Ghost hunting|ghost hunters]]\" to the restaurant, who take up shop investigating paranormal activity around the premises. With Halloween fast approaching, their presence and the rumors of a ghost bring increased business to the restaurant.\n\nTina and Jeff begin going out, earning her attention from her friends, though she has some doubts about whether Jeff is real. However, Tammy takes the box and claims that Jeff left a message written in steam on the girls' bathroom mirror that says he's breaking up with Tina and is now dating Tammy. Tina is heartbroken. The family tries to decide how to cheer Tina up and Louise reveals to the rest of the family that she controlled the Ouija board and made Jeff up, but did not anticipate that Tina would fall in love with him or that Tammy would one-up her by stealing Tina's popularity with a similar ruse. Louise and Gene resolve to get back at Tammy by scaring her on [[Halloween]] night when the older kids plan to enter a [[mausoleum]] in the nearby cemetery. Tina surprises them by joining the group and they head into the mausoleum, which immediately shuts and traps them inside in complete darkness. Louise takes this opportunity to steal the box and fill it with bugs from the restaurant and gives it back to Tammy to open. The kids light a candle and are frightened to find a message written in blood on the mausoleum walls, allegedly from Jeff, condemning them all to [[Hell]].\n\nScared, Tammy confesses that she wrote the fake breakup message and throws the box away, causing the bugs to swarm them all. Tina calms everyone down by revealing that she pretended the mausoleum door was locked and wrote the message before they arrived in ketchup to scare them, having realized long ago that Jeff was not real. She explains that they all believed in Jeff because he was able to give them something they wanted: Tina wanted a boyfriend, Zeke wanted to believe in the afterlife, Jocelyn wanted another way to conform, and Tammy wanted Jeff as a status symbol. Tina states that they can get these things from themselves, though they all agree that Tammy is terrible. Louise is impressed that Tina pulled such a great Halloween prank on all of them.

Amarendran]]). His gym trainer Dheena (Sai Dheena) is seen paying respects at the funeral before leaving. The plot then shifts to a young crime inspector named Kumaran ([[Sundeep Kishan]]), who is chasing a petty thief and witnesses Dheena murdering his wife. Kumaran chases Dheena, who corners him and halts him with a blow to his head. In an ensuing tussle, Kumaran manages to kill Dheena.\n\nA meeting with psychiatrist Aadhirai ([[Lavanya Tripathi]]) ends on a rough note when she deems him medically unfit to rejoin the police force. Later, when he faces symptoms which attribute to PTSD, he mends his ways with Aadhirai, who helps him overcome his disorder. A second murder happens in which a famous actress, Vishma ([[Akshara Gowda]]) is killed. Kumaran visits the spot and gets stressed and shocked upon finding the similar blood stains from the earlier murder and the same brand of cigarette smoked by the murderer. Aadhirai finds him, treats him for his PTSD, and makes him normal. Kumaran meets with Rudhran ([[Daniel Balaji]]) and introduces Aadhirai to him as a motivational speaker. Kumaran, now fitter, sets out his investigation and finds that a makeup man named Gopi ([[Mime Gopi]]) must have done the murder as he is the prime suspect. Upon investigation, he gets to know that Gopi and Dheena showed a totally different behavior a few days before they committed the murders. Kumaran tracks down Gopi, but he jumps to his death before confessing anything.\n\nThe next murder happens, and the victim is another scientist named Narayanan (Kathi Ravi). Kumaran tries to find evidences in Narayanan's home and finds a book written by Rudhran. Thinking that Rudhran might know the scientist, Kumaran visits his office and finds that his behavior has changed. His own dog starts to bark at him, and he has also started to smoke recently, that too the same brand that was found in the earlier murders. Kumaran deduces that some strange thing is happening, and Rudhran could either be murdered or become the next murderer. He nabs Rudhran when he shows his more ruthless and cold-blooded side when he kills his dog. Kumaran takes Rudhran into custody. While signing on the FIR, Rudhran signs a different name but corrects it to his own sign. Kumaran notices this and finds out that the first sign was signed \"Pramodh\".\n\nA brief investigation reveals that Pramodh is a late colleague of Narayanan. They worked together at the Indian Institute of Neurosciences. A senior official named Velayudham ([[Jayaprakash]]) reveals that Pramodh was involved in a project called Project Maayavan, which could enable a person to store their memories into a hard drive, which can be transferred to another individual by injecting a gel which would house millions of nano-transmitters. When injected into the brain, these transmitters will attach onto the neurons. When the person dies, their memories could be transmitted to another individual whose brain would already have been injected with the gel. The memories of the new person will first be erased, and the old person's memories will be transferred via the nano-transmitters. This way the person (their memories) will not die and will instead live forever.\n\nTo prove his theory, Pramodh works day and night. During this experiment, he sends a patient into a coma but is not bothered about human life and instead wants to succeed in his mission. After Narayanan becomes the Director of the Indian Institute of Neurosciences, he stops Pramodh's project. Pramodh uses himself as the subject, transfers his memories in a hard drive, and commits suicide. Once he dies, his memories get transferred to his trainer, and then to Gopi and then Rudhran. Kumaran solves this and finds that the next target is Army general Major Sathyan ([[Jackie Shroff]]). Pramodh, who is living in Rudhran's body, commits suicide and arrives into Sathyan's brain. Sathyan invites Kumaran and says that his technology will let him live for more than 1000 years, and no one can stop him. With a clue from Pramodh's wife, Kumaran finds his secret lab where Pramodh has his memories stored. Pramodh successfully retrieves the hard drive containing his memories, which includes blackmailing and later killing Kumaran's friend Karna ([[Bagavathi Perumal]]). He then kidnaps Velayudham and goes to the institute lab to let him switch to another body. Kumaran tracks him down, and a gunfight ensues. Finally, Kumaran realizes that Aadhirai is the next subject. If Sathyan dies, then Pramodh's memories will transfer to Aadhirai's body, leaving Kumaran with a difficult choice.\n\n20 years later, Kumaran is happily married to Aadhirai, and they have a son. It is shown that Kumaran has trapped Sathyan in his basement and has kept him alive.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Sundeep Kishan]] as Kumaran, a young crime inspector.\n*[[Lavanya Tripathi]] as Aadhirai, a psychiatrist whom Kumaran gets treated for his PTSD and later marries him.\n*[[Jackie Shroff]] as Major Sathyan, an Army officer.\n*[[Daniel Balaji]] as Rudhran, a man whom Kumaran meets and later finds him behaving in a strange way.\n*[[Mime Gopi]] as Gopi, a makeup man who commits suicide after Kumaran tracks him down.\n*[[R.

The title is a reference to the famous song \"[[Tea for Two (song)|Tea for Two]]\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] requests [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] to go pick up his clothes from a dry cleaning store. Peter tells her that he got his favorite white shirt washed by the cleaners, but when he goes to pick up the shirt at the Chinese-owned laundromat Super Cowboy USA Hot Dog Rocket Ship American Cleaners Number One, he finds out that the owner, Mr. Washee-Washee (Robert Wu), has lost it. He denies losing it, causing Peter to refuse to give him business any longer and claiming that Mr. Washee-Washee stole it. Lois steadfastly declines to find a new dry cleaner \u2013 as Mr. Washee-Washee is the best \u2013 and invites him to dinner in an attempt to make Peter and him settle their differences. Peter fights with Mr. Washee-Washee during the meal about his shirt; Mr. Washee-Washee leaves in a huff, banning the Griffins from his store for life. Later that night, Peter and Chris go over to the cleaner's house. Peter then sneaks inside and finds a similar shirt, thinking the cleaner has stolen it. When he tries it on, however, Peter discovers that it isn't his shirt. At that moment, Washee-Washee comes in and holds Peter at gun-point, causing the two to break into a [[Street Fighter 2]]-like battle with Peter ultimately losing and ending up in jail. [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] goes to bail him out, and meets a woman, Denise, whom he takes a liking to. Brian later tells Lois about Denise, and tries to impress her by inviting Denise on a date. However, when Brian does so on the phone, Denise rejects him, instantly sending the dog into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]].\n\nAfter Peter learns of Brian's depression, he suggests that he take [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]'s class on dating women. Despite Quagmire's dislike of him, Brian decides to try out the program that night. Initially, Quagmire refuses to accept Brian into the class, but when Brian produces the signed class credit, he reluctantly allows him to stay and Brian goes along with the class to the local bar to pick up chicks. Brian successfully hooks up with an obese woman named Bettina, and comes home dressed in obnoxious clothing (that resembles [[Jon Gosselin]]) before heading out to try again with Denise. Denise is turned off by Brian's newfound arrogance and leaves him. Now enraged, Brian blames Quagmire for ruining his life; Quagmire replies that the course is about getting laid, not finding the right woman. Quagmire then admits that he is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, [[Cheryl Tiegs]] (first mentioned in \"[[Jerome Is the New Black]]\" as the only woman Quagmire truly loved, with Quagmire citing their break-up as the reason he is a sex addict), who dated him in the early 1980s but left him over his constant jealousy. Cheryl appears at Quagmire's house the next day, with her new boyfriend, Brian, who mocks Quagmire and [[the finger|flips him the bird]] before driving off with Cheryl and making out with her. Furious, Quagmire tries to fight with Brian for dating Cheryl, but is stopped by Peter, who is actually quite impressed with Brian's feat.\n\nThat night, Brian takes Cheryl to dinner, where Quagmire discovers the two. Quagmire then offers to buy dinner for the two, along with his new girlfriend, Jillian, whom Brian had dated. Jealous, Brian and Quagmire begin fighting and pointing out each other's flaws in front of Cheryl and Jillian causing them to leave and break up with their dates. Brian suggests that his feud with Quagmire has finally come to an end and that it took them stealing each other's girls to finally become friends again, to which Quagmire reluctantly agrees. However, when Brian asks for a ride home, Quagmire drives off without him and backs his car onto him before driving off again.\n\n==Cultural references==\nA cutaway gag mocks [[Michael J.

Before long, mechanical means were found to achieve this. For instance, [[stamp mill]]s were used in [[Samarkand]] as early as 973. They were also in use in medieval [[Persia]]. By the 11th century, stamp mills were in widespread use throughout the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and North Africa in the west to [[Central Asia]] in the east.<ref>Adam Robert Lucas (2005), \"Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe\", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1): 1-30 [10-1 & 27]</ref> A later example was the [[Cornish stamps]], consisting of a series of iron hammers mounted in a vertical frame, raised by [[cam]]s on the shaft of a [[waterwheel]] and falling onto the ore under gravity.\n\nThe simplest method of separating ore from gangue consists of picking out the individual crystals of each. This is a very tedious process, particularly when the individual particles are small. Another comparatively simple method relies on the various minerals having different [[specific gravity|densities]], causing them to collect in different places: metallic minerals (being heavier) will drop out of suspension more quickly than lighter ones, which will be carried further by a stream of water. The process of panning and sifting for gold uses both of these methods. Various devices known as 'buddles' were used to take advantage of this property.{{When|date=November 2010}} Later, more advanced machines were used such as the [[vanning|Frue vanner]], invented in 1874.\n\nOther equipment used historically includes the hutch, a trough used with some ore-dressing machines and the keeve or kieve, a large tub used for differential settlement.\n\n==Unit operations==\nMineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation: ''[[comminution]]'' \u2013 particle size reduction; ''[[sizing]]'' \u2013 separation of particle sizes by screening or classification; ''concentration'' by taking advantage of physical and surface chemical properties; and ''[[dewatering]]'' \u2013 solid/liquid separation. In all of these processes, the most important considerations are the economics of the processes and this is dictated by the grade and recovery of the final product. To do this, the mineralogy of the ore needs to be considered as this dictates the amount of liberation required and the processes that can occur. The smaller the particles processes, the greater the theoretical grade and recovery of the final product, but this however is difficult to do with fine particles as they prevent certain concentration processes from occurring.\n\n===Comminution===\n[[Comminution]] is particle size reduction of materials. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. [[Crusher|Crushing]] and [[Mill (grinding)|grinding]] are the two primary comminution processes. Crushing is normally carried out on \"run-of-mine\"<ref>Run-of-mine: The raw mined material as it is delivered prior to treatment of any sort. {{cite web\n |url         = http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/dmmrt1017.html\n |title       = Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms\n |publisher   = Hacettepe University - Department of Mining Engineering\n |accessdate  = 2010-08-07\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101029170449/http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/dmmrt1017.html\n |archivedate = 2010-10-29\n}}</ref> ore, while grinding (normally carried out after crushing) may be conducted on dry or slurried material. In comminution, the size reduction of particles is done by three types of forces: compression, impact and attrition. Compression and impact forces are extensively used in crushing operations while attrition is the dominant force in grinding. The primarily used equipment in crushing are-jaw crushers, gyratory crushers and cone crushers whereas rod mills and ball mills, closed circuited with a classifier unit, are generally employed for grinding purposes in a mineral processing plant. Crushing is a dry process whereas grinding is generally performed wet and hence is more energy intensive.\n\n===Sizing===\n[[File:THC 2003.902.122 Ore Crushing Machinery.tif | thumb|right | Screening ore through a sieve, Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory, 1930]]\n[[File:Sizer 2000.jpg|thumb|Sizer 2000 for screening coarse to small particles]]\nSizing is the general term for separation of particles according to their size.\n\nThe simplest sizing process is screening, or passing the particles to be sized through a screen or number of screens. Screening equipment can include grizzlies,<ref>Grizzly: a grid of iron bars that allows ore of the correct size to travel down the ore pass to the bottom of the mine, ready for hoisting to the surface. An active, articulating \"grizzly\" that is able to roll, scrub, clean and discharge oversize rock and boulder of up to 4 foot (1220 mm minus)diameter, while recovering all the 2 inch minus (51 mm minus) slurry material for further screening, separation and recovery of target metals/minerals is the DEROCKER system (RMS-Ross Corporation)\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.geevor.com/index.php?object=255\n|title=Geevor Tin Mine: Grizzly men\n|publisher=Geevor Tin Mine Museum\n|accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref> bar screens, wedge wire screens, radial sieves, banana screens, multi-deck screens, vibratory screen, fine screens, flip flop screens and wire mesh screens. Screens can be static (typically the case for very coarse material), or they can incorporate mechanisms to shake or vibrate the screen. Some considerations in this process include the screen material, the aperture size, shape and orientation, the amount of near sized particles, the addition of water, the amplitude and frequency of the vibrations, the angle of inclination, the presence of harmful materials, like steel and wood, and the size distribution of the particles.\n\nClassification refers to sizing operations that exploit the differences in settling velocities exhibited by particles of different size. Classification equipment may include [[ore sorting|ore sorters]], [[gas cyclone]]s, [[hydrocyclone]]s, rotating [[trommel]]s, rake classifiers or fluidized classifiers.\n\nAn important factor in both comminution and sizing operations is the determination of the particle size distribution of the materials being processed, commonly referred to as [[particle size analysis]]. Many techniques for analyzing particle size are used, and the techniques include both off-line analyses which require that a sample of the material be taken for analysis and on-line techniques that allow for analysis of the material as it flows through the process.\n\n===Concentration===\nThere are a number of ways to increase the concentration of the wanted minerals: in any particular case, the method chosen will depend on the relative physical and surface chemical properties of the mineral and the [[gangue]].\nConcentration is defined as the number of moles of a solute in a volume of the solution. In case of mineral processing, concentration means the increase of the percentage of the valuable mineral in the concentrate.\n\n===Gravity concentration===\nGravity separation is the separation of two or more minerals of different specific gravity by their relative movement in response to the force of gravity and one or more other forces (such as centrifugal forces, magnetic forces, buoyant forces), one of which is resistance to motion (drag force) by a viscous medium such as heavy media, water or, less commonly, air. \n\nGravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation, classification, magnetic separation and leaching. Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.\n\nIt is necessary to determine the suitability of a gravity concentration process before it is employed for concentration of an ore. The ''concentration criterion'' is commonly used for this purpose, designated <math>CC</math> in the following equation (where <math>SG</math> represents [[specific gravity]]):\n\n:<math>CC = \\frac {SG(heavy\\ mineral) - SG(fluid)}{SG(light\\ mineral) - SG(fluid)}</math>\n*for CC > 2.5, suitable for separation of particles above 75 micron in size\n*for 1.75 < CC < 2.5, suitable for separation of particles above 150 micron in size\n*for 1.50 < CC < 1.75, suitable for separation of particles above 1.7&nbsp;mm in size\n*for 1.25 < CC < 1.50, suitable for separation of particles above 6.35&nbsp;mm in size\n*for CC < 1.25, not suitable for any size\n\nAlthough concentration criteria is a useful rule of thumb when predicting [[Amenable group|amenability]] to gravity concentration, factors such as particle shape and relative concentration of heavy and light particles can dramatically affect separation efficiency in practice.\n\n; Classification\nThere are several methods that make use of the weight or density differences of particles:<ref>{{Citation | author1=Lowrie, Raymond L | author2=Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration | title=SME mining reference handbook | publication-date=2002 | publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration | isbn=978-0-87335-175-1 }} - chapter 17 - Classification section by Paul D.

When subjected to this media particles either float or sink depending on their density relative to the media. In this way the separation takes place purely on density differences and does not, in principle, relay on any other factors such as particle weight or shape. In practice, particle size and shape can affect separation efficiency. Dense medium separation can be performed using a variety of mediums. These include, organic liquids, aqueous solutions or suspensions of very fine particles in water or air. The organic liquids are typically not used due to their toxicity, difficulties in handling and relative cost. Industrially, the most common dense media is a suspension of fine magnetite and/or ferrosilicon particles. An aqueous solution as a dense medium is used in coal processing in the form of a belknap wash and suspensions in air are used in water-deficient areas, like areas of China, where sand is used to separate coal from the gangue minerals.\n\nGravity separation is also called relative gravity separation as it separates particles due to their relative response to a driving force. This is controlled by factors such as particle weight, size and shape. These processes can also be classified into multi-G and single G processes. The difference is the magnitude of the driving force for the separation. Multi-G processes allow the separation of very fine particles to occur (in the range of 5 to 50 micron) by increasing the driving force of separation in order to increase the rate at which particles separate. In general, single G process are only capable of processing particles that are greater than approximately 80 micron in diameter.\n\nOf the gravity separation processes, the spiral concentrators and circular jigs are two of the most economical due to their simplicity and use of space. They operate by flowing film separation and can either use washwater or be washwater-less. The washwater spirals separate particles more easily but can have issues with entrainment of gangue with the concentrate produced.\n\n===Froth flotation===\n[[File:FlotationFalconbridgeOnt.jpg|thumb|right|Froth flotation cells used to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario.]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n[[Froth flotation]] is an important concentration process. This process can be used to separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles. In flotation, bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp. In the process, hydrophobic particles become bound to the surface of the bubbles. The driving force for this attachment is the change in the surface free energy when the attachment occurs. These bubbles rise through the slurry and are collected from the surface. To enable these particles to attach, careful consideration of the chemistry of the pulp needs to be made. These considerations include the pH, Eh and the presence of flotation reagents. The pH is important as it changes the charge of the particles surface and the pH affects the chemisorption of collectors on the surface of the particles.\n\nThe addition of flotation reagents also affects the operation of these processes. The most important chemical that is added is the collector. This chemical binds to the surface of the particles as it is a surfactant. The main considerations in this chemical is the nature of the head group and the size of the hydrocarbon chain. The hydrocarbon tail needs to be short to maximize the selectivity of the desired mineral and the headgroup dictates which minerals it attaches to.\n\nThe frothers are another important chemical addition to the pulp as it enables stable bubbles to be formed. This is important as if the bubble coalesce, minerals fall off their surface. The bubbles however should not be too stable as this prevents easy transportation and dewatering of the concentrate formed. The mechanism of these frothers is not completely known and further research into their mechanisms is being performed.\n\nDepressants and activators are used to selectively separate one mineral from another. Depressants inhibit the flotation of one mineral or minerals while activators enable the flotation of others. Examples of these include CN<sup>\u2212</sup>, used to depress all sulfides but galena and this depressant is believed to operate by changing the solubility of chemisorbed and physisorbed collectors on sulfides. This theory originates from Russia. An example of an activator is Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions, used for the flotation of sphalerite.\n\nThere are a number of cells able to be used for the flotation of minerals. these include flotation columns and mechanical flotation cells. The flotation columns are used for finer minerals and they typically have a higher grade and lower recovery of minerals than mechanical flotation cells. The cells in use at the moment can exceed 300&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>. This is done as they are cheaper per unit volume than smaller cells, but they are not able to be controlled as easily as smaller cells.\n\nThis process was invented in the 19th century in Australia. It was used to recover a [[sphalerite]] concentrate from tailings, produced using gravity concentration. Further improvements have come from Australia in the form of the [[Jameson Cell]], developed at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This operated by the use of a plunging jet that generates fine bubbles. These fine bubbles have a higher kinetic energy and as such they can be used for the flotation of fine grained minerals, such as those produced by the isamill.\n\nStaged flotation reactors (SFRs) split the flotation process into 3 defined stages per cell and are becoming increasingly more common in use as they require much less energy, air and big round tits .\n\n===Electrostatic separation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}There are two main types of [[electrostatic separator]]s. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high tension rollers) or electrostatic separators. In high tension rollers, particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic plate separators work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons to the plate and are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, one of the most important is the water content of the particles. This is important as a layer of moisture on the particles will render the non-conductors as conductors as the layer of the water is conductive.\n\nElectrostatic plate separators are usually used for streams that have small conductors and coarse non-conductors. The high tension rollers are usually used for streams that have coarse conductors and fine non-conductors.\n\nThese separators are commonly used for separating [[mineral sands]], an example of one of these mineral processing plants is the CRL processing plant at Pinkenba in Brisbane Queensland. In this plant, [[zircon]], [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]] are separated from the silica [[gangue]]. In this plant, the separation is performed in a number of stages with roughers, cleaners, scavengers and recleaners.\n\n===Magnetic separation===\nMagnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. In mines where [[wolframite]] was mixed with [[cassiterite]], such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores. At these mines a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844\u20131906)[1] was used. In this machine the raw ore, after calcination was fed onto a moving belt which passed underneath two pairs of electromagnets under which further belts ran at right angles to the feed belt. The first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day. This process of separating magnetic substances from the non-magnetic substances in a mixture with the help of a magnet is called magnetic separation..\n\nThis process operates by moving particles in a magnetic field. The force experienced in the magnetic field is given by the equation f=m/k.H.dh/dx. with k=magnetic susceptibility, H-magnetic field strength, and dh/dx being the magnetic field gradient. As seen in this equation, the separation can be driven in two ways, either through a gradient in a magnetic field or the strength of a magnetic field. The different driving forces are used in the different concentrators. These can be either with water or without. Like the spirals, washwater aids in the separation of the particles while increases the entrainment of the gangue in the concentrate.\n\n===Automated Ore Sorting===\n{{See also|Sensor-based sorting}}\nModern, automated sorting applies optical sensors (visible spectrum, near infrared, X-ray, ultraviolet), that can be coupled with electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility sensors, to control the mechanical separation of ore into two or more categories on an individual rock by rock basis. Also new sensors have been developed which exploit material properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetization, molecular structure and thermal conductivity. Sensor based sorting has found application in the processing of nickel, gold, copper, coal\nand diamonds.\n\n===Dewatering===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nDewatering is an important process in mineral processing. The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done for a number of reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue. The water extracted from the ore by dewatering is recirculated for plant operations after being sent to a water treatment plant. The main processes that are used in dewatering include dewatering screens such as [[Sepro Mineral Systems#Sepro-Sizetec Screens|Sepro-Sizetec Screens]], sedimentation, filtering, and thermal drying. These processes increase in difficulty and cost as the particle size decreases.\n\nDewatering screens operate by passing particles over a screen. The particles pass over the screen while the water passes through the apertures in the screen. This process is only viable for coarse ores that have a close size distribution as the apertures can allow small particles to pass through.\n\nSedimentation operates by passing water into a large thickener or clarifier. In these devices, the particles settle out of the slurry under the effects of gravity, or centripetal forces. These are limited by the surface chemistry of the particles and the size of the particles. To aid in the sedimentation process, flocculants and coagulants are added to reduce the repulsive forces between the particles. This repulsive force is due to the double layer formed on the surface of the particles. The flocculants work by binding multiple particles together while the coagulants work by reducing the thickness of the charged layer on the outside of the particle. After thickening, slurry is often stored in ponds or impoundments. Alternatively, it can pumped into a [[belt press]] or membrane [[filter press]] to recycle process water and create stackable, dry filter cake, or \"tailings\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tons Per Hour Product Guide 2016|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/TPH_PG_2016_Eng.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThermal drying is usually used for fine particles and to remove low water content in the particles. Some common processes include rotary dryers, fluidised beds, spray driers, hearth dryers and rotary tray dryers. This process is usually expensive to operate due to the fuel requirement of the dryers.\n\n==Other processes==\nMany [[physical plant|mechanical plants]] also incorporate [[Hydrometallurgy|hydrometallurgical]] or [[Pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical]] processes as part of an extractive metallurgical operation. [[Geometallurgy]] is a branch of [[extractive metallurgy]] that combines mineral processing with the geologic sciences.

Before long, mechanical means were found to achieve this. For instance, [[stamp mill]]s were used in [[Samarkand]] as early as 973. They were also in use in medieval [[Persia]]. By the 11th century, stamp mills were in widespread use throughout the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], from [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] and North Africa in the west to [[Central Asia]] in the east.<ref>Adam Robert Lucas (2005), \"Industrial Milling in the Ancient and Medieval Worlds: A Survey of the Evidence for an Industrial Revolution in Medieval Europe\", ''Technology and Culture'' '''46''' (1): 1-30 [10-1 & 27]</ref> A later example was the [[Cornish stamps]], consisting of a series of iron hammers mounted in a vertical frame, raised by [[cam]]s on the shaft of a [[waterwheel]] and falling onto the ore under gravity.\n\nThe simplest method of separating ore from gangue consists of picking out the individual crystals of each. This is a very tedious process, particularly when the individual particles are small. Another comparatively simple method relies on the various minerals having different [[specific gravity|densities]], causing them to collect in different places: metallic minerals (being heavier) will drop out of suspension more quickly than lighter ones, which will be carried further by a stream of water. The process of panning and sifting for gold uses both of these methods. Various devices known as 'buddles' were used to take advantage of this property.{{When|date=November 2010}} Later, more advanced machines were used such as the [[vanning|Frue vanner]], invented in 1874.\n\nOther equipment used historically includes the hutch, a trough used with some ore-dressing machines and the keeve or kieve, a large tub used for differential settlement.\n\n==Unit operations==\nMineral processing can involve four general types of unit operation: ''[[comminution]]'' \u2013 particle size reduction; ''[[sizing]]'' \u2013 separation of particle sizes by screening or classification; ''concentration'' by taking advantage of physical and surface chemical properties; and ''[[dewatering]]'' \u2013 solid/liquid separation. In all of these processes, the most important considerations are the economics of the processes and this is dictated by the grade and recovery of the final product. To do this, the mineralogy of the ore needs to be considered as this dictates the amount of liberation required and the processes that can occur. The smaller the particles processes, the greater the theoretical grade and recovery of the final product, but this however is difficult to do with fine particles as they prevent certain concentration processes from occurring.\n\n===Comminution===\n[[Comminution]] is particle size reduction of materials. Comminution may be carried out on either dry materials or slurries. [[Crusher|Crushing]] and [[Mill (grinding)|grinding]] are the two primary comminution processes.

Many techniques for analyzing particle size are used, and the techniques include both off-line analyses which require that a sample of the material be taken for analysis and on-line techniques that allow for analysis of the material as it flows through the process.\n\n===Concentration===\nThere are a number of ways to increase the concentration of the wanted minerals: in any particular case, the method chosen will depend on the relative physical and surface chemical properties of the mineral and the [[gangue]].\nConcentration is defined as the number of moles of a solute in a volume of the solution. In case of mineral processing, concentration means the increase of the percentage of the valuable mineral in the concentrate.\n\n===Gravity concentration===\nGravity separation is the separation of two or more minerals of different specific gravity by their relative movement in response to the force of gravity and one or more other forces (such as centrifugal forces, magnetic forces, buoyant forces), one of which is resistance to motion (drag force) by a viscous medium such as heavy media, water or, less commonly, air. \n\nGravity separation is one of the oldest technique in mineral processing but has seen a decline in its use since the introduction of methods like flotation, classification, magnetic separation and leaching. Gravity separation dates back to at least 3000 BC when Egyptians used the technique for separation of gold.\n\nIt is necessary to determine the suitability of a gravity concentration process before it is employed for concentration of an ore. The ''concentration criterion'' is commonly used for this purpose, designated <math>CC</math> in the following equation (where <math>SG</math> represents [[specific gravity]]):\n\n:<math>CC = \\frac {SG(heavy\\ mineral) - SG(fluid)}{SG(light\\ mineral) - SG(fluid)}</math>\n*for CC > 2.5, suitable for separation of particles above 75 micron in size\n*for 1.75 < CC < 2.5, suitable for separation of particles above 150 micron in size\n*for 1.50 < CC < 1.75, suitable for separation of particles above 1.7&nbsp;mm in size\n*for 1.25 < CC < 1.50, suitable for separation of particles above 6.35&nbsp;mm in size\n*for CC < 1.25, not suitable for any size\n\nAlthough concentration criteria is a useful rule of thumb when predicting [[Amenable group|amenability]] to gravity concentration, factors such as particle shape and relative concentration of heavy and light particles can dramatically affect separation efficiency in practice.\n\n; Classification\nThere are several methods that make use of the weight or density differences of particles:<ref>{{Citation | author1=Lowrie, Raymond L | author2=Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration | title=SME mining reference handbook | publication-date=2002 | publisher=Society for Mining, Metallurgy, and Exploration | isbn=978-0-87335-175-1 }} - chapter 17 - Classification section by Paul D.

When subjected to this media particles either float or sink depending on their density relative to the media. In this way the separation takes place purely on density differences and does not, in principle, relay on any other factors such as particle weight or shape. In practice, particle size and shape can affect separation efficiency. Dense medium separation can be performed using a variety of mediums. These include, organic liquids, aqueous solutions or suspensions of very fine particles in water or air. The organic liquids are typically not used due to their toxicity, difficulties in handling and relative cost. Industrially, the most common dense media is a suspension of fine magnetite and/or ferrosilicon particles. An aqueous solution as a dense medium is used in coal processing in the form of a belknap wash and suspensions in air are used in water-deficient areas, like areas of China, where sand is used to separate coal from the gangue minerals.\n\nGravity separation is also called relative gravity separation as it separates particles due to their relative response to a driving force. This is controlled by factors such as particle weight, size and shape. These processes can also be classified into multi-G and single G processes. The difference is the magnitude of the driving force for the separation. Multi-G processes allow the separation of very fine particles to occur (in the range of 5 to 50 micron) by increasing the driving force of separation in order to increase the rate at which particles separate. In general, single G process are only capable of processing particles that are greater than approximately 80 micron in diameter.\n\nOf the gravity separation processes, the spiral concentrators and circular jigs are two of the most economical due to their simplicity and use of space. They operate by flowing film separation and can either use washwater or be washwater-less. The washwater spirals separate particles more easily but can have issues with entrainment of gangue with the concentrate produced.\n\n===Froth flotation===\n[[File:FlotationFalconbridgeOnt.jpg|thumb|right|Froth flotation cells used to concentrate copper and nickel sulfide minerals, Falconbridge, Ontario.]]\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n[[Froth flotation]] is an important concentration process. This process can be used to separate any two different particles and operated by the surface chemistry of the particles. In flotation, bubbles are introduced into a pulp and the bubbles rise through the pulp. In the process, hydrophobic particles become bound to the surface of the bubbles. The driving force for this attachment is the change in the surface free energy when the attachment occurs. These bubbles rise through the slurry and are collected from the surface. To enable these particles to attach, careful consideration of the chemistry of the pulp needs to be made. These considerations include the pH, Eh and the presence of flotation reagents. The pH is important as it changes the charge of the particles surface and the pH affects the chemisorption of collectors on the surface of the particles.\n\nThe addition of flotation reagents also affects the operation of these processes. The most important chemical that is added is the collector. This chemical binds to the surface of the particles as it is a surfactant. The main considerations in this chemical is the nature of the head group and the size of the hydrocarbon chain. The hydrocarbon tail needs to be short to maximize the selectivity of the desired mineral and the headgroup dictates which minerals it attaches to.\n\nThe frothers are another important chemical addition to the pulp as it enables stable bubbles to be formed. This is important as if the bubble coalesce, minerals fall off their surface. The bubbles however should not be too stable as this prevents easy transportation and dewatering of the concentrate formed. The mechanism of these frothers is not completely known and further research into their mechanisms is being performed.\n\nDepressants and activators are used to selectively separate one mineral from another. Depressants inhibit the flotation of one mineral or minerals while activators enable the flotation of others. Examples of these include CN<sup>\u2212</sup>, used to depress all sulfides but galena and this depressant is believed to operate by changing the solubility of chemisorbed and physisorbed collectors on sulfides. This theory originates from Russia. An example of an activator is Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions, used for the flotation of sphalerite.\n\nThere are a number of cells able to be used for the flotation of minerals. these include flotation columns and mechanical flotation cells. The flotation columns are used for finer minerals and they typically have a higher grade and lower recovery of minerals than mechanical flotation cells. The cells in use at the moment can exceed 300&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>. This is done as they are cheaper per unit volume than smaller cells, but they are not able to be controlled as easily as smaller cells.\n\nThis process was invented in the 19th century in Australia. It was used to recover a [[sphalerite]] concentrate from tailings, produced using gravity concentration. Further improvements have come from Australia in the form of the [[Jameson Cell]], developed at the University of Newcastle, Australia. This operated by the use of a plunging jet that generates fine bubbles. These fine bubbles have a higher kinetic energy and as such they can be used for the flotation of fine grained minerals, such as those produced by the isamill.\n\nStaged flotation reactors (SFRs) split the flotation process into 3 defined stages per cell and are becoming increasingly more common in use as they require much less energy, air and installation space.\n\n===Electrostatic separation===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}There are two main types of [[electrostatic separator]]s. These work in similar ways, but the forces applied to the particles are different and these forces are gravity and electrostatic attraction. The two types are electrodynamic separators (or high tension rollers) or electrostatic separators. In high tension rollers, particles are charged by a corona discharge. This charges the particles that subsequently travel on a drum. The conducting particles lose their charge to the drum and are removed from the drum with centripetal acceleration. Electrostatic plate separators work by passing a stream of particles past a charged anode. The conductors lose electrons to the plate and are pulled away from the other particles due to the induced attraction to the anode. These separators are used for particles between 75 and 250 micron and for efficient separation to occur, the particles need to be dry, have a close size distribution and uniform in shape. Of these considerations, one of the most important is the water content of the particles. This is important as a layer of moisture on the particles will render the non-conductors as conductors as the layer of the water is conductive.\n\nElectrostatic plate separators are usually used for streams that have small conductors and coarse non-conductors. The high tension rollers are usually used for streams that have coarse conductors and fine non-conductors.\n\nThese separators are commonly used for separating [[mineral sands]], an example of one of these mineral processing plants is the CRL processing plant at Pinkenba in Brisbane Queensland. In this plant, [[zircon]], [[rutile]] and [[ilmenite]] are separated from the silica [[gangue]]. In this plant, the separation is performed in a number of stages with roughers, cleaners, scavengers and recleaners.\n\n===Magnetic separation===\nMagnetic separation is a process in which magnetically susceptible material is extracted from a mixture using a magnetic force. This separation technique can be useful in mining iron as it is attracted to a magnet. In mines where [[wolframite]] was mixed with [[cassiterite]], such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina, Tasmania, magnetic separation was used to separate the ores. At these mines a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill, 1844\u20131906)[1] was used. In this machine the raw ore, after calcination was fed onto a moving belt which passed underneath two pairs of electromagnets under which further belts ran at right angles to the feed belt. The first pair of electromagnets was weakly magnetised and served to draw off any iron ore present. The second pair were strongly magnetised and attracted the wolframite, which is weakly magnetic. These machines were capable of treating 10 tons of ore a day. This process of separating magnetic substances from the non-magnetic substances in a mixture with the help of a magnet is called magnetic separation..\n\nThis process operates by moving particles in a magnetic field. The force experienced in the magnetic field is given by the equation f=m/k.H.dh/dx. with k=magnetic susceptibility, H-magnetic field strength, and dh/dx being the magnetic field gradient. As seen in this equation, the separation can be driven in two ways, either through a gradient in a magnetic field or the strength of a magnetic field. The different driving forces are used in the different concentrators. These can be either with water or without. Like the spirals, washwater aids in the separation of the particles while increases the entrainment of the gangue in the concentrate.\n\n===Automated Ore Sorting===\n{{See also|Sensor-based sorting}}\nModern, automated sorting applies optical sensors (visible spectrum, near infrared, X-ray, ultraviolet), that can be coupled with electrical conductivity and magnetic susceptibility sensors, to control the mechanical separation of ore into two or more categories on an individual rock by rock basis. Also new sensors have been developed which exploit material properties such as electrical conductivity, magnetization, molecular structure and thermal conductivity. Sensor based sorting has found application in the processing of nickel, gold, copper, coal\nand diamonds.\n\n===Dewatering===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\nDewatering is an important process in mineral processing. The purpose of dewatering is to remove water absorbed by the particles which increases the pulp density. This is done for a number of reasons, specifically, to enable ore handling and concentrates to be transported easily, allow further processing to occur and to dispose of the gangue. The water extracted from the ore by dewatering is recirculated for plant operations after being sent to a water treatment plant. The main processes that are used in dewatering include dewatering screens such as [[Sepro Mineral Systems#Sepro-Sizetec Screens|Sepro-Sizetec Screens]], sedimentation, filtering, and thermal drying. These processes increase in difficulty and cost as the particle size decreases.\n\nDewatering screens operate by passing particles over a screen. The particles pass over the screen while the water passes through the apertures in the screen. This process is only viable for coarse ores that have a close size distribution as the apertures can allow small particles to pass through.\n\nSedimentation operates by passing water into a large thickener or clarifier. In these devices, the particles settle out of the slurry under the effects of gravity, or centripetal forces. These are limited by the surface chemistry of the particles and the size of the particles. To aid in the sedimentation process, flocculants and coagulants are added to reduce the repulsive forces between the particles. This repulsive force is due to the double layer formed on the surface of the particles. The flocculants work by binding multiple particles together while the coagulants work by reducing the thickness of the charged layer on the outside of the particle. After thickening, slurry is often stored in ponds or impoundments. Alternatively, it can pumped into a [[belt press]] or membrane [[filter press]] to recycle process water and create stackable, dry filter cake, or \"tailings\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Tons Per Hour Product Guide 2016|url=http://tonsperhour.com/wp-content/uploads/TPH_PG_2016_Eng.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThermal drying is usually used for fine particles and to remove low water content in the particles. Some common processes include rotary dryers, fluidised beds, spray driers, hearth dryers and rotary tray dryers. This process is usually expensive to operate due to the fuel requirement of the dryers.\n\n==Other processes==\nMany [[physical plant|mechanical plants]] also incorporate [[Hydrometallurgy|hydrometallurgical]] or [[Pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical]] processes as part of an extractive metallurgical operation.
