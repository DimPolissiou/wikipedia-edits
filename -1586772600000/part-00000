Their partnership was uniquely successful, Elvis being an entirely new force in popular music, and Parker an entrepreneur able to market him.\n\nAt age 18, Parker had arrived in America by jumping ship, and never held a US passport, even when the [[Smith Act|1940 Alien Registration Act]] would have entitled him to one. This is attributed to his uncertain legal status, possibly connected to police inquiries about a murder in his native [[Breda]]. To the puzzlement of overseas fans, he never worked abroad for fear of apprehension, nor did he allow Elvis to tour overseas. While Presley was stationed in [[West Germany]] during his [[Elvis Presley's Army career|two-year Army service]] from 1958 to 1960, Parker never left the borders of the United States. Parker's Dutch birthplace and immigrant status were not revealed for many years.\n\nA carnival worker by background, Parker moved into music promotion, earning the courtesy rank of \u2018Colonel\u2019 from a grateful singer [[Jimmie Davis]], who had become the [[Governor of Louisiana]]. After discovering the teenage [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]], Parker discovered the then-unknown Elvis Presley in 1955, and skillfully maneuvered himself into position as his sole representative with control over much of his private life. Within months, he had won Presley a recording contract with the prestigious RCA Victor record label, made him a star in 1956 with his first single \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", negotiated lucrative merchandising deals, and made plans for TV appearances as well as a new career as an actor in film musicals.\n\nWhen Presley was drafted into the US Army in 1958, Parker was shrewd enough to see that military service would boost his image, and made no attempt to stop his posting to [[West Germany|Germany]]. He also judged correctly that public demand would be whetted by his two-year absence, and he stage-managed a triumphal homecoming rail-tour to Memphis.\n\nBut the 1960s would impact hard on Elvis's public and private life. The youth market was suddenly being taken over by a new British band called [[The Beatles]]. The films became low-budget production-line work, however profitable. Also, Elvis's bachelor live-in arrangement with the teenage [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla Beaulieu]], against her father's wishes, threatened a possible image crisis, and Parker urged at marriage. By the end of the decade, Elvis had gone back on tour, but years of binge-eating and unofficially prescribed drugs had ruined his health, and Parker, realizing there was little profit margin left in Presley, saw very little of Presley before his death in August 1977.\n\nParker continued to manage the Presley estate, but he had unwisely sold the rights to Elvis's early recordings, which would have ensured a steady income.

Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.<ref name=\"Day\"/>\n\nDespite this hiccup in his career, Presley was still going from strength to strength. He had expressed interest in making films when he first met Parker, and now Parker was working to make that happen. He arranged for a screen test with [[Paramount Pictures]], and after impressing them with his acting ability, Presley was signed to a seven-picture contract.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=67}} Parker made sure that the contract allowed Presley the freedom to make at least one film a year with another studio, and also managed to set up an office, with staff, at Paramount. Presley's acting career was originally intended to be a serious one, but after seeing a chance to cross-promote singles and albums with the films, Parker persuaded him to sing in his films. This proved very lucrative, especially when the single for Presley's first film, ''[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]],'' sold over one million copies in advance sales. With 1956 coming to a close, Parker had made Presley one of the most well-known, well-paid entertainers in the world.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=94}}\n\nIn 1957, Parker finally managed to give Tommy Sands his big break by arranging for him to audition for and star in ''The Singin' Idol'', a drama for [[NBC]] that was loosely based on the life and career of Presley.<ref name=nash120/> NBC had originally wanted Presley for the role, but Parker had turned them down.<ref name=nash120/> In the drama the role of Parker was portrayed as a \"twisted psychopath\".<ref name=nash120/> Critics were very positive in their reviews of both the drama and Sands, leading to [[Capitol Records]] signing Sands within a week.<ref name=nash120/> Soon after, Sands' song \"[[Teen-Age Crush]]\" reached number 2 on the pop charts, eventually selling 800,000 copies.<ref name=nash120/>\n\n====Elvis in the Army (1958\u20131960)====\nRegardless of the success that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still struggling to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two.<ref name=\"Vel102\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his [[Conscription|draft notice]] from the United States Army.<ref name=\"Day4\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=95}}</ref> He was upset about the possibility of it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> \n\nPresley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\nParker was looking ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Presley had wanted to join [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], allowing him the opportunity to continue to perform while at the same time getting an easier ride than other soldiers.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\n\nWhile Presley was serving in West Germany, Parker was hard at work keeping his name known to the public. He realized that by keeping RCA, and more importantly the public, hungry for more Presley material, he would be able to negotiate a better contract for him when he returned from active service.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction,<ref name=\"Vel106\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period. RCA was eager for Presley to record in Germany, but Parker insisted that it would ruin his reputation as a regular soldier if he was able to go into a recording studio and sing.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> All of these stories were fabrications, but it kept his name in view of the public.\n\nParker appeared to be in complete control during Presley's time away, but he was worried about the outside influence that Presley might come across in Germany.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Parker had declined to travel to Europe, denying that he spoke any language other than English.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He sent Presley's friends to keep him company, arranged for business associates to watch over him while they were working in Europe, and kept in regular contact with him via telephone and letter.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He was reportedly afraid that Presley would realize that there were other managers available, contracts that did not require as much as 25% for his manager. Parker was still worried that Presley would return to nothing, that the public would have found a new star to fawn over by then, and that his golden goose would be reduced to nothing more than a \"has-been.\"<ref name=\"Vel106\"/>\n\n====Elvis returns (1960\u20131965)====\nFor Presley's return in March 1960, Parker had arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops along the way for fans to see their idol in person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=149}}</ref> If Parker had had any doubts about his return, they were soon gone when he witnessed the turnout along the route.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]], who had declared Presley and rock and roll a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show.<ref name=\"Vel112\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=112\u201315}}</ref> Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be {{US$|125000|1960|long=no|about=yes|round=-3}} for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=140}}</ref> but he agreed. The show, entitled \u201cWelcome Home, Elvis\u201d, was Presley's first national television appearance since ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in January 1957.\n\nAfter the Sinatra special, Parker decided that Presley's future lay in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He envisioned him as an entertainment machine, pumping out three films and soundtracks a year, until the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He allowed him to perform three live shows in 1961, all charity events, two in Memphis and one in Hawaii.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> After that, until 1968, Presley gave no live performances, and had very little contact with his fans.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> Parker signed long-term contracts with the film studios,<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> possibly to guarantee work and income for both him and Presley. This was, with hindsight, a mistake on his part; if he had negotiated each deal separately based on the profits of the previous film, he could have received more money.<ref name=\"Vel118\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=118\u2013121}}</ref> Throughout the 1960s Parker would continually renegotiate Presley's film contracts, often paying little attention to the scripts or the thoughts of his client.<ref name=doll139>Doll, ''Elvis for Dummies'', p. 139.</ref> These deals were sometimes so harsh on the studios that it led producer [[Hal Wallis]] to state, \"I'd rather try and close a deal with the Devil.\"<ref name=doll139/>\n\nPresley had to do no more than provide RCA with three albums a year,<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> and his film soundtracks did that for him. With no touring or public appearances to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. But as time went on, as [[the Beatles]] began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as [[Beatlemania]] began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/>\n\n====Dead ends (1966\u20131967)====\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not appear to care if the films were good or bad but only about the profits.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[The Beach Boys]] dominated the charts. Later in 1983, Parker admitted during an interview that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.\n<ref name=\"Vel127\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=127\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nTo make up for lack of earnings, Parker arranged for Presley's gold Cadillac to go on tour.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> Selling it to RCA for $24,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), it was used to promote Presley's latest film, ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1966 film)|Frankie & Johnny]].''<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> The Cadillac tour proved to be somewhat more successful than the film itself.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> In [[Houston]] alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to see it, with one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow her to sit in it.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 1967, Parker re-negotiated his managerial/agent contract with Presley, persuading him to increase Parker's share from 25% to 50% on certain transactions.

Presley had been living with [[Priscilla Beaulieu]], ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin \u2013 and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.\n\nParker hoped that marriage would not only boost Presley's career but also possibly tame him.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> With Priscilla's father dropping heavy hints, and fear that their relationship might become public beforehand, Parker persuaded Presley that he should make an \"honest woman\" of her in the very near future. However, it would be a quiet wedding. Parker decided that Las Vegas was the perfect place to do it,<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> and on May 1, 1967, the couple were married in a ceremony that lasted only eight minutes and had a handful of guests.<ref name=\"Vel134\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=134\u2013140}}</ref> A breakfast reception was arranged, taking place after the media got their photographs of the couple.<ref name=\"Vel134\"/>\n\n====The comeback (1968\u20131972)====\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker|Elvis Presley and Parker on a Hollywood film set, 1969]]\nIt took the energetic 1968 television special ''[[Singer Presents...ELVIS|Elvis]]'', which the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] sponsored, and a subsequent series of acclaimed recording sessions in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] that included songs such as \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\" and \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", to restore Presley's musical reputation. However, the music scene had radically changed. It was producer [[Steve Binder]] who put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits and even the staged section with his old band, [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D. J. Fontana]], the latter inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room. Presley was never one to stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a true comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it \"Binder's way.\" Their instincts were proven right; the TV special proved an enormous hit, and the album that was released featuring performances from the special became a best-seller. After the special, Parker managed Presley's return to live performance, including a set of brief U.S. tours and many engagements in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Following the success of Presley's Las Vegas return, Parker signed a contract with the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] to guarantee Presley would play a month-long engagement for $125,000 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), an unheard-of sum at the time. During this part of Presley's career, Parker and Presley agreed to a 50/50 \"partnership\", which, with Parker controlling merchandising and other non-music related items, resulted in Parker earning more than his client.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAfter the success of Presley's return to live performing in Las Vegas, Parker decided it was time to take him back out on tour for the first time in 13 years.<ref name=enc384>Victor, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pp. 384\u2013395</ref> The tours were so popular and financially successful that they determined Presley's workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker's main role during these tours was to plan the logistics and make sure tickets were sold.<ref name=enc384/> He would usually fly ahead to the venues and prepare the way for Presley's entourage to follow, so that he and Presley rarely saw each other, and as time progressed it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley.<ref name=enc384/> These live performances, as well as being financially satisfying, also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley's recording contract with RCA. Between 1969 and 1972 alone, RCA released three albums of live material.<ref>Carr & Farren, ''The Complete Illustrated Record''.</ref>\n\nBy 1972, Parker had managed to increase Presley's weekly wage in Las Vegas to $150,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), and secured $50,000 a year (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for himself as a \"consultant to the hotel chain\".{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Parker had also decided that it was time for Presley to return to New York, and had arranged for him to perform at [[Madison Square Garden]] in June.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Originally planned as three performances, demand was so high that Parker decided to add a fourth performance, making Presley the first performer to sell out the venue four consecutive times.

He suggested to Parker that, as Presley had recorded and was still performing the song \"[[I'll Remember You]]\" written by [[Kui Lee]], the donations could go to the Kui Lee Cancer Fund that had been set up following the death of the songwriter in 1966.<ref name=\"Gur478\"/> Seeing the chance to publicize Presley's charitable nature once again, Parker eagerly agreed.<ref name=\"Gur478\"/> The album was released simultaneously around the world, and went to number 1 on the US charts, the first Presley album to do so since the ''Roustabout'' soundtrack, in 1964.<ref name=\"Day322\"/>\n\n====Downhill (1973\u20131977)====\n\n=====1973\u20131974=====\n''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'' proved to be the last great moment in Presley's career. In May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley's growing dependence on prescription drugs, Presley's father, Vernon, and Parker attempted to cut off his supply.<ref name=doll236>{{cite book|last=Doll|first=Susan|title=Elvis for Dummies|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-47202-6|pages=}}</ref> They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and were successful in stopping any more from reaching Presley.<ref name=doll236/> However, it wasn't long before Presley was able to find other doctors to meet his demands.<ref name=doll236/> In later years, several of Presley's inner circle would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs.<ref name=doll236/> As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of access to drugs for themselves.<ref name=doll236/> Presley's main doctor, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], would often replace Presley's medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs.<ref name=doll236/> This would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick, he simply found himself other doctors.<ref name=doll236/> Author [[Alanna Nash]] suggests that one of the reasons Parker didn't do more is because he may have just not known how to handle the situation.<ref name=nash229>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 229</ref> In her book, ''The Colonel'', she writes \"in the days before the [[Betty Ford Clinic]], the Colonel didn't know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work if the truth got out.\"<ref name=nash229/>\n\nAfter the ''Aloha'' special, Parker made a deal that would later be used in court to prove that he had not acted in the best interests of Presley.<ref name=enc384/> He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million.<ref name=enc384/> At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973.<ref name=enc384/> To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement.<ref name=enc384/> \n\nFrom 1974 onward, Presley's weight gain and prescription drug abuse became too much to be controlled.<ref name=\"Nash286\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley |year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press |isbn=978-1-84513-025-1|pages=286\u2013295}}</ref> In Las Vegas he was starting to appear drugged on stage, slurring his words and forgetting song lyrics.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> \n\nDuring a closing night performance on September 3, 1973, following news that a Hilton staff member who Presley was fond of had been fired, he attacked [[Barron Hilton]] in a verbal rage on stage.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> Parker was furious, and he stormed into Presley's dressing room after the show to confront him. After a heated argument between the two, Presley told Parker he was fired.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> Angered by this outburst, Parker declared, \"You can't fire me. I quit!\"<ref name=\"Nash286\"/>\n\nParker accepted that their working relationship was over, and demanded that Presley pay him $2 million to end their contract; money Parker claimed he was owed.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> But Presley's father, Vernon, upon reading the bill Parker sent itemizing each cost individually, declared that they could not afford to buy out their contract.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> After nearly two weeks of trading insults back and forth, Parker and Presley decided to bury the hatchet and put the whole situation behind them.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/>\n\nAlthough many around Presley were worried about his worsening drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem.<ref name=nash384>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 384\u201390.</ref> Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was getting. However, other friends and members of Presley's entourage have stood by the suggestion that Parker didn't want to admit there was such a problem because he didn't know how to deal with it, and he was also worried about any negative publicity it would create.<ref name=nash384/> According to Parker himself, he did privately attempt to talk to his client a number of times about the matter, but that allegedly every time Parker casually told Presley to quit or at least tone it down with the pill popping and binge eating, Presley would respond by telling Parker, in a simple but firm tone, to stay out of his personal business.<ref name=nash384/>\n\n=====1975\u20131977=====\nIn February 1975, during his engagement in Las Vegas, Presley, along with Parker, met with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Jon Peters]].<ref name=nash384/> They discussed the possibility of Presley's co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film'' [[A Star is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]].''<ref name=nash384/> Seeing it as a chance to finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley's friend, [[Jerry Schilling]], Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge.<ref name=nash384/> Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley a salary of $500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and 10% of the profits.<ref name=nash384/> Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for expenses, and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal.<ref name=nash384/> First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counter-offer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to [[Kris Kristofferson]] who accepted.<ref name=nash384/> Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have contradicted Parker's statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role.<ref name=nash384/>\n\nLater in 1975, the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] offered Parker $5 million for Presley to perform there.<ref name=nash384/> Parker turned the offer down, and Presley was overjoyed when they replied with another offer of $10 million.<ref name=nash384/> Yet, despite Presley's eagerness to do the shows, Parker again turned them down.<ref name=nash384/> Promoters in South America also made offers, as much as $2.5 million, and all of them were turned down by Parker; \"Well, whenever I need $2.5 million I'll call you\" he once said to them.<ref name=nash384/> Presley was beginning to consider new management, with ''[[Concerts West]]'' co-founder Tom Hulett being the clear favorite for the job.<ref name=nash384/> Hulett's company had managed tours for Presley, and he had worked with artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]]. According to several people who knew Presley at the time, the talks with Hulett got so far along that it seemed almost inevitable the deal would be done. The talks had included details about European tours, and buying out Presley's contract would not have been a problem for Hulett and his company.<ref name=nash384/> Despite this, however, the deal never materialized. According to Presley's biographer [[Peter Guralnick]], Presley and Parker \"were really like, in a sense, a married couple, who started out with great love, loyalty, respect that lasted for a considerable period of time, and went through a number of stages until, towards the end of Presley's life, they should have walked away. None of the rules of the relationship were operative any longer, yet neither had the courage to walk away, for a variety of reasons.\" In any case, Parker remained Presley's manager without a break until Presley's death in 1977.\n\nBy this time, Parker was aware that Presley needed a rest from touring and the chance to deal with his prescription drug addictions.<ref name=nash390>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 290\u2013295.</ref> He phoned Presley's father once to suggest taking time off, but Vernon Presley told him they couldn't afford to stop touring due to Presley's constant and lavish spending of money.<ref name=nash390/> Vernon also threatened to find a new manager if Parker wouldn't continue to tour Presley.<ref name=nash390/>\n\nIn July 1976, three of Presley's personal bodyguards and members of the \"Memphis Mafia\", [[Red West|Robert Gene \"Red\" West]], his cousin [[Sonny West (actor)|Sonny West]] and David Hebler, were fired by Vernon Presley and decided to write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle, entitled ''[[Elvis: What Happened?]]'' <ref name=nash298>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 298\u2013302</ref> Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the publication of the book. Parker made several attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so.<ref name=nash298/> According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do something about it.<ref name=nash298/> The book would eventually be published one year later on July 12, 1977, one month before Presley's death.\n\nFor the remainder of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale.<ref name=nash298/> Although Parker publicly denied these claims, he had been in talks with [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], manager of [[Led Zeppelin]], about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley.<ref name=nash298/> As with all the talk about Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.\n\n=====Touring abroad=====\nSome have speculated that the reason Presley only performed abroad once during his career, failing to undertake the highly lucrative prospect of touring other countries and continents, may have been that Parker was worried that he would not have been able to acquire a U.S. passport and might even have been deported upon filing his application. Although Parker was a U.S. Army veteran and the spouse of an American citizen, one of the basic tenets of U.S. immigration law is that unless an application is made as part of an amnesty program, there are few paths to citizenship or even legal residency for those who entered the country illegally.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Julia|title=Tweak in Rule to Ease a Path to Green Card|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/path-to-green-card-for-illegal-immigrant-family-members-of-americans.html|accessdate=December 19, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> As Parker had not availed himself of the 1940 Alien Registration Act, and there was no amnesty program available to him afterwards and he was reportedly ineligible for US citizenship.{{cn}\n\nThroughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States \u2013 all of them in Canada: [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Vancouver]], during brief tours there in 1957. At the time of those concerts, crossing the US-Canada border did not require a passport. [[Red Robinson]], Vancouver radio icon and MC of the Presley concert in that city, said Parker did not accompany Presley to that show, but instead stayed in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. However, it is well-established that Parker did not accompany Presley on every tour and every performance date, even in the US, suggesting this may not have been the only rationale for Presley not performing abroad.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nRumors Presley would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an [[Australia]]n tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. Parker ultimately quashed any notions Presley had of working abroad, although Presley did not push the issue, either.<ref>Stanly & Coffey, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pg. 123.</ref>\n\nTo cover up Parker's need for questioning in criminal activity, many theories for Presley's lack of touring abroad have surfaced, including the following:\n* Parker's claims that foreign security was poor, relative to the USA.\n* Parker's belief that outside influences (managers, agents etc.) would inform Presley of how unusual his contract with Parker was.\n* Parker's claim that there was a lack of venues large enough to accommodate a star of Presley's stature. All of these excuses were given to Presley when he would show an interest in touring abroad and, known to avoid confrontation, Presley would never argue with Parker.\n* Some promoters wanted to charge fans the equivalent of $100 per ticket. Parker did not wish the fans to be ripped off, and this was another reason he turned down overseas offers.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Presley's death====\nWhen [[Elvis Presley#Final months and death|Presley died in August 1977]], one day before he was due to go out on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened.<ref name=\"Victor392\">{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Adam|title=The Elvis Encyclopedia |year=2008|publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co Ltd|isbn=978-0-7156-3816-3|pages=392\u2013393}}</ref> Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered \"oh dear God\", and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley where Parker advised Presley's father that his son's image needed to be protected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Roy|title=Elvis: The Illustrated Record |year=1982|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53979-9|pages=}}</ref>\n\nParker set out to protect his future income. Asked by a journalist what he would do now, Parker responded, \"Why, I'll just go right on managing him!\"<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Almost immediately, before even visiting Graceland, Parker traveled to New York City to meet with merchandising associates and RCA executives, instructing them to prepare for a huge demand in Presley products.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Shortly afterward, he traveled to Memphis for Presley's funeral. Mourners recall being surprised at his wearing a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap, smoking his trademark cigar, and purposely avoiding the casket.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> At the funeral, he persuaded Presley's father to sign over control of Presley's career in death to him.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/>\n\nIn September 1978, shortly after the first anniversary of Presley's death, Parker arranged a fan festival, ''Always Elvis'', where he, Vernon, and Presley's ex-wife [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla]], dedicated a bronze statue of him in the lobby of the [[Westgate Las Vegas|Las Vegas Hilton]].<ref name=nash315>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 315</ref>\n\n====After Elvis====\nFollowing Presley's death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc.

Inc.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley's income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, it was discovered that Presley had lost out on royalties for songs on which he had been listed as an author and/or composer because Parker had unwisely advised him not to sign up to [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] or its younger competitor, [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]].<ref name=\"BMI\">{{cite book|last=Jobe Pierce|first=Patricia|title=The Ultimate Elvis|year=1994|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0-671-87022-5|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateelviselv0000pier}}</ref> Experts in the field at the time estimated that it had potentially cost Presley millions of dollars<ref name=\"BMI\"/> and worse for Parker, it had also potentially cost him those millions of dollars.

Tual to investigate Parker's management.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> Tual, once appointed as Lisa Marie's ''guardian ad litem'', chose to investigate the entire period of Parker's management of Presley; his preliminary finding was that Parker's management deal of 50% was extortionate compared to the industry average of 15\u201320%.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He also noted that Parker's handling of Presley's business affairs during his lifetime, including the decision to sell off past royalties to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973, was \"unethical\" and poorly handled.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> During a second, more detailed investigation, Tual discovered that all earnings were paid directly to the Trust instead of Parker.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> By this time, with the IRS demanding almost $15 million in taxes, the estate was facing bankruptcy.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nOn August 14, 1981, Judge Evans ordered EPE to sue Parker for mismanagement.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> In response to this, Parker countersued.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> The case against Parker was settled out of court in 1983, with the estate paying him $2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}})<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> in exchange for all Presley audio recordings or visual images that he owned<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and the termination of his involvement in any Presley related earnings for five years.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nParker had worked as a \"consultant\" for [[Hilton Hotels]] since Presley's death,<ref name=\"Nash328\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|pages=328\u2013335}}</ref> with some believing he was working to pay off debts owed to the casino from his gambling during Presley's performances there.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> Part of this role resulted in Parker keeping the same fourth-floor suite he occupied when Presley was alive, but by 1984, with his gambling debts reportedly rising again, he was evicted.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> On the surface, however, relations between the two were as good as ever, with Parker helping the Hilton to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Presley's death.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nThe disputes with the Presley estate did not terminate his association with his most high-profile client. Parker appeared at posthumous events honoring Presley, such as the 1993 issuing of the [[United States Postal Service]] stamp honoring the King of Rock and Roll. He also became friendly with the estate again, attending special ceremonies and events in Memphis, invited by Priscilla.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> However, he did occasionally step on their toes by commenting negatively on some of their decisions. In 1994, following the marriage of Lisa Marie and Michael Jackson, Parker stated that Presley would not have approved,<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> and in 1993, interest in Presley's enduring legend, interest that is sometimes notable for its obsessiveness, provoked Parker to remark, \"I don't think I exploited Elvis as much as he's being exploited today.\"<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nIn 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California was dedicated to him.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\nAs Presley's fame grew, people became interested in Parker as well. For a time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming to have been born in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]], West Virginia, (to explain his Dutch accent as being a Southern accent) and to have run away at an early age to join a circus run by an uncle. The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker's sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the [[Netherlands]], recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley.<ref>https://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/elvis-presley-col-tom-parker.html</ref>\n\nOne of Parker's brothers, Adam \"Ad\" van Kuijk, visited Parker once in [[Los Angeles]] in April 1961. Parker privately acknowledged his brother and introduced him to Presley. During the week-long visit, Parker was informed by Adam van Kuijk that their mother had died three years earlier in 1958, never knowing what happened to her son after he left the Netherlands for good in 1929. Adam van Kuijk later died from emphysema in 1992, never seeing or visiting Parker again.<ref>https://www.elvis.com.au/presley/andreas-van-kuijk.shtml</ref>\n\nThe claim of Parker's Dutch heritage was publicly confirmed when Parker tried to avert a lawsuit brought against him in 1982 by asserting in open court that he was a Dutch citizen. In 1993, in one of his last media appearances, Parker appeared in a television interview with Dutch TV director [[Jorrit van der Kooi]] where they spoke to each other in Dutch about the Netherlands and about Elvis Presley's life and career. During the interview, Parker said that he was not aware that another one of his sisters, named Adriana van Kuijk, had died in the Netherlands a few years before.\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott.<ref name=\"Vellenga\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and The Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=49\u201351}}</ref> Marie was one of six children,<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> had been married twice before, and had a son from her first marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> Unbeknownst to Parker at the time, she had a second son from her first marriage, but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability (a [[club foot]]).{{sfn|Nash|2002|p=71}} Some have suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the US;<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> a marriage to a US citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a \"ready-made family\".<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> However, there is no definite proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/>\n\nOthers, however, have doubts about whether they were legally married at all.<ref name=\"Nash\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|ref=harv|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> According to interviews given by Parker to the [[Associated Press]] many years later, he and Marie were married in [[Tampa, Florida]] during the winter of 1932,<ref name=\"Nash\"/> but the Florida Office of Vital Statistics has no record of such a marriage any time between 1927 and 1946.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> It is also recorded that Marie did not divorce her second husband until 1936, and her brother, [[Bitsy Mott|Bitsy]], recalls no ceremony of marriage between Parker and Marie.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> Author Alanna Nash suggests the couple may have simply placed their hands on a Bible and given themselves a \"carny wedding\".<ref name=\"Nash\"/>\n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Marie and Parker worked together in the carnivals.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> As Parker's management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country.

In the scene, Parker is satirically portrayed as a gluttonous, satanic figure. The scene contrasts Parker's management of Elvis with the freedom Epstein allows the Beatles. The scene also portrays Parker as [[anti-semitic]]. Tiwary claimed in an interview that Parker did make those comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/188384/meet-the-fifth-jewish-beatle-manager-brian-epste/|title=Meet the Fifth (Jewish) Beatle \u2013 Manager Brian Epstein|date=December 4, 2013|work=The Forward}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n{{in popular culture|section|date=January 2019}}\n\n*Parker is also mentioned in the fifth episode of ''[[Archer Vice]]'', entitled \"Southbound and Down\".

Their partnership was uniquely successful, Elvis being an entirely new force in popular music, and Parker an entrepreneur able to market him.\n\nAt age 18, Parker had arrived in America by jumping ship, and never held a US passport, even when the [[Smith Act|1940 Alien Registration Act]] would have entitled him to one. This is attributed to his uncertain legal status, possibly connected to police inquiries about a murder in his native [[Breda]]. To the puzzlement of overseas fans, he never worked abroad for fear of apprehension, nor did he allow Elvis to tour overseas. While Presley was stationed in [[West Germany]] during his [[Elvis Presley's Army career|two-year Army service]] from 1958 to 1960, Parker never left the borders of the United States. Parker's Dutch birthplace and immigrant status were not revealed for many years.\n\nA carnival worker by background, Parker moved into music promotion, earning the courtesy rank of \u2018Colonel\u2019 from a grateful singer [[Jimmie Davis]], who had become the [[Governor of Louisiana]]. After discovering the teenage [[Tommy Sands (American singer)|Tommy Sands]], Parker discovered the then-unknown Elvis Presley in 1955, and skillfully maneuvered himself into position as his sole representative with control over much of his private life. Within months, he had won Presley a recording contract with the prestigious RCA Victor record label, made him a star in 1956 with his first single \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", negotiated lucrative merchandising deals, and made plans for TV appearances as well as a new career as an actor in film musicals.\n\nWhen Presley was drafted into the US Army in 1958, Parker was shrewd enough to see that military service would boost his image, and made no attempt to stop his posting to [[West Germany|Germany]]. He also judged correctly that public demand would be whetted by his two-year absence, and he stage-managed a triumphal homecoming rail-tour to Memphis.\n\nBut the 1960s would impact hard on Elvis's public and private life. The youth market was suddenly being taken over by a new British band called [[The Beatles]]. The films became low-budget production-line work, however profitable. Also, Elvis's bachelor live-in arrangement with the teenage [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla Beaulieu]], against her father's wishes, threatened a possible image crisis, and Parker urged at marriage. By the end of the decade, Elvis had gone back on tour, but years of binge-eating and unofficially prescribed drugs had ruined his health, and Parker, realizing there was little profit margin left in Presley, saw very little of Presley before his death in August 1977.\n\nParker continued to manage the Presley estate, but he had unwisely sold the rights to Elvis's early recordings, which would have ensured a steady income.

Presley would later remember the event as one of the worst moments of his career.<ref name=\"Day\"/>\n\nDespite this hiccup in his career, Presley was still going from strength to strength. He had expressed interest in making films when he first met Parker, and now Parker was working to make that happen. He arranged for a screen test with [[Paramount Pictures]], and after impressing them with his acting ability, Presley was signed to a seven-picture contract.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=67}} Parker made sure that the contract allowed Presley the freedom to make at least one film a year with another studio, and also managed to set up an office, with staff, at Paramount. Presley's acting career was originally intended to be a serious one, but after seeing a chance to cross-promote singles and albums with the films, Parker persuaded him to sing in his films. This proved very lucrative, especially when the single for Presley's first film, ''[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]],'' sold over one million copies in advance sales. With 1956 coming to a close, Parker had made Presley one of the most well-known, well-paid entertainers in the world.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=94}}\n\nIn 1957, Parker finally managed to give Tommy Sands his big break by arranging for him to audition for and star in ''The Singin' Idol'', a drama for [[NBC]] that was loosely based on the life and career of Presley.<ref name=nash120/> NBC had originally wanted Presley for the role, but Parker had turned them down.<ref name=nash120/> In the drama the role of Parker was portrayed as a \"twisted psychopath\".<ref name=nash120/> Critics were very positive in their reviews of both the drama and Sands, leading to [[Capitol Records]] signing Sands within a week.<ref name=nash120/> Soon after, Sands' song \"[[Teen-Age Crush]]\" reached number 2 on the pop charts, eventually selling 800,000 copies.<ref name=nash120/>\n\n====Elvis in the Army (1958\u20131960)====\nRegardless of the success that Parker and Presley had achieved, Parker was still struggling to believe that Presley's career would last longer than a year or two.<ref name=\"Vel102\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=102\u2013103}}</ref> He had seen many acts come and go during his earlier years in management, and felt that to think that Presley, despite being Parker's most successful act to date, would be any different, was foolish. In January 1958 Presley received his [[Conscription|draft notice]] from the United States Army.<ref name=\"Day4\">{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=95}}</ref> He was upset about the possibility of it affecting his career, but Parker was secretly overjoyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> \n\nPresley had been showing signs of rebellion against him recently, and Parker believed that a stint in the Army would cure him of this.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\nParker was looking ahead to the future when he persuaded Presley to sign up as a regular soldier.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Presley had wanted to join [[Special Services (entertainment)|Special Services]], allowing him the opportunity to continue to perform while at the same time getting an easier ride than other soldiers.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> Parker, on the other hand, was fully aware that any special treatment given to Presley would instantly be used against him in the media and by those who disliked his style of music.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> If Presley could show the world that he was just the same as any other young man, Parker told him, then more people would be likely to accept him and his music. Parker was also afraid that any attempt to block Presley from being drafted would result in a more detailed look into his own service record.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He also realized that it would be a great opportunity to promote Presley by having the media witness his induction day, including the Army haircut that would see the most famous hair style in the world destroyed.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/>\n\nWhile Presley was serving in West Germany, Parker was hard at work keeping his name known to the public. He realized that by keeping RCA, and more importantly the public, hungry for more Presley material, he would be able to negotiate a better contract for him when he returned from active service.<ref name=\"Vel102\"/> He had arranged for Presley to record five singles before his induction,<ref name=\"Vel106\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> guaranteeing RCA enough material to release over a two-year period. RCA was eager for Presley to record in Germany, but Parker insisted that it would ruin his reputation as a regular soldier if he was able to go into a recording studio and sing.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Stories appeared in the press regularly about Presley, including that he would do a live CCTV broadcast when he returned and that he had signed a deal for a series of annual television spectaculars to be broadcast across the country.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> All of these stories were fabrications, but it kept his name in view of the public.\n\nParker appeared to be in complete control during Presley's time away, but he was worried about the outside influence that Presley might come across in Germany.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> Parker had declined to travel to Europe, denying that he spoke any language other than English.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He sent Presley's friends to keep him company, arranged for business associates to watch over him while they were working in Europe, and kept in regular contact with him via telephone and letter.<ref name=\"Vel106\"/> He was reportedly afraid that Presley would realize that there were other managers available, contracts that did not require as much as 25% for his manager. Parker was still worried that Presley would return to nothing, that the public would have found a new star to fawn over by then, and that his golden goose would be reduced to nothing more than a \"has-been.\"<ref name=\"Vel106\"/>\n\n====Elvis returns (1960\u20131965)====\nFor Presley's return in March 1960, Parker had arranged for a train to take him from Washington, D.C., to Memphis, with stops along the way for fans to see their idol in person.<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|pages=149}}</ref> If Parker had had any doubts about his return, they were soon gone when he witnessed the turnout along the route.\n\n[[Frank Sinatra]], who had declared Presley and rock and roll a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show.<ref name=\"Vel112\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=112\u201315}}</ref> Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be {{US$|125000|1960|long=no|about=yes|round=-3}} for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show,<ref>{{cite book|last=Guralnick|first=Peter|title=Elvis Day by Day|year=1999|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=978-0-345-42089-3|page=140}}</ref> but he agreed. The show, entitled \u201cWelcome Home, Elvis\u201d, was Presley's first national television appearance since ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in January 1957.\n\nAfter the Sinatra special, Parker decided that Presley's future lay in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He envisioned him as an entertainment machine, pumping out three films and soundtracks a year, until the end of the decade.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> He allowed him to perform three live shows in 1961, all charity events, two in Memphis and one in Hawaii.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> After that, until 1968, Presley gave no live performances, and had very little contact with his fans.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> Parker signed long-term contracts with the film studios,<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> possibly to guarantee work and income for both him and Presley. This was, with hindsight, a mistake on his part; if he had negotiated each deal separately based on the profits of the previous film, he could have received more money.<ref name=\"Vel118\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=118\u2013121}}</ref> Throughout the 1960s Parker would continually renegotiate Presley's film contracts, often paying little attention to the scripts or the thoughts of his client.<ref name=doll139>Doll, ''Elvis for Dummies'', p. 139.</ref> These deals were sometimes so harsh on the studios that it led producer [[Hal Wallis]] to state, \"I'd rather try and close a deal with the Devil.\"<ref name=doll139/>\n\nPresley had to do no more than provide RCA with three albums a year,<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> and his film soundtracks did that for him. With no touring or public appearances to be made, Parker was able to keep costs to a minimum.<ref name=\"Vel112\"/> For the first few years Presley's films were somewhat successful, his albums topped the charts, and any singles that were released were mostly hits. But as time went on, as [[the Beatles]] began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as [[Beatlemania]] began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/>\n\n====Dead ends (1966\u20131967)====\nFor the remainder of the 1960s, Presley made films that relied heavily on exotic locations and mundane songs, and he was tied into contracts that he could not escape. Parker did not appear to care if the films were good or bad but only about the profits.<ref name=\"Vel118\"/> When Presley complained to him that he wanted better scripts, Parker reminded him of his lavish lifestyle and that risking $1 million a year for doing practically no work was dangerous. Presley's career stagnated while artists like [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], and [[The Beach Boys]] dominated the charts. Later in 1983, Parker admitted during an interview that after 1966, the income from Presley films and soundtracks was dramatically reduced.\n<ref name=\"Vel127\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=127\u2013131}}</ref>\n\nTo make up for lack of earnings, Parker arranged for Presley's gold Cadillac to go on tour.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> Selling it to RCA for $24,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|24000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), it was used to promote Presley's latest film, ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1966 film)|Frankie & Johnny]].''<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> The Cadillac tour proved to be somewhat more successful than the film itself.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> In [[Houston]] alone in one afternoon, 40,000 people paid to see it, with one woman offering to have sex with the tour manager if he would allow her to sit in it.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/>\n\nOn January 2, 1967, Parker re-negotiated his managerial/agent contract with Presley, persuading him to increase Parker's share from 25% to 50% on certain transactions.

Presley had been living with [[Priscilla Beaulieu]], ten years his junior, for the past four years, but it had not been public knowledge. [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s career had been almost destroyed when it came out that he had married his 13-year-old cousin \u2013 and Parker was not going to let a similar scandal happen to Presley.\n\nParker hoped that marriage would not only boost Presley's career but also possibly tame him.<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> With Priscilla's father dropping heavy hints, and fear that their relationship might become public beforehand, Parker persuaded Presley that he should make an \"honest woman\" of her in the very near future. However, it would be a quiet wedding. Parker decided that Las Vegas was the perfect place to do it,<ref name=\"Vel127\"/> and on May 1, 1967, the couple were married in a ceremony that lasted only eight minutes and had a handful of guests.<ref name=\"Vel134\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and the Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=134\u2013140}}</ref> A breakfast reception was arranged, taking place after the media got their photographs of the couple.<ref name=\"Vel134\"/>\n\n====The comeback (1968\u20131972)====\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker 1969.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of Elvis Presley and Colonel Tom Parker|Elvis Presley and Parker on a Hollywood film set, 1969]]\nIt took the energetic 1968 television special ''[[Singer Presents...ELVIS|Elvis]]'', which the [[Singer Corporation|Singer Company]] sponsored, and a subsequent series of acclaimed recording sessions in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] that included songs such as \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\" and \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", to restore Presley's musical reputation. However, the music scene had radically changed. It was producer [[Steve Binder]] who put forward the idea of Presley singing his old hits and even the staged section with his old band, [[Scotty Moore]] and [[D. J. Fontana]], the latter inspired by a post-rehearsal informal jam in Presley's dressing room. Presley was never one to stand up against Parker, but he knew that this TV show was his one chance at a true comeback, and with Binder backing him, Presley told Parker he was doing it \"Binder's way.\" Their instincts were proven right; the TV special proved an enormous hit, and the album that was released featuring performances from the special became a best-seller. After the special, Parker managed Presley's return to live performance, including a set of brief U.S. tours and many engagements in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Following the success of Presley's Las Vegas return, Parker signed a contract with the [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] to guarantee Presley would play a month-long engagement for $125,000 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|125000|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), an unheard-of sum at the time. During this part of Presley's career, Parker and Presley agreed to a 50/50 \"partnership\", which, with Parker controlling merchandising and other non-music related items, resulted in Parker earning more than his client.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nAfter the success of Presley's return to live performing in Las Vegas, Parker decided it was time to take him back out on tour for the first time in 13 years.<ref name=enc384>Victor, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pp. 384\u2013395</ref> The tours were so popular and financially successful that they determined Presley's workload for the remainder of his life and career. Parker's main role during these tours was to plan the logistics and make sure tickets were sold.<ref name=enc384/> He would usually fly ahead to the venues and prepare the way for Presley's entourage to follow, so that he and Presley rarely saw each other, and as time progressed it became even more difficult for Parker to get in contact with Presley.<ref name=enc384/> These live performances, as well as being financially satisfying, also allowed Parker to fulfill Presley's recording contract with RCA. Between 1969 and 1972 alone, RCA released three albums of live material.<ref>Carr & Farren, ''The Complete Illustrated Record''.</ref>\n\nBy 1972, Parker had managed to increase Presley's weekly wage in Las Vegas to $150,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|150000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), and secured $50,000 a year (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1972}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for himself as a \"consultant to the hotel chain\".{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Parker had also decided that it was time for Presley to return to New York, and had arranged for him to perform at [[Madison Square Garden]] in June.{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=273\u2013275}} Originally planned as three performances, demand was so high that Parker decided to add a fourth performance, making Presley the first performer to sell out the venue four consecutive times.

He suggested to Parker that, as Presley had recorded and was still performing the song \"[[I'll Remember You]]\" written by [[Kui Lee]], the donations could go to the Kui Lee Cancer Fund that had been set up following the death of the songwriter in 1966.<ref name=\"Gur478\"/> Seeing the chance to publicize Presley's charitable nature once again, Parker eagerly agreed.<ref name=\"Gur478\"/> The album was released simultaneously around the world, and went to number 1 on the US charts, the first Presley album to do so since the ''Roustabout'' soundtrack, in 1964.<ref name=\"Day322\"/>\n\n====Downhill (1973\u20131977)====\n\n=====1973\u20131974=====\n''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]'' proved to be the last great moment in Presley's career. In May 1973, in an attempt to deal with Presley's growing dependence on prescription drugs, Presley's father, Vernon, and Parker attempted to cut off his supply.<ref name=doll236>{{cite book|last=Doll|first=Susan|title=Elvis for Dummies|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-47202-6|pages=}}</ref> They hired private detectives to find out where the drugs were coming from and were successful in stopping any more from reaching Presley.<ref name=doll236/> However, it wasn't long before Presley was able to find other doctors to meet his demands.<ref name=doll236/> In later years, several of Presley's inner circle would tell of how difficult it was to persuade Presley to quit the drugs.<ref name=doll236/> As well as being their employer and paying their wages, he was also their main source of access to drugs for themselves.<ref name=doll236/> Presley's main doctor, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], would often replace Presley's medication with placebos in an attempt to wean him off the drugs.<ref name=doll236/> This would be successful for a short time, but when Presley discovered the trick, he simply found himself other doctors.<ref name=doll236/> Author [[Alanna Nash]] suggests that one of the reasons Parker didn't do more is because he may have just not known how to handle the situation.<ref name=nash229>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 229</ref> In her book, ''The Colonel'', she writes \"in the days before the [[Betty Ford Clinic]], the Colonel didn't know where to take him for discreet, effective help and loathed risking the loss of work if the truth got out.\"<ref name=nash229/>\n\nAfter the ''Aloha'' special, Parker made a deal that would later be used in court to prove that he had not acted in the best interests of Presley.<ref name=enc384/> He offered RCA the opportunity to buy Presley's entire back catalog for a mere $5.4 million.<ref name=enc384/> At the time, Presley's back catalog was not considered that important and RCA initially calculated it at being worth much less, but in later years it would become one of the most valuable catalogs in the music business. The sale of the catalog to RCA meant that after his death Presley's estate would not receive any royalties for his songs prior to 1973.<ref name=enc384/> To be fair to Parker, however, Presley had asked him to raise funds to pay for his upcoming divorce settlement.<ref name=enc384/> \n\nFrom 1974 onward, Presley's weight gain and prescription drug abuse became too much to be controlled.<ref name=\"Nash286\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley |year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press |isbn=978-1-84513-025-1|pages=286\u2013295}}</ref> In Las Vegas he was starting to appear drugged on stage, slurring his words and forgetting song lyrics.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> \n\nDuring a closing night performance on September 3, 1973, following news that a Hilton staff member who Presley was fond of had been fired, he attacked [[Barron Hilton]] in a verbal rage on stage.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> Parker was furious, and he stormed into Presley's dressing room after the show to confront him. After a heated argument between the two, Presley told Parker he was fired.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> Angered by this outburst, Parker declared, \"You can't fire me. I quit!\"<ref name=\"Nash286\"/>\n\nParker accepted that their working relationship was over, and demanded that Presley pay him $2 million to end their contract; money Parker claimed he was owed.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> But Presley's father, Vernon, upon reading the bill Parker sent itemizing each cost individually, declared that they could not afford to buy out their contract.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/> After nearly two weeks of trading insults back and forth, Parker and Presley decided to bury the hatchet and put the whole situation behind them.<ref name=\"Nash286\"/>\n\nAlthough many around Presley were worried about his worsening drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem.<ref name=nash384>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 384\u201390.</ref> Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was getting. However, other friends and members of Presley's entourage have stood by the suggestion that Parker didn't want to admit there was such a problem because he didn't know how to deal with it, and he was also worried about any negative publicity it would create.<ref name=nash384/> According to Parker himself, he did privately attempt to talk to his client a number of times about the matter, but that allegedly every time Parker casually told Presley to quit or at least tone it down with the pill popping and binge eating, Presley would respond by telling Parker, in a simple but firm tone, to stay out of his personal business.<ref name=nash384/>\n\n=====1975\u20131977=====\nIn February 1975, during his engagement in Las Vegas, Presley, along with Parker, met with [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[Jon Peters]].<ref name=nash384/> They discussed the possibility of Presley's co-starring with Streisand in a remake of the film'' [[A Star is Born (1976 film)|A Star is Born]].''<ref name=nash384/> Seeing it as a chance to finally be taken seriously as an actor, Presley agreed to take the role if the contracts could be worked out. According to Presley's friend, [[Jerry Schilling]], Presley was excited about the opportunity to take on a new challenge.<ref name=nash384/> Streisand's production company, First Artists, offered Presley a salary of $500,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and 10% of the profits.<ref name=nash384/> Parker, who had always dealt with Presley's film contracts and viewed the offer as a starting bid to earning more money, instead asked for a salary $1 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}), 50% of the profits, plus another $100,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1975}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for expenses, and spoke of needing to arrange details of a soundtrack deal.<ref name=nash384/> First Artists, not used to such huge demands, didn't put forward a counter-offer and decided instead to offer the role, along with the original salary offer, to [[Kris Kristofferson]] who accepted.<ref name=nash384/> Parker later claimed that Presley had asked him to make the contract so demanding so that they would not offer him the part, although many of Presley's friends have contradicted Parker's statement because they had said Presley was furious at losing the role.<ref name=nash384/>\n\nLater in 1975, the government of [[Saudi Arabia]] offered Parker $5 million for Presley to perform there.<ref name=nash384/> Parker turned the offer down, and Presley was overjoyed when they replied with another offer of $10 million.<ref name=nash384/> Yet, despite Presley's eagerness to do the shows, Parker again turned them down.<ref name=nash384/> Promoters in South America also made offers, as much as $2.5 million, and all of them were turned down by Parker; \"Well, whenever I need $2.5 million I'll call you\" he once said to them.<ref name=nash384/> Presley was beginning to consider new management, with ''[[Concerts West]]'' co-founder Tom Hulett being the clear favorite for the job.<ref name=nash384/> Hulett's company had managed tours for Presley, and he had worked with artists such as [[Led Zeppelin]]. According to several people who knew Presley at the time, the talks with Hulett got so far along that it seemed almost inevitable the deal would be done. The talks had included details about European tours, and buying out Presley's contract would not have been a problem for Hulett and his company.<ref name=nash384/> Despite this, however, the deal never materialized. According to Presley's biographer [[Peter Guralnick]], Presley and Parker \"were really like, in a sense, a married couple, who started out with great love, loyalty, respect that lasted for a considerable period of time, and went through a number of stages until, towards the end of Presley's life, they should have walked away. None of the rules of the relationship were operative any longer, yet neither had the courage to walk away, for a variety of reasons.\" In any case, Parker remained Presley's manager without a break until Presley's death in 1977.\n\nBy this time, Parker was aware that Presley needed a rest from touring and the chance to deal with his prescription drug addictions.<ref name=nash390>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 290\u2013295.</ref> He phoned Presley's father once to suggest taking time off, but Vernon Presley told him they couldn't afford to stop touring due to Presley's constant and lavish spending of money.<ref name=nash390/> Vernon also threatened to find a new manager if Parker wouldn't continue to tour Presley.<ref name=nash390/>\n\nIn July 1976, three of Presley's personal bodyguards and members of the \"Memphis Mafia\", [[Red West|Robert Gene \"Red\" West]], his cousin [[Sonny West (actor)|Sonny West]] and David Hebler, were fired by Vernon Presley and decided to write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle, entitled ''[[Elvis: What Happened?]]'' <ref name=nash298>Nash, ''The Colonel'', pp. 298\u2013302</ref> Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the publication of the book. Parker made several attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so.<ref name=nash298/> According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade him to do something about it.<ref name=nash298/> The book would eventually be published one year later on July 12, 1977, one month before Presley's death.\n\nFor the remainder of Presley's life, Parker would see very little of him. The two had become almost strangers to each other, and false reports in the media suggested that Presley's contract was up for sale.<ref name=nash298/> Although Parker publicly denied these claims, he had been in talks with [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]], manager of [[Led Zeppelin]], about the possibility of him overseeing a European tour for Presley.<ref name=nash298/> As with all the talk about Presley touring overseas, Parker never followed through with the deal.\n\n=====Touring abroad=====\nSome have speculated that the reason Presley only performed abroad once during his career, failing to undertake the highly lucrative prospect of touring other countries and continents, may have been that Parker was worried that he would not have been able to acquire a U.S. passport and might even have been deported upon filing his application. Although Parker was a U.S. Army veteran and the spouse of an American citizen, one of the basic tenets of U.S. immigration law is that unless an application is made as part of an amnesty program, there are few paths to citizenship or even legal residency for those who entered the country illegally.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Julia|title=Tweak in Rule to Ease a Path to Green Card|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/path-to-green-card-for-illegal-immigrant-family-members-of-americans.html|accessdate=December 19, 2017|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 6, 2012}}</ref> As Parker had not availed himself of the 1940 Alien Registration Act, and there was no amnesty program available to him afterwards and he was reportedly ineligible for US citizenship.{{cn}\n\nThroughout his entire career, Presley performed in only three venues outside the United States \u2013 all of them in Canada: [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] and [[Vancouver]], during brief tours there in 1957. At the time of those concerts, crossing the US-Canada border did not require a passport. [[Red Robinson]], Vancouver radio icon and MC of the Presley concert in that city, said Parker did not accompany Presley to that show, but instead stayed in [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. However, it is well-established that Parker did not accompany Presley on every tour and every performance date, even in the US, suggesting this may not have been the only rationale for Presley not performing abroad.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nRumors Presley would play overseas for the first time were fueled in 1974 by a million-dollar bid for an [[Australia]]n tour. Parker was uncharacteristically reluctant, prompting those close to Presley to speculate about the manager's past and the reasons for his apparent unwillingness to apply for a passport. Parker ultimately quashed any notions Presley had of working abroad, although Presley did not push the issue, either.<ref>Stanly & Coffey, ''The Elvis Encyclopedia'', pg. 123.</ref>\n\nTo cover up Parker's need for questioning in criminal activity, many theories for Presley's lack of touring abroad have surfaced, including the following:\n* Parker's claims that foreign security was poor, relative to the USA.\n* Parker's belief that outside influences (managers, agents etc.) would inform Presley of how unusual his contract with Parker was.\n* Parker's claim that there was a lack of venues large enough to accommodate a star of Presley's stature. All of these excuses were given to Presley when he would show an interest in touring abroad and, known to avoid confrontation, Presley would never argue with Parker.\n* Some promoters wanted to charge fans the equivalent of $100 per ticket. Parker did not wish the fans to be ripped off, and this was another reason he turned down overseas offers.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n====Presley's death====\nWhen [[Elvis Presley#Final months and death|Presley died in August 1977]], one day before he was due to go out on tour, some accounts suggest Parker acted as if nothing had happened.<ref name=\"Victor392\">{{cite book|last=Victor|first=Adam|title=The Elvis Encyclopedia |year=2008|publisher=Gerald Duckworth & Co Ltd|isbn=978-0-7156-3816-3|pages=392\u2013393}}</ref> Other accounts suggest he slumped in his chair at his office, muttered \"oh dear God\", and then quickly phoned Vernon Presley where Parker advised Presley's father that his son's image needed to be protected.<ref>{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Roy|title=Elvis: The Illustrated Record |year=1982|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53979-9|pages=}}</ref>\n\nParker set out to protect his future income. Asked by a journalist what he would do now, Parker responded, \"Why, I'll just go right on managing him!\"<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Almost immediately, before even visiting Graceland, Parker traveled to New York City to meet with merchandising associates and RCA executives, instructing them to prepare for a huge demand in Presley products.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> Shortly afterward, he traveled to Memphis for Presley's funeral. Mourners recall being surprised at his wearing a Hawaiian shirt and baseball cap, smoking his trademark cigar, and purposely avoiding the casket.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/> At the funeral, he persuaded Presley's father to sign over control of Presley's career in death to him.<ref name=\"Victor392\"/>\n\nIn September 1978, shortly after the first anniversary of Presley's death, Parker arranged a fan festival, ''Always Elvis'', where he, Vernon, and Presley's ex-wife [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla]], dedicated a bronze statue of him in the lobby of the [[Westgate Las Vegas|Las Vegas Hilton]].<ref name=nash315>Nash, ''The Colonel'', p. 315</ref>\n\n====After Elvis====\nFollowing Presley's death, Parker set up a licensing operation with Factors Etc.

Inc.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> However, because Parker was still entitled to 50% of all Presley's income, and after taxes were taken off, the overall amount going towards the upkeep of the estate was less than $1 million a year.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nIn January 1979, it was discovered that Presley had lost out on royalties for songs on which he had been listed as an author and/or composer because Parker had unwisely advised him not to sign up to [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]] or its younger competitor, [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]].<ref name=\"BMI\">{{cite book|last=Jobe Pierce|first=Patricia|title=The Ultimate Elvis|year=1994|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0-671-87022-5|pages=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateelviselv0000pier}}</ref> Experts in the field at the time estimated that it had potentially cost Presley millions of dollars<ref name=\"BMI\"/> and worse for Parker, it had also potentially cost him those millions of dollars.

Tual to investigate Parker's management.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/><ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> Tual, once appointed as Lisa Marie's ''guardian ad litem'', chose to investigate the entire period of Parker's management of Presley; his preliminary finding was that Parker's management deal of 50% was extortionate compared to the industry average of 15\u201320%.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> He also noted that Parker's handling of Presley's business affairs during his lifetime, including the decision to sell off past royalties to RCA for $5.4 million in 1973, was \"unethical\" and poorly handled.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> During a second, more detailed investigation, Tual discovered that all earnings were paid directly to the Trust instead of Parker.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> By this time, with the IRS demanding almost $15 million in taxes, the estate was facing bankruptcy.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nOn August 14, 1981, Judge Evans ordered EPE to sue Parker for mismanagement.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> In response to this, Parker countersued.<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> The case against Parker was settled out of court in 1983, with the estate paying him $2 million (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1983}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}})<ref name=\"Gaar240\"/> in exchange for all Presley audio recordings or visual images that he owned<ref name=\"Victor394\"/> and the termination of his involvement in any Presley related earnings for five years.<ref name=\"Victor394\"/>\n\nParker had worked as a \"consultant\" for [[Hilton Hotels]] since Presley's death,<ref name=\"Nash328\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|pages=328\u2013335}}</ref> with some believing he was working to pay off debts owed to the casino from his gambling during Presley's performances there.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> Part of this role resulted in Parker keeping the same fourth-floor suite he occupied when Presley was alive, but by 1984, with his gambling debts reportedly rising again, he was evicted.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> On the surface, however, relations between the two were as good as ever, with Parker helping the Hilton to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Presley's death.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nThe disputes with the Presley estate did not terminate his association with his most high-profile client. Parker appeared at posthumous events honoring Presley, such as the 1993 issuing of the [[United States Postal Service]] stamp honoring the King of Rock and Roll. He also became friendly with the estate again, attending special ceremonies and events in Memphis, invited by Priscilla.<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> However, he did occasionally step on their toes by commenting negatively on some of their decisions. In 1994, following the marriage of Lisa Marie and Michael Jackson, Parker stated that Presley would not have approved,<ref name=\"Nash328\"/> and in 1993, interest in Presley's enduring legend, interest that is sometimes notable for its obsessiveness, provoked Parker to remark, \"I don't think I exploited Elvis as much as he's being exploited today.\"<ref name=\"Nash328\"/>\n\nIn 1994, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], California was dedicated to him.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121013165655/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n{{refimprove|date=February 2020}}\nAs Presley's fame grew, people became interested in Parker as well. For a time, Parker lied about his childhood, claiming to have been born in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]], West Virginia, (to explain his Dutch accent as being a Southern accent) and to have run away at an early age to join a circus run by an uncle. The truth about his early years was revealed in 1960 when one of Parker's sisters, Nel Dankers-van Kuijk, living in the [[Netherlands]], recognized him in photographs standing next to Presley.<ref>https://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/pictures/elvis-presley-col-tom-parker.html</ref>\n\nOne of Parker's brothers, Adam \"Ad\" van Kuijk, visited Parker once in [[Los Angeles]] in April 1961. Parker privately acknowledged his brother and introduced him to Presley. During the week-long visit, Parker was informed by Adam van Kuijk that their mother had died three years earlier in 1958, never knowing what happened to her son after he left the Netherlands for good in 1929. Adam van Kuijk later died from emphysema in 1992, never seeing or visiting Parker again.<ref>https://www.elvis.com.au/presley/andreas-van-kuijk.shtml</ref>\n\nThe claim of Parker's Dutch heritage was publicly confirmed when Parker tried to avert a lawsuit brought against him in 1982 by asserting in open court that he was a Dutch citizen. In 1993, in one of his last media appearances, Parker appeared in a television interview with Dutch TV director [[Jorrit van der Kooi]] where they spoke to each other in Dutch about the Netherlands and about Elvis Presley's life and career. During the interview, Parker said that he was not aware that another one of his sisters, named Adriana van Kuijk, had died in the Netherlands a few years before.\n\n===Marriage===\nIn 1935, while traveling with a circus, Parker met and married 27-year-old Marie Francis Mott.<ref name=\"Vellenga\">{{cite book|last=Vellenga|first=Dirk|title=Elvis and The Colonel|year=1990|publisher=Grafton|isbn=978-0-586-20595-2|pages=49\u201351}}</ref> Marie was one of six children,<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> had been married twice before, and had a son from her first marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> Unbeknownst to Parker at the time, she had a second son from her first marriage, but had given him up for adoption at birth due to his disability (a [[club foot]]).{{sfn|Nash|2002|p=71}} Some have suggested that Parker married Marie to disguise his illegal status in the US;<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> a marriage to a US citizen with a child could help him bury his past in a \"ready-made family\".<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/> However, there is no definite proof that anything other than romance led to their marriage.<ref name=\"Vellenga\"/>\n\nOthers, however, have doubts about whether they were legally married at all.<ref name=\"Nash\">{{cite book|last=Nash|first=Alanna|title=The Colonel: The Extraordinary Story of Colonel Tom Parker and Elvis Presley|year=2002|publisher=Aurum Press Ltd|isbn=978-1-85410-948-4|ref=harv|pages=72\u201373}}</ref> According to interviews given by Parker to the [[Associated Press]] many years later, he and Marie were married in [[Tampa, Florida]] during the winter of 1932,<ref name=\"Nash\"/> but the Florida Office of Vital Statistics has no record of such a marriage any time between 1927 and 1946.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> It is also recorded that Marie did not divorce her second husband until 1936, and her brother, [[Bitsy Mott|Bitsy]], recalls no ceremony of marriage between Parker and Marie.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> Author Alanna Nash suggests the couple may have simply placed their hands on a Bible and given themselves a \"carny wedding\".<ref name=\"Nash\"/>\n\nIn the early days of their marriage, Marie and Parker worked together in the carnivals.<ref name=\"Nash\"/> As Parker's management career began to take off, Marie became more of a housewife, although she would occasionally travel with him to various parts of the country.

In the scene, Parker is satirically portrayed as a gluttonous, satanic figure. The scene contrasts Parker's management of Elvis with the freedom Epstein allows the Beatles. The scene also portrays Parker as [[anti-semitic]]. Tiwary claimed in an interview that Parker did make those comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/188384/meet-the-fifth-jewish-beatle-manager-brian-epste/|title=Meet the Fifth (Jewish) Beatle \u2013 Manager Brian Epstein|date=December 4, 2013|work=The Forward}}</ref>\n\n===Television===\n{{in popular culture|section|date=January 2019}}\n\n*Parker is also mentioned in the fifth episode of ''[[Archer Vice]]'', entitled \"Southbound and Down\".

The skit has much of the elements of the Elvis films Parker promoted, with an underdog, in this case Gretzky is playing a busboy at a country club in Hawaii, who defeats the pretentious snobs in [[ice hockey]]. Afterwards, Gretzky gets the girl of one of the stuck-up boys, who is impressed with his down-to-earth ways.\n*In ''[[Eek! the Cat]]'', a cat singer named \"Melvis\" decides he has had enough of performing and [[faked death|gets everyone to think he died in an accident]].

However, they are not required to be fluent in [[French language|French]] to be admitted, as there is a special one-year ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial'' language program. The academic curriculum of the international sections supplements the standard French curriculum with additional courses in literature/language and history/geography, taught in the language of the students' respective national sections, allowing them to pursue the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Option Internationale du Baccalaur.C3.A9at|''option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at'']] (OIB), the international variant of the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at''.\n \nThe school's main campus at 2 bis rue du Fer \u00e0 Cheval ({{coord|48|53|44|N|2|3|40|E}}) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye contains a preschool (''maternelle''), a primary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''), a middle school (''coll\u00e8ge''), and a high school (''lyc\u00e9e''). Due to the size of the student body, some larger national sections have satellite campuses for primary and middle school grades at other local schools in the area of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. All students return to the main campus for their final three (''lyc\u00e9e''-level) years.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the school to date can be described by three distinct phases:\n\n===1951\u20131965===\n\nIn 1951, the then-recently established [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), a grouping of 15 countries, created [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) with the aim of ensuring peace and security in the North Atlantic region, and promising European members the support of the United States in the event of any future aggression.\n\nSHAPE was installed at [[Rocquencourt]], and [[Saint Germain-en-Laye]] was chosen as the place of residence for the serving officers and their families. The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [[Belgium]], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building.

However, they are not required to be fluent in [[French language|French]] to be admitted, as there is a special one-year ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial'' language program. The academic curriculum of the international sections supplements the standard French curriculum with additional courses in literature/language and history/geography, taught in the language of the students' respective national sections, allowing them to pursue the [[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Option Internationale du Baccalaur.C3.A9at|''option internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at'']] (OIB), the international variant of the French ''baccalaur\u00e9at''.\n \nThe school's main campus at 2 bis rue du Fer \u00e0 Cheval ({{coord|48|53|44|N|2|3|40|E}}) in Saint-Germain-en-Laye contains a preschool (''maternelle''), a primary school (''\u00e9cole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire''), a middle school (''coll\u00e8ge''), and a high school (''lyc\u00e9e''). Due to the size of the student body, some larger national sections have satellite campuses for primary and middle school grades at other local schools in the area of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. All students return to the main campus for their final three (''lyc\u00e9e''-level) years.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the school to date can be described by three distinct phases:\n\n===1951\u20131965===\n\nIn 1951, the then-recently established [[NATO]] (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), a grouping of 15 countries, created [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE) with the aim of ensuring peace and security in the North Atlantic region, and promising European members the support of the United States in the event of any future aggression.\n\nSHAPE was installed at [[Rocquencourt]], and [[Saint Germain-en-Laye]] was chosen as the place of residence for the serving officers and their families. The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 [[French language|French]] children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in [[Belgium]], and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts.

For example, \"11\" represents the number ''eleven'' in the [[decimal numeral system]] (used in common life), the number ''three'' in the [[binary numeral system]] (used in [[computer]]s), and the number two in the [[unary numeral system]] (e.g. used in [[Tally marks|tallying]] scores).\n\nThe number the numeral represents is called its value.\n\nIdeally, a numeral system will:\n*Represent a useful set of numbers (e.g. all [[integer]]s, or [[rational number]]s)\n*Give every number represented a unique representation (or at least a standard representation)\n*Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers.\n\nFor example, the usual [[decimal]] representation of whole numbers gives every nonzero whole number a unique representation as a [[finite set|finite]] [[sequence]] of [[numerical digit|digits]], beginning with a non-zero digit. However, when decimal representation is used for the [[rational number|rational]] or real numbers, such numbers, in general, have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.\n\nNumeral systems are sometimes called ''[[number system]]s'', but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of [[real number]]s, the system of [[complex number]]s, the system of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.\n\n==Main numeral systems==\n{{main|List of numeral systems}}\nThe most commonly used system of numerals is the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |author2=Louis Charles Karpinski |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |url=https://archive.org/details/hinduarabicnume05karpgoog |year=1911 |publisher=Ginn and Company}}</ref> Two [[Indian mathematicians]] are credited with developing it. [[Aryabhata]] of [[Patna|Kusumapura]] developed the [[place-value notation]] in the 5th&nbsp;century and a century later [[Brahmagupta]] introduced the symbol for [[zero]]. The numeral system and the zero concept, developed by the Hindus in India, slowly spread to other surrounding regions like Arabia due to their commercial and military activities with India. The Hindu-Arabic numeral system then spread to Europe along with many other science knowledge and due to merchants trading and using a stable simple numeral system. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India. It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit\u2013Devanagari notation, which is still used in India and neighbouring Nepal.\n\nThe simplest numeral system is the [[unary numeral system]], in which every [[natural number]] is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol <tt>/</tt> is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by <tt>///////</tt>. [[Tally marks]] represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in [[theoretical computer science]]. [[Elias gamma coding]], which is commonly used in [[data compression]], expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.\n\nThe unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, \u2212 for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as <tt>+++ ////</tt> and the number 123 as <tt>+ \u2212 \u2212 ///</tt> without any need for zero. This is called [[sign-value notation]]. The ancient [[Egyptian numeral system]] was of this type, and the [[Roman numeral system]] was a modification of this idea.\n\nMore useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for \"one occurrence\", B \"two occurrences\", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing [[Chinese numerals]] and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the [[English language]] is of this type (\"three hundred [and] four\"), as are those of other spoken [[language]]s, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is ''soixante dix-neuf'' ({{nowrap|60 + 10 + 9}}) and in Welsh is ''pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain'' ({{nowrap|4 + (5 + 10) + (3 \u00d7 20)}}) or (somewhat archaic) ''pedwar ugain namyn un'' ({{nowrap|4 \u00d7 20 \u2212 1}}). In English, one could say \"four score less one\", as in the famous [[Gettysburg Address]] representing \"87 years ago\" as \"four score and seven years ago\".\n\nMore elegant is a ''[[positional notation|positional system]]'', also known as place-value notation. Again working in base&nbsp;10, ten different digits 0,&nbsp;..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in {{nowrap|304 {{=}} 3\u00d7100 + 0\u00d710 + 4\u00d71}} or more precisely {{nowrap|3\u00d710<sup>2</sup> + 0\u00d710<sup>1</sup> + 4\u00d710<sup>0</sup>}}. Zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to \"skip\" a power. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base&nbsp;10 system.\n\nArithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base&nbsp;10).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chowdhury|first=Arnab|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=WXn-mT3K6dgC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=Arithmetic+is+much+easier+in+positional+systems+than+in+the+earlier+additive+ones;+furthermore,+additive+systems+need+a+large+number+of+different+symbols+for+the+different+powers+of+10;+a+positional+system+needs+only+ten+different+symbols+(assuming+that+it+uses+base+10).&source=bl&ots=Wo9O3gyf4x&sig=ACfU3U3r-uuGFdI7r4o3nOo3dONYKfT1Ww&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjV8KHkkuXoAhUCA3IKHUIMDqgQ6AEwAHoECBMQKA#v=onepage&q=Arithmetic%20is%20much%20easier%20in%20positional%20systems%20than%20in%20the%20earlier%20additive%20ones;%20furthermore,%20additive%20systems%20need%20a%20large%20number%20of%20different%20symbols%20for%20the%20different%20powers%20of%2010;%20a%20positional%20system%20needs%20only%20ten%20different%20symbols%20(assuming%20that%20it%20uses%20base%2010).&f=false|title=Design of an Efficient Multiplier using DBNS|publisher=GIAP Journals|isbn=978-93-83006-18-2|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coursehero.com/file/p1047rhv/The-simplest-numeral-system-is-the-unary-numeral-sys-tem-in-which-every-natural/|title=The simplest numeral system is the unary numeral sys tem in which every natural|website=www.coursehero.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://courses.aiu.edu/Certificate/Human%20Resources%20and%20MKT/Algebra%20with%20Applications/Leccion%201/ALGEBRA%20SEC%201.pdf|title=Mathematics Defined!|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base&nbsp;1000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.\n\nIn [[computers]], the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base&nbsp;2 ([[binary numeral system]]), with two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three ([[octal numeral system]]) or four ([[hexadecimal numeral system]]) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases&nbsp;2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the [[machine word]]) are used, as, for example, in [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP]].\n\nIn certain biological systems, the [[unary coding]] system is employed. Unary numerals used in the [[neural circuit]]s responsible for [[birdsong]] production.<ref> Fiete, I. R.; Seung, H. S. (2007). \"Neural network models of birdsong production, learning, and coding\". In Squire, L.; Albright, T.; Bloom, F.; Gage, F.; Spitzer, N. New Encyclopedia of Neuroscience.</ref> The nucleus in the brain of the songbirds that plays a part in both the learning and the production of bird song is the HVC ([[high vocal center]]). The command signals for different notes in the birdsong emanate from different points in the HVC. This coding works as space coding which is an efficient strategy for biological circuits due to its inherent simplicity and robustness.\n\nThe numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the [[Arithmetic sequence|arithmetic]] numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the [[Geometric sequence|geometric]] numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the [[Greek numerals|Ionic system]]), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses ''both'' arithmetic and geometric numerals.\n\nIn certain areas of computer science, a modified base ''k'' positional system is used, called [[bijective numeration]], with digits 1, 2,&nbsp;..., ''k'' ({{nowrap|''k'' \u2265 1}}), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a [[bijection]] between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-''k'' numeration is also called ''k''-adic notation, not to be confused with [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. Bijective base&nbsp;1 is the same as unary.\n\n==Positional systems in detail==<!--This section is linked from [[Cantor set]]-->\n{{See also|Positional notation}}\nIn a positional base ''b'' numeral system (with ''b'' a [[natural number]] greater than 1 known as the [[radix]]), ''b'' basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first ''b'' natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by ''b''.\n\nFor example, in the [[decimal]] system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means {{math|('''4'''\u00d710<sup>3</sup>) + ('''3'''\u00d710<sup>2</sup>) + ('''2'''\u00d710<sup>1</sup>) + ('''7'''\u00d710<sup>0</sup>)}}, noting that {{math|10<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}.\n\nIn general, if ''b'' is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base ''b'' by expressing it in the form {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''b''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 2</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>''b''<sup>0</sup>}} and writing the enumerated digits {{math|''a''<sub>n</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub> ... ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and {{math|''b'' \u2212 1}}, inclusive.\n\nIf a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base&nbsp;10) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: number<sub>base</sub>. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.\n\nBy using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base&nbsp;2 numeral 10.11 denotes {{math|1\u00d72<sup>1</sup> + 0\u00d72<sup>0</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22121</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22122</sup> {{=}} 2.75}}.\n\nIn general, numbers in the base ''b'' system are of the form:\n\n:<math>\n(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_1a_0.c_1 c_2 c_3\\cdots)_b =\n\\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb^k + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_kb^{-k}.\n</math>\n\nThe numbers ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> and ''b''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> are the [[weight function|weights]] of the corresponding digits. The position ''k'' is the [[logarithm]] of the corresponding weight ''w'', that is <math>k = \\log_{b} w = \\log_{b} b^k</math>. The highest used position is close to the [[order of magnitude]] of the number.\n\nThe number of [[tally marks]] required in the [[unary numeral system]] for ''describing the weight'' would have been '''w'''. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only <math>k + 1 = \\log_{b} w + 1</math>, for ''k'' \u2265 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because <math>\\log_{10} 1000 + 1 = 3 + 1</math>. The number of digits required to ''describe the position'' is <math>\\log_b k + 1 = \\log_b \\log_b w + 1</math> (in positions 1, 10, 100,... only for simplicity in the decimal example).\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{l|rrrrrrr}\n\\text{Position}\n& 3\n& 2\n& 1\n& 0\n& -1\n& -2\n& \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Weight}\n& b^3 & b^2 & b^1 & b^0 & b^{-1} & b^{-2} & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Digit}\n& a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & c_1 & c_2 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Decimal example weight}\n& 1000 & 100 & 10 & 1 & 0.1 & 0.01 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Decimal example digit}\n& 4 & 3 & 2 & 7 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nA number has a terminating or repeating expansion [[if and only if]] it is [[rational number|rational]]; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus {{math|0.3<sub>10</sub> {{=}} 0.0100110011001...<sub>2</sub>}}). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base&nbsp;2, {{math|[[pi|\u03c0]] {{=}} 3.1415926...<sub>10</sub>}} can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...<sub>2</sub>.\n\nPutting [[overline|overscores]], {{overline|''n''}}, or dots, ''\u1e45'', above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:\n:14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.{{overline|27}} &nbsp; or &nbsp; 321.3217878787878... = 321.321{{Overline|78}}.\n\nIf ''b'' = ''p'' is a [[prime number]], one can define base-''p'' numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].\n\n==Generalized variable-length integers==\nMore general is using a [[mixed radix]] notation (here written [[Endianness|little-endian]]) like <math>a_0 a_1 a_2</math> for <math>a_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 b_2</math>, etc.\n\nThis is used in [[punycode]], one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of \"digits\" from a collection of 36: a\u2013z and 0\u20139, representing 0\u201325 and 26\u201335 respectively. A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b\u20139 (1\u201335), therefore the weight ''b''<sub>1</sub> is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 \u00d7 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence:\n\na (0), ba (1), ca (2), .., 9a (35), bb (36), cb (37), .., 9b (70), bca (71), .., 99a (1260), bcb (1261), etc.\n\nUnlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed \u2013 the a would terminate the number.\n\nThe flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.\n\nThe case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to [[bijective numeration]], where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[List of numeral systems]]\n*[[Computer numbering formats]]\n*[[Golden ratio base]]\n*[[History of ancient numeral systems]]\n*[[History of numbers]]\n*[[List of numeral system topics]]\n*[[N-ary (disambiguation)|''n''-ary]]\n*[[Numeral (linguistics)|Number names]]\n*[[Quater-imaginary base]]\n*[[Quipu]]\n*[[Recurring decimal]]\n*[[Residue numeral system]]\n*[[Long and short scales|Short and long scales]]\n*[[Scientific notation]]\n*[[-yllion]]\n*[[Numerical cognition]]\n*[[Number system]]\n*[[Unary numeral system]]}}\n* [[0.999...]] - every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n*Georges Ifrah.

However, when decimal representation is used for the [[rational number|rational]] or real numbers, such numbers, in general, have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.\n\nNumeral systems are sometimes called ''[[number system]]s'', but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of [[real number]]s, the system of [[complex number]]s, the system of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.\n\n==Main numeral systems==\n{{main|List of numeral systems}}\nThe most commonly used system of numerals is the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |author2=Louis Charles Karpinski |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |url=https://archive.org/details/hinduarabicnume05karpgoog |year=1911 |publisher=Ginn and Company}}</ref> Two [[Indian mathematicians]] are credited with developing it. [[Aryabhata]] of [[Patna|Kusumapura]] developed the [[place-value notation]] in the 5th&nbsp;century and a century later [[Brahmagupta]] introduced the symbol for [[zero]]. The numeral system and the zero concept, developed by the Hindus in India, slowly spread to other surrounding regions like Arabia due to their commercial and military activities with India. The Hindu-Arabic numeral system then spread to Europe along with many other science knowledge and due to merchants trading and using a stable simple numeral system. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India. It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit\u2013Devanagari notation, which is still used in India and neighbouring Nepal.\n\nThe simplest numeral system is the [[unary numeral system]], in which every [[natural number]] is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol <tt>/</tt> is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by <tt>///////</tt>. [[Tally marks]] represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in [[theoretical computer science]]. [[Elias gamma coding]], which is commonly used in [[data compression]], expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.\n\nThe unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, \u2212 for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as <tt>+++ ////</tt> and the number 123 as <tt>+ \u2212 \u2212 ///</tt> without any need for zero. This is called [[sign-value notation]]. The ancient [[Egyptian numeral system]] was of this type, and the [[Roman numeral system]] was a modification of this idea.\n\nMore useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for \"one occurrence\", B \"two occurrences\", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing [[Chinese numerals]] and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the [[English language]] is of this type (\"three hundred [and] four\"), as are those of other spoken [[language]]s, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is ''soixante dix-neuf'' ({{nowrap|60 + 10 + 9}}) and in Welsh is ''pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain'' ({{nowrap|4 + (5 + 10) + (3 \u00d7 20)}}) or (somewhat archaic) ''pedwar ugain namyn un'' ({{nowrap|4 \u00d7 20 \u2212 1}}). In English, one could say \"four score less one\", as in the famous [[Gettysburg Address]] representing \"87 years ago\" as \"four score and seven years ago\".\n\nMore elegant is a ''[[positional notation|positional system]]'', also known as place-value notation. Again working in base&nbsp;10, ten different digits 0,&nbsp;..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in {{nowrap|304 {{=}} 3\u00d7100 + 0\u00d710 + 4\u00d71}} or more precisely {{nowrap|3\u00d710<sup>2</sup> + 0\u00d710<sup>1</sup> + 4\u00d710<sup>0</sup>}}. Zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to \"skip\" a power. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base&nbsp;10 system.\n\nArithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base&nbsp;10).\n\nThe positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base&nbsp;1000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.\n\nIn [[computers]], the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base&nbsp;2 ([[binary numeral system]]), with two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three ([[octal numeral system]]) or four ([[hexadecimal numeral system]]) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases&nbsp;2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the [[machine word]]) are used, as, for example, in [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP]].\n\nIn certain biological systems, the [[unary coding]] system is employed. Unary numerals used in the [[neural circuit]]s responsible for [[birdsong]] production.<ref> Fiete, I. R.; Seung, H. S. (2007). \"Neural network models of birdsong production, learning, and coding\". In Squire, L.; Albright, T.; Bloom, F.; Gage, F.; Spitzer, N. New Encyclopedia of Neuroscience.</ref> The nucleus in the brain of the songbirds that plays a part in both the learning and the production of bird song is the HVC ([[high vocal center]]). The command signals for different notes in the birdsong emanate from different points in the HVC. This coding works as space coding which is an efficient strategy for biological circuits due to its inherent simplicity and robustness.\n\nThe numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the [[Arithmetic sequence|arithmetic]] numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the [[Geometric sequence|geometric]] numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the [[Greek numerals|Ionic system]]), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses ''both'' arithmetic and geometric numerals.\n\nIn certain areas of computer science, a modified base ''k'' positional system is used, called [[bijective numeration]], with digits 1, 2,&nbsp;..., ''k'' ({{nowrap|''k'' \u2265 1}}), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a [[bijection]] between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-''k'' numeration is also called ''k''-adic notation, not to be confused with [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. Bijective base&nbsp;1 is the same as unary.\n\n==Positional systems in detail==<!--This section is linked from [[Cantor set]]-->\n{{See also|Positional notation}}\nIn a positional base ''b'' numeral system (with ''b'' a [[natural number]] greater than 1 known as the [[radix]]), ''b'' basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first ''b'' natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by ''b''.\n\nFor example, in the [[decimal]] system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means {{math|('''4'''\u00d710<sup>3</sup>) + ('''3'''\u00d710<sup>2</sup>) + ('''2'''\u00d710<sup>1</sup>) + ('''7'''\u00d710<sup>0</sup>)}}, noting that {{math|10<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}.\n\nIn general, if ''b'' is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base ''b'' by expressing it in the form {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''b''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 2</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>''b''<sup>0</sup>}} and writing the enumerated digits {{math|''a''<sub>n</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub> ... ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and {{math|''b'' \u2212 1}}, inclusive.\n\nIf a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base&nbsp;10) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: number<sub>base</sub>. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.\n\nBy using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base&nbsp;2 numeral 10.11 denotes {{math|1\u00d72<sup>1</sup> + 0\u00d72<sup>0</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22121</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22122</sup> {{=}} 2.75}}.\n\nIn general, numbers in the base ''b'' system are of the form:\n\n:<math>\n(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_1a_0.c_1 c_2 c_3\\cdots)_b =\n\\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb^k + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_kb^{-k}.\n</math>\n\nThe numbers ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> and ''b''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> are the [[weight function|weights]] of the corresponding digits. The position ''k'' is the [[logarithm]] of the corresponding weight ''w'', that is <math>k = \\log_{b} w = \\log_{b} b^k</math>. The highest used position is close to the [[order of magnitude]] of the number.\n\nThe number of [[tally marks]] required in the [[unary numeral system]] for ''describing the weight'' would have been '''w'''. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only <math>k + 1 = \\log_{b} w + 1</math>, for ''k'' \u2265 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because <math>\\log_{10} 1000 + 1 = 3 + 1</math>. The number of digits required to ''describe the position'' is <math>\\log_b k + 1 = \\log_b \\log_b w + 1</math> (in positions 1, 10, 100,... only for simplicity in the decimal example).\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{l|rrrrrrr}\n\\text{Position}\n& 3\n& 2\n& 1\n& 0\n& -1\n& -2\n& \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Weight}\n& b^3 & b^2 & b^1 & b^0 & b^{-1} & b^{-2} & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Digit}\n& a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & c_1 & c_2 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Decimal example weight}\n& 1000 & 100 & 10 & 1 & 0.1 & 0.01 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Decimal example digit}\n& 4 & 3 & 2 & 7 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nA number has a terminating or repeating expansion [[if and only if]] it is [[rational number|rational]]; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus {{math|0.3<sub>10</sub> {{=}} 0.0100110011001...<sub>2</sub>}}). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base&nbsp;2, {{math|[[pi|\u03c0]] {{=}} 3.1415926...<sub>10</sub>}} can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...<sub>2</sub>.\n\nPutting [[overline|overscores]], {{overline|''n''}}, or dots, ''\u1e45'', above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:\n:14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.{{overline|27}} &nbsp; or &nbsp; 321.3217878787878... = 321.321{{Overline|78}}.\n\nIf ''b'' = ''p'' is a [[prime number]], one can define base-''p'' numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].\n\n==Generalized variable-length integers==\nMore general is using a [[mixed radix]] notation (here written [[Endianness|little-endian]]) like <math>a_0 a_1 a_2</math> for <math>a_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 b_2</math>, etc.\n\nThis is used in [[punycode]], one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of \"digits\" from a collection of 36: a\u2013z and 0\u20139, representing 0\u201325 and 26\u201335 respectively. A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b\u20139 (1\u201335), therefore the weight ''b''<sub>1</sub> is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 \u00d7 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence:\n\na (0), ba (1), ca (2), .., 9a (35), bb (36), cb (37), .., 9b (70), bca (71), .., 99a (1260), bcb (1261), etc.\n\nUnlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed \u2013 the a would terminate the number.\n\nThe flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.\n\nThe case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to [[bijective numeration]], where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[List of numeral systems]]\n*[[Computer numbering formats]]\n*[[Golden ratio base]]\n*[[History of ancient numeral systems]]\n*[[History of numbers]]\n*[[List of numeral system topics]]\n*[[N-ary (disambiguation)|''n''-ary]]\n*[[Numeral (linguistics)|Number names]]\n*[[Quater-imaginary base]]\n*[[Quipu]]\n*[[Recurring decimal]]\n*[[Residue numeral system]]\n*[[Long and short scales|Short and long scales]]\n*[[Scientific notation]]\n*[[-yllion]]\n*[[Numerical cognition]]\n*[[Number system]]\n*[[Unary numeral system]]}}\n* [[0.999...]] - every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n*Georges Ifrah.
