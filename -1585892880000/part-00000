\u2013 16 July 2019) was a South African musician and [[anthropologist]], some of whose work was in musicology focused on the music of indigenous South African peoples.<ref name=sexton/> His band [[Juluka]] began as a duo with [[Sipho Mchunu]], and was the first group in the South African [[apartheid]]-era with a white man and a black man. They recorded and performed, later in larger formation.\n\nIn 1986 Clegg founded the band [[Savuka]], and also recorded as a solo act, occasionally reuniting with his earlier band partners. Sometimes called ''Le Zoulou Blanc'' ({{IPA-fr|l\u0259 zulu bl\u0251\u0303|lang}}, for \"The White [[Zulu people|Zulu]]\"), he was an important figure in South African popular music and one of the most prominent white activists in [[Internal resistance to apartheid|resistance to apartheid]], with songs that mix [[Zulu language|Zulu]] with English lyrics and [[Music of Africa|African music]] with various Western styles.\n\n==Early life and career==\nClegg was born on 7 June 1953 in [[Bacup]], [[Lancashire]],<ref name=\"official\">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnyclegg.com/biog.html|title=JOHNNY CLEGG BIOGRAPHY AND AWARDS|publisher=JohnnyClegg.com|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref> to an English father of Scottish descent, Dennis Clegg, and a Rhodesian mother, Muriel (Braudo).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/white-zulu-is-making-a-comeback-940896|title=White Zulu is making a comeback &#124; IOL Entertainment|website=Iol.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/arts/music/johnny-clegg-dead.html|title=Johnny Clegg, South African Singer Who Battled Apartheid With Music, Is Dead at 66|first=Alan|last=Cowell|date=16 July 2019|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref> Clegg's mother's family was [[Jews|Jewish]], immigrants from [[Lithuania]], and Clegg had a secular Jewish upbringing, learning about the [[Ten Commandments]] but refusing to have a ''[[bar mitzvah]]'' or even associate with other Jewish children at school.<ref name=\"stars\">''Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories'' by Scott R.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
