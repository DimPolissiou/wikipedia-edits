[[AllMusic]] writer Steve Huey criticized the album for failing to convey any of its concepts, but concluded, \"Still, credit must be given to the band for having finished the record at all, and in its own way, the confusion of ''The Process'' speaks volumes\".<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Nicholas Maltezos of ''[[The Record (New Jersey)|The Record]]'' awarded the album one star out four, stating that \"Skinny Puppy's sound was certainly original \u2013 the group's synthesizer-dominated rock could have easily served as the background music for a dream sequence in a horror or sci-fi movie.

Perry concluded by saying, \"you can't help feeling it would have been better all round if they hadn't bothered\".<ref name=NME /> Ben Mitchell of ''[[Select (magazine)|Select]]'' panned the album, writing that \"an unerring inability to distinguish arse from elbow throughout results in a flimsy 11-track approximation of a gang of mildly irritated moped riders attempting a stage invasion at a [[Jean-Michel Jarre]] concert\".<ref name=\"Select\" />\n\nJames Muretich of the ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' was impressed by tracks such as \"Candle\" and wrote that \"the band at least goes out with more of a bark than a whimper\".<ref name=\"Calgary\" /> Rommie Johnson of ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]'' gave a mixed review, awarding the album two stars out of four. Johnson said that the ''[[Last Rights (album)|Last Rights]]'' track \"Download\" would have been \"the ''perfect'' ending\" for the band, and that ''The Process'' presented nothing new. Johnson concluded on a more positive note, saying that the album \"only sounds weak in light of Puppy's track record\" and that \"the band still make Nine Inch Nails sound like sissies\".<ref name=\"Tampa\">{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Rommie |title=Skinny Puppy \u2013 The Process (American) |journal=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |date=March 29, 1996 |page=23}}</ref> Steve Byrne of the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' said \"Goettel and Puppy devotees deserve a better epitaph than 'The Process'\", concluding that the album was \"bogged down in [the] B-horror-movie mode that the band has explored more relevantly before\".<ref name=\"Byrne\" />\n\nSome critics reviewed the album more favorably. Sandy Masuo of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' described the album as being \"full of intriguing vagaries\", filled with \"driving dance grooves, both choppy and smooth\". Masuo also praised the song \"Candle\", calling it a \"suitably moody swan song\".<ref name=LATimes /> Malcolm X.

She received her Bachelor of Science degree with a thesis on the comparative morphology of [[Asplenium bulbiferum]] in 1896, at the age of 24. <ref>Gertrude Burlingham, Teacher, Taxonomist, Trailblazer, ''New York Mycological Society Newsletter'', Spring 2019 http://newyorkmyc.org/category/newsletters/</ref>.

She moved to [[Binghamton, NY]] in [[1898]] to teach high school [[biology]]<ref>Bulletin of the New York Botanical Garden, 1910</ref>, and then to New York City for a postgraduate degree at [[Columbia University]]. After finishing her Ph.D. in 1908 she taught biology at Brooklyn's [[Eastern District High School]] until her retirement in [[1934]]. Despite earning a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1908, she never taught at college level.<ref name=\"seaver\"/><ref name=\"mycobio\"/><ref name=\"lentz\"/>\n\nAs a postgraduate, she worked primarily at the [[New York Botanical Garden]] (NYBG) under an agreement between that institution and Columbia University for doctoral studies, the first woman to gain a Ph.D. from the program.<ref name=\"lentz\"/> At the garden, she collaborated with [[William A. Murrill]] (she would eventually name ''[[Russula murrillii]]'' after him). Soon after starting her scientific career, she began spending a lot of time in [[Vermont]], where she owned a secondary home in [[Newfane, Vermont|Newfane]], [[Windham County, Vermont|Windham County]], an area that was the topic of her very first scientific publication.<ref name=\"seaver\"/><ref name=\"lactarii\"/>\n\nTribe Lactarieae, formed of the genera ''Lactarius'' (which she called ''Lactaria'') and ''Russula'', was her specialty<ref name=\"seaver\"/><ref name=\"rogerson\"/> and the topic of both her doctoral thesis (published in the ''Memoirs of the [[Torrey Botanical Club]]'') as well as the majority of her publications, such as the 1910 treatment of the tribe for the ''North American Flora''.<ref name=\"mycobio\"/> ''Russula'' specialist Ray Fatto credited Burlingham with noting the importance of spore ornamentation in separating the species of this notoriously troublesome genus. Although some authors, like [[Michael Kuo]],<ref name=\"kuo\"/> have disputed the usefulness of that criterion, it has remained of great importance in the absence of genetic research to clarify the status of many species.<ref name=\"mycobio\"/><ref name=\"woo\"/> In his obituary, [[Fred J.

It is undeniable that the Government's policy of supporting the South Vietnamese regime with arms, equipment and training was regarded by some quarters, especially the Opposition parties, as a form of interfering in the internal affairs of that country and the Tunku's valiant efforts to defend it were not convincing enough, from a purely foreign policy standpoint. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016191310/http://www.idfr.gov.my/images/stories/publication/2008/tunku.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n| combatant1  = {{Plainlist}}\n* {{flag|North Vietnam}}\n* {{flagdeco|Republic of South Vietnam}} [[Republic of South Vietnam]](Viet Cong)\n* {{flagdeco|Laos}} [[Pathet Lao]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1975}} [[Khmer Rouge]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1973}} [[GRUNK]] <small>(1970\u20131975)</small>\n* {{flag|China}}\n* {{flag|Soviet Union|1955}}\n* {{flag|North Korea}}\n{{Endplainlist}}\n{{clist\n|bullets=no\n|title=Supported by:\n| {{nowrap|{{flagcountry|Czechoslovak Socialist Republic}}}}\n| {{flag|Cuba}}\n| {{nowrap|{{flag|East Germany}}}}\n| {{flagcountry|Polish People's Republic|1947}}\n| {{flag|Socialist Republic of Romania|name=Romania}}\n| {{flag|Hungarian People's Republic|name=Hungary}}\n| {{flag|People's Republic of Bulgaria|name=Bulgaria}}\n| {{flag|Sweden}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/why-did-sweeden-support-the-viet-cong.htm |title=Why did Sweden support the Viet Cong? |work=HistoryNet |date=25 July 2013| access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sweden-announces-support-to-viet-cong |title=Sweden announces support to Viet Cong |work=HISTORY.com | access-date=20 July 2016 |quote=In Sweden, Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson reveals that Sweden has been providing assistance to the Viet Cong, including some $550,000 worth of medical supplies.

In August, the [[Gulf of Tonkin incident]] occurred, in which a U.S. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with North Vietnamese fast attack craft. In response, the U.S Congress passed the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], giving President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] broad authorization to increase U.S. military presence. He ordered the deployment of [[Military organization|combat units]] for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000.<ref name=AWL/> Past this point, the [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) (also known as the North Vietnamese Army or NVA) engaged in more [[conventional warfare]] with U.S and South Vietnamese forces. Every year onward, there was significant build-up of U.S forces, despite little progress. U.S Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]], one of the principal architects of the war, began expressing doubts of victory by the end of 1966.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|287}} U.S. and South Vietnam forces relied on [[air supremacy|air superiority]] and overwhelming firepower to conduct [[search and destroy]] operations, involving [[army|ground forces]], [[artillery]], and [[airstrike]]s. The U.S. also conducted a large-scale [[strategic bombing]] campaign against North Vietnam and Laos.\n\nThe [[Tet Offensive]] of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|481}} The CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north.<ref name=Pribbenow/>{{rp|247\u20139}} In 1969, North Vietnam declared a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]] in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional [[Combined arms]] warfare. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch [[Norodom Sihanouk]] by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN [[Cambodian campaign|counter-invasion]].\n\nIn 1969, following the election of U.S President Richard Nixon, a policy of \"[[Vietnamization]]\" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972.The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] of January 1973 saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement.<ref name=Kolko>{{cite book|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|title=Anatomy of a War: Vietnam, the United States, and the Modern Historical Experience|url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofwarviet00kolk|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0394747613}}</ref>{{rp|457}} The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years. [[Fall of Phnom Penh|Phnom Penh fell]] to the Khmer Rouge on 17 April 1975 while the [[1975 Spring Offensive]] saw the capture of Saigon by the PAVN on 30 April; this marked the end of the war, and 2 countries North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year (1976).\n\nThe scale of fighting was enormous: by 1970 the ARVN was the world's fourth largest army, with the PAVN being similar in size at around a million regular soldiers.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pilger|first=John|title=Heroes|publisher=South End Press|year=2001|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dcL6w-VmjWwC&pg=PA238|isbn=9780896086661|page=238}}</ref><ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|770}} The war exacted a huge human cost in terms of fatalities (see [[Vietnam War casualties]]): estimates of the number of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians killed vary from 966,000<ref name=Hirschman/> to 3.8 million.<ref name=Obermeyer/> Some 275,000\u2013310,000 [[Khmer people|Cambodians]],<ref name=Heuveline/><ref name=Banister/><ref name=Sliwinski/> 20,000\u201362,000 [[Lao people|Laotians]],<ref name=Obermeyer/> and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain [[missing in action]].<ref group=\"A\" name=\"USd&w\" />\n\nThe [[Sino-Soviet split]] re-emerged following the lull during the Vietnam War.

Chinese forces directly invaded Vietnam in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]](1979-1990), with subsequent [[Sino-Vietnamese conflicts, 1979\u20131991|border conflicts]] lasting until 1991. Insurgencies were fought by the unified Vietnam in all three countries. The end of the war and resumption of the [[Third Indochina War]] would precipitate the [[Vietnamese boat people]] and the larger [[Indochina refugee crisis]], which saw millions of refugees leave Indochina (mainly southern Vietnam), with an estimated 250,000 of whom perished at sea.

When the Japanese invaded during [[World War II]], the [[Viet Minh]] opposed them with support from the US, the Soviet Union and China. They received some Japanese arms when Japan surrendered. The Viet Minh, a Communist-led common front under the leadership of [[Ho Chi Minh]], then initiated an insurgency against French rule.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html|archivedate=20 April 2011  }} cf. {{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|issue=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426|doi=10.1080/14682740500284630|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eba3f2702e3ef484dfa94ad17652f80187e8067b}} cf. {{cite book|last=Vu|first=Tuong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false|title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.&nbsp;...

Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|264}} In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.\u2013Soviet issues. Only 16 months later, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) played out on television worldwide. It was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale [[nuclear war]], and the U.S. raised the readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) forces to [[DEFCON]] 2.\n\nThe Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in South Korea, and Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] that he had approved on 4 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/161188|title=It's Time to Stop Saying that JFK Inherited the Bay of Pigs Operation from Ike|publisher=History News Network|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement in May (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|265}}), the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. These crises made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F.

He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that \"to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|VTF|1969|loc=IV.

Poor leadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in weakening the ARVN. The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the Viet Cong played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.<ref name=McNamara/>{{rp|369}}\n\nOne major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using [[special forces]] for [[counterinsurgency]] warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a \"brush fire\" war in Vietnam.\n\n[[File:President meets with Secretary of Defense.

He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F.

This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents over the Buddhist majority. Di\u1ec7m's elder brother [[Pierre Martin Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c|Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Th\u1ee5c]] was the Archbishop of Hu\u1ebf and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state. Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Di\u1ec7m's rule. Di\u1ec7m refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the ARVN [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] of Colonel [[L\u00ea Quang Tung]], loyal to Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, [[X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|raided pagodas]] across Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.\n\nU.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a [[regime change]] during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favored Di\u1ec7m. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces, and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ng\u00f4 family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].\n\n[[File:Corpse of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1963 coup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] after being shot and killed in a coup on 2 November 1963]]\n\nThe CIA was in contact with generals planning to remove Di\u1ec7m. They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid.

When Kennedy was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that he \"rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|326}} Kennedy had not anticipated Di\u1ec7m's murder.

Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in quick succession.

In Vietnam, one notable film set during Operation Linebacker II was the film ''[[Girl from Hanoi]]'' (1975) depicting war-time life in Hanoi. Another notable work was the diary of \u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u00f9y Tr\u00e2m, a Vietnamese doctor who enlisted in the Southern battlefield, and was killed at the age of 27 by US forces near [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]]. Her diaries were later published in Vietnam as ''\u0110\u1eb7ng Th\u00f9y Tr\u00e2m's Diary'' (''Last Night I Dreamed Of Peace''), where it became a best-seller and was later made into a film ''[[Don't Burn]]'' (''\u0110\u1eebng \u0110\u1ed1t'').

Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)&nbsp;\u2013 based on his service in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989), ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), ''[[The Siege of Firebase Gloria]]'' (1989), and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994). Later films would include ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' (2007).<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}}\n\nThe war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded ''[[The \"Fish\" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]'' in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}} Many songwriters and musicians supported the anti-war movement, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Peggy Seeger]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Barbara Dane]], [[The Critics Group]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[John Lennon]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Neil Young]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Jimmy Cliff]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]]. The modern classical composer [[George Crumb]] composed a string quartet, a [[threnody]], regarding the war in 1970 titled [[Black Angels (Crumb)|''Black Angels'']].\n\nThe war is also depicted in popular [[video game]]s, especially in [[first-person shooter]] [[Wargame (video games)|war]] [[genre]], such as ''[[Line of Sight: Vietnam]]'' (2003)'', [[Vietcong (video game)|Vietcong]]'' (2003), ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' (2004), ''[[Vietcong: Fist Alpha]]'' (2004), ''[[Elite Warriors: Vietnam]]'' (2005), ''[[The Hell in Vietnam]]'' (2008), ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified]]'' (2012), ''[[Rising Storm 2: Vietnam]]'' (2017), and in ''[[Far Cry 5#Downloadable content|Far Cry 5]]'' (2018) as an [[Downloadable content|additional content]]. The war also saw [[depiction]] in [[Video game genre|another genre]], in the form of [[third-person shooter]], [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], [[real-time strategy]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], such as ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II#Other media|Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Caliber .50]]'' (1989), ''[[Vietcong 2]]'' (2005), ''[[Made Man (video game)|Made Man]]'' (2006), ''[[Gunboat (video game)|Gunboat]]'' (1990) and ''[[Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam]]'' (2009).\n\n====Myths==== <!-- Redirect target of [[Mythology of the Vietnam War]] and [[Vietnam War myths]] -->\nMyths play a central role in the [[historiography]] of the Vietnam War, and have become a part of the [[culture of the United States]].

These included a total of 45,707 single-barrel shotguns, 611 armoured cars and smaller numbers of carbines and pistols. Writing in 1975, he revealed that \"we had clandestinely been giving 'aid' to Vietnam since early 1958. Published American archival sources now reveal that the actual Malaysian contributions to the war effort in Vietnam included the following: \"over 5,000 Vietnamese officers trained in Malaysia; training of 150 U.S. soldiers in handling Tracker Dogs; a rather impressive list of military equipment and weapons given to Viet-Nam after the end of the Malaysian insurgency (for example, 641 armored personnel carriers, 56,000 shotguns); and a creditable amount of civil assistance (transportation equipment, cholera vaccine, and flood relief)\". It is undeniable that the Government's policy of supporting the South Vietnamese regime with arms, equipment and training was regarded by some quarters, especially the Opposition parties, as a form of interfering in the internal affairs of that country and the Tunku's valiant efforts to defend it were not convincing enough, from a purely foreign policy standpoint. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016191310/http://www.idfr.gov.my/images/stories/publication/2008/tunku.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}\n| combatant1  = {{Plainlist}}\n* {{flag|North Vietnam}}\n* {{flagdeco|Republic of South Vietnam}} [[Viet Cong]] and [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|PRG]]\n* {{flagdeco|Laos}} [[Pathet Lao]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1975}} [[Khmer Rouge]]\n* {{flagdeco|Cambodia|1973}} [[GRUNK]] <small>(1970\u20131975)</small>\n* {{flag|China}}\n* {{flag|Soviet Union|1955}}\n* {{flag|North Korea}}\n{{Endplainlist}}\n{{clist\n|bullets=no\n|title=Supported by:\n| {{nowrap|{{flagcountry|Czechoslovak Socialist Republic}}}}\n| {{flag|Cuba}}\n| {{nowrap|{{flag|East Germany}}}}\n| {{flagcountry|Polish People's Republic|1947}}\n| {{flag|Socialist Republic of Romania|name=Romania}}\n| {{flag|Hungarian People's Republic|name=Hungary}}\n| {{flag|People's Republic of Bulgaria|name=Bulgaria}}\n| {{flag|Sweden}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/why-did-sweeden-support-the-viet-cong.htm |title=Why did Sweden support the Viet Cong? |work=HistoryNet |date=25 July 2013| access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/sweden-announces-support-to-viet-cong |title=Sweden announces support to Viet Cong |work=HISTORY.com | access-date=20 July 2016 |quote=In Sweden, Foreign Minister Torsten Nilsson reveals that Sweden has been providing assistance to the Viet Cong, including some $550,000 worth of medical supplies.

With the VC and PAVN mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, U.S domestic support for the war began fading. The [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) expanded following a period of neglect after Tet and was modeled after U.S doctrine. The VC sustained heavy losses during the Tet Offensive and subsequent U.S.-ARVN operations in the rest of 1968, losing over 50,000 men.<ref name=Hastings/>{{rp|481}} The CIA's [[Phoenix Program]] further degraded the VC's membership and capabilities. By the end of the year, the VC insurgents held almost no territory in South Vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of PAVN regular soldiers from the north.<ref name=Pribbenow/>{{rp|247\u20139}} In 1969, North Vietnam declared a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]] in South Vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced VC a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as PAVN forces begun more conventional [[Combined arms]] warfare. Operations crossed national borders: Laos was invaded by North Vietnam early on, while Cambodia was used by North Vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through Cambodia began to be bombed by the U.S. in 1969, while the Laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. The deposing of the monarch [[Norodom Sihanouk]] by the Cambodian National Assembly resulted in a PAVN invasion of the country at the request of the Khmer Rouge, escalating the Cambodian Civil War and resulting in a U.S.-RVN [[Cambodian campaign|counter-invasion]].\n\nIn 1969, following the election of U.S President Richard Nixon, a policy of \"[[Vietnamization]]\" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded ARVN, with U.S. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. U.S. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. The ARVN, buttressed by said U.S. support, stopped the largest and first mechanized PAVN offensive to date during the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972.The offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the PAVN to subdue South Vietnam, but the ARVN itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] of January 1973 saw all U.S forces withdrawn; the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]], passed by the U.S Congress on 15 August 1973, officially ended direct U.S military involvement.<ref name=Kolko>{{cite book|last=Kolko|first=Gabriel|title=Anatomy of a War: Vietnam, the United States, and the Modern Historical Experience|url=https://archive.org/details/anatomyofwarviet00kolk|url-access=registration|publisher=Pantheon Books|year=1985|isbn=978-0394747613}}</ref>{{rp|457}} The Peace Accords were broken almost immediately, and fighting continued for two more years.

First, this decree was issued in 1953 for the rent and interest reduction campaign that preceded the far more radical land redistribution and party rectification campaigns (or waves) that followed during 1954\u20131956. Second, the decree was meant to apply to free areas (under the control of the Viet Minh government), not to the areas under French control that would be liberated in 1954\u20131955 and that would experience a far more violent struggle. Thus the number of 13,500 executed people seems to be a low-end estimate of the real number. This is corroborated by Edwin Moise in his recent paper \"Land Reform in North Vietnam, 1953\u20131956\" presented at the 18th Annual Conference on SE Asian Studies, Center for SE Asian Studies, University of California, Berkeley (February 2001). In this paper Moise (7\u20139) modified his earlier estimate in his 1983 book (which was 5,000) and accepted an estimate close to 15,000 executions. Moise made the case based on Hungarian reports provided by Balazs, but the document I cited above offers more direct evidence for his revised estimate. This document also suggests that the total number should be adjusted up some more, taking into consideration the later radical phase of the campaign, the unauthorized killings at the local level, and the suicides following arrest and torture (the central government bore less direct responsibility for these cases, however). |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420044800/http://www.lib.washington.edu/southeastasia/vsg/elist_2007/Newly%20released%20documents%20on%20the%20land%20reform%20.html|archivedate=20 April 2011  }} cf. {{cite journal|last=Szalontai|first=Balazs|title=Political and Economic Crisis in North Vietnam, 1955\u201356|journal=[[Cold War History (journal)|Cold War History]]|volume=5|issue=4|date=November 2005|pages=395\u2013426|doi=10.1080/14682740500284630|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/eba3f2702e3ef484dfa94ad17652f80187e8067b}} cf. {{cite book|last=Vu|first=Tuong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZbr9iD1HZ8C&q=15%2C000#v=snippet&q=15%2C000&f=false|title=Paths to Development in Asia: South Korea, Vietnam, China, and Indonesia|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-1139489010 |p=103 |quote=Clearly Vietnamese socialism followed a moderate path relative to China.&nbsp;...

In early 1957, South Vietnam enjoyed its first peace in over a decade. Incidents of political violence began to occur in mid-1957, but the government \"did not construe it as a campaign, considering the disorders too diffuse to warrant committing major GVN [Government of Vietnam] resources.\" By early 1959, however, Di\u1ec7m had come to regard the (increasingly frequent) disorders as an organized campaign and implemented Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.<ref>[http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html Excerpts from Law 10/59, 6 May 1959] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723163835/http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html |date=23 July 2008 }}</ref> There had been some division among former Viet Minh whose main goal was to hold the elections promised in the Geneva Accords, leading to \"[[wildcat strike|wildcat]]\" activities separate from the other communists and anti-GVN activists.<ref name=\"WarBegan\" />\n\nIn December 1960, the Viet Cong was formally created with the intent of uniting all anti-GVN activists, including non-communists. It was formed in [[Memot District|Memot, Cambodia]], and directed through a central office known as [[Central Office for South Vietnam|COSVN]]. According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the Viet Cong \"placed heavy emphasis on the withdrawal of American advisors and influence, on land reform and liberalization of the GVN, on [[coalition government]] and the neutralization of Vietnam.\" The identities of the leaders of the organization often were kept secret.<ref name=\"WarBegan\" />\n\nSupport for the VC was driven by peasant resentment of Diem's reversal of land reforms in the countryside. The vast majority of the population lived in villages in the countryside, where a key demand was for land reform. In areas they controlled, the Viet Minh had confiscated large private landholdings, reduced rents and debts, and leased communal lands, mostly to the poorer peasants. Diem brought the landlords back to the villages. People who were farming land they had held for years now had to return it to landlords and pay years of back rent. This rent collection was enforced by the South Vietnamese army.

Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America \"loomed larger than Asia on his sights.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|264}} In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.\u2013Soviet issues. Only 16 months later, the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] (16\u201328 October 1962) played out on television worldwide. It was the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full-scale [[nuclear war]], and the U.S. raised the readiness level of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) forces to [[DEFCON]] 2.\n\nThe Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in South Korea, and Kennedy faced four crisis situations: the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] that he had approved on 4 April,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historynewsnetwork.org/article/161188|title=It's Time to Stop Saying that JFK Inherited the Bay of Pigs Operation from Ike|publisher=History News Network|date=12 May 2015}}</ref> settlement negotiations between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement in May (\"Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.\"<ref name=Karnow/>{{rp|265}}), the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in August, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October. These crises made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to \"draw a line in the sand\" and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna summit meeting with Khrushchev, \"Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.\"<ref>[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F.

He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that \"to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|VTF|1969|loc=IV.

Poor leadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in weakening the ARVN. The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the Viet Cong played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.<ref name=McNamara/>{{rp|369}}\n\nOne major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using [[special forces]] for [[counterinsurgency]] warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional Soviet invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a \"brush fire\" war in Vietnam.\n\n[[File:President meets with Secretary of Defense.

He seemed concerned only with fending off coups and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F.

This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents over the Buddhist majority.

Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government, and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Di\u1ec7m's rule. Di\u1ec7m refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the ARVN [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] of Colonel [[L\u00ea Quang Tung]], loyal to Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Nhu, [[X\u00e1 L\u1ee3i Pagoda raids|raided pagodas]] across Vietnam, causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.\n\nU.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a [[regime change]] during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favored Di\u1ec7m. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Di\u1ec7m's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces, and was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ng\u00f4 family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].\n\n[[File:Corpse of Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m in the 1963 coup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m]] after being shot and killed in a coup on 2 November 1963]]\n\nThe CIA was in contact with generals planning to remove Di\u1ec7m.

In Vietnam the diary has often been compared to ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'' and both are used in literary education.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://english.vov.vn/society/amsterdam-mayor-visits-hanoiamsterdam-high-school-284797.vov|title=Amsterdam Mayor visits Hanoi-Amsterdam High School|last=http://vov.vn/|date=10 December 2014|work=VOV Online Newspaper|access-date=17 June 2018}}</ref> Another Vietnamese film produced was ''[[The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone]]'' (''C\u00e1nh \u0111\u1ed3ng hoang)'' in 1979 which weaves the narrative of living on the ground in a US \"free-fire zone\" as well as perspectives from US helicopters.\n\nIn American popular culture, the \"Crazy Vietnam Veteran\", who was suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, became a common [[stock character]] after the war.\n\nOne of the first major films based on the Vietnam War was [[John Wayne]]'s pro-war film, ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968). Further cinematic representations were released during the 1970s and 1980s, including [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979), [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986)&nbsp;\u2013 based on his service in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987), ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987), ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'' (1989), ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989), ''[[The Siege of Firebase Gloria]]'' (1989), and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'' (1994). Later films would include ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' (2002) and ''[[Rescue Dawn]]'' (2007).<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}}\n\nThe war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded ''[[The \"Fish\" Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-to-Die Rag]]'' in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.<ref name=Tucker/>{{rp|}} Many songwriters and musicians supported the anti-war movement, including [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Peggy Seeger]], [[Ewan MacColl]], [[Barbara Dane]], [[The Critics Group]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[John Lennon]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Neil Young]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Jimmy Cliff]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]]. The modern classical composer [[George Crumb]] composed a string quartet, a [[threnody]], regarding the war in 1970 titled [[Black Angels (Crumb)|''Black Angels'']].\n\nThe war is also depicted in popular [[video game]]s, especially in [[first-person shooter]] [[Wargame (video games)|war]] [[genre]], such as ''[[Line of Sight: Vietnam]]'' (2003)'', [[Vietcong (video game)|Vietcong]]'' (2003), ''[[Battlefield Vietnam]]'' (2004), ''[[Vietcong: Fist Alpha]]'' (2004), ''[[Elite Warriors: Vietnam]]'' (2005), ''[[The Hell in Vietnam]]'' (2008), ''[[Battlefield: Bad Company 2: Vietnam]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' (2010), ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops: Declassified]]'' (2012), ''[[Rising Storm 2: Vietnam]]'' (2017), and in ''[[Far Cry 5#Downloadable content|Far Cry 5]]'' (2018) as an [[Downloadable content|additional content]]. The war also saw [[depiction]] in [[Video game genre|another genre]], in the form of [[third-person shooter]], [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], [[real-time strategy]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]], such as ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II#Other media|Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'' (1985), ''[[Caliber .50]]'' (1989), ''[[Vietcong 2]]'' (2005), ''[[Made Man (video game)|Made Man]]'' (2006), ''[[Gunboat (video game)|Gunboat]]'' (1990) and ''[[Strike Fighters 2: Vietnam]]'' (2009).\n\n====Myths==== <!-- Redirect target of [[Mythology of the Vietnam War]] and [[Vietnam War myths]] -->\nMyths play a central role in the [[historiography]] of the Vietnam War, and have become a part of the [[culture of the United States]]. Much like the general historiography of the war, discussion of myth has focused on US experiences, but changing myths of war have also played a role in [[Vietnam]]ese and [[Australia]]n historiography.\n\nRecent scholarship has focused on \"myth-busting\",<ref name=Milam/>{{rp|373}} attacking the previous orthodox and revisionist schools of American historiography of the Vietnam War.

For a time, up to the turn of the 19th century, armies tried to circumvent the problem by moving into range in dispersed formations and charging only the last metres, as the French did in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] (1859), the Prussians in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866), or the Germans against the French in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u201371).\n\nThe advent of the machine gun and the adoption of [[Hydraulic recoil mechanism|hydraulic-recoil]] artillery was a further setback for close order. The showing of the [[Boer]]s against the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899-1902) fanned an enthusiasm for \"Boer tactics\": open order tactics reliant more on achieving fire superiority and moving quickly when enemy fire was ineffective than on positioning oneself for the final bayonet charge.\n\n===World War I assault tactics===\n\n{{see also|Eingreif division}}\n\nIn the first part of the war, the standard assault on a trench line consisted of a lengthy [[barrage (artillery)|artillery barrage]] all along the line, attempting to smash the enemy positions, followed by a rush forward of infantry in massed lines to overwhelm any remaining defenders. This process either failed, or at most gained only a short distance, while incurring enormous casualties, and the armies settled into [[trench warfare]].\n\n===Development of tactics===\n[[File:StB5 \u2013 Willy Rohr.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Rohr]]]]\n\nThe first experimental pioneer assault unit of the German army formed in the spring of 1915, founded by Major Calsow and later commanded and refined by Hauptmann [[Willy Rohr]]. These methods<ref>Hermann Cron: ''Geschichte des Deutschen Heeres im Welkriege 1914-1918''; Berlin 1937, p. 23</ref> further evolved war tactics originally developed by the Prussians, to form the basis of German infiltration tactics. The troops involved were identified as {{lang|de|Sto\u00dftruppen}}, and the term was translated as \"storm troops\" in English.\n\nAllied versions of infiltration tactics were first formally proposed by French Army captain {{Interlanguage link multi|Andr\u00e9 Laffargue|fr}}.<ref>[http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/csir_13/csir_13.asp CSI Report No. 13: Tactical responses to concentrated artillery: Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602111844/http://www.cgsc.edu/carl/resources/csi/csir_13/csir_13.asp |date=2011-06-02 }} ([[Combat Studies Institute]], [[U.S. Army Command and General Staff College]], [[Fort Leavenworth]]).{{US Army}}</ref> In 1915 Laffargue published a pamphlet, \"The attack in trench warfare\", based upon his experiences in combat that same year. He advocated that the first wave of an attack identify hard-to-defeat defenses but not attack them; subsequent waves would do this.

SA Calsow consisted of a headquarters, two [[Combat engineering|pioneer]] companies and a 37mm gun (''Sturmkanone'') battery. The unit was to use heavy shields and [[Personal armor|body armor]] as protection in attacks.\n\nHowever, SA Calsow was never employed in its intended role. Instead it was sent into the line in France as emergency reinforcements during heavy [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] attacks. By June, the unit had already lost half its men. Major Calsow was relieved for this, against his protests that it was not his fault that the unit was not used as intended.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\n===Rohr Assault Battalion===\n[[Image:StB5 \u2013 Sturm-Pionier.jpg|thumb|Stormtrooper of the Assault Bataillon Rohr]]\n\nThe new commander of the Assault Detachment from 8 September 1915 was ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) Willy Rohr, previously commander of the Guard Rifle Battalion. The Assault Detachment was reinforced with a machine gun [[platoon]] and [[flamethrower]] platoon. The old [[infantry support gun]]s had been shown to be too difficult to move across the battlefield, and a new model was developed based on captured Russian [[76 mm divisional gun M1902|76.2mm fortress guns]] and issued to the Assault Detachment.<ref name=\"Gud\" /><ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00e4ger, Herbert|title= German Artillery of World War One|publisher=Crowood Press (UK)|location= |year=2001|page=136|isbn=1-86126-403-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Samuels, Martin|title=Command or control?

The only item of armor kept was the ''[[Stahlhelm#Origin|Stahlhelm]]'', a new model of steel helmet. It later became the standard in all German units by the end of the war, and was used throughout [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nThe new tactics developed by Captain Rohr, building much on his own previous experiences from the front, was based on the use of squad sized stormtroops (\"''Sturmtruppen''\" or \"''Sto\u00dftruppen''\"), supported by a number of heavy support weapons and [[field artillery]] that was to be coordinated at the lowest level possible and rolling up enemy trenches using troops armed with [[hand grenade]]s. These tactics were tested the first time in October 1915 in a successful assault on a French position in the [[Vosges Mountains]].<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nIn December 1915, the Assault Detachment started training men of other German units in the new assault tactics. Around this time the Assault Detachment also changed some of its equipment to better fit its new requirements. Lighter footwear was issued, and uniforms were reinforced with leather patches on knees and elbows to protect them when crawling. Special bags designed to carry grenades replaced the old belts and ammunition pouches, and the standard [[Gewehr 98]] rifle was replaced with the lighter [[Gewehr 98#Karabiner 98a|Karabiner 98a]] previously used by [[cavalry]]men. The stocked artilleryman's pistol/carbine, the 9mm [[Luger pistol#Lange Pistole 08 (Artillery Luger)|Lange Pistole 08]], was also used in concert with an extended 32-round drum magazine to increase the close-range firepower of the unit. The long and impractical \u00e9p\u00e9e-style Seitengewehr 98 bayonet was replaced by shorter models, and supplemented with [[trench knives]], clubs, and other melee weapons. While continuing to train other units, the Assault Detachment also participated in many small [[Trench raiding|trench raids]] and attacks with limited objectives.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nThe first major offensive led by the new Assault Detachment was the initial German attack at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] in February 1916. Stormtroops were in the first wave, leading some units into the French trenches, attacking seconds after the barrage had lifted. This generally worked very well, even though it worked much better against the first trenchline than against the less well-known enemy rear-area.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nOn 1 April 1916, the Assault Detachment was redesignated \"Assault Battalion Rohr\". Around this time it was expanded from two to four pioneer companies. At the same time, several [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] battalions began retraining as new Assault Battalions.<ref name=\"Gud\" /><ref name=\"Cron\">{{cite book|author1=Rogers, Duncan F. |author2=Cron, Hermann |title=Imperial German Army 1914-18: Organisation, Structure, Orders of Battle|publisher=Helion & Company|location= |year=2002|page=119|isbn=1-874622-70-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Hutier and the last German offensive===\nGeneral [[Oskar von Hutier]], now commanding Eighth Army, became a champion of the new tactics, which became known as [[Infiltration tactics|Hutier tactics]] in Britain and the allies.\n\nHutier suggested an alternative approach, combining some previous and some new attacks in a complex strategy:<ref>Westwell ,I. (2000). ''World War I Day by Day''. {{ISBN|9781840133622}}.</ref>\n# A short artillery bombardment, employing heavy shells mixed with numerous [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] projectiles, to neutralize the enemy front lines, and not try to destroy them.\n# Under a [[creeping barrage]], ''Sto\u00dftruppen'' would then move forward, in dispersed order. They would avoid combat whenever possible, infiltrate the Allied defenses at previously identified weak points, and destroy or capture enemy headquarters and artillery strongpoints.\n# Next, infantry battalions with extra [[light machine gun]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] and [[flamethrower]]s, would attack on narrow fronts against any Allied strongpoints the shock troops missed. Mortars and field guns would be in place to fire as needed to accelerate the breakthrough.\n# In the last stage of the assault, regular infantry would mop up any remaining Allied resistance.\n\nThe new assault method had men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down [[suppressive fire]] for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, which were intended to achieve tactical surprise, were to attack the weakest parts of an enemy's line, bypass his strongpoints and to abandon the futile attempt to have a grand and detailed plan of operations controlled from afar. Instead, junior leaders could [[Directive control|exercise initiative on the spot]]. Any enemy strong points which had not been overrun by stormtroopers could be attacked by the second echelon troops following the stormtroopers.\n\n===Stormtroopers in 1918===\nWith the withdrawal of Russia, Germany moved troops from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] to reinforce the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. This allowed them to take units out of the line for retraining as stormtroopers.\n\nOn 21 March 1918, Germany launched [[Operation Michael]], a major offensive, using the new tactics. Four successive German offensives followed and for the first time in four years the stalemate of trench warfare was broken. However, the German advance failed to achieve the complete breakthrough necessary for a decisive result and in July the Allies began their [[Hundred Days Offensive]].<ref name=\"Griff\"/>\n\n====Reasons for the failure of the offensive====\nApart from suffering heavy casualties several other reasons for the failure of the stormtroops have been suggested.\n\n# The initial attack was against the British section of the front which was the most strongly held.<ref>Delany, J., The Blitzkrieg campaigns: Germany's \"lightning war\" strategy in action</ref>\n# The leading units were not relieved or rotated out of action and became exhausted.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n# The terrain contained many rivers, towns, forests and canals which slowed the advance.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n# The [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza epidemic]].<ref>''The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I'', John Mosier, 2002</ref>\n# The capture of British stores which contained large quantities of alcohol\u2014\"not for lack of German fighting spirit, but on account of the abundance of English drinking spirit!\"<ref>Soldiers: a history of men in battle - John Keegan, Richard Holmes, John Gau - 1986 - 288 pages</ref>\n\n===3rd and 46th Assault Company===\nWith three infantry battalions, the German 703rd Infantry Battalion, some machine-gun, cavalry, and artillery units, the 3rd Assault Company, and the 46th Assault Company counterattacked the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].

The assault detachment was given a four\u2013week course in German\u2013style stormtrooper tactics, to which the division sent an additional officer and five NCOs.

L. Waite]] and ''Male Fantasies'' by [[Klaus Theweleit]], some of the psychological and social aspects of the Stormtrooper experience found their way into the [[Weimar paramilitary groups|Weimar republic paramilitary groups]] such as the [[Freikorps]], which were largely made up of World War I veterans. For example, the formal barrier between officer and staff was largely broken down and replaced by a fierce loyalty. There was also a \"brutalization\" process owing to the uniquely violent conditions of such raids. The name ''Sturmabteilung'' itself was commandeered by the Nazi Party for its squads of brown-shirted streetfighters and bullies.\n\n==Austro-Hungarian assault units==\nDuring the winter of 1914\u20131915 large parts of the Eastern Front switched to trench warfare. To cope with the new situation many Austro-Hungarian regiments spontaneously formed infantry squads called ''[[Jagdkommando]]s''. These squads were named after the specially trained forces of Russian army formed in 1886 and were used to protect against ambushes, to perform reconnaissance and for low intensity fights in no-man's-land.\n\nAustro-Hungarian High army command (''Armeeoberkommando'', AOK) realised the need for [[special forces]] and decided to draw on German experience. Starting in September\u2013October 1916 about 120 officers and 300 NCOs were trained in the German training area in Beuville (near the village of [[Doncourt-l\u00e8s-Conflans|Doncourt]]) to be the main cadre of the newly raised Austro-Hungarian army assault battalions. The former ''Jagdkommandos'' were incorporated into these battalions.\n\n==Ottoman stormtroopers==\nDuring the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]], especially in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]], Ottomans utilized [[Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Army Group]] which used the latest Western Front infiltration tactics and [[close combat]] gear such as [[Stahlhelm]]s and stick-grenades with concentrated fire of artillery and machine guns.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = History Press| isbn = 9780750966610| last = Hadaway| first = Stuart| title = From Gaza to Jerusalem: The Campaign for Southern Palestine 1917| date = 2015-10-01|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsSQCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR63&lpg=PR63&dq=ottoman+stormtroopers&source=bl&ots=a7atupuUhB&sig=-8XY7cKGe157ow2c8Nff_V9hU_o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGttnaq73QAhUHuhoKHeluB_wQ6AEISDAI#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20stormtroopers&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Yale University Press| isbn = 9780300219456| last = Faulkner| first = Neil| title = Lawrence of Arabia's War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WWI| date = 2016-05-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y64ODAAAQBAJ&pg=PT482}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Arditi]]''\n* ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'', a paramilitary arm of the [[Nazi Party]], also known as the SA, or Brownshirts\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Cron |first1=Hermann |last2=Rogers |first2=Duncan F. |title=Imperial German Army 1914\u201318: Organisation, Structure, Orders of Battle |publisher=Helion |location= |year=2002 |isbn=1-874622-70-1}}\n* {{cite book |title=Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: A Comparative Study |last=Erickson |first=Edward J. |series=Cass: Military History and Policy |number=26 |editor-last1=Gooch |editor-first1=John |editor-first2=Brian |editor-last2=Holden Reid |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-0-203-96456-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Paddy |title=Battle Tactics of the Western Front: The British Army's Art of Attack, 1916\u201318 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05910-8}}\n* {{cite book |last=J\u00e4ger |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |year=2001 |isbn=1-86126-403-8}}\n* {{cite book |last=Samuels |first=Martin |title=Command or Control?

For a time, up to the turn of the 19th century, armies tried to circumvent the problem by moving into range in dispersed formations and charging only the last metres, as the French did in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] (1859), the Prussians in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866), or the Germans against the French in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u201371).\n\nThe advent of the machine gun and the adoption of [[Hydraulic recoil mechanism|hydraulic-recoil]] artillery was a further setback for close order. The showing of the [[Boer]]s against the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] (1899-1902) fanned an enthusiasm for \"Boer tactics\": open order tactics reliant more on achieving fire superiority and moving quickly when enemy fire was ineffective than on positioning oneself for the final bayonet charge.\n\n===World War I assault tactics===\n\n{{see also|Eingreif division}}\n\nIn the first part of the war, the standard assault on a trench line consisted of a lengthy [[barrage (artillery)|artillery barrage]] all along the line, attempting to smash the enemy positions, followed by a rush forward of infantry in massed lines to overwhelm any remaining defenders. This process either failed, or at most gained only a short distance, while incurring enormous casualties, and the armies settled into [[trench warfare]].\n\n===Development of tactics===\n[[File:StB5 \u2013 Willy Rohr.jpg|thumb|[[Willy Rohr]]]]\n\nThe first experimental pioneer assault unit of the German army formed in the spring of 1915, founded by Major Calsow and later commanded and refined by Hauptmann [[Willy Rohr]].

Major Calsow was relieved for this, against his protests that it was not his fault that the unit was not used as intended.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\n===Rohr Assault Battalion===\n[[Image:StB5 \u2013 Sturm-Pionier.jpg|thumb|Stormtrooper of the Assault Bataillon Rohr]]\n\nThe new commander of the Assault Detachment from 8 September 1915 was ''[[Hauptmann]]'' (Captain) Willy Rohr, previously commander of the Guard Rifle Battalion. The Assault Detachment was reinforced with a machine gun [[platoon]] and [[flamethrower]] platoon. The old [[infantry support gun]]s had been shown to be too difficult to move across the battlefield, and a new model was developed based on captured Russian [[76 mm divisional gun M1902|76.2mm fortress guns]] and issued to the Assault Detachment.<ref name=\"Gud\" /><ref>{{cite book|author=J\u00e4ger, Herbert|title= German Artillery of World War One|publisher=Crowood Press (UK)|location= |year=2001|page=136|isbn=1-86126-403-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Samuels, Martin|title=Command or control?

The only item of armor kept was the ''[[Stahlhelm#Origin|Stahlhelm]]'', a new model of steel helmet. It later became the standard in all German units by the end of the war, and was used throughout [[World War II]].<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nThe new tactics developed by Captain Rohr, building much on his own previous experiences from the front, was based on the use of squad sized stormtroops (\"''Sturmtruppen''\" or \"''Sto\u00dftruppen''\"), supported by a number of heavy support weapons and [[field artillery]] that was to be coordinated at the lowest level possible and rolling up enemy trenches using troops armed with [[hand grenade]]s. These tactics were tested the first time in October 1915 in a successful assault on a French position in the [[Vosges Mountains]].<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nIn December 1915, the Assault Detachment started training men of other German units in the new assault tactics. Around this time the Assault Detachment also changed some of its equipment to better fit its new requirements. Lighter footwear was issued, and uniforms were reinforced with leather patches on knees and elbows to protect them when crawling. Special bags designed to carry grenades replaced the old belts and ammunition pouches, and the standard [[Gewehr 98]] rifle was replaced with the lighter [[Gewehr 98#Karabiner 98a|Karabiner 98a]] previously used by [[cavalry]]men. The stocked artilleryman's pistol/carbine, the 9mm Lange Pistole 08, was also used in concert with an extended 32-round drum magazine to increase the close-range firepower of the unit. The long and impractical \u00e9p\u00e9e-style Seitengewehr 98 bayonet was replaced by shorter models, and supplemented with [[trench knives]], clubs, and other melee weapons. While continuing to train other units, the Assault Detachment also participated in many small [[Trench raiding|trench raids]] and attacks with limited objectives.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nThe first major offensive led by the new Assault Detachment was the initial German attack at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] in February 1916. Stormtroops were in the first wave, leading some units into the French trenches, attacking seconds after the barrage had lifted. This generally worked very well, even though it worked much better against the first trenchline than against the less well-known enemy rear-area.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n\nOn 1 April 1916, the Assault Detachment was redesignated \"Assault Battalion Rohr\". Around this time it was expanded from two to four pioneer companies. At the same time, several [[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]] battalions began retraining as new Assault Battalions.<ref name=\"Gud\" /><ref name=\"Cron\">{{cite book|author1=Rogers, Duncan F. |author2=Cron, Hermann |title=Imperial German Army 1914-18: Organisation, Structure, Orders of Battle|publisher=Helion & Company|location= |year=2002|page=119|isbn=1-874622-70-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Hutier and the last German offensive===\nGeneral [[Oskar von Hutier]], now commanding Eighth Army, became a champion of the new tactics, which became known as [[Infiltration tactics|Hutier tactics]] in Britain and the allies.\n\nHutier suggested an alternative approach, combining some previous and some new attacks in a complex strategy:<ref>Westwell ,I. (2000). ''World War I Day by Day''. {{ISBN|9781840133622}}.</ref>\n# A short artillery bombardment, employing heavy shells mixed with numerous [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] projectiles, to neutralize the enemy front lines, and not try to destroy them.\n# Under a [[creeping barrage]], ''Sto\u00dftruppen'' would then move forward, in dispersed order. They would avoid combat whenever possible, infiltrate the Allied defenses at previously identified weak points, and destroy or capture enemy headquarters and artillery strongpoints.\n# Next, infantry battalions with extra [[light machine gun]]s, [[Mortar (weapon)|mortars]] and [[flamethrower]]s, would attack on narrow fronts against any Allied strongpoints the shock troops missed. Mortars and field guns would be in place to fire as needed to accelerate the breakthrough.\n# In the last stage of the assault, regular infantry would mop up any remaining Allied resistance.\n\nThe new assault method had men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down [[suppressive fire]] for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics, which were intended to achieve tactical surprise, were to attack the weakest parts of an enemy's line, bypass his strongpoints and to abandon the futile attempt to have a grand and detailed plan of operations controlled from afar. Instead, junior leaders could [[Directive control|exercise initiative on the spot]]. Any enemy strong points which had not been overrun by stormtroopers could be attacked by the second echelon troops following the stormtroopers.\n\n===Stormtroopers in 1918===\nWith the withdrawal of Russia, Germany moved troops from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] to reinforce the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]. This allowed them to take units out of the line for retraining as stormtroopers.\n\nOn 21 March 1918, Germany launched [[Operation Michael]], a major offensive, using the new tactics. Four successive German offensives followed and for the first time in four years the stalemate of trench warfare was broken. However, the German advance failed to achieve the complete breakthrough necessary for a decisive result and in July the Allies began their [[Hundred Days Offensive]].<ref name=\"Griff\"/>\n\n====Reasons for the failure of the offensive====\nApart from suffering heavy casualties several other reasons for the failure of the stormtroops have been suggested.\n\n# The initial attack was against the British section of the front which was the most strongly held.<ref>Delany, J., The Blitzkrieg campaigns: Germany's \"lightning war\" strategy in action</ref>\n# The leading units were not relieved or rotated out of action and became exhausted.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n# The terrain contained many rivers, towns, forests and canals which slowed the advance.<ref name=\"Gud\" />\n# The [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 influenza epidemic]].<ref>''The Myth of the Great War: A New Military History of World War I'', John Mosier, 2002</ref>\n# The capture of British stores which contained large quantities of alcohol\u2014\"not for lack of German fighting spirit, but on account of the abundance of English drinking spirit!\"<ref>Soldiers: a history of men in battle - John Keegan, Richard Holmes, John Gau - 1986 - 288 pages</ref>\n\n===3rd and 46th Assault Company===\nWith three infantry battalions, the German 703rd Infantry Battalion, some machine-gun, cavalry, and artillery units, the 3rd Assault Company, and the 46th Assault Company counterattacked the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]].

L. Waite]] and ''Male Fantasies'' by [[Klaus Theweleit]], some of the psychological and social aspects of the Stormtrooper experience found their way into the [[Weimar paramilitary groups|Weimar republic paramilitary groups]] such as the [[Freikorps]], which were largely made up of World War I veterans. For example, the formal barrier between officer and staff was largely broken down and replaced by a fierce loyalty. There was also a \"brutalization\" process owing to the uniquely violent conditions of such raids. The name ''Sturmabteilung'' itself was commandeered by the Nazi Party for its squads of brown-shirted streetfighters and bullies.\n\n==Austro-Hungarian assault units==\nDuring the winter of 1914\u20131915 large parts of the Eastern Front switched to trench warfare. To cope with the new situation many Austro-Hungarian regiments spontaneously formed infantry squads called ''[[Jagdkommando]]s''. These squads were named after the specially trained forces of Russian army formed in 1886 and were used to protect against ambushes, to perform reconnaissance and for low intensity fights in no-man's-land.\n\nAustro-Hungarian High army command (''Armeeoberkommando'', AOK) realised the need for [[special forces]] and decided to draw on German experience. Starting in September\u2013October 1916 about 120 officers and 300 NCOs were trained in the German training area in Beuville (near the village of [[Doncourt-l\u00e8s-Conflans|Doncourt]]) to be the main cadre of the newly raised Austro-Hungarian army assault battalions. The former ''Jagdkommandos'' were incorporated into these battalions.\n\n==Ottoman stormtroopers==\nDuring the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]], especially in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]], Ottomans utilized [[Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m Army Group]] which used the latest Western Front infiltration tactics and [[close combat]] gear such as [[Stahlhelm]]s and stick-grenades with concentrated fire of artillery and machine guns.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = History Press| isbn = 9780750966610| last = Hadaway| first = Stuart| title = From Gaza to Jerusalem: The Campaign for Southern Palestine 1917| date = 2015-10-01|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsSQCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR63&lpg=PR63&dq=ottoman+stormtroopers&source=bl&ots=a7atupuUhB&sig=-8XY7cKGe157ow2c8Nff_V9hU_o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGttnaq73QAhUHuhoKHeluB_wQ6AEISDAI#v=onepage&q=ottoman%20stormtroopers&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Yale University Press| isbn = 9780300219456| last = Faulkner| first = Neil| title = Lawrence of Arabia's War: The Arabs, the British and the Remaking of the Middle East in WWI| date = 2016-05-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y64ODAAAQBAJ&pg=PT482}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Arditi]]''\n* ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'', a paramilitary arm of the [[Nazi Party]], also known as the SA, or Brownshirts\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Cron |first1=Hermann |last2=Rogers |first2=Duncan F. |title=Imperial German Army 1914\u201318: Organisation, Structure, Orders of Battle |publisher=Helion |location= |year=2002 |isbn=1-874622-70-1}}\n* {{cite book |title=Ottoman Army Effectiveness in World War I: A Comparative Study |last=Erickson |first=Edward J. |series=Cass: Military History and Policy |number=26 |editor-last1=Gooch |editor-first1=John |editor-first2=Brian |editor-last2=Holden Reid |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon |isbn=978-0-203-96456-9}}\n* {{cite book |last=Griffith |first=Paddy |title=Battle Tactics of the Western Front: The British Army's Art of Attack, 1916\u201318 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, CT |year=1994 |isbn=0-300-05910-8}}\n* {{cite book |last=J\u00e4ger |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |location=Marlborough |year=2001 |isbn=1-86126-403-8}}\n* {{cite book |last=Samuels |first=Martin |title=Command or Control?

(sound source: 100 ms [[white noise]] from 90\u00b0 [[azimuth]], 0\u00b0 [[elevation]])]]\n\nThe '''interaural time difference''' (or '''ITD''') when concerning humans or animals, is the difference in arrival time of a sound between two ears. It is important in the [[Sound_localization|localization of sounds]], as it provides a cue to the direction or angle of the sound source from the head. If a signal arrives at the head from one side, the signal has further to travel to reach the far ear than the near ear. This pathlength difference results in a time difference between the sound's arrivals at the ears, which is detected and aids the process of identifying the direction of sound source.\n\nWhen a signal is produced in the horizontal plane, its angle in relation to the head is referred to as its [[azimuth]], with 0 degrees (0\u00b0) azimuth being directly in front of the listener, 90\u00b0 to the right, and 180\u00b0 being directly behind.\n\n==Different methods for measuring ITDs==\n*For an abrupt stimulus such as a click, onset ITDs are measured. An onset ITD is the time difference between the onset of the signal reaching two ears.\n*A transient ITD can be measured when using a random noise stimulus and is calculated as the time difference between a set peak of the noise stimulus reaching the ears.\n*If the stimulus used is not abrupt but periodic then ongoing ITDs are measured. This is where the waveforms reaching both ears can be shifted in time until they perfectly match up and the size of this shift is recorded as the ITD. This shift is known as the interaural phase difference (IPD) and can be used for measuring the ITDs of periodic inputs such as pure tones and amplitude modulated stimuli.  An amplitude modulated stimulus IPD can be assessed by looking at either the waveform [[Temporal envelope and fine structure|envelope]] or the waveform [[Temporal envelope and fine structure|fine structure]].\n\n==Duplex theory==\nThe Duplex theory proposed by [[Lord Rayleigh]] (1907) provides an explanation for the ability of humans to localise sounds by time differences between the sounds reaching each ear (ITDs) and differences in sound level entering the ears (interaural level differences, ILDs). But there still lies a question whether ITD or ILD is prominent.\n\nThe duplex theory states that ITDs are used to localise low frequency sounds, in particular, while ILDs are used in the localisation of high frequency sound inputs. However, the frequency ranges for which the auditory system can use ITDs and ILDs significantly overlap, and most natural sounds will have both high and low frequency components, so that the auditory system will in most cases have to combine information from both ITDs and ILDs to judge the location of a sound source.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Auditory Neuroscience\n | author = Jan Schnupp, Israel Nelken and Andrew King\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | year = 2011\n | isbn = 0-262-11318-X\n | url = https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal\n | access-date = 2011-04-14\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110129053859/https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal/\n | archive-date = 2011-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> \nA consequence of this duplex system is that it is also possible to generate so-called \"cue trading\" or \"time\u2013intensity trading\" stimuli on headphones, where ITDs pointing to the left are offset by ILDs pointing to the right, so the sound is perceived as coming from the midline.\nA limitation of the duplex theory is that the theory does not completely explain directional hearing, as no explanation is given for the ability to distinguish between a sound source directly in front and behind. Also the theory only relates to localising sounds in the horizontal plane around the head. The theory also does not take into account the use of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] in localisation.(Gelfand, 2004)\n\nExperiments conducted by Woodworth (1938) tested the duplex theory by using a solid sphere to model the shape of the head and measuring the ITDs as a function of azimuth for different frequencies. The model used had a distance between the 2 ears of approximately 22\u201323&nbsp;cm. Initial measurements found that there was a maximum time delay of approximately 660 \u03bcs when the sound source was placed at directly 90\u00b0 azimuth to one ear. This time delay correlates to the wavelength of a sound input with a [[frequency]] of 1500&nbsp;Hz. The results concluded that when a sound played had a frequency less than 1500&nbsp;Hz the [[wavelength]] is greater than this maximum time delay between the ears. Therefore, there is a [[phase difference]] between the sound waves entering the ears providing acoustic localisation cues. With a sound input with a frequency closer to 1500&nbsp;Hz the wavelength of the sound wave is similar to the natural time delay. Therefore, due to the size of the head and the distance between the ears there is a reduced phase difference so localisations errors start to be made. When a high frequency sound input is used with a frequency greater than 1500&nbsp;Hz, the wavelength is shorter than the distance between the 2 ears, a [[head shadow]] is produced and ILD provide cues for the localisation of this sound.\n\nFeddersen et al. (1957) also conducted experiments taking measurements on how ITDs alter with changing the azimuth of the loudspeaker around the head at different frequencies. But unlike the Woodworth experiments human subjects were used rather than a model of the head. The experiment results agreed with the conclusion made by Woodworth about ITDs. The experiments also concluded that is there is no difference in ITDs when sounds are provided from directly in front or behind at 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 azimuth. The explanation for this is that the sound is equidistant from both ears. Interaural time differences alter as the loudspeaker is moved around the head. The maximum ITD of 660 \u03bcs occurs when a sound source is positioned at 90\u00b0 azimuth to one ear.\n\n==Current findings==\n\nStarting in 1948, the prevailing theory on interaural time differences centered on the idea that inputs from the medial superior olive differentially process inputs from the ipsilateral and contralateral side relative to the sound. This is accomplished through a discrepancy in arrival time of excitatory inputs into the medial superior olive, based on differential conductance of the axons, which allows both sounds to ultimately converge at the same time through neurons with complementary intrinsic properties. \n\nThe article ''In vivo coincidence detection in mammalian sound localization generates phase delays'', authored by Franken et al., attempts to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying ITD in mammalian brains. One experiment they performed was to isolate discrete inhibitory post-synaptic potentials to try and determine if inhibitory inputs to the superior olive were allowing the faster excitatory input to delay firing until the two signals were synced. However, after blocking EPSPs with a glutamate receptor blocker, they determine that the size of inhibitory inputs was too marginal to appear to play a significant role in phase locking. This was verified when the experimenters blocked inhibitory input and still saw clear phase locking of the excitatory inputs in their absence. This led them to the theory that in-phase excitatory inputs are summated such that the brain can process sound localization by counting the number of action potentials that arise from various magnitudes of summated depolarization. \n\nFranken, et al. also examined anatomical and functional patterns within the superior olive to clarify previous theories about the rostrocaudal axis serving as a source of tonotopy. Their results showed a significant correlation between tuning frequency and relative position along the dorsoventral axis, while they saw no distinguishable pattern of tuning frequency on the rostrocaudal axis. \n\nLastly, they went on to further explore the driving forces behind the interaural time difference, specifically whether the process is simply the alignment of inputs that is processed by a coincidence detector, or whether the process is more complicated. Evidence from Franken, et al. shows that the processing is affected by inputs that precede the binaural signal, which would alter the functioning of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels to shift the membrane potential of the neuron. Furthermore, the shift is dependent on the frequency tuning of each neuron, ultimately creating a more complex confluence and analysis of sound. Franken, et al.'s findings provide several pieces of evidence that contradict existing theories about binaural audition.\n\n==The anatomy of the ITD pathway==\nThe auditory nerve fibres, known as the [[afferent nerve]] fibres, carry information from the [[organ of Corti]] to the [[brainstem]] and [[brain]]. Auditory afferent fibres consist of two types of fibres called type I and type II fibres. Type I fibres innervate the base of one or two [[inner hair cells]] and Type II fibres innervate the outer hair cells. Both leave the [[organ of Corti]] through an opening called the habenula perforata. The type I fibres are thicker than the type II fibres and may also differ in how they innervate the [[inner hair cells]]. [[Neurons]] with large calyceal endings ensure preservation of timing information throughout the ITD pathway. \n\nNext in the pathway is the [[cochlear nucleus]], which receives mainly ipsilateral (that is, from the same side) afferent input. The cochlear nucleus has three distinct anatomical divisions, known as the antero-ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), postero-ventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN) and dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and each have different neural innervations.\n\nThe AVCN contains predominant ''bushy cells'', with one or two profusely branching [[dendrites]]; it is thought that bushy cells may process the change in the spectral profile of complex stimuli. The AVCN also contain cells with more complex firing patterns than bushy cells called ''multipolar cells'', these cells have several profusely branching dendrites and irregular shaped cell bodies. Multipolar cells are sensitive to changes in acoustic stimuli and in particular, onset and offset of sounds, as well as changes in intensity and frequency. The axons of both cell types leave the AVCN as large tract called the ''ventral acoustic stria'', which forms part of the [[trapezoid body]] and travels to the [[superior olivary complex]].\n\nA group of nuclei in [[pons]] make up the [[superior olivary complex]] (SOC). This is the first stage in auditory pathway to receive input from both cochleas, which is crucial for our ability to localise the sounds source in the horizontal plane. The SOC receives input from cochlear nuclei, primarily the ipsilateral and contralateral AVCN. Four nuclei make up the SOC but only the medial superior olive (MSO) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) receive input from both cochlear nuclei.\n\nThe MSO is made up of neurons which receive input from the low-frequency fibers of the left and right AVCN. The result of having input from both cochleas is an increase in the firing rate of the MSO units. The neurons in the MSO are sensitive to the difference in the arrival time of sound at each ear, also known as the interaural time difference (ITD). Research shows that if stimulation arrives at one ear before the other, many of the MSO units will have increased discharge rates. The axons from the MSO continue to higher parts of the pathway via the ipsilateral lateral lemniscus tract.(Yost, 2000)\n\nThe [[lateral lemniscus]] (LL) is the main auditory tract in the brainstem connecting SOC to the [[inferior colliculus]]. The dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) is a group of neurons separated by lemniscus fibres, these fibres are predominantly destined for the inferior colliculus (IC). In studies using an unanesthetized rabbit the DNLL was shown to alter the sensitivity of the IC neurons and may alter the coding of interaural timing differences (ITDs) in the IC.(Kuwada et al., 2005) The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) is a chief source of input to the inferior colliculus. Research using rabbits shows the discharge patterns, frequency tuning and dynamic ranges of VNLL neurons supply the inferior colliculus with a variety of inputs, each enabling a different function in the analysis of sound.(Batra & Fitzpatrick, 2001) \nIn the inferior colliculus (IC) all the major ascending pathways from the olivary complex and the central nucleus converge. The IC is situated in the midbrain and consists of a group of nuclei the largest of these is the central nucleus of inferior colliculus (CNIC). The greater part of the ascending axons forming the lateral lemniscus will terminate in the ipsilateral CNIC however a few follow the commissure of Probst and terminate on the contralateral CNIC. The axons of most of the CNIC cells form the brachium of IC and leave the [[brainstem]] to travel to the ipsilateral [[thalamus]]. Cells in different parts of the IC tend to be monaural, responding to input from one ear, or binaural and therefore respond to bilateral stimulation. \n\nThe spectral processing that occurs in the AVCN and the ability to process binaural stimuli, as seen in the SOC, are replicated in the IC. Lower centres of the IC extract different features of the acoustic signal such as frequencies, frequency bands, onsets, offsets, changes in intensity and localisation.  The integration or synthesis of acoustic information is thought to start in the CNIC.(Yost, 2000)\n\n==Effect of a hearing loss==\nA number of studies have looked into the effect of hearing loss on interaural time differences. In their review of localisation and lateralisation studies, Durlach, Thompson, and Colburn (1981), cited in Moore (1996) found a \"clear trend for poor localization and lateralization in people with unilateral or asymmetrical cochlear damage.\" This is due to the difference in performance between the two ears. In support of this, they did not find significant localisation problems in individuals with symmetrical cochlear losses. \nIn addition to this, studies have been conducted into the effect of hearing loss on the threshold for interaural time differences. The normal human threshold for detection of an ITD is up to a time difference of 10\u03bcs (microseconds). Studies by Gabriel, Koehnke, & Colburn (1992), H\u00e4usler, Colburn, & Marr (1983) and Kinkel, Kollmeier, & Holube (1991)(cited by Moore, 1996) have shown that there can be great differences between individuals regarding binaural performance. It was found that unilateral or asymmetric hearing losses can increase the threshold of ITD detection in patients. This was also found to apply to individuals with symmetrical hearing losses when detecting ITDs in narrowband signals.

(sound source: 100 ms [[white noise]] from 90\u00b0 [[azimuth]], 0\u00b0 [[elevation]])]]\n\nThe '''interaural time difference''' (or '''ITD''') when concerning humans or animals, is the difference in arrival time of a sound between two ears. It is important in the localization of sounds, as it provides a cue to the direction or angle of the sound source from the head. If a signal arrives at the head from one side, the signal has further to travel to reach the far ear than the near ear. This pathlength difference results in a time difference between the sound's arrivals at the ears, which is detected and aids the process of identifying the direction of sound source.\n\nWhen a signal is produced in the horizontal plane, its angle in relation to the head is referred to as its [[azimuth]], with 0 degrees (0\u00b0) azimuth being directly in front of the listener, 90\u00b0 to the right, and 180\u00b0 being directly behind.\n\n==Different methods for measuring ITDs==\n*For an abrupt stimulus such as a click, onset ITDs are measured. An onset ITD is the time difference between the onset of the signal reaching two ears.\n*A transient ITD can be measured when using a random noise stimulus and is calculated as the time difference between a set peak of the noise stimulus reaching the ears.\n*If the stimulus used is not abrupt but periodic then ongoing ITDs are measured. This is where the waveforms reaching both ears can be shifted in time until they perfectly match up and the size of this shift is recorded as the ITD. This shift is known as the interaural phase difference (IPD) and can be used for measuring the ITDs of periodic inputs such as pure tones and amplitude modulated stimuli.  An amplitude modulated stimulus IPD can be assessed by looking at either the waveform [[Temporal envelope and fine structure|envelope]] or the waveform [[Temporal envelope and fine structure|fine structure]].\n\n==Duplex theory==\nThe Duplex theory proposed by [[Lord Rayleigh]] (1907) provides an explanation for the ability of humans to localise sounds by time differences between the sounds reaching each ear (ITDs) and differences in sound level entering the ears (interaural level differences, ILDs). But there still lies a question whether ITD or ILD is prominent.\n\nThe duplex theory states that ITDs are used to localise low frequency sounds, in particular, while ILDs are used in the localisation of high frequency sound inputs. However, the frequency ranges for which the auditory system can use ITDs and ILDs significantly overlap, and most natural sounds will have both high and low frequency components, so that the auditory system will in most cases have to combine information from both ITDs and ILDs to judge the location of a sound source.<ref>{{cite book\n | title = Auditory Neuroscience\n | author = Jan Schnupp, Israel Nelken and Andrew King\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | year = 2011\n | isbn = 0-262-11318-X\n | url = https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal\n | access-date = 2011-04-14\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110129053859/https://mustelid.physiol.ox.ac.uk/drupal/\n | archive-date = 2011-01-29\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> \nA consequence of this duplex system is that it is also possible to generate so-called \"cue trading\" or \"time\u2013intensity trading\" stimuli on headphones, where ITDs pointing to the left are offset by ILDs pointing to the right, so the sound is perceived as coming from the midline.\nA limitation of the duplex theory is that the theory does not completely explain directional hearing, as no explanation is given for the ability to distinguish between a sound source directly in front and behind. Also the theory only relates to localising sounds in the horizontal plane around the head. The theory also does not take into account the use of the [[pinna (anatomy)|pinna]] in localisation.(Gelfand, 2004)\n\nExperiments conducted by Woodworth (1938) tested the duplex theory by using a solid sphere to model the shape of the head and measuring the ITDs as a function of azimuth for different frequencies. The model used had a distance between the 2 ears of approximately 22\u201323&nbsp;cm. Initial measurements found that there was a maximum time delay of approximately 660 \u03bcs when the sound source was placed at directly 90\u00b0 azimuth to one ear. This time delay correlates to the wavelength of a sound input with a [[frequency]] of 1500&nbsp;Hz. The results concluded that when a sound played had a frequency less than 1500&nbsp;Hz the [[wavelength]] is greater than this maximum time delay between the ears. Therefore, there is a [[phase difference]] between the sound waves entering the ears providing acoustic localisation cues. With a sound input with a frequency closer to 1500&nbsp;Hz the wavelength of the sound wave is similar to the natural time delay. Therefore, due to the size of the head and the distance between the ears there is a reduced phase difference so localisations errors start to be made. When a high frequency sound input is used with a frequency greater than 1500&nbsp;Hz, the wavelength is shorter than the distance between the 2 ears, a [[head shadow]] is produced and ILD provide cues for the localisation of this sound.\n\nFeddersen et al. (1957) also conducted experiments taking measurements on how ITDs alter with changing the azimuth of the loudspeaker around the head at different frequencies. But unlike the Woodworth experiments human subjects were used rather than a model of the head. The experiment results agreed with the conclusion made by Woodworth about ITDs. The experiments also concluded that is there is no difference in ITDs when sounds are provided from directly in front or behind at 0\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 azimuth. The explanation for this is that the sound is equidistant from both ears. Interaural time differences alter as the loudspeaker is moved around the head. The maximum ITD of 660 \u03bcs occurs when a sound source is positioned at 90\u00b0 azimuth to one ear.\n\n==Current findings==\n\nStarting in 1948, the prevailing theory on interaural time differences centered on the idea that inputs from the medial superior olive differentially process inputs from the ipsilateral and contralateral side relative to the sound. This is accomplished through a discrepancy in arrival time of excitatory inputs into the medial superior olive, based on differential conductance of the axons, which allows both sounds to ultimately converge at the same time through neurons with complementary intrinsic properties. \n\nThe article ''In vivo coincidence detection in mammalian sound localization generates phase delays'', authored by Franken et al., attempts to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying ITD in mammalian brains. One experiment they performed was to isolate discrete inhibitory post-synaptic potentials to try and determine if inhibitory inputs to the superior olive were allowing the faster excitatory input to delay firing until the two signals were synced. However, after blocking EPSPs with a glutamate receptor blocker, they determine that the size of inhibitory inputs was too marginal to appear to play a significant role in phase locking. This was verified when the experimenters blocked inhibitory input and still saw clear phase locking of the excitatory inputs in their absence. This led them to the theory that in-phase excitatory inputs are summated such that the brain can process sound localization by counting the number of action potentials that arise from various magnitudes of summated depolarization. \n\nFranken, et al. also examined anatomical and functional patterns within the superior olive to clarify previous theories about the rostrocaudal axis serving as a source of tonotopy. Their results showed a significant correlation between tuning frequency and relative position along the dorsoventral axis, while they saw no distinguishable pattern of tuning frequency on the rostrocaudal axis. \n\nLastly, they went on to further explore the driving forces behind the interaural time difference, specifically whether the process is simply the alignment of inputs that is processed by a coincidence detector, or whether the process is more complicated. Evidence from Franken, et al. shows that the processing is affected by inputs that precede the binaural signal, which would alter the functioning of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels to shift the membrane potential of the neuron. Furthermore, the shift is dependent on the frequency tuning of each neuron, ultimately creating a more complex confluence and analysis of sound. Franken, et al.'s findings provide several pieces of evidence that contradict existing theories about binaural audition.\n\n==The anatomy of the ITD pathway==\nThe auditory nerve fibres, known as the [[afferent nerve]] fibres, carry information from the [[organ of Corti]] to the [[brainstem]] and [[brain]]. Auditory afferent fibres consist of two types of fibres called type I and type II fibres. Type I fibres innervate the base of one or two [[inner hair cells]] and Type II fibres innervate the outer hair cells. Both leave the [[organ of Corti]] through an opening called the habenula perforata. The type I fibres are thicker than the type II fibres and may also differ in how they innervate the [[inner hair cells]]. [[Neurons]] with large calyceal endings ensure preservation of timing information throughout the ITD pathway. \n\nNext in the pathway is the [[cochlear nucleus]], which receives mainly ipsilateral (that is, from the same side) afferent input. The cochlear nucleus has three distinct anatomical divisions, known as the antero-ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN), postero-ventral cochlear nucleus (PVCN) and dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) and each have different neural innervations.\n\nThe AVCN contains predominant ''bushy cells'', with one or two profusely branching [[dendrites]]; it is thought that bushy cells may process the change in the spectral profile of complex stimuli. The AVCN also contain cells with more complex firing patterns than bushy cells called ''multipolar cells'', these cells have several profusely branching dendrites and irregular shaped cell bodies. Multipolar cells are sensitive to changes in acoustic stimuli and in particular, onset and offset of sounds, as well as changes in intensity and frequency. The axons of both cell types leave the AVCN as large tract called the ''ventral acoustic stria'', which forms part of the [[trapezoid body]] and travels to the [[superior olivary complex]].\n\nA group of nuclei in [[pons]] make up the [[superior olivary complex]] (SOC). This is the first stage in auditory pathway to receive input from both cochleas, which is crucial for our ability to localise the sounds source in the horizontal plane. The SOC receives input from cochlear nuclei, primarily the ipsilateral and contralateral AVCN. Four nuclei make up the SOC but only the medial superior olive (MSO) and the lateral superior olive (LSO) receive input from both cochlear nuclei.\n\nThe MSO is made up of neurons which receive input from the low-frequency fibers of the left and right AVCN. The result of having input from both cochleas is an increase in the firing rate of the MSO units. The neurons in the MSO are sensitive to the difference in the arrival time of sound at each ear, also known as the interaural time difference (ITD). Research shows that if stimulation arrives at one ear before the other, many of the MSO units will have increased discharge rates. The axons from the MSO continue to higher parts of the pathway via the ipsilateral lateral lemniscus tract.(Yost, 2000)\n\nThe [[lateral lemniscus]] (LL) is the main auditory tract in the brainstem connecting SOC to the [[inferior colliculus]]. The dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (DNLL) is a group of neurons separated by lemniscus fibres, these fibres are predominantly destined for the inferior colliculus (IC). In studies using an unanesthetized rabbit the DNLL was shown to alter the sensitivity of the IC neurons and may alter the coding of interaural timing differences (ITDs) in the IC.(Kuwada et al., 2005) The ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL) is a chief source of input to the inferior colliculus. Research using rabbits shows the discharge patterns, frequency tuning and dynamic ranges of VNLL neurons supply the inferior colliculus with a variety of inputs, each enabling a different function in the analysis of sound.(Batra & Fitzpatrick, 2001) \nIn the inferior colliculus (IC) all the major ascending pathways from the olivary complex and the central nucleus converge. The IC is situated in the midbrain and consists of a group of nuclei the largest of these is the central nucleus of inferior colliculus (CNIC). The greater part of the ascending axons forming the lateral lemniscus will terminate in the ipsilateral CNIC however a few follow the commissure of Probst and terminate on the contralateral CNIC. The axons of most of the CNIC cells form the brachium of IC and leave the [[brainstem]] to travel to the ipsilateral [[thalamus]]. Cells in different parts of the IC tend to be monaural, responding to input from one ear, or binaural and therefore respond to bilateral stimulation. \n\nThe spectral processing that occurs in the AVCN and the ability to process binaural stimuli, as seen in the SOC, are replicated in the IC. Lower centres of the IC extract different features of the acoustic signal such as frequencies, frequency bands, onsets, offsets, changes in intensity and localisation.  The integration or synthesis of acoustic information is thought to start in the CNIC.(Yost, 2000)\n\n==Effect of a hearing loss==\nA number of studies have looked into the effect of hearing loss on interaural time differences. In their review of localisation and lateralisation studies, Durlach, Thompson, and Colburn (1981), cited in Moore (1996) found a \"clear trend for poor localization and lateralization in people with unilateral or asymmetrical cochlear damage.\" This is due to the difference in performance between the two ears. In support of this, they did not find significant localisation problems in individuals with symmetrical cochlear losses. \nIn addition to this, studies have been conducted into the effect of hearing loss on the threshold for interaural time differences. The normal human threshold for detection of an ITD is up to a time difference of 10\u03bcs (microseconds). Studies by Gabriel, Koehnke, & Colburn (1992), H\u00e4usler, Colburn, & Marr (1983) and Kinkel, Kollmeier, & Holube (1991)(cited by Moore, 1996) have shown that there can be great differences between individuals regarding binaural performance. It was found that unilateral or asymmetric hearing losses can increase the threshold of ITD detection in patients. This was also found to apply to individuals with symmetrical hearing losses when detecting ITDs in narrowband signals. However, ITD thresholds seem to be normal for those with symmetrical losses when listening to broadband sounds.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sound localization]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Franken TP, Roberts MT, Wei L, NL NLG, Joris PX.
