She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\n[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3\u20135</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny C\u00e4cilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>\n\nWhile growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>\n\n=== Gender and class limitations ===\nIn the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\n[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\nIn 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nWilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833\u201334. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder f\u00fcr Klavier'' were written in the period 1836\u20131837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\n[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Style and form ===\n[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> \n\nR. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]]. In 1850, the publisher began to distribute Fanny Mendelssohn's unreleased works, starting with ''Vier Lieder'' Op. 8.<ref>Todd (2010), p. 351</ref>\n\nIn recent{{when|date=April 2020}} years, Fanny Mendelssohn's music has become better known thanks to concert performances and a number of CDs being released on labels such as [[Hyperion Records|Hyperion]] and [[Classic Produktion Osnabr\u00fcck|CPO]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} Her ''Easter Sonata'' for piano, formerly attributed to Felix, was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\n===Writings===\nFanny Mendelssohn published no writings during her lifetime.

She grew up in Berlin, Germany, and received a thorough musical education from teachers including her mother, [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]], and [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]]. Her brother [[Felix Mendelssohn]], also a composer and pianist, shared the same education and the two developed a close relationship. Due to the reservations of her family, and to social conventions of the time about the roles of women, a number of her works were published under her brother's name in his [[Opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections. In 1829, she married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]] and, in 1820, the two had their only child, Sebastian Hensel. In 1846, despite the continuing ambivalence of her family towards her musical ambitions, Fanny Hensel published a collection of songs as her Opus 1. The next year, she suddenly died of a stroke.\n\nShe composed over 460 pieces of music, including a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and over 250 [[Lied|Lieder]], most of which went unpublished in her lifetime. Since the 1990s her life and works have been the subject of more detailed research. Her ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' was inaccurately credited to her brother in 1970, before analysis of new documents in 2010 corrected the error.  \n\nThe [[Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum]] opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.\n\n==Life==\n=== Early life and education ===\n[[File:Fannymendelssohn-improved.jpg|thumb|upright|Fanny Mendelssohn, sketched in 1829 by her future husband [[Wilhelm Hensel]]]]Mendelssohn was born in [[Hamburg]], the [[Mendelssohn family|oldest of four children]], including her brother Felix Mendelssohn born four years after her.<ref name=Grove>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> She was descended on both sides from distinguished [[Jewish]] families; her parents were [[Abraham Mendelssohn]] (who was the son of philosopher [[Moses Mendelssohn]] and later changed the family surname to Mendelssohn Bartholdy), and Lea, n\u00e9e Salomon, a granddaughter of the entrepreneur [[Daniel Itzig]].<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 3\u20135</ref> Her uncle was the banker [[Joseph Mendelssohn]]. She was baptised as a Christian in 1816, becoming Fanny C\u00e4cilie Mendelssohn Bartholdy.<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Despite this, she and her family continued an affinity with the social and moral values of Judaism.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987), pp. xxix, 629</ref><ref>Citron (1994), p. 322</ref> Like her brother Felix, she objected strongly when their father Abraham changed the family surname to 'Mendelssohn Bartholdy' with the intention of playing down their Jewish origins: she wrote to Felix of  \"Bartholdy, that name which we all dislike.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) 1987, p. 66</ref>\n\nWhile growing up in the family's new home in Berlin,<ref>Forney (2015), p. 278</ref> Mendelssohn showed prodigious musical ability and began to write music. She received her first piano instruction from her mother, who had learned the Berlin Bach tradition through the writings of [[Johann Kirnberger]], a student of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref>Todd (2010){{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Thus as a 14 year old, Mendelssohn could already play all 24 preludes from Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'' from memory alone, and she did so in honour of her father's birthday in 1819.<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref> Beyond inspiration from her mother, Mendelssohn may also have been influenced by the role-models of her great-aunts [[Fanny von Arnstein]] and [[Itzig family#Sarah Itzig|Sarah Levy]], both lovers of music, the former the patroness of a well-known [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] and the latter a skilled keyboard player in her own right.<ref>Citron (1994), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> \n\nAfter studying briefly with the pianist [[Marie Bigot]] in Paris,<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received piano lessons from [[Ludwig Berger (composer)|Ludwig Berger]] and composition instruction from [[Carl Friedrich Zelter]].<ref>Rogers (2011), p. 178</ref> At one point, Zelter favoured Fanny over Felix: he wrote to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1816, in a letter introducing Abraham Mendelssohn to the poet, \"He has adorable children and his oldest daughter could give you something of Sebastian Bach. This child is really something special.\"<ref>Conway (2011), 171</ref> Both Mendelssohn and her brother Felix received instruction in composition from Zelter starting in 1819. In 1820, they joined the [[Sing-Akademie zu Berlin]], which was led by Zelter at the time.<ref>Mendelssohn (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Much later, in an 1831 letter to Goethe, Zelter described Fanny's skill as a pianist with the highest praise for a woman at the time: \"She plays like a man.\"<ref>Todd (2010) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> Visitors to the Mendelssohn household in the early 1820s, including [[Ignaz Moscheles]] and [[George Thomas Smart|Sir George Smart]], were equally impressed by both siblings.<ref>Conway (2011), p. 169</ref><ref>Smart (1907), pp. 173, 179</ref>\n\n=== Gender and class limitations ===\nIn the words of the music historian Kristine Forney, at this period \"social assumptions about women long discouraged them from composing (and limited their public performances)\".<ref>Forney et al. (2015), page not given</ref> Such attitudes were shared by Mendelssohn's father, who was tolerant, rather than supportive, of her activities as a composer. In 1820, he wrote to her, \"Music will perhaps become his [i.e. Felix's] profession, while for ''you'' it can and must be only an ornament\".<ref>Letter of 16 July 1820, in Hensel (1884), I p. 82</ref> Although Felix was privately broadly supportive of her as a composer and a performer, he was cautious (professedly for family reasons) of her publishing her works under her own name. He wrote:\n<blockquote>From my knowledge of Fanny I should say that she has neither inclination nor vocation for authorship. She is too much all that a woman ought to be for this. She regulates her house, and neither thinks of the public nor of the musical world, nor even of music at all, until her first duties are fulfilled. Publishing would only disturb her in these, and I cannot say that I approve of it.<ref>Letter to Lea Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, 24 June 1837. Mendelssohn (1864), p. 113</ref>  </blockquote>\n\nThe music historian Angela Mace Christian has written that Fanny Mendelssohn \"struggled her entire life with the conflicting impulses of authorship versus the social expectations for her high-class status[...]; her hesitation was variously a result of her dutiful attitude towards her father, her intense relationship with her brother, and her awareness of contemporary social thought on women in the public sphere.\"<ref name=Grove /> Felix's friend [[Henry Chorley]] wrote of Fanny: \"Had Madame Hensel been a poor man's daughter, she must have become known to the world by the side of [[Clara Schumann|Madame Schumann]] and [[Marie Pleyel|Madame Pleyel]] as a female pianist of the highest class\", suggesting that her social class was limiting for her career as well as her sex.<ref>Conway (2011) pp. 27\u201328</ref> \n\nThe biography of the Mendelssohn family compiled from family documents by Fanny's son Sebastian Hensel<ref>Hensel (1884)</ref> has been construed by the musicologist Marian Kimber as intending to represent Fanny as having no aspirations to perform outside the private sphere.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 115</ref> However, the editor of Fanny's correpondence, [[Marcia Citron]], notes that Fanny's \"oft-reported longing for a professional music career is not supported by her ... diaries, which are somewhat surprising for how little they reveal about her musical life.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\">Kimber (2004), p.&nbsp;51</ref>\n\n===Felix and Fanny===\n[[ File:Mendelssohn Bartholdy 1821.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=|right|Felix Mendelssohn aged 12 (1821) by [[Carl Joseph Begas]]]]The siblings' bond was strengthened by their shared passion for music. Fanny's works were often played alongside her brother's at the family home in Berlin in a Sunday concert series (Sonntagskonzerte), which was originally organised by her father, and after 1831 carried on by Fanny herself.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 631</ref> In 1822, when Fanny was 17 and Felix 13, she wrote \"Up to the present moment I possess his {Felix's] unbounded confidence. I have watched the progress of his talent step by step, and may say I have contributed to his development. I have always been his only musical adviser, and he never writes down a thought before submitting it to my judgment.\"<ref>Hensel (1884), p. 117</ref>\n\nIn 1826/1827 Felix arranged with Fanny for some of her songs to be published under his name,<ref name=Hensel>Hensel (1884), II 168\u201371</ref> three in his Op. 8 collection<ref name=Todd175>Todd (2003), p. 175</ref> and three more in his Op. 9.<ref>Todd (2003), p. 224</ref> In 1842, this resulted in an embarrassing moment when [[Queen Victoria]], receiving Felix at [[Buckingham Palace]], expressed her intention of singing to the composer her favourite of his songs, ''Italien'' (to words by [[Franz Grillparzer]]), which Felix confessed was by Fanny.<ref name=Hensel/><ref name=Todd175/>\n\nThere was a lifelong musical correspondence between the two. Fanny helped Felix by providing constructive criticism of pieces and projects, which he always considered very carefully.<ref>Reich (1991), p. 92</ref> Felix would rework pieces solely based on the suggestions she made, and nicknamed her \"Minerva\" after the [[Minerva|Roman goddess of wisdom]].<ref>Library of Congress (n.d.)</ref> Their correspondence of 1840/41 reveals that they were both outlining scenarios for an opera on the subject of the [[Nibelungenlied]]: Fanny wrote \"The hunt with Siegfried's death provides a splendid finale to the second act.\"<ref>Letter of 9 December 1840. See Fanny Mendelssohn (1987), pp. 299\u2013301</ref>\n\n=== Marriage and later life===\n[[File:Wilhelm Hensel - Selbstbildnis.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Wilhelm Hensel: Self-portrait (1829)]]In 1829, after a courtship of several years (they had first met in 1821 when she was 16),<ref name=Grove /> Fanny married the artist [[Wilhelm Hensel]], and the following year had her only child, {{ill|Sebastian Hensel|de|Sebastian Hensel (Landwirt)|lt=Sebastian Ludwig Felix Hensel}}.<ref>Todd (2003), pp. 219, 230</ref> She later had at least two miscarriages or stillbirths, in 1832 and 1837.<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\nIn 1830 came her first public notice as a composer, when John Thomson, who had met her in Berlin the previous year, wrote in the London journal ''[[The Harmonicon]]'' in praise of a number of her songs that had been shown to him by Felix.<ref>Gates (2006), p. 7</ref> Her public debut at the piano (one of only three known public performances according to Mendelssohn scholar R. Larry Todd)<ref>Todd (2010), p. x</ref> came in 1838, when she played her brother's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Mendelssohn)|Piano Concerto No. 1]].<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. xxiv</ref> \n\nWilhelm Hensel, like Felix, was supportive of Fanny's composing, but unlike many others of her circle was also in favour of her seeking publication of her works.<ref>Kimber (2002), p. 116</ref><ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" /><ref>Reich (1991), p. 95.</ref> The historian [[Nancy B. Reich]] has suggested two events which may have increased her confidence.  One was her visit to Italy with her husband and Sebastian in 1839\u201340. This was her first visit to the South and she felt invigorated and inspired; they also spent time with young French musicians who had won the [[Prix de Rome]] (one was the young [[Charles Gounod]]) and whose respect for Fanny powered her self-esteem as a musician. The other event was her acquaintance shortly afterwards with the Berlin critic Robert von Keudell; in her diary she wrote: \"Keudell looks at everything new that I write with the greatest interest, and points out to me if there is something to be corrected [...] He has always given me the very best counsel.\"<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 95\u20136</ref> \n\n[[File:Fannyhenselgrave.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Grave of Fanny Hensel in Berlin]]In 1846, she decided, after an approach by two Berlin publishers,<ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, p. 325</ref> and without consulting Felix, to publish a collection of her songs (as her Op. 1).<ref>Citron, (1994)</ref> After publication, Felix wrote to her \"[I] send you my professional blessing on becoming a member of the craft [...] may you have much happiness in giving pleasure to others; may you taste only the sweets and none of the bitterness of authorship; may the public pelt you with roses, and never with sand.\" (12 August 1846). On 14 August Fanny wrote in her journal \"Felix has written, and given me his professional blessing in the kindest manner. I know that he is not quite satisfied in his heart of hearts, but I am glad he has said a kind word to me about it.\" <ref>Hensel (1874), v. 2, pp. 325\u2013326</ref> She also wrote about the publication to her friend Angelica von Woringen: \"I can truthfully say that I let it happen more than made it happen, and it is this in particular which cheers me [...] If [the publishers] want more from me, it should act as a stimulus to achieve. If the matter comes to an end then, I also won't grieve, for I'm not ambitious.\"<ref name=\"Kimber2004p51\" />\n\n===Death===\nThroughout March 1847 Fanny had many visits from [[Clara Schumann]]. At this time Fanny was working on her Piano Trio Op. 11 and Clara had recently completed her own Piano Trio (Op. 17), which she may have intended to dedicate to Fanny.<ref name=Grove /> \n\nOn 14 May 1847 Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel died in Berlin of complications from a stroke suffered while rehearsing one of her brother's [[Cantata|cantatas]], ''[[Die erste Walpurgisnacht|The First Walpurgis Night]]''.<ref>Todd (2002), p. 557</ref> Felix himself died less than six months later from the same cause (which was also responsible for the deaths of both of their parents and their grandfather Moses),<ref>Sterndale Bennett (1955) 376</ref> but not before completing his [[String Quartet No. 6 (Mendelssohn)|String Quartet No. 6 in F minor]], written in memory of his sister.<ref>Todd (2010), pp. 348\u2013349</ref>\n\n== Compositions ==\n{{see also|List of compositions by Fanny Mendelssohn}}\n[[File:April (Fanny Hensel, Das Jahr).jpg|thumb|left|''April'' from the manuscript of Fanny Hensel's ''Das Jahr'' (illustration by Wilhelm Hensel)]] \nFanny Mendelssohn composed over 460 pieces of music.<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> Her compositions include a [[piano trio]], a [[piano quartet]], an orchestral overture, four cantatas, over 125 pieces for the piano, and an excess of 250 Lieder (German art songs).<ref>Forney (2014), p. 278</ref>A number of her songs were originally published under Felix's name in his [[opus number|Opus]] 8 and 9 collections.<ref>Song (2016), pp. 2\u20133</ref> Her piano works are often in the manner of songs, and many carry the name ''Lied f\u00fcr Klavier (Song for Piano)'', analagous to Felix's ''Lieder ohne Worte ([[Songs Without Words]])''. This style of piano music was most successfully developed by Felix, whose first set (Op. 19b) appeared in 1829\u201330, with a second set (Op.30) appearing in 1833\u201334. Fanny's sets of ''Lieder f\u00fcr Klavier'' were written in the period 1836\u20131837, at about the same time as Felix's set Op. 38.<ref name=Mace118>Mace (2013) p. 118</ref><ref>Song (2016), pp. 5\u20137</ref>\n\n[[File:IMSLP99178-PMLP194743-Hensel Fanny Sechs Lieder fuer eine Stimme mit Begleitung des Pianoforte Op 1 Bote 1046 1846 p 1pdf.png|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Title page of first edition of Fanny Hensel's Op. 1, 1846]]The majority of Fanny Mendelssohn's compositions are limited to lieder and piano pieces as she felt her abilities did not extend to larger, more intricate compositions. She was also undoubtedly hampered by the fact that, unlike her brother, she had never studied or played any string instruments, experience which would have assisted her in writing chamber or orchestral works.<ref>Reich (1991), pp. 93\u20134</ref> After completing her string quartet, she wrote to Felix in 1835, \"I lack the ability to sustain ideas properly and give them the needed consistency. Therefore lieder suit me best, in which, if need be, merely a pretty idea without much potential for development can suffice.\"<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987), p. 174.</ref> She was an early example of women composers of a string quartet; she had also earlier written, with the assistance of Zelter, a [[piano quartet]] in 1822 (her first large-scale work), and, despite her reservations in her letter to Felix, she wrote in her last year a [[piano trio]] (Op. 11).<ref name=Grove /><ref>Todd (2003), pp. 104, 542\u2013544</ref> Amongst her works is the ''[[Easter Sonata]]'' written in 1828, which was unpublished in her lifetime, then discovered and attributed to her brother in 1970, before examination of the manuscript and a mention of the work in her diary finally established in 2010 that the work was hers.<ref>Hawkins (2017)</ref> It was premiered in her name on 8 March 2017, [[International Women's Day]].<ref>Hayman (2017)</ref>\n\nShe also composed in 1841 a cycle of pieces depicting the months of the year, ''Das Jahr'' (The Year).<ref>Mace Christian (2018)</ref> The music was written on tinted sheets of paper and illustrated by her husband Wilhelm, with each piece accompanied by a short poem.{{refn|See {{IMSLP|work=Das Jahr, H.385 (Hensel, Fanny)|cname=''Das Jahr''}}|group=n}} The writer Kristine Forney has suggested that the poems, artwork and coloured paper may represent the different stages of life, with some suggesting they represent Mendelssohn's life.<ref>Forney (2014), p. 177</ref> In a letter from Rome, Fanny described the process behind composing ''Das Jahr'':<blockquote>I have been composing a good deal lately, and have called my piano pieces after the names of my favourite haunts, partly because they really came into my mind at these spots, partly because our pleasant excursions were in my mind while I was writing them. They will form a delightful souvenir, a kind of second diary. But do not imagine that I give these names when playing them in society, they are for home use entirely.<ref>Mendelssohn (Hensel) (1987) {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Style and form ===\n[[File:Julius Eduard Wilhelm Helfft - The Music Room of Fanny Hensel (nee Mendelssohn) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Fanny Hensel's music room in the Hensel house, Leipziger Str. 3, Berlin]] Angela Mace, the musicologist who proved Fanny Hensel's authorship of the ''Easter Sonata'', considers that Fanny was much more experimental with her lieder than Felix, noting that her works have a \"harmonic density\" that serves to express emotion.<ref>Mace (2013) p. 10</ref> \n\nR. Larry Todd has pointed out that, although there has been much comment about the influence of Felix's music on Fanny (and some comment on that of Fanny on Felix), both were strongly influenced by the later music of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] in terms of [[ musical form|form]], [[tonality]] and [[fugue|fugal]] [[counterpoint]].<ref>Todd (2010), p. 182</ref>. This is reflected for example in Fanny's string quartet.<ref>Song (2016), p. 1</ref>\n\nMusicologist Stephen Rodgers has claimed that the relative lack of analysis of Fanny Mendelssohn's music has left the presence of triple [[hypermeter]] in her songs mostly overlooked. He points to this type of meter being used by Mendelssohn to alter the speed of vocals in the song and to reflect emotions through distortion of duple norms.<ref>Rogers (2011b), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> He also points to a lack of [[tonic (music)|tonic]] harmony as a recurring characteristic of her lieder, identifying it in the lied ''Verlust'' as a deliberate means to reflect the song's themes of abandonment and failing to find love. Mendelssohn's use of [[word painting]] is also acknowledged as a common element of her style, a method of stressing emotion in the song text.<ref>Rogers (2011a), {{page needed|date=April 2020}}</ref> She commonly used [[strophic form]] for her songs, and her piano accompaniments frequently doubled the voice-line, characteristics also of the music of her teachers Zelter and Berger.<ref>Draper (2012), p. 87</ref> Though the foundation created by her teachers would remain, Rodgers suggests that she increasingly turned to [[through-composed]] forms as her style developed, as a way to respond to elements of poetic text.<ref>Rogers (2011b) p. 201</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n===Museum===\nThe Fanny & Felix Mendelssohn Museum, which is dedicated to the lives and work of Fanny Mendelssohn and her brother Felix, opened on 29 May 2018 in Hamburg, Germany.<ref>KomponistenQuartier (n.d.)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nIn the six months before his death, Felix attempted to ensure that his sister received the recognition that had been withheld throughout most of her life by collecting many of her works with the intent of releasing them to the public through his publisher, [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]].

By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.\n\n== Background ==\nThe county of Staffordshire, several days travel from the main seat of power in London, had a long-standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King.  [[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>Tringham, General History.</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>\n\n== Early-war Burton ==\nBurton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>Tringham, Established Church.</ref>\n\n[[File:John Gell.jpg|thumb|left|Sir John Gell]]\nEast Staffordshire's strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>\n\nParliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Shortly thereafter, Gell whose forces amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>\n\nDuring this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref name=\"county\"/><ref name=\"Lewisp19\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=19}}.</ref>\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Tyldesley.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Tyldesley]]\nGell's garrison at Burton was commanded by Captain Thomas Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p20\"/>\n\nIn July 1643 the Queen's convoy and its guard advanced from Newark to [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] and then to Burton.<ref name=\"p20\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=20}}.</ref>  Gell summoned the Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/> The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though damage was caused to the town's St Modwen's church, the battle seems to have been decided by the action at the bridge.<ref name=\"p20l\"/><ref name=lanc>Remember Sir Thomas.</ref>  The forces of parliament were decisively beaten and, according to Gell, the town was \"most miserably plundered and destroyed\".<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Henrietta Maria herself recorded that so much loot was taken that her men \"could not well march with their bundles\".<ref name=county/>\n\nThe Royalists claimed that they had twice requested the surrender of the town before they attacked and that the Queen forbade any violence against the townsfolk.<ref name=\"p20l\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=20}}.</ref>  Conversely the parliamentarians claimed that 30 of their men were forced into the church and offered to surrender but were refused and were killed by cavaliers in the night.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists were also alleged to have looted the town and raped women before drowning at least 20 civilians in the river.<ref name=\"p20l\"/>  The Royalists took most of the Roundhead officers prisoner including Captain Sanders and Colonel Houghton (and his wife).<ref name=\"p20\"/><ref name=\"p20l\"/>  Sanders was later exchanged and was promoted to Major by the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] and commissioned by Gell to act as Colonel and to raise a regiment of horse.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  Tyldesley was knighted and promoted to brigadier-general for bravery shown in the action.<ref name=\"ODNB\">Blackwood.</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:HenriettaMariaofFrance02.jpg|thumb|Queen Henrietta Maria]]\nHaving lost Burton, Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>\n\nThe new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>\n\nA Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]].{{efn|The plaque on the modern bridge commemorating the battle reads: \"near this spot on 2nd July 1643, during the English Civil War, Colonel

By the time of the battle the town, which had at various times been held by both sides, was garrisoned by a Parliamentarian unit under the command of Captain Thomas Sanders and the town's military governor, Colonel Richard Houghton.  The key river crossing at Burton was desired by Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who was proceeding southwards from Yorkshire with a convoy of supplies destined for King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] at Oxford.  The Royalists, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], launched a cavalry charge across the bridge which succeeded in defeating the Parliamentarians and capturing most of their officers, including Sanders and Houghton.  The Queen's convoy proceeded on its way south to Oxford with Tyldesley receiving a knighthood and a promotion in recognition of his victory.  Burton changed hands several more times during the course of the war, before finally coming into Parliament's control in 1646.\n\n== Background ==\nThe county of Staffordshire, several days travel from the main seat of power in London, had a long-standing disinclination to paying taxes and levies imposed by the King.  [[James I]]'s [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] was forced to write to the county's [[Justices of the Peace]] for their failure to raise a single penny to support the King's [[Palatinate campaign|campaign to reclaim the Palatinate]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] for his son-in-law [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine|Frederick V]] in the 1620s.<ref name=\"p3\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=3}}.</ref>  The county was also slow to pay [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s [[ship money]] which began to be levied (in defiance of the Parliament) on the inland counties in 1634 and saw much resistance.<ref name=\"p3\"/>  Open dissent against the King's decrees occurred in 1640 in objection to the levying of 300 men from the county for the King's [[Bishops' Wars|campaign against the Scots]].<ref name=\"p5\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=5}}.</ref>  Riots took place in [[Uttoxeter]] with an armed guard having to be formed to prevent the levy from deserting.<ref name=\"p5\"/>\n\nUpon the outbreak of the Civil War in 1642 the town of Burton was largely sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause.<ref name=county>{{cite book|last=Tringham|first=Nigel J.|title=A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 9 - Burton-upon-Trent&nbsp;\u2014 General History|year=2003|publisher=Victoria County History|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=12328}}</ref>   This was probably, in part, due to the large [[Puritan]] following in the town and Staffordshire's general disapproval of the [[High Church]] practices of the then Archbishop of Canterbury [[William Laud]] (who was later executed for his opposition of Puritanism).<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p4\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=4}}.</ref>\n\n== Early-war Burton ==\nBurton's river crossing, a 36-arched medieval structure known as \"Burton Bridge\", was desirable to both sides, being described as \"the only passage over the [[River Trent|Trent]] and [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] to the North\", and was positioned between the Royalist towns of Lichfield, Tutbury, and Ashby-de-la-Zouch and Parliamentarian Stafford and Derby.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p19\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=19}}.</ref>  Despite this strategic location the town was unfortified and possessed few natural defences.<ref name=county/>  Burton would change hands at least a dozen times during the course of the war, first coming to the attention of the Royalists when the [[Philip Stanhope, 1st Earl of Chesterfield|Earl of Chesterfield]] used it as a rendezvous for his forces in late 1642.<ref name=county/>  Chesterfield withdrew his forces to Lichfield for the winter, garrisoning the [[Lichfield Cathedral|cathedral]] which would be the scene of much fighting during the war.<ref name=\"p15\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=15}}.</ref>  There were rumours prior to the war that the town held secret supplies of gunpowder for a catholic rebellion, these were investigated by [[William Paget, 5th Baron Paget|Lord Paget]] (who began the war as a parliamentarian, switched allegiance to the King in 1642 before returning to the side of Parliament in 1644) and found to be false, though the explosion of a store of gunpowder did occur in 1643 causing the roof of [[St Modwen's, Burton upon Trent|St Modwen's Church]] to be destroyed.<ref name=county/><ref>{{cite book|last=Tringham|first=Nigel J.|title=A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 9 - Burton-upon-Trent&nbsp;\u2014 Established

strategic importance was heightened by its position at the boundary of Royalist and Parliamentarian garrisons in the region.<ref name=\"p16\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=16}}.</ref>  Burton had come to [[roundhead]] attention in early 1643 after the establishment of a garrison at nearby Derby by the county committee leader, [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]].<ref name=county/>  In February Gell placed a garrison across the county border at Burton, consisting of an infantry company under Dutch Major Johannes Molanus, but withdrew it less than a month later to assist in an [[Newark-on-Trent#The Civil War|attack on Newark]].<ref name=county/>\n\nParliament's forces in Staffordshire and Warwickshire were initially under the command of [[Robert Greville, 2nd Baron Brooke|Lord Brooke]] but after his death during the successful siege of Lichfield Cathedral in March 1643 Gell was appointed as his replacement.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  Gell's forces now amounted to around 1,000 infantry, a few horse and 300 partially armed [[Staffordshire Moorlands|Staffordshire moorlanders]] and he met with [[Sir William Brereton, 1st Baronet|Sir William Brereton]], Commander-in-Chief of Cheshire, to organise an attack upon Stafford.<ref name=\"p16\"/>  This became known to the Royalists and the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]] was sent with two fast-moving cavalry regiments to thwart Gell and Brereton's plan.<ref name=\"p17\">{{Harvnb|Lewis|1983|p=17}}.</ref>  Northampton met with troops led by [[Henry Hastings, 1st Baron Loughborough|Henry Hastings]] (later Lord Loughborough) and garrisoned Tamworth before engaging Gell at the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]], during which Northampton was killed.<ref name=\"p17\"/>\n\nDuring this time [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]] landed at [[Bridlington]], Yorkshire with a supply of weapons purchased abroad that she intended to bring to the King, who was then in [[Oxford]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  In advance of this the King sent his nephew, [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], from Oxford with 1,200 horse, 700 foot and 6 cannon to clear South Staffordshire.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Prince Rupert's troops evicted garrisons from [[Rushall, West Midlands|Rushall]] and [[Birmingham]] and successfully [[Lichfield Cathedral#Devastation of the English Civil War|recaptured Lichfield]].<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Rupert placed Royalist garrison in key towns including Burton to secure the route of Henrietta's convoy.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  The garrison at Burton was soon driven out once more by Gell, acting in co-operation with [[Thomas Grey, Lord Grey of Groby|Lord Grey]], commander-in-chief of the East Midlands Association.<ref name=county/>  He placed his own garrison there of 200 infantry, 60 dragoons and a cannon from Derbyshire before proceeding with the remainder of his force to [[Tutbury Castle]] which he unsuccessfully attacked.<ref

Sanders, who had previously commanded one of the largest companies in Gell's force.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders held more radical political views than Gell and was seen as a potential rival.<ref name=\"p19\"/>  Sanders may have been concerned that his deployment to such a precarious position was a plot by Gell to be rid of him.<ref name=county/>  Whatever the case Sanders decided to remove himself from Gell's command and place him and his men under the direction of Colonel Richard Houghton, of the Staffordshire county committee and military governor of Burton.<ref name=county/><ref

Staffordshire and Nottinghamshire associations forces to defend the town but they refused to [[Muster (military)|muster]] for him.<ref name=\"p20\"/>  On 4 July 1643 the Roaylist cavalry, led by Colonel [[Thomas Tyldesley]], charged across Burton Bridge and engaged Sanders' men.<ref name=county/><ref name=plaque/>  The engagement was described as \"bloody\" and \"desperate\" and, though

Gell feared an attack upon Derby and withdrew troops from [[Nottingham]] and [[Leicester]] to defend it.<ref name=\"p21\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=21}}.</ref> He was also able to secure supplies of 20 barrels of powder, 300 muskets, 60 carbines and 60 cases of pistols and an additional troop of horses, allowing him to arm his regiment fully for the first time.<ref name=\"p21\"/>  However Derby was not attacked by the Queen's forces who bypassed it and moved through Walsall, proceeding according to the King's instructions to avoid delays.<ref name=\"p21\"/>\n\nThe new Royalist garrison in Burton fortified the bridge and maintained control of the town until driven out by Gell in January 1644.<ref name=county/>  During this attack Gell took the commanding officer (a Major), six captains, eight other officers and 500 men prisoner.<ref name=\"p31\">{{Harvnb|Polkey|1992|p=31}}.</ref>  Burton Bridge was again a focal point of the assault with five Royalists losing their lives there, with Gell claiming that he lost no men in the attack.<ref name=\"p31\"/>  Gell withdrew with his prisoners to Derby, allowing Lord Loughborough to retake the town and bridge which he intended to hold as a means of communication between his \"flying army\" at Ashby and the Royalist garrisons in Tutbury and Derbyshire.<ref name=\"p31\"/>\n\nA Parliamentarian raid again attacked and plundered the town in April 1644, afterwards ceding control to the Royalists once more, before Sanders' newly raised regiment of 400 horse retook it  narrowly failing to capture Loughborough himself.<ref name=county/><ref name=\"p31\"/>  Parliament troops from Derbyshire and Staffordshire were established as a garrison in November 1644 but were driven out by Royalists by February 1645.<ref name=county/>  King Charles I briefly made Burton his headquarters in May of that year before the town was retaken for the final time by Parliament in early 1646, becoming a centre of supply of coin and beer to the forces besieging Tutbury and Lichfield.<ref name=county/>  After the war and the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration of Charles II]] in 1660 Burton remained a place of [[English Dissenters|dissent]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]] with large [[Presbyterian]] and [[Baptist]] congregations, raising doubts within the [[Church of England]] over the town's loyalty.<ref name=county/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe medieval bridge over which the battle was fought was replaced in the Victorian era.<ref name=county/>  A plaque commemorating the battle was erected on the bridge on 2 July 1993 by Sir Thomas Tyldesley's Regiment of the [[English Civil War Society]] (the umbrella group for English Civil War re-enactors).<ref name=plaque/> Another monument erected at the site of Tyldesley's death at the [[Battle of Wigan Lane]] by one of his [[Cornet (military rank)|cornets]], Alexander Rigby, in 1679 notes his \"desperate storming of Burton-Upon-Trent over a bridge of 36

She is most notable for her [[glamour photography|glamour]] and [[cosplay]] [[Instagram model|modeling]] on [[Instagram]]. Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends.

Her posts on the platform featured a risqu\u00e9 and self-proclaimed \"weird\" aesthetic, and were often influenced by popular [[Internet memes]] and trends.

It broadcasts music from the 1980s through today as \"Majic 95.9\" and is part of the [[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]'s Marion cluster which includes [[WMRN (AM)|WMRN]] and [[WMRN-FM]]. Its Cleveland FM sister [[WMJI]] also uses the \"Majic\" branding for its 1960s/70s oldies station.  WYNT was also formerly an oldies station under the same branding.\n\nThe station had for years, served as a full-service adult contemporary/country music station serving Upper Sandusky, the seat of Wyandot County, as well as the communities surrounding Upper Sandusky, which is not to be confused with the town of Sandusky, Ohio...about 50 miles due north in Erie County, best known as the home of [[Cedar Point]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to the 1981 Broadcasting and Cable Yearbook, WYNT first went on the air on December 11, 1973 with the original call letters WYAN, licensed to Upper Sandusky.\n\nThe station was founded by Wendell A. Triplett, president of Triplett Broadcasting of [[Bellefontaine, Ohio]]; which also owned the former WTOO (now [[WBLL]]) in Bellefontaine, founded the former WPNM (currently [[WBUK]]) in Ottawa and the former WAXT (later WHTI, now [[WBKQ]]) in Alexandria, Indiana.  Triplett's brother and company vice president Robert S. Triplett served as the station's first general manager, and also served as the station's chief engineer.  T.P.

Its Cleveland FM sister [[WMJI]] also uses the \"Majic\" branding for its 1960s/70s oldies station.

Triplett, president of Triplett Broadcasting of [[Bellefontaine, Ohio]]; which also owned the former WTOO (now [[WBLL]]) in Bellefontaine, founded the former WPNM (currently [[WBUK]]) in Ottawa and the former WAXT (later WHTI, now [[WBKQ]]) in Alexandria, Indiana.
