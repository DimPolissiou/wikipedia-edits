In partnership with [[Louis Daguerre]], he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.\n\nNi\u00e9pce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light-sensitive [[silver halide]]s, which Ni\u00e9pce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast and permanent. Daguerre's efforts culminated in what would later be named the [[daguerreotype]] process. The essential elements\u2014a silver-plated surface sensitized by [[iodine]] vapor, developed by [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, and \"fixed\" with hot saturated [[sodium chloride|salt]] water\u2014were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in 1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre's process was publicly announced, without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation. France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer [[Robert Cornelius]] is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait.\n\n[[File:Latticed window at lacock abbey 1835.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A latticed window in [[Lacock Abbey]], England, photographed by [[William Fox Talbot]] in 1835.

After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the [[calotype]] process, which used the [[photographic processing|chemical development]] of a [[latent image]] to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent [[negative (photography)|negative]] which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml William Henry Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003154557/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml |date=3 October 2010}}.

He invented the [[cyanotype]] process, later familiar as the \"blueprint\". He was the first to use the terms \"photography\", \"negative\" and \"positive\". He had discovered in 1819 that [[sodium thiosulphate]] was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to \"fix\" silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first [[glass negative]] in late 1839.\n\n<!--[[File:Daguerreotype tintype photographer model studio table brady stand cast iron portrait photos.jpg|right|thumb|Mid-19th-century \"Brady stand\" photo model's armrest table, meant to keep portrait models still during long exposure times (studio equipment nicknamed after the famed US photographer, [[Mathew Brady]]).]] \u2013 remove, not mentioned in body-->\nIn the March 1851 issue of ''The Chemist'', [[Frederick Scott Archer]] published his wet plate [[collodion process]]. It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the [[Ambrotype]] (a positive image on glass), the [[Ferrotype]] or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on [[albumen]] or salted paper.\n\nMany advances in [[Photographic plate|photographic glass plates]] and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, [[Gabriel Lippmann]] introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.\n\nGlass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as [[astrophotography]], continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser [[holography]], it has persisted into the 2010s.\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Photographic film}}\n[[File:undeveloped film.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Undeveloped Arista black-and-white film, [[Film speed|ISO]] 125/22\u00b0]]\n\n[[Hurter and Driffield]] began pioneering work on the [[sensitometry|light sensitivity]] of photographic emulsions in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.\n\nThe first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by [[Eastman Kodak|George Eastman]], founder of [[Kodak]] in 1885, but this original \"film\" was actually a coating on a paper base. As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic roll film followed in 1889.<!--am leaving this date untouched, but it is a matter of some controversy--> It was made from highly flammable [[nitrocellulose]] (\"[[celluloid]]\"), now usually called \"[[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]\".\n\nAlthough [[cellulose acetate]] or \"[[safety film]]\" had been introduced by Kodak in 1908,<ref>[http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml History of Kodak, Milestones-chronology: 1878\u20131929] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210123011/http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml |date=10 February 2012}}. kodak.com</ref> at first it found only a few special applications as an alternative to the hazardous nitrate film, which had the advantages of being considerably tougher, slightly more transparent, and cheaper.

The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title   = Black & White Photography\n| journal = PSA Journal\n| volume  = 77\n| issue   = 12\n| year    = 2011\n| pages   = 38\u201340\n}}</ref> It is important to note that monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular [[hue]] depending on the process. The [[cyanotype]] process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The [[albumen print]] process first used more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1847|1|1}}|-1}} years ago, produces brownish tones.\n\nMany photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard [[RGB color model|RGB]] color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.\n\n=== Color ===\n{{Main|Color photography}}\n[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|The first [[color photograph]] made by the three-color method suggested by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855, taken in 1861 by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]].

Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an [[additive color|additive method]] of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing [[carbon print]]s of the three images made in their [[complementary color]]s, a [[subtractive color|subtractive method]] of color reproduction pioneered by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] in the late 1860s.\n[[File:Colonel William Willoughby Verner, Sanger Shepherd process, by Sarah Acland 1903.png|thumb|left|Color photography was possible long before [[Kodachrome]], as this 1903 portrait by [[Sarah Angelina Acland]] demonstrates, but in its earliest years, the need for special equipment, long exposures, and complicated printing processes made it extremely rare.]]\nRussian photographer [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]] made extensive use of this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong [[photographic plate|plate]]. Because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color \"fringes\" or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.\n\nImplementation of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist [[Hermann W. Vogel|Hermann Vogel]] in 1873 suddenly made it possible to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of [[Photographic emulsion|emulsions]] steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color, bringing it ever closer to commercial viability.\n\n[[Autochrome]], the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] in 1907. Autochrome [[photographic plate|plates]] incorporated a [[mosaic]] color filter layer made of dyed grains of [[potato starch]], which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was [[reversal film|reversal processed]] to produce a positive [[reversal film|transparency]], the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing the color of the subject by the [[additive color|additive method]]. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.\n\n[[Kodachrome]], the first modern \"integral tripack\" (or \"monopack\") color film, was introduced by [[Kodak]] in 1935. It captured the three color components in a multi-layer [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]]. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. Without special [[film processing]], the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but [[complementary color|complementary]] cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding [[color coupler]]s during a complex processing procedure.\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa's]] similarly structured [[Agfacolor]] Neu was introduced in 1936. Unlike Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing. Currently, available color films still employ a multi-layer emulsion and the same principles, most closely resembling Agfa's product.\n\n[[Instant film|Instant color film]], used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished color print only a minute or two after the exposure, was introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1963.\n\nColor photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used in a [[slide projector]], or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995\u20132005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive \"look\".\n\n=== Digital ===\n{{Main|Digital photography}}\n{{See also|Digital camera}}\n[[File:Early digital!.jpg|thumb|201x201px|Kodak DCS 100, based on a [[Nikon F3]] body with Digital Storage Unit]]\nIn 1981, [[Sony]] unveiled the first consumer camera to use a [[charge-coupled device]] for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the [[Sony Mavica]]. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital.\n\nThe first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS-1P created by Fujfilm in 1988.<ref>https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/</ref> https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/\n\nIn 1991, Kodak unveiled the [[DCS 100]], the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than [[photojournalism]] and professional photography, commercial [[digital photography]] was born.\n\nDigital imaging uses an electronic [[image sensor]] to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film.<ref>Schewe, Jeff (2012). The Digital Negative: Raw Image Processing In Lightroom, Camera Raw, and Photoshop. Berkeley, CA: Peachpit Press, {{ISBN|0-321-83957-9}}, p. 72</ref> An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists [[photo manipulation]] because it involves [[photographic film|film]] and [[photographic paper]], while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.\n\nDigital photography dominates the 21st century. More than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.\n\n=== Synthesis ===\nSynthesis photography is part of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) where the shooting process is modeled on real photography. The CGI, creating digital copies of real universe, requires a visual representation process of these universes. Synthesis photography is the application of [[Analog photography|analog]] and [[digital photography]] in digital space. With the characteristics of the real photography but not being constrained by the physical limits of real world, synthesis photography allows artists to move into areas beyond the grasp of real photography.<ref>{{cite conference\n| url         = http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| title       = Synthesis photography and architecture\n| last1       = Paux\n| first1      = Marc-Olivier\n| date        = 1 February 2011\n| conference  = [[Imagina]]\n| location    = Monaco\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092825/http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| archivedate = 2 April 2015\n| df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Techniques ==\n[[File:San Francisco brutalism.jpg|thumb|Angles such as vertical, horizontal, or as pictured here diagonal are considered important photographic techniques]]\nA large variety of photographic techniques and media are used in the process of capturing images for photography. These include the camera; stereoscopy; dualphotography; full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared media; light field photography; and other imaging techniques.\n\n=== Cameras ===\n{{Main|Camera}}\nThe camera is the image-forming device, and a [[photographic plate]], [[photographic film]] or a [[silicon]] electronic [[image sensor]] is the capture medium. The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.<ref>{{cite web\n| url          = http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/glossary/\n| title        = Glossary: Digital Photography Review\n| publisher    = Dpreview.com\n| accessdate   = 24 June 2013\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130118033153/http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?%2Fglossary%2F\n| archive-date = 18 January 2013\n| url-status   = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nPhotographers control the camera and lens to \"expose\" the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a \"[[latent image]]\" (on plate or film) or [[RAW file]] (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image. [[Digital photography|Digital cameras]] use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or [[complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.\n\nThe camera (or '[[camera obscura]]') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see [[Process camera]]).\n\nAs soon as photographic materials became \"fast\" (sensitive) enough for taking [[Candid photography|candid]] or surreptitious pictures, small \"detective\" cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the ''Ticka'' camera) or even worn hidden behind an [[Ascot tie|Ascot]] necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.\n\nThe [[movie camera]] is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each called a \"frame\". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n| url         = http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| author1     = Anderson, Joseph\n| author2     = Anderson, Barbara\n| title       = The Myth of Persistence of Vision Revisited\n| journal     = Journal of Film and Video\n| volume      = 45\n| issue       = 1\n| date        = Spring 1993\n| pages       = 3\u201312\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091124182503/http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| archivedate = 24 November 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereoscopic ===\n{{Main|Stereoscopy}}\nPhotographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision. Stereoscopic photography was the first that captured figures in motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n| author  = Belisle, Brooke\n| url     = https://www.academia.edu/4450652\n| title   = The Dimensional Image: Overlaps In Stereoscopic, Cinematic, And Digital Depth\n| journal = Film Criticism\n| volume  = 37/38\n| issue   = 3/1\n| pages   = 117\u201337\n| year    = 2013\n}}</ref> While known colloquially as \"3-D\" photography, the more accurate term is stereoscopy. Such cameras have long been realized by using film and more recently in digital electronic methods (including cell phone cameras).\n\n=== Dualphotography ===\n{{Main|Dualphotography}}\n[[File:1485016840 IMG 7518.JPG larger.jpg|thumb|An example of a dualphoto using a smartphone based app]]\nDualphotography consists of photographing a scene from both sides of a photographic device at once (e.g. camera for back-to-back dualphotography, or two networked cameras for portal-plane dualphotography). The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer, or both sides of a geographical place at once, thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to that of a single image.<ref>{{cite news\n| title        = An introduction to Dualphotography\n| first        = Tristan\n| last         = Zand\n| url          = https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| publisher    = Medium.com\n| work         = Dual.Photo\n| date         = 8 April 2017\n| access-date  = 15 April 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170416044530/https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| archive-date = 16 April 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared ===\n{{Main|Full spectrum photography}}\n[[File:Saturn's Rings in Ultraviolet Light.png|thumb|This image of the [[rings of Saturn]] is an example of the application of [[ultraviolet photography]] in [[ultraviolet astronomy|astronomy]]]]\n\n[[Ultraviolet photography|Ultraviolet]] and [[infrared photography|infrared]] films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\n\nModified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350&nbsp;nm to 1000&nbsp;nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared [[hot mirror]] filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm.<ref>Twede, David. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120215235949/http://surrealcolor.110mb.com/IR_explained_web/IR_explained.htm#CamColor Introduction to Full-Spectrum and Infrared photography]. surrealcolor.110mb.com</ref>\n\nReplacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) colored micro-filters placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet (blue window) and infrared (primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro-filters).\n\nUses of full spectrum photography are for [[fine art photography]], [[Remote sensing#Geodetic|geology]], [[History of forensic photography|forensics]] and law enforcement.\n\n=== Light field ===\n{{See also|Light-field camera}}\nDigital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of \"light field photography\" (also known as synthetic aperture photography). This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected ''after'' the photograph has been captured.<ref>[[Ren Ng|Ng, Ren]] (July 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120916121457/http://www.lytro.com/renng-thesis.pdf Digital Light Field Photography]. PhD Thesis, Stanford University</ref> As explained by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1846, the \"[[light field]]\" is understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point.\n\nThese additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm.\n\n[[File:M\u00fc\u00fcrlooga (Arabidopsis thaliana) lehekarv (trihhoom) 311 0804.JPG|thumb|Devices other than cameras can be used to record images.

Note that image has been [[Image editing|edited]] by adding colors to clarify structure or to add an aesthetic effect. Heiti Paves from [[Tallinn University of Technology]].]]\n\n=== Other ===\nBesides the camera, other methods of forming images with light are available. For instance, a [[photocopy]] or [[xerography]] machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static [[Electric charge|electrical charges]] rather than photographic medium, hence the term [[electrophotography]]. [[Photogram]]s are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an [[image scanner]] to produce digital pictures.\n\n== Types of photography ==\n===Amateur=== <!-- \"Amateur photography\" redirects here. -->\nAn amateur photographer is one who practices photography as a [[hobby]]/[[Passion (emotion)|passion]] and not necessarily for profit. The quality of some amateur work is comparable to that of many professionals and may be highly specialized or [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi     = 10.1080/03087298.2011.606727\n| title   = Home Portraiture\n| journal = History of Photography\n| volume  = 35\n| issue   = 4\n| pages   = 374\u201387\n| year    = 2011\n| last1   = Peterson\n| first1  = C.A.\n}}</ref> Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone.

In this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. The commercial photographic world could include:\n* Advertising photography: photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as [[packshot]]s, are generally done with an [[advertising agency]], [[design firm]] or with an in-house corporate design team.\n* Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates [[photographic model|models]] and is a form of advertising photography. [[Fashion photography]], like the work featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', emphasizes clothes and other products; glamour emphasizes the model and body form. Glamour photography is popular in advertising and [[men's magazine]]s. Models in [[glamour photography]] sometimes work [[Nude photography|nude]].\n* [[360 product photography]] displays a series of photos to give the impression of a rotating object. This technique is commonly used by ecommerce websites to help shoppers visualise products.\n* [[Concert photography]] focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere (including the crowd). Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show. Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue.\n* [[Crime scene photography]] consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders. A black and white camera or an [[infrared camera]] may be used to capture specific details.\n* [[Still life photography]] usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.\n* Real Estate photography focuses on the production of photographs showcasing a property that is for sale, such photographs requires the use of wide-lens and extensive knowledge in [[High-dynamic-range imaging]] photography.\n[[File:Cheese and Tomatoes.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a studio-made food photograph.]]\n* [[Food photography]] can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills.\n* [[Photojournalism]] can be considered a subset of editorial photography. Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story.\n* [[Paparazzi]] is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other prominent people.\n* [[Portrait photography|Portrait]] and [[wedding photography]]: photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images.\n* [[Landscape photography]] depicts locations.\n* [[Wildlife photography]] demonstrates the life of animals.\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:Alfred Stieglitz - The Steerage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Classic [[Alfred Stieglitz]] photograph, ''[[The Steerage]]'' shows unique aesthetic of black-and-white photos.]]\n\nDuring the 20th century, both [[fine art photography]] and [[documentary photography]] became accepted by the [[English language|English-speaking]] art world and the [[art gallery|gallery]] system. In the United States, a handful of photographers, including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[John Szarkowski]], [[F. Holland Day]], and [[Edward Weston]], spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.\nAt first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is called [[Pictorialism]], often using [[soft focus]] for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, [[Ansel Adams]], and others formed the [[Group f/64]] to advocate '[[straight photography]]', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself and not an imitation of something else.\n\nThe [[aesthetics]] of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it [[beauty|beautiful]] to the viewer. The controversy began with the earliest images \"written with light\"; [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]], [[Louis Daguerre]], and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.\n\n[[Clive Bell]] in his classic essay ''Art'' states that only \"significant form\" can distinguish art from what is not art.\n\n{{quote|There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist; possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether worthless. What is this quality? What quality is shared by all objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions? What quality is common to Sta.

Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects, the subject is strictly abstract.\n\n=== Photojournalism ===\n{{Main|Photojournalism}}\nPhotojournalism is a particular form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, [[street photography]] or [[celebrity photography]]) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.\n\n=== Science and forensics ===\n[[File:Wootton bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861]]\n\nThe camera has a long and distinguished history as a means of recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical events ([[Solar eclipse#Photography|eclipses]] for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to the eyepiece of microscopes (in [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]]) and for [[macro photography]] of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording [[crime scene]]s and the scenes of accidents, such as the [[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as [[forensic photography]]. Crime scene photos are taken from three vantage point. The vantage points are overview, mid-range, and close-up.<ref>Rohde, R.R. (2000). Crime Photography. PSA Journal, 66(3), 15.</ref>\n\nIn 1845 [[Francis Ronalds]], the Honorary Director of the [[Kew Observatory]], invented the first successful camera to make continuous recordings of meteorological and geomagnetic parameters.  Different machines produced 12- or 24- hour photographic traces of the minute-by-minute variations of [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric electricity]], and the three components of [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic forces]].

Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation.\n\nModern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society. In [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\n<blockquote>\nThe camera doesn't rape or even possess, though it may presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of metaphor, assassinate \u2013 all activities that, unlike the sexual push and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some detachment.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nDigital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating digital photographs in post-processing. Many photojournalists have declared they will not [[cropping|crop]] their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make \"[[photomontage]]s\", passing them as \"real\" photographs. Today's technology has made [[image editing]] relatively simple for even the novice photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of [[forensic photography]].\n\nPhotography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society.<ref>Levinson, P. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York, pp. 37\u201348, {{ISBN|0-415-15785-4}}.</ref> Further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization. Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised. Particularly, photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. Sontag is concerned that \"to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.\" Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images. Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\nOne of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism.

In partnership with [[Louis Daguerre]], he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. With an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.\n\nNi\u00e9pce died in 1833 and Daguerre then redirected the experiments toward the light-sensitive [[silver halide]]s, which Ni\u00e9pce had abandoned many years earlier because of his inability to make the images he captured with them light-fast and permanent. Daguerre's efforts culminated in what would later be named the [[daguerreotype]] process. The essential elements\u2014a silver-plated surface sensitized by [[iodine]] vapor, developed by [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] vapor, and \"fixed\" with hot saturated [[sodium chloride|salt]] water\u2014were in place in 1837. The required exposure time was measured in minutes instead of hours. Daguerre took the earliest confirmed photograph of a person in 1838 while capturing a view of a Paris street: unlike the other pedestrian and horse-drawn traffic on the busy boulevard, which appears deserted, one man having his boots polished stood sufficiently still throughout the several-minutes-long exposure to be visible. The existence of Daguerre's process was publicly announced, without details, on 7 January 1839. The news created an international sensation. France soon agreed to pay Daguerre a pension in exchange for the right to present his invention to the world as the gift of France, which occurred when complete working instructions were unveiled on 19 August 1839. In that same year, American photographer [[Robert Cornelius]] is credited with taking the earliest surviving photographic self-portrait.\n\n[[File:Latticed window at lacock abbey 1835.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A latticed window in [[Lacock Abbey]], England, photographed by [[William Fox Talbot]] in 1835.

After reading about Daguerre's invention in January 1839, Talbot published his hitherto secret method and set about improving on it. At first, like other pre-daguerreotype processes, Talbot's paper-based photography typically required hours-long exposures in the camera, but in 1840 he created the [[calotype]] process, which used the [[photographic processing|chemical development]] of a [[latent image]] to greatly reduce the exposure needed and compete with the daguerreotype. In both its original and calotype forms, Talbot's process, unlike Daguerre's, created a translucent [[negative (photography)|negative]] which could be used to print multiple positive copies; this is the basis of most modern chemical photography up to the present day, as daguerreotypes could only be replicated by rephotographing them with a camera.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml William Henry Fox Talbot (1800\u20131877)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101003154557/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/fox_talbot_william_henry.shtml |date=3 October 2010}}.

He invented the [[cyanotype]] process, later familiar as the \"blueprint\". He was the first to use the terms \"photography\", \"negative\" and \"positive\". He had discovered in 1819 that [[sodium thiosulphate]] was a solvent of silver halides, and in 1839 he informed Talbot (and, indirectly, Daguerre) that it could be used to \"fix\" silver-halide-based photographs and make them completely light-fast. He made the first [[glass negative]] in late 1839.\n\n<!--[[File:Daguerreotype tintype photographer model studio table brady stand cast iron portrait photos.jpg|right|thumb|Mid-19th-century \"Brady stand\" photo model's armrest table, meant to keep portrait models still during long exposure times (studio equipment nicknamed after the famed US photographer, [[Mathew Brady]]).]] \u2013 remove, not mentioned in body-->\nIn the March 1851 issue of ''The Chemist'', [[Frederick Scott Archer]] published his wet plate [[collodion process]]. It became the most widely used photographic medium until the gelatin dry plate, introduced in the 1870s, eventually replaced it. There are three subsets to the collodion process; the [[Ambrotype]] (a positive image on glass), the [[Ferrotype]] or Tintype (a positive image on metal) and the glass negative, which was used to make positive prints on [[albumen]] or salted paper.\n\nMany advances in [[Photographic plate|photographic glass plates]] and printing were made during the rest of the 19th century. In 1891, [[Gabriel Lippmann]] introduced a process for making natural-color photographs based on the optical phenomenon of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] of light waves. His scientifically elegant and important but ultimately impractical invention earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1908.\n\nGlass plates were the medium for most original camera photography from the late 1850s until the general introduction of flexible plastic films during the 1890s. Although the convenience of the film greatly popularized amateur photography, early films were somewhat more expensive and of markedly lower optical quality than their glass plate equivalents, and until the late 1910s they were not available in the large formats preferred by most professional photographers, so the new medium did not immediately or completely replace the old. Because of the superior dimensional stability of glass, the use of plates for some scientific applications, such as [[astrophotography]], continued into the 1990s, and in the niche field of laser [[holography]], it has persisted into the 2010s.\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Photographic film}}\n[[File:undeveloped film.png|thumb|upright=1.6|right|Undeveloped Arista black-and-white film, [[Film speed|ISO]] 125/22\u00b0]]\n\n[[Hurter and Driffield]] began pioneering work on the [[sensitometry|light sensitivity]] of photographic emulsions in 1876. Their work enabled the first quantitative measure of film speed to be devised.\n\nThe first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by [[Eastman Kodak|George Eastman]], founder of [[Kodak]] in 1885, but this original \"film\" was actually a coating on a paper base. As part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. The first transparent plastic roll film followed in 1889.<!--am leaving this date untouched, but it is a matter of some controversy--> It was made from highly flammable [[nitrocellulose]] (\"[[celluloid]]\"), now usually called \"[[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate film]]\".\n\nAlthough [[cellulose acetate]] or \"[[safety film]]\" had been introduced by Kodak in 1908,<ref>[http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml History of Kodak, Milestones-chronology: 1878\u20131929] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210123011/http://www.kodak.com/global/en/corp/historyOfKodak/1878.jhtml |date=10 February 2012}}. kodak.com</ref> at first it found only a few special applications as an alternative to the hazardous nitrate film, which had the advantages of being considerably tougher, slightly more transparent, and cheaper.

The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title   = Black & White Photography\n| journal = PSA Journal\n| volume  = 77\n| issue   = 12\n| year    = 2011\n| pages   = 38\u201340\n}}</ref> It is important to note that monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular [[hue]] depending on the process. The [[cyanotype]] process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The [[albumen print]] process first used more than {{rounddown|{{age|format=raw|1847|1|1}}|-1}} years ago, produces brownish tones.\n\nMany photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. Some full-color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard [[RGB color model|RGB]] color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.\n\n=== Color ===\n{{Main|Color photography}}\n[[File:Tartan Ribbon.jpg|thumb|The first [[color photograph]] made by the three-color method suggested by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1855, taken in 1861 by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]].

Transparent prints of the images could be projected through similar color filters and superimposed on the projection screen, an [[additive color|additive method]] of color reproduction. A color print on paper could be produced by superimposing [[carbon print]]s of the three images made in their [[complementary color]]s, a [[subtractive color|subtractive method]] of color reproduction pioneered by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]] in the late 1860s.\n[[File:Colonel William Willoughby Verner, Sanger Shepherd process, by Sarah Acland 1903.png|thumb|left|Color photography was possible long before [[Kodachrome]], as this 1903 portrait by [[Sarah Angelina Acland]] demonstrates, but in its earliest years, the need for special equipment, long exposures, and complicated printing processes made it extremely rare.]]\nRussian photographer [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]] made extensive use of this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong [[photographic plate|plate]]. Because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color \"fringes\" or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.\n\nImplementation of color photography was hindered by the limited sensitivity of early photographic materials, which were mostly sensitive to blue, only slightly sensitive to green, and virtually insensitive to red. The discovery of dye sensitization by photochemist [[Hermann W. Vogel|Hermann Vogel]] in 1873 suddenly made it possible to add sensitivity to green, yellow and even red. Improved color sensitizers and ongoing improvements in the overall sensitivity of [[Photographic emulsion|emulsions]] steadily reduced the once-prohibitive long exposure times required for color, bringing it ever closer to commercial viability.\n\n[[Autochrome]], the first commercially successful color process, was introduced by the [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] in 1907. Autochrome [[photographic plate|plates]] incorporated a [[mosaic]] color filter layer made of dyed grains of [[potato starch]], which allowed the three color components to be recorded as adjacent microscopic image fragments. After an Autochrome plate was [[reversal film|reversal processed]] to produce a positive [[reversal film|transparency]], the starch grains served to illuminate each fragment with the correct color and the tiny colored points blended together in the eye, synthesizing the color of the subject by the [[additive color|additive method]]. Autochrome plates were one of several varieties of additive color screen plates and films marketed between the 1890s and the 1950s.\n\n[[Kodachrome]], the first modern \"integral tripack\" (or \"monopack\") color film, was introduced by [[Kodak]] in 1935. It captured the three color components in a multi-layer [[Photographic emulsion|emulsion]]. One layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the [[visible spectrum|spectrum]], another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. Without special [[film processing]], the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but [[complementary color|complementary]] cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding [[color coupler]]s during a complex processing procedure.\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert|Agfa's]] similarly structured [[Agfacolor]] Neu was introduced in 1936. Unlike Kodachrome, the color couplers in Agfacolor Neu were incorporated into the emulsion layers during manufacture, which greatly simplified the processing. Currently, available color films still employ a multi-layer emulsion and the same principles, most closely resembling Agfa's product.\n\n[[Instant film|Instant color film]], used in a special camera which yielded a unique finished color print only a minute or two after the exposure, was introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1963.\n\nColor photography may form images as positive transparencies, which can be used in a [[slide projector]], or as color negatives intended for use in creating positive color enlargements on specially coated paper. The latter is now the most common form of film (non-digital) color photography owing to the introduction of automated photo printing equipment. After a transition period centered around 1995\u20132005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel digital cameras. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive \"look\".\n\n=== Digital ===\n{{Main|Digital photography}}\n{{See also|Digital camera}}\n[[File:Early digital!.jpg|thumb|201x201px|Kodak DCS 100, based on a [[Nikon F3]] body with Digital Storage Unit]]\nIn 1981, [[Sony]] unveiled the first consumer camera to use a [[charge-coupled device]] for imaging, eliminating the need for film: the [[Sony Mavica]]. While the Mavica saved images to disk, the images were displayed on television, and the camera was not fully digital.\n\nThe first digital camera to both record and save images in a digital format was the Fujix DS-1P created by Fujfilm in 1988.<ref>https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/</ref> https://www.fujifilm.com/innovation/achievements/ds-1p/\n\nIn 1991, Kodak unveiled the [[DCS 100]], the first commercially available digital single lens reflex camera. Although its high cost precluded uses other than [[photojournalism]] and professional photography, commercial [[digital photography]] was born.\n\nDigital imaging uses an electronic [[image sensor]] to record the image as a set of electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film.<ref>Schewe, Jeff (2012). The Digital Negative: Raw Image Processing In Lightroom, Camera Raw, and Photoshop. Berkeley, CA: Peachpit Press, {{ISBN|0-321-83957-9}}, p. 72</ref> An important difference between digital and chemical photography is that chemical photography resists [[photo manipulation]] because it involves [[photographic film|film]] and [[photographic paper]], while digital imaging is a highly manipulative medium. This difference allows for a degree of image post-processing that is comparatively difficult in film-based photography and permits different communicative potentials and applications.\n\nDigital photography dominates the 21st century. More than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.\n\n=== Synthesis ===\nSynthesis photography is part of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) where the shooting process is modeled on real photography. The CGI, creating digital copies of real universe, requires a visual representation process of these universes. Synthesis photography is the application of [[Analog photography|analog]] and [[digital photography]] in digital space. With the characteristics of the real photography but not being constrained by the physical limits of real world, synthesis photography allows artists to move into areas beyond the grasp of real photography.<ref>{{cite conference\n| url         = http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| title       = Synthesis photography and architecture\n| last1       = Paux\n| first1      = Marc-Olivier\n| date        = 1 February 2011\n| conference  = [[Imagina]]\n| location    = Monaco\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402092825/http://www.zhongart.com/marcol/premier/photoA_files/synthesis%20photography%20and%20architecture.html\n| archivedate = 2 April 2015\n| df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n== Techniques ==\n[[File:San Francisco brutalism.jpg|thumb|Angles such as vertical, horizontal, or as pictured here diagonal are considered important photographic techniques]]\nA large variety of photographic techniques and media are used in the process of capturing images for photography. These include the camera; stereoscopy; dualphotography; full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared media; light field photography; and other imaging techniques.\n\n=== Cameras ===\n{{Main|Camera}}\nThe camera is the image-forming device, and a [[photographic plate]], [[photographic film]] or a [[silicon]] electronic [[image sensor]] is the capture medium. The respective recording medium can be the plate or film itself, or a digital magnetic or electronic memory.<ref>{{cite web\n| url          = http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/glossary/\n| title        = Glossary: Digital Photography Review\n| publisher    = Dpreview.com\n| accessdate   = 24 June 2013\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20130118033153/http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?%2Fglossary%2F\n| archive-date = 18 January 2013\n| url-status   = dead\n}}</ref>\n\nPhotographers control the camera and lens to \"expose\" the light recording material to the required amount of light to form a \"[[latent image]]\" (on plate or film) or [[RAW file]] (in digital cameras) which, after appropriate processing, is converted to a usable image. [[Digital photography|Digital cameras]] use an electronic image sensor based on light-sensitive electronics such as [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) or [[complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor]] (CMOS) technology. The resulting digital image is stored electronically, but can be reproduced on a paper.\n\nThe camera (or '[[camera obscura]]') is a dark room or chamber from which, as far as possible, all light is excluded except the light that forms the image. It was discovered and used in the 16th century by painters. The subject being photographed, however, must be illuminated. Cameras can range from small to very large, a whole room that is kept dark while the object to be photographed is in another room where it is properly illuminated. This was common for reproduction photography of flat copy when large film negatives were used (see [[Process camera]]).\n\nAs soon as photographic materials became \"fast\" (sensitive) enough for taking [[Candid photography|candid]] or surreptitious pictures, small \"detective\" cameras were made, some actually disguised as a book or handbag or pocket watch (the ''Ticka'' camera) or even worn hidden behind an [[Ascot tie|Ascot]] necktie with a tie pin that was really the lens.\n\nThe [[movie camera]] is a type of photographic camera which takes a rapid sequence of photographs on recording medium. In contrast to a still camera, which captures a single snapshot at a time, the movie camera takes a series of images, each called a \"frame\". This is accomplished through an intermittent mechanism. The frames are later played back in a movie projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, a person's eyes and brain merge the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n| url         = http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| author1     = Anderson, Joseph\n| author2     = Anderson, Barbara\n| title       = The Myth of Persistence of Vision Revisited\n| journal     = Journal of Film and Video\n| volume      = 45\n| issue       = 1\n| date        = Spring 1993\n| pages       = 3\u201312\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091124182503/http://www.uca.edu/org/ccsmi/ccsmi/classicwork/Myth%20Revisited.htm\n| archivedate = 24 November 2009\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Stereoscopic ===\n{{Main|Stereoscopy}}\nPhotographs, both monochrome and color, can be captured and displayed through two side-by-side images that emulate human stereoscopic vision. Stereoscopic photography was the first that captured figures in motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n| author  = Belisle, Brooke\n| url     = https://www.academia.edu/4450652\n| title   = The Dimensional Image: Overlaps In Stereoscopic, Cinematic, And Digital Depth\n| journal = Film Criticism\n| volume  = 37/38\n| issue   = 3/1\n| pages   = 117\u201337\n| year    = 2013\n}}</ref> While known colloquially as \"3-D\" photography, the more accurate term is stereoscopy. Such cameras have long been realized by using film and more recently in digital electronic methods (including cell phone cameras).\n\n=== Dualphotography ===\n{{Main|Dualphotography}}\n[[File:1485016840 IMG 7518.JPG larger.jpg|thumb|An example of a dualphoto using a smartphone based app]]\nDualphotography consists of photographing a scene from both sides of a photographic device at once (e.g. camera for back-to-back dualphotography, or two networked cameras for portal-plane dualphotography). The dualphoto apparatus can be used to simultaneously capture both the subject and the photographer, or both sides of a geographical place at once, thus adding a supplementary narrative layer to that of a single image.<ref>{{cite news\n| title        = An introduction to Dualphotography\n| first        = Tristan\n| last         = Zand\n| url          = https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| publisher    = Medium.com\n| work         = Dual.Photo\n| date         = 8 April 2017\n| access-date  = 15 April 2017\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170416044530/https://medium.com/dualphoto/an-introduction-to-dualphotography-b17f02049bbf\n| archive-date = 16 April 2017\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Full-spectrum, ultraviolet and infrared ===\n{{Main|Full spectrum photography}}\n[[File:Saturn's Rings in Ultraviolet Light.png|thumb|This image of the [[rings of Saturn]] is an example of the application of [[ultraviolet photography]] in [[ultraviolet astronomy|astronomy]]]]\n\n[[Ultraviolet photography|Ultraviolet]] and [[infrared photography|infrared]] films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. New technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\n\nModified digital cameras can detect some ultraviolet, all of the visible and much of the near infrared spectrum, as most digital imaging sensors are sensitive from about 350&nbsp;nm to 1000&nbsp;nm. An off-the-shelf digital camera contains an infrared [[hot mirror]] filter that blocks most of the infrared and a bit of the ultraviolet that would otherwise be detected by the sensor, narrowing the accepted range from about 400&nbsp;nm to 700&nbsp;nm.<ref>Twede, David. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120215235949/http://surrealcolor.110mb.com/IR_explained_web/IR_explained.htm#CamColor Introduction to Full-Spectrum and Infrared photography]. surrealcolor.110mb.com</ref>\n\nReplacing a hot mirror or infrared blocking filter with an infrared pass or a wide spectrally transmitting filter allows the camera to detect the wider spectrum light at greater sensitivity. Without the hot-mirror, the red, green and blue (or cyan, yellow and magenta) colored micro-filters placed over the sensor elements pass varying amounts of ultraviolet (blue window) and infrared (primarily red and somewhat lesser the green and blue micro-filters).\n\nUses of full spectrum photography are for [[fine art photography]], [[Remote sensing#Geodetic|geology]], [[History of forensic photography|forensics]] and law enforcement.\n\n=== Light field ===\n{{See also|Light-field camera}}\nDigital methods of image capture and display processing have enabled the new technology of \"light field photography\" (also known as synthetic aperture photography). This process allows focusing at various depths of field to be selected ''after'' the photograph has been captured.<ref>[[Ren Ng|Ng, Ren]] (July 2006) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120916121457/http://www.lytro.com/renng-thesis.pdf Digital Light Field Photography]. PhD Thesis, Stanford University</ref> As explained by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1846, the \"[[light field]]\" is understood as 5-dimensional, with each point in 3-D space having attributes of two more angles that define the direction of each ray passing through that point.\n\nThese additional vector attributes can be captured optically through the use of microlenses at each pixel point within the 2-dimensional image sensor. Every pixel of the final image is actually a selection from each sub-array located under each microlens, as identified by a post-image capture focus algorithm.\n\n[[File:M\u00fc\u00fcrlooga (Arabidopsis thaliana) lehekarv (trihhoom) 311 0804.JPG|thumb|Devices other than cameras can be used to record images.

Note that image has been [[Image editing|edited]] by adding colors to clarify structure or to add an aesthetic effect. Heiti Paves from [[Tallinn University of Technology]].]]\n\n=== Other ===\nBesides the camera, other methods of forming images with light are available. For instance, a [[photocopy]] or [[xerography]] machine forms permanent images but uses the transfer of static [[Electric charge|electrical charges]] rather than photographic medium, hence the term [[electrophotography]]. [[Photogram]]s are images produced by the shadows of objects cast on the photographic paper, without the use of a camera. Objects can also be placed directly on the glass of an [[image scanner]] to produce digital pictures.\n\n== Types of photography ==\n===Amateur=== <!-- \"Amateur photography\" redirects here. -->\nAn amateur photographer is one who practices photography as a [[hobby]]/[[Passion (emotion)|passion]] and not necessarily for profit. The quality of some amateur work is comparable to that of many professionals and may be highly specialized or [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] in choice of subjects. Amateur photography is often pre-eminent in photographic subjects which have little prospect of commercial use or reward. Amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi     = 10.1080/03087298.2011.606727\n| title   = Home Portraiture\n| journal = History of Photography\n| volume  = 35\n| issue   = 4\n| pages   = 374\u201387\n| year    = 2011\n| last1   = Peterson\n| first1  = C.A.\n}}</ref> Nowadays it has spread widely through social media and is carried out throughout different platforms and equipment, switching to the use of cell phone.

In this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. Wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. The commercial photographic world could include:\n* Advertising photography: photographs made to illustrate and usually sell a service or product. These images, such as [[packshot]]s, are generally done with an [[advertising agency]], [[design firm]] or with an in-house corporate design team.\n* Fashion and glamour photography usually incorporates [[photographic model|models]] and is a form of advertising photography. [[Fashion photography]], like the work featured in ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', emphasizes clothes and other products; glamour emphasizes the model and body form. Glamour photography is popular in advertising and [[men's magazine]]s. Models in [[glamour photography]] sometimes work [[Nude photography|nude]].\n* [[360 product photography]] displays a series of photos to give the impression of a rotating object. This technique is commonly used by ecommerce websites to help shoppers visualise products.\n* [[Concert photography]] focuses on capturing candid images of both the artist or band as well as the atmosphere (including the crowd). Many of these photographers work freelance and are contracted through an artist or their management to cover a specific show. Concert photographs are often used to promote the artist or band in addition to the venue.\n* [[Crime scene photography]] consists of photographing scenes of crime such as robberies and murders. A black and white camera or an [[infrared camera]] may be used to capture specific details.\n* [[Still life photography]] usually depicts inanimate subject matter, typically commonplace objects which may be either natural or man-made. Still life is a broader category for food and some natural photography and can be used for advertising purposes.\n* Real Estate photography focuses on the production of photographs showcasing a property that is for sale, such photographs requires the use of wide-lens and extensive knowledge in [[High-dynamic-range imaging]] photography.\n[[File:Cheese and Tomatoes.jpg|thumb|right|Example of a studio-made food photograph.]]\n* [[Food photography]] can be used for editorial, packaging or advertising use. Food photography is similar to still life photography but requires some special skills.\n* [[Photojournalism]] can be considered a subset of editorial photography. Photographs made in this context are accepted as a documentation of a news story.\n* [[Paparazzi]] is a form of photojournalism in which the photographer captures candid images of athletes, celebrities, politicians, and other prominent people.\n* [[Portrait photography|Portrait]] and [[wedding photography]]: photographs made and sold directly to the end user of the images.\n* [[Landscape photography]] depicts locations.\n* [[Wildlife photography]] demonstrates the life of animals.\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:Alfred Stieglitz - The Steerage - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Classic [[Alfred Stieglitz]] photograph, ''[[The Steerage]]'' shows unique aesthetic of black-and-white photos.]]\n\nDuring the 20th century, both [[fine art photography]] and [[documentary photography]] became accepted by the [[English language|English-speaking]] art world and the [[art gallery|gallery]] system. In the United States, a handful of photographers, including [[Alfred Stieglitz]], [[Edward Steichen]], [[John Szarkowski]], [[F. Holland Day]], and [[Edward Weston]], spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.\nAt first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. This movement is called [[Pictorialism]], often using [[soft focus]] for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. In reaction to that, Weston, [[Ansel Adams]], and others formed the [[Group f/64]] to advocate '[[straight photography]]', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself and not an imitation of something else.\n\nThe [[aesthetics]] of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. Many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. If photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it [[beauty|beautiful]] to the viewer. The controversy began with the earliest images \"written with light\"; [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]], [[Louis Daguerre]], and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.\n\n[[Clive Bell]] in his classic essay ''Art'' states that only \"significant form\" can distinguish art from what is not art.\n\n{{quote|There must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist; possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether worthless. What is this quality? What quality is shared by all objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions? What quality is common to Sta.

Even though what is depicted in the photographs are real objects, the subject is strictly abstract.\n\n=== Photojournalism ===\n{{Main|Photojournalism}}\nPhotojournalism is a particular form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. It is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. Photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, [[street photography]] or [[celebrity photography]]) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. Photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. Photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. They deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining.\n\n=== Science and forensics ===\n[[File:Wootton bridge.jpg|thumb|[[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861]]\n\nThe camera has a long and distinguished history as a means of recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical events ([[Solar eclipse#Photography|eclipses]] for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to the eyepiece of microscopes (in [[Micrograph|photomicroscopy]]) and for [[macro photography]] of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording [[crime scene]]s and the scenes of accidents, such as the [[Wootton bridge collapse]] in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as [[forensic photography]]. Crime scene photos are taken from three vantage point. The vantage points are overview, mid-range, and close-up.<ref>Rohde, R.R. (2000). Crime Photography. PSA Journal, 66(3), 15.</ref>\n\nIn 1845 [[Francis Ronalds]], the Honorary Director of the [[Kew Observatory]], invented the first successful camera to make continuous recordings of meteorological and geomagnetic parameters.  Different machines produced 12- or 24- hour photographic traces of the minute-by-minute variations of [[atmospheric pressure]], temperature, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric electricity]], and the three components of [[Earth's magnetic field|geomagnetic forces]].

Along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation.\n\nModern photography has raised a number of concerns on its effect on society. In [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), the camera is presented as promoting voyeurism. 'Although the camera is an observation station, the act of photographing is more than passive observing'.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\n<blockquote>\nThe camera doesn't rape or even possess, though it may presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of metaphor, assassinate \u2013 all activities that, unlike the sexual push and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some detachment.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nDigital imaging has raised ethical concerns because of the ease of manipulating digital photographs in post-processing. Many photojournalists have declared they will not [[cropping|crop]] their pictures or are forbidden from combining elements of multiple photos to make \"[[photomontage]]s\", passing them as \"real\" photographs. Today's technology has made [[image editing]] relatively simple for even the novice photographer. However, recent changes of in-camera processing allow digital fingerprinting of photos to detect tampering for purposes of [[forensic photography]].\n\nPhotography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society.<ref>Levinson, P. (1997) ''The Soft Edge: a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York, pp. 37\u201348, {{ISBN|0-415-15785-4}}.</ref> Further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization. Fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised. Particularly, photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. Sontag is concerned that \"to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed.\" Desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images. Sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality.<ref name=\"Sontag\" />\n\nOne of the practices through which photography constitutes society is tourism. Tourism and photography combine to create a \"tourist gaze\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| title     = The tourist gaze\n| edition   = 2nd\n| author    = Urry, John\n| publisher = Sage\n| year      = 2002\n| isbn      = 978-0-7619-7347-8\n| url       = https://books.google.com/?id=bhhtg1sz0YAC&printsec=frontcover\n| location  = London\n}}</ref>\nin which local inhabitants are positioned and defined by the camera lens.

Protection of photographs is typically achieved through the granting of [[copyright]] or moral rights to the photographer. In the United States, photography is protected as a [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment right]] and anyone is free to photograph anything seen in public spaces as long as it is in plain view.<ref>{{Cite web\n| title        = You Have Every Right to Photograph That Cop\n| url          = https://www.aclu.org/news/you-have-every-right-photograph-cop?redirect=free-speech/you-have-every-right-photograph-cop\n| website      = American Civil Liberties Union\n| access-date  = 18 February 2016\n| archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20160225024330/https://www.aclu.org/news/you-have-every-right-photograph-cop?redirect=free-speech%2Fyou-have-every-right-photograph-cop\n| archive-date = 25 February 2016\n| url-status   = live\n}}</ref> In the UK a recent law (Counter-Terrorism Act 2008) increases the power of the police to prevent people, even press photographers, from taking pictures in public places.<ref>{{cite journal\n| url         = http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=836675\n| title       = Jail for photographing police?\n| journal     = British Journal of Photography\n| date        = 28 January 2009\n| url-status  = dead\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100327183624/http://www.bjp-online.com/public/showPage.html?page=836675\n| archivedate = 27 March 2010\n}}</ref> In South Africa, any person may photograph any other person, without their permission, in public spaces and the only specific restriction placed on what may not be photographed by government is related to anything classed as national security.

The nave arcades are of this period, that on the north being the earlier, but the aisles appear to have been rebuilt and widened in the 14th century. In 1901 there was an extensive restoration of the fabric when the floors of the nave and aisles were lowered to their original level and the tower was underpinned to a solid foundation.

The chancel has an east window of two lights with a circle in the head, originally c. 1250, and there are single lancets in the north and south walls. The vestry is of brick and is five steps below the chancel level. The 13th-century arch to the nave is of two chamfered orders, the inner one resting on moulded corbels supported by grotesque heads.\n\nThe windows of the north aisle are all of 14th century date, that at the east end being of three trefoiled lights with modern reticulated tracery, the others of two lights with quatrefoil in the head. On each side of the east window is a moulded corbel for a statue. In the south aisle the east window is of three tall trefoiled lights, with slight piercings, c. 1280, and near it, in the usual position, is a pointed piscina with fluted bowl and inner trefoil arch on plain corbels. The other windows are later and of two cinquefoiled lights. Both doorways have continuous moulded head and jambs, and there is a pseudo-Gothic plaster ribbed ceiling to the porch. At the west end of the south aisle is a stone wallbench. The clearstory windows are square-headed and of two trefoiled lights.<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThere are 17th-century tombs and headstones in the churchyard, and on one of the buttresses on the south side are three [[mass dial|scratch dials]].<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThe registers before 1812 are as follows: (i) all entries 1559\u20131648, and births 1654\u201381; (ii) baptisms 1695\u20131812, marriages 1695\u20131754, burials 1683\u20131812; (iii) marriages 1754\u20131812.

The font has been reset on an octagonal stone step.<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThe early 18th century oak pulpit was re-arranged at the restoration. The seating is modern, but in the aisles are some carved and traceried bench ends, perhaps of 16th century date.

In the south aisle the east window is of three tall trefoiled lights, with slight piercings, c. 1280, and near it, in the usual position, is a pointed piscina with fluted bowl and inner trefoil arch on plain corbels. The other windows are later and of two cinquefoiled lights. Both doorways have continuous moulded head and jambs, and there is a pseudo-Gothic plaster ribbed ceiling to the porch. At the west end of the south aisle is a stone wallbench. The clearstory windows are square-headed and of two trefoiled lights.<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThere are 17th century tombs and headstones in the churchyard, and on one of the buttresses on the south side are three [[mass dial|scratch dials]].<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThe registers before 1812 are as follows: (i) all entries 1559\u20131648, and births 1654\u201381; (ii) baptisms 1695\u20131812, marriages 1695\u20131754, burials 1683\u20131812; (iii) marriages 1754\u20131812.

The font has been reset on an octagonal stone step.<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThe early 18th century oak pulpit was re-arranged at the restoration. The seating is modern, but in the aisles are some carved and traceried bench ends, perhaps of 16th century date. There is a brass plate in the floor of the nave to John Andrewe (d. 1629), and in the chancel a mural monument to Brooke Bridges (d. 1702).<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThere are six bells in the tower, the first cast by Tobie Norris, of Stamford, in 1603; the second a medi\u00e6val bell inscribed 'Ave Maria gratia plena Dominus tecum'; the tenor dated 1607. The tenor alone is rung, the others being cracked.<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\nThe plate consists of a silver cup and cover paten of 1755, a flagon of 1776, and a silver dish with the mark of Jacques Cottin, of Paris, c. 1726, inscribed 'To the Pious Memory of ye Revd. Mr. Nat. Bridges who was 33 years Rectr. of this Church 1747.'<ref name=lhg-pub />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Wadenhoe Village Hall - geograph.org.uk - 1377969.jpg|Wadenhoe Village Hall\nFile:Church Street, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 309826.jpg|Church Street, Wadenhoe\nFile:Sundial at Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 796089.jpg|Sundial at Wadenhoe\nFile:Cottages at Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 796059.jpg|Cottages at Wadenhoe\nFile:Path to Wadenhoe Church - geograph.org.uk - 796069.jpg|Path to Wadenhoe Church\nFile:Wadenhoe Lock and sluice gate - geograph.org.uk - 1194106.jpg|Wadenhoe Lock and sluice gate\nFile:Wadenhoe Church from the car park - geograph.org.uk - 1218708.jpg|Wadenhoe Church from the car park\nFile:River Nene, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 796076.jpg|River Nene, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk\nFile:Church Street, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 795926.jpg|Church Street, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk\nFile:Milk Churn Stand, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 714481.jpg|Milk Churn Stand, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk\nFile:Footpath from Achurch to Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 322805.jpg|Footpath from Achurch to Wadenhoe\nFile:The Nene Way near Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 1377970.jpg|The Nene Way near Wadenhoe\nFile:Mill pond and Mill Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 1340276.jpg|Mill pond and Mill Wadenhoe\nFile:Wadenhoe Mill on the River Nene - geograph.org.uk - 309828.jpg|Wadenhoe Mill on the River Nene\nFile:Footpath bridge between Achurch and Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 1340246.jpg|Footpath bridge between Achurch and Wadenhoe\nFile:Trees in a parkland setting, Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 1340319.jpg|Trees in a parkland setting, Wadenhoe\nFile:Mooring on the River Nene at Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 1218701.jpg|Mooring on the River Nene at Wadenhoe\nFile:Footbridge on the Nene Way between Aldwincle and Wadenhoe - geograph.org.uk - 1377972.jpg|Footbridge on the Nene Way between Aldwincle and Wadenhoe\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Wadenhoe}}\n*[http://www.canalplan.org.uk/cgi-bin/gazetteer.cgi?id=a9kh Details of the lock on the Nene with some information on the village]\n*[http://www.focusnorthamptonshire.org.uk/Walk.aspx?AreaMapID=2&MapFeatureID=6 A walk featuring, Wadenhoe], [[Aldwincle]] and [[Achurch]]\n* [http://www.wadenhoehistorygroup.org/pdfs/WADbkChap2.pdf Wadenhoe Local History Group]\n*{{oscoor gbx|TL011836}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Northamptonshire]]\n[[Category:Civil parishes in Northamptonshire]]\n[[Category:East Northamptonshire District]]\n", "name_user": "Chris the speller", "label": "safe", "comment": "punct", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadenhoe"}
