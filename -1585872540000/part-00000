SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and child-like attitude, taking influence from other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]], The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', in 1996. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May 1, 1999. \n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has earned a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults, frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy from conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other anthropomorphic aquatic creatures.

After finishing high school in [[Baghdad]], he was awarded a government scholarship to study at the [[American University of Beirut]], where he earned both a B.B.A. and a B.A. in philosophy.

Here he studied at the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] under [[Nabia Abbott]] and began his lifelong exploration of political philosophy under the guidance of [[Leo Strauss]]. He wrote his dissertation on [[Ibn Khaldun]]. After two more years in Baghdad, Mahdi returned to Chicago, where he taught in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from 1958-1969. At [[Harvard University]] (from 1969 until his retirement in 1996),as James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic, he  served as director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and also as Chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.\n\nMahd\u012b was versed in medieval Arabic, ancient Greek, medieval Jewish and Christian philosophy but also modern Western political philosophy.

He devoted much of his career to searching for manuscripts wherever his travels took him. He is especially known for the recovery, edition, translation and interpretation of many of the works of [[Alfarabi]].

His best-known work was the first critical edition of the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHe was born and raised in the Shiite pilgrimage [[Ayn al-Tamr]] of [[Kerbala]]<ref>Musin Mahdi, La Cit\u00e9 vertueuse d\u2019Al-Farabi \u2013 La Fondation de la philosophie politique en Islam, trad. de l\u2019anglais par Fr.

After finishing high school in [[Baghdad]], he was awarded a government scholarship to study at the [[American University of Beirut]], where he earned both a B.B.A. and a B.A. in philosophy. He taught for a year at the [[University of Baghdad]] before coming to the United States in 1948, where he earned an M.A. and Ph.D.(1954) at the [[University of Chicago]]. Here he studied at the [[Oriental Institute, Chicago|Oriental Institute]] under [[Nabia Abbott]] and began his lifelong exploration of political philosophy under the guidance of [[Leo Strauss]]. He wrote his dissertation on [[Ibn Khaldun]]. After two more years in Baghdad, Mahdi returned to Chicago, where he taught in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations from 1958-1969. At [[Harvard University]] (from 1969 until his retirement in 1996),as James Richard Jewett Professor of Arabic, he  served as director of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies and also as Chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations.\n\nMahd\u012b was versed in medieval Arabic, ancient Greek, medieval Jewish and Christian philosophy but also modern Western political philosophy. Grounded in the methods of critical editions of manuscripts developed by European scholars for the ancient and medieval texts, he tried to establish the same standards in the fields of Arabic philology and philosophy. He devoted much of his career to searching for manuscripts wherever his travels took him. He is especially known for the recovery, edition, translation and interpretation of many of the works of [[Alfarabi]]. With [[Ralph Lerner]] at Chicago and [[Ernest Fortin]] at Boston College, he co-edited Medieval Political Philosophy, a path-breaking sourcebook that includes selections in translation from Arabic, Hebrew and Latin texts.\n\n==Best-known works==\n* ''Ibn Khaldun's Philosophy of History: A Study in the Philosophical Foundation of the Science of Culture''. His doctoral dissertation of 1954, published 1957.\n* ''The Thousand and One Nights (Alf layla wa-layla), from the Earliest Known Sources'', ed. by Muhsin Mahdi, 3 vols (Leiden: Brill, 1984-1994). {{ISBN|9004074287}}.\n* NB The Arabian Nights: based on the text of the fourteenth-century manuscript ed. by Muhsin Mahdi.

Discrimination and cyberbullying are more prevalent online because people have more courage to write something bold rather than to say it in person <ref>https://education.findlaw.com/student-conduct-and-discipline/cyberbullying-and-social-media.html</ref>. There is also a strong positive correlation between social anxiety and social media usage. The defining feature of social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is intense anxiety or fear of being judged, negatively evaluated, or rejected in a social or performance situation <ref>https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder</ref>. Many users with mental illnesses, such as social anxiety, go to the internet as an escape from reality, so they often withdraw from in-person communication and feel most comfortable with online communication. People usually act differently on social media than they do in person, resulting in many activities and social groups being different when using social media. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Starbird|first=Kate|last2=Weber|first2=Ingmar | name-list-format = vanc |date=2018-10-08|title=Report on the 2018 International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media |journal=AI Magazine|volume=39|issue=4|pages=17\u201318|doi=10.1609/aimag.v39i4.2841 }}</ref>  The pros and cons of social media are heavily debated; although using social media can satisfy personal communication needs, those who use them at higher rates are shown to have higher levels of psychological distress.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Menon IS, Sharma MK, Chandra PS, Thennarasu K | title = Social networking sites: an adjunctive treatment modality for psychological problems | journal = Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 260\u20133 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25035548 | pmc = 4100410 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7176.135374 }}</ref>\n\nSymptoms of social anxiety include: \n\nExcessive sweating, blushing, trembling, rapid heart rate, nausea, rigid body posture, lack of eye contact, quiet speaking, difficulty interacting with people, feeling insecure, and avoiding places with a lot of people. <ref>https://www.healthyplace.com/anxiety-panic/social-anxiety-disorder/social-anxiety-disorder-social-phobia-symptoms</ref>\n\nAn effective way to treat social anxiety disorder would be cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT helps victims of social anxiety to improve their ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to stressful situations. Withal, most CBT is held in a group format to help improve social skills. <ref>https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/cognitive-behavioral-therapy</ref>\n\n==Mechanisms==\nA 2017 review article noted the \"cultural norm\" among adolescence of being always on or connected to social media, remarking that this reflects young people's \"need to belong\" and stay up-to-date, and that this perpetuates a \"[[fear of missing out]]\". Other motivations include information seeking and identity formation, as well as voyeurism and cyber-stalking. For some individuals, social media can become \"the single most important activity that they engage in\". This can be related to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], with basic human needs often met from social media. Positive-outcome expectations and limited self-control of social media use can develop into \"addictive\" social media use. Further problematic use may occur when social media is used to cope with [[psychological stress]], or a perceived inability to cope with life demands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Mark D.|last2=Kuss|first2=Daria J.|date=March 2017|title=Social Networking Sites and Addiction: Ten Lessons Learned|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=3|pages=311|doi=10.3390/ijerph14030311|pmid=28304359|pmc=5369147}}</ref>\n\nCultural anthropologist Natasha Dow Sch\u00fcll noted parallels to the [[gambling]] industry inherent in the design of various social media sites, with \"'ludic loops' or repeated cycles of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback\" potentially contributing to problematic social media use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-create-psychological-cravings|title=Social media copies gambling methods 'to create psychological cravings' {{!}} Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation|website=ihpi.umich.edu|access-date=2019-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701123846/https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-create-psychological-cravings|archive-date=2019-07-01|url-status = live}}</ref> Another factor directly facilitating the development of addiction towards social media is implicit attitude towards the IT artifact.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turel|first=Ofir|last2=Serenko|first2=Alexander|date=2020|title=Cognitive Biases and Excessive Use of Social Media: The Facebook Implicit Associations Test (FIAT)|url=http://aserenko.com/papers/Turel_Serenko_FIAT.pdf |journal= Addictive Behaviors |volume=105|issue=June|pages=106328|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106328|pmid=32058236}}</ref>\n\nGriffiths also postulated in 2014 that social networking online may fulfill basic evolutionary drives, after mass [[urbanization]] worldwide.

With some of the negative effects that the smartphone has caused, one being the term \u201cphubbing,\u201d which is snubbing someone while an individual check their smartphone in the middle of a real-life conversation. The study was used to check the direct and indirect associations of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and trait fear of missing out with phubbing via state fear of missing out and problematic Instagram use. The total number of 423 adolescents and emerging adults between the ages of 14 to 21 years old (53% female) participated in the study. With the findings indicating that females had the significantly higher scores of phubbing, fear of missing out, problematic Instagram use, trait anxiety, and neuroticism.

The study consisted of 1008 undergraduate students, between the age of 17 and 32 years old. Participants preferred Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook reported higher scores of problematic social media use. The study concluded that YouTube was the only platform with a net positive rating based on 14 questions related to health and well-being, followed by Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, and finally Instagram. Instagram had the lowest rating: it was identified to having some positive effects such as self-expression, self-identity, and community, but ultimately was outweighed by its negative effects on sleep, body image, and \"fear of missing out,\" also known as FOMO syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/62be270a-a55f-4719-ad668c2ec7a74c2a.pdf|title=#StatusOfMind - Social media and young people's mental health and wellbeing|date=|work=Royal Society for Public Health|access-date=2019-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125171341/https://www.rsph.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/62be270a-a55f-4719-ad668c2ec7a74c2a.pdf|archive-date=2018-11-25|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\n=== Limiting the Use of Social Media ===\nA three week study for limiting social media usage was conducted on 108 female and 35 male undergraduate students at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

This study observed the student\u2019s well being by sending a questionnaire at the start of the experiment, as well as at the end of every week. Students were asked questions about their well-being on the scale of:  \u201csocial support,\u201d \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d \u201cloneliness,\u201d \u201canxiety,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201cself-esteem,\u201d and \u201cautonomy and self-acceptance.\u201d The conclusion of the study revealed that limiting social media usage on a mobile phone to 10 minutes per platform per day had a significant impact on well-being. Loneliness and depressive symptoms declined with the group that had limited social media usage. Students with depressive symptoms had a much higher impact with social media restriction if they began with higher levels of depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Melissa G.|last2=Marx|first2=Rachel|last3=Lipson|first3=Courtney|last4=Young|first4=Jordyn|date=2018|title=No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=751\u2013768|doi=10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751|issn=0736-7236}}</ref> \n\nSome people may be starting to come to grips with the fact that social media isn\u2019t so great for mental health. Others may think that getting on it will give them a boost\u2014but especially depending on how you spend your time on it, you may well feel worse after using. Plenty of studies have found correlations between higher social media use and poorer mental health, including depression, anxiety, feelings of loneliness and isolation, lower self-esteem, and even suicidality.\n\nBut two new studies underline this reality by showing not just correlation, but causation\u2014in other words, that tweaking your time on social media actually has measurable effects on mental health.\n\nThe first study, carried out at the University of Pennsylvania and published in the ''Journal of Social and Clinical'' Psychology, asked 140 undergraduates to either continue their regular use of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, or to limit each one to 10 minutes per day (30 minutes total). The participants also provided data from their phones to show precisely how much time they were actually spending on the apps, rather than relying on memory, which can be unreliable.\n\nBefore and after the \u201cintervention,\u201d the participants also filled out questionnaires so the researchers could understand how they were doing psychologically\u2014they were particularly interested in anxiety, depression, loneliness, and the famous \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d or FOMO.\n\nAs the researchers expected, people who limited their social media use to 30 minutes felt significantly better after the three-week period, reporting reduced depression and loneliness, especially those who came into the study with higher levels of depression. Interestingly, both groups reported less FOMO and less anxiety in the end, which the team suggests may just be a resulting benefit of increased self-monitoring.\n\n== Scales and Measures ==\nProblematic Social Media Use has been a concern for over a decade. There have been several scales developed and validated that help to understand the issues regarding problematic social media use. One of the first scales was an eight-item scale that was used for Facebook use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=2007-07-01|title=The Benefits of Facebook \"Friends:\" Social Capital and College Students' Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/12/4/1143/4582961|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143\u20131168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x}}</ref>  The Facebook Intensity Scale (FBI) was used multiple times and showed good reliability and validity. This scale only covered three areas of social media engagement, which left the scale lacking. Although the FBI was a good measure it lacked the needed component of purpose of use. The Multi-dimensional Facebook Intensity Scale (MFIS) investigated different dimensions of use that include overuse and reasons for use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orosz|first=G\u00e1bor|last2=T\u00f3th-Kir\u00e1ly|first2=Istv\u00e1n|last3=B\u0151the|first3=Be\u00e1ta|date=2016-10-01|title=Four facets of Facebook intensity \u2014 The development of the Multidimensional Facebook Intensity Scale|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|series=Dr. Sybil Eysenck Young Researcher Award|volume=100|pages=95\u2013104|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.11.038|issn=0191-8869}}</ref> The MFIS is composed of 13 items and has been used on several samples. The MFIS also had good reliability and validity, but the scale was directed toward the use of Facebook, and social media is far more than just one platform. The Social Networking Activity Intensity Scale (SNAIS) was created to look at the frequency of use of several platforms and investigated three facets of engagement with a 14-item survey. This scale looked at the purposes of use both entertainment and social function, and the scale as a whole had acceptable reliability and validity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jibin|last2=Lau|first2=Joseph T.

This and other relationships between [[digital media use and mental health]] have been considerably researched, debated, and discussed among experts in several disciplines, and have generated controversy in medical, scientific, and technological communities.

It showed that the amount of time spent on social media is not the key factor but rather how time is spent. Declines in well-being and [[life satisfaction]] were found in older adolescents who passively consumed social media; however, these were not shown in those who were more actively engaged. The report also found a U-shaped, curvilinear relationship between the amount of time spent on digital media with risk of depression developing, at both the low and high ends of Internet use.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reid Chassiakos YL, Radesky J, Christakis D, Moreno MA, Cross C | title = Children and Adolescents and Digital Media | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 138 | issue = 5 | pages = e20162593 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27940795 | doi = 10.1542/peds.2016-2593 }}</ref>  One can anaylze how much time is spent on social media, to discover if an addiction is present.

Therefore,  individuals may passively consume media for longer amounts of time. Also, In the digital age, it is common for adolescent to use their smart phones for entertainment purposes, education, news,  and managing their daily life. Therefore, adolescents are further at risk for developing addictive behaviours and habits.\n\n=== Social anxiety  ===\nSocial media allows users to openly share their feelings, values, relationships and thoughts. With the platform social media provides, users can freely express their emotions. However, not all is great with social media, it can also cause [[discrimination]] and [[cyberbullying]]. Discrimination and cyberbullying are more prevalent online because people have more courage to write something bold rather than to say it in person <ref>https://education.findlaw.com/student-conduct-and-discipline/cyberbullying-and-social-media.html</ref>. There is also a strong positive correlation between social anxiety and social media usage. The defining feature of social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, is intense anxiety or fear of being judged, negatively evaluated, or rejected in a social or performance situation <ref>https://adaa.org/understanding-anxiety/social-anxiety-disorder</ref>. Many users with mental illnesses, such as social anxiety, go to the internet as an escape from reality, so they often withdraw from in-person communication and feel most comfortable with online communication. People usually act differently on social media than they do in person, resulting in many activities and social groups being different when using social media. <ref>{{cite journal|last=Starbird|first=Kate|last2=Weber|first2=Ingmar | name-list-format = vanc |date=2018-10-08|title=Report on the 2018 International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media |journal=AI Magazine|volume=39|issue=4|pages=17\u201318|doi=10.1609/aimag.v39i4.2841 }}</ref>  The pros and cons of social media are heavily debated; although using social media can satisfy personal communication needs, those who use them at higher rates are shown to have higher levels of psychological distress.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Menon IS, Sharma MK, Chandra PS, Thennarasu K | title = Social networking sites: an adjunctive treatment modality for psychological problems | journal = Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 260\u20133 | date = July 2014 | pmid = 25035548 | pmc = 4100410 | doi = 10.4103/0253-7176.135374 }}</ref>\n\nSymptoms of social anxiety include: \n\nExcessive sweating, blushing, trembling, rapid heart rate, nausea, rigid body posture, lack of eye contact, quiet speaking, difficulty interacting with people, feeling insecure, and avoiding places with a lot of people. <ref>https://www.healthyplace.com/anxiety-panic/social-anxiety-disorder/social-anxiety-disorder-social-phobia-symptoms</ref>\n\nAn effective way to treat social anxiety disorder would be cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).

Other motivations include information seeking and identity formation, as well as voyeurism and cyber-stalking. For some individuals, social media can become \"the single most important activity that they engage in\". This can be related to [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], with basic human needs often met from social media. Positive-outcome expectations and limited self-control of social media use can develop into \"addictive\" social media use. Further problematic use may occur when social media is used to cope with [[psychological stress]], or a perceived inability to cope with life demands.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffiths|first=Mark D.|last2=Kuss|first2=Daria J.|date=March 2017|title=Social Networking Sites and Addiction: Ten Lessons Learned|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=3|pages=311|doi=10.3390/ijerph14030311|pmid=28304359|pmc=5369147}}</ref>\n\nCultural anthropologist Natasha Dow Sch\u00fcll noted parallels to the [[gambling]] industry inherent in the design of various social media sites, with \"'ludic loops' or repeated cycles of uncertainty, anticipation and feedback\" potentially contributing to problematic social media use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-create-psychological-cravings|title=Social media copies gambling methods 'to create psychological cravings' {{!}} Institute for Healthcare Policy & Innovation|website=ihpi.umich.edu|access-date=2019-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701123846/https://ihpi.umich.edu/news/social-media-copies-gambling-methods-create-psychological-cravings|archive-date=2019-07-01|url-status = live}}</ref> Another factor directly facilitating the development of addiction towards social media is implicit attitude towards the IT artifact.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Turel|first=Ofir|last2=Serenko|first2=Alexander|date=2020|title=Cognitive Biases and Excessive Use of Social Media: The Facebook Implicit Associations Test (FIAT)|url=http://aserenko.com/papers/Turel_Serenko_FIAT.pdf |journal= Addictive Behaviors |volume=105|issue=June|pages=106328|doi=10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106328|pmid=32058236}}</ref>\n\nGriffiths also postulated in 2014 that social networking online may fulfill basic evolutionary drives, after mass [[urbanization]] worldwide.

With some of the negative effects that the smartphone has caused, one being the term \u201cphubbing,\u201d which is snubbing someone while an individual check their smartphone in the middle of a real-life conversation. The study was used to check the direct and indirect associations of neuroticism, trait anxiety, and trait fear of missing out with phubbing via state fear of missing out and problematic Instagram use. The total number of 423 adolescents and emerging adults between the ages of 14 to 21 years old (53% female) participated in the study.

Students with depressive symptoms had a much higher impact with social media restriction if they began with higher levels of depression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Melissa G.|last2=Marx|first2=Rachel|last3=Lipson|first3=Courtney|last4=Young|first4=Jordyn|date=2018|title=No More FOMO: Limiting Social Media Decreases Loneliness and Depression|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|language=en|volume=37|issue=10|pages=751\u2013768|doi=10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751|issn=0736-7236}}</ref> \n\nSome people may be starting to come to grips with the fact that social media isn\u2019t so great for mental health. Others may think that getting on it will give them a boost\u2014but especially depending on how you spend your time on it, you may well feel worse after using. Plenty of studies have found correlations between higher social media use and poorer mental health, including depression, anxiety, feelings of loneliness and isolation, lower self-esteem, and even suicidality.\n\nBut two new studies underline this reality by showing not just correlation, but causation\u2014in other words, that tweaking your time on social media actually has measurable effects on mental health.\n\nThe first study, carried out at the University of Pennsylvania and published in the ''Journal of Social and Clinical'' Psychology, asked 140 undergraduates to either continue their regular use of Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram, or to limit each one to 10 minutes per day (30 minutes total). The participants also provided data from their phones to show precisely how much time they were actually spending on the apps, rather than relying on memory, which can be unreliable.\n\nBefore and after the \u201cintervention,\u201d the participants also filled out questionnaires so the researchers could understand how they were doing psychologically\u2014they were particularly interested in anxiety, depression, loneliness, and the famous \u201cfear of missing out,\u201d or FOMO.\n\nAs the researchers expected, people who limited their social media use to 30 minutes felt significantly better after the three-week period, reporting reduced depression and loneliness, especially those who came into the study with higher levels of depression. Interestingly, both groups reported less FOMO and less anxiety in the end, which the team suggests may just be a resulting benefit of increased self-monitoring.\n\n== Scales and Measures ==\nProblematic Social Media Use has been a concern for over a decade. There have been several scales developed and validated that help to understand the issues regarding problematic social media use. One of the first scales was an eight-item scale that was used for Facebook use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=2007-07-01|title=The Benefits of Facebook \"Friends:\" Social Capital and College Students' Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/12/4/1143/4582961|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143\u20131168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x}}</ref>  The Facebook Intensity Scale (FBI) was used multiple times and showed good reliability and validity. This scale only covered three areas of social media engagement, which left the scale lacking. Although the FBI was a good measure it lacked the needed component of purpose of use. The Multi-dimensional Facebook Intensity Scale (MFIS) investigated different dimensions of use that include overuse and reasons for use.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orosz|first=G\u00e1bor|last2=T\u00f3th-Kir\u00e1ly|first2=Istv\u00e1n|last3=B\u0151the|first3=Be\u00e1ta|date=2016-10-01|title=Four facets of Facebook intensity \u2014 The development of the Multidimensional Facebook Intensity Scale|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|series=Dr. Sybil Eysenck Young Researcher Award|volume=100|pages=95\u2013104|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2015.11.038|issn=0191-8869}}</ref> The MFIS is composed of 13 items and has been used on several samples. The MFIS also had good reliability and validity, but the scale was directed toward the use of Facebook, and social media is far more than just one platform. The Social Networking Activity Intensity Scale (SNAIS) was created to look at the frequency of use of several platforms and investigated three facets of engagement with a 14-item survey. This scale looked at the purposes of use both entertainment and social function, and the scale as a whole had acceptable reliability and validity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Jibin|last2=Lau|first2=Joseph T.

They are attracted to the positive outcomes they receive on social media.\n\nBased on those models, Xu and Tan suggest that the transition from normal to problematic social media use occurs when a person relies on it to relieve stress, loneliness, depression, or provide continuous rewards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elibrary.aisnet.org/Default.aspx?url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1216&context=icis2012|title=Why do i keep checking Facebook: Effects of message characteristics on the formation of social network services addiction|last=Xu|first=H.|last2=Tan|first2=B.C.Y.|date=2012|website=Association for Information Systems|location=Behavioral Addictions: Chapter 6 - Social Networking Addiction: An Overview of Preliminary Findings|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Management ==\nNo established treatments exist, but from research from the related entity of [[Internet addiction disorder]], treatments have been considered, with further research needed.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Andreassen|first=Cecilie|last2=Pallesen|first2=Stale|date=June 2014|title=Social Network Site Addiction - An Overview|journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design|volume=20|issue=25|pages=4053\u20134061|doi=10.2174/13816128113199990616|issn=1381-6128|pmid=24001298}}</ref> [[Screen time]] recommendations for children and families have been developed by the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx|title=How to Make a Family Media Use Plan|website=HealthyChildren.org|access-date=2019-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606111436/https://www.healthychildren.org/English/family-life/Media/Pages/How-to-Make-a-Family-Media-Use-Plan.aspx|archive-date=2019-06-06|url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Korioth|first=Trisha|date=2018-12-12|title=Family Media Plan helps parents set boundaries for kids|url=http://www.aappublications.org/news/2016/10/21/MediaParents102116|journal=AAP News|name-list-format=vanc|access-date=2019-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190109155630/http://www.aappublications.org/news/2016/10/21/MediaParents102116|archive-date=2019-01-09|url-status = live}}</ref>\n\nPossible therapeutic interventions published by Andreasson include:\n\n* Self-help interventions, including application-specific timers;\n* Cognitive behavioral therapy; and\n* Organizational and schooling support.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Andreassen|first=Cecilie Schou|date=2015-06-01|title=Online Social Network Site Addiction: A Comprehensive Review|journal=Current Addiction Reports|volume=2|issue=2|pages=175\u2013184|doi=10.1007/s40429-015-0056-9|issn=2196-2952}}</ref>\n\nMedications have not been shown to be effective in randomized, controlled trials for the related conditions of Internet addiction disorder or [[gaming disorder]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Technology firms ===\nAs awareness of these issues has increased, many technology and medical communities have continued to work together to develop novel solutions.

American actor and singer. He began his career as a child actor in 1987 acting in films including ''[[The Mighty Ducks]]'' (1992) and [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[North (1994 film)|North]]'' (1994).

For example, FHPP was attempted for the first time to repair cracks in space shuttle external components of high-strength aluminum alloys. FHPP is also considered in repairing surface cracks in steam turbine rotors of a high-strength, high-temperature-resistant steel (grade 26NiCrMoV14-5) (Ref). Alternative methods such as fusion welding processes for in-service repairing of cracks in components of these high-strength steels remained difficult because of their high hardenability and mandatory need of pre-heating and post-weld heat treatment. In contrast, initial FHPP trials could achieve joint strengths up to 90% of the base materials in high-strength steel components, especially those used for petrochemical and thermal power plants. In particular, pressurized pipes and vessels of AISI 4140 steel are widely used in the power generation, oil and gas, and petrochemical industries. Initial studies on FHPP of this alloy have showed promising results. \n\nFusion welding of AISI 4140 steel is usually recommended in annealed condition and with low hydrogen diffusible filler wires of relatively lower strength, e.g., ER70S-2 and ER80S-D2, because of the very high hardenability of Cr-Mo steels. Careful pre-heating and post weld heat treatments procedures must be followed to avoid cold cracking, reduce residual stresses and decrease impairment of HAZ properties in fusion welding of Cr-Mo and high carbon steels. Since FHPP is a solid-state joining process, several of the aforementioned issues can be alleviated. A systematic analysis of FHPP of Cr-Mo and Carbon steels is therefore needed but scarce in the literature.\n\nAn increase in stud force led to faster plastic flow of the stud and therefore reduced the overall processing time and peak temperature. However, the effect of the reduced processing time and lower peak temperature on the joint properties were not well addressed in the literature. Improper selection of the stud force often led to \"lack of filling\" defects near the crack hole bottom in FHPP of high-strength steels. FHPP is also attempted under the water to reduce the peak temperature in components of high-strength line pipe X65 steels (Ref). However, the resulting joint exhibited a full martensite structure due to higher cooling rates. A fairly uniform hardness distribution across the joint was reported in FHPP of C-Mn steel especially at lower stud forces (Ref). Although these studies provided an insight into FHPP of steels, a quantitative understanding of the effect of process variables on the temperature field, cooling rate and resulting joint hardness distribution remained scarce in FHPP of high-strength steels.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Welding]]\n", "text_old": "{{COI|date=March 2018}}\n{{original research|date=March 2018}}\n'''Friction hydro-pillar processing''' <ref>{{cite journal | author1= B Vicharapu. |author2= L F Kanan. | author3= T Clarke. | author4= A De. | doi= 10.1080/13621718.2016.1274849 | volume=22 | issue=7 |title= An investigation on friction hydro-pillar processing  | journal= Science and Technology of Welding and Joining | pages=555\u2013561|year= 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author1= L F Kanan. |author2= B Vicharapu. | author3= A F B Bueno. | author4 = T Clarke. | author5= A De. | doi= 10.1007/s11663-018-1171-5 | volume=49 | issue=2 |title= Friction Hydro-Pillar Processing of a High Carbon Steel: Joint Structure and Properties| journal= Metallurgical and Materials Transactions B | pages=699\u2013708|year= 2018 }}</ref> is a solid-state joining technology which can be used for filling of surface and sub-surface cracks in thick metals.

While they achieved great success in Canada, the band never had a song in the [[Top 40]] in the [[United States]], although \"[[Lunatic Fringe (song)|Lunatic Fringe]]\" became popular on [[album-oriented rock]] radio. They also charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with \u201cWhite Hot\u201d and \"[[Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)]]\", and charted comparably to \"Lunatic Fringe\" on Mainstream Rock (AOR) with \"[[Big League (song)|Big League]]\" (which remains popular to this day), \"Human Race\", and \"Power\".\n\n== Band history ==\n\n===As Red Rider ===\n\nRed Rider was formed in [[Toronto]] in 1975 when Peter Boynton (keyboards, synthesizers, vocals), [[Ken Greer]] (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals) and Rob Baker ([[Drum kit|drums]]) joined up with Arvo Lepp (guitar) and Jon Checkowski (bass) and began playing around Toronto, performing both original and cover music.\n\nIn 1978 their manager at that time was contacted by [[Capitol Records]] about adding singer/guitarist/composer [[Tom Cochrane]] to the group. Cochrane was invited to one of the band's gigs in [[London, Ontario]] to rehearse with them. Boynton, Greer and Baker were impressed with his playing and songwriting but Lepp and Checkowski were not as enthused and decided to leave the band. [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]] (formerly with [[Ocean (band)|Ocean]] and the original bassist for [[Rush (band)|Rush]]) was then brought in on bass, and it was the lineup of Cochrane, Boynton, Greer, Baker and Jones that were signed to Capitol and released their first album ''[[Don't Fight It (album)|Don't Fight It]]'' in October 1979. With the singles \"White Hot\" and \"Don't Fight It\", the album quickly reached gold status.\n\nTheir second album, ''[[As Far as Siam]]'', was released in June 1981 and featured the hit \"Lunatic Fringe\", which featured steel guitarist Greer. The song was used in the 1985 movie ''[[Vision Quest]]'', appeared in the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode \"Smuggler's Blues\" and saw high rotation on the United States cable network [[MTV]]. It is now a mainstay on American [[classic rock]] radio.\n\nPeter Boynton was replaced by keyboardist [[Steve Sexton]] on Red Rider's third album ''[[Neruda (album)|Neruda]]'', released in March 1983, and the track \"Napoleon Sheds His Skin\" would become one of the more popular songs from the album, while \"Human Race\" picked up considerable FM radio airplay in the US, becoming their second best known song there after \"Lunatic Fringe\". Moreover, the song \"Can't Turn Back\" was used in the ''Miami Vice'' episode \"Tale of the Goat\".\n\nFor their next release, ''[[Breaking Curfew]]'' (September 1984), [[John Webster (musician)|John Webster]] (formerly with Canadian soft rockers [[Stonebolt]]) replaced Sexton on keyboards. The album did not sell as well as ''Neruda'' and a dispute with [[Bruce Allen (manager)|Bruce Allen]], the band's manager, over the future direction of the band resulted in Red Rider's departure from the Bruce Allen camp and a change in band members, as Jeff Jones and Rob Baker left. The album did contain the band's top-charting single, [[Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)]], which reached number 71 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n=== As Tom Cochrane & Red Rider ===\n\nIn what became a strong signal regarding the future of the band, they officially became known as Tom Cochrane & Red Rider and released their [[Tom Cochrane and Red Rider|self-titled fifth album]] in May 1986, with new members [[Ken Sinnaeve|Ken \"Spider\" Sinnaeve]] on bass and Randall Coryell on drums, although [[Graham Broad]] ([[Go West (band)|Go West]] and [[Roger Waters]]' band) played drums on the album, recorded in [[Wales]] at [[Rockfield Studios]] and [[Metalworks Studios]] in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]] over the early months of 1985, produced by Patrick Moran.\n\nIn 1987 Capitol released a compilation CD titled ''[[Over 60 Minutes with Red Rider]]'', covering the band's first four albums. Also in 1987, the band, who had been nominated 11 times for [[Juno Awards]], finally was awarded one for Group of the Year.\n\nDuring the late 1980s, guitarist Peter Mueller was added to the band.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Victory Day (album)|Victory Day]]'', which contained the track \"Big League\", about the death of a young hockey player. The young man's father approached Cochrane on the day of a concert, mentioning that his son was a big fan of Red Rider's song \"Boy Inside The Man\".  Cochrane asked the man if his son was going to be attending the concert and the man responded that his son had recently died in a car accident.<ref>[http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/tomcochrane.html MelodicRock.com interview with Tom Cochrane.] Accessed September 27, 2008.</ref> Another note about \"Big League\" is that Cochrane and Greer played it at GM place at the start of the 2008/09 hockey season to commemorate the passing of [[Luc Bourdon]], a member of the [[Vancouver Canucks]].\nThe song was also featured in a segment on [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.\n\nRed Rider's final album, ''[[The Symphony Sessions (Red Rider album)|The Symphony Sessions]]'', which was recorded on March 17 and 18, 1989, and released in December 1989, saw the band performing with the [[Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]], as [[Procol Harum]] had done seventeen years before. Cochrane's solo career was taking off and the band broke up in early 1990, shortly after the album was released.\n\nThe three-[[compact disc|CD]] [[box set]] ''Ashes to Diamonds'', which includes material by both Red Rider and Cochrane as a solo artist, was released in 1993.\n\nCochrane, Greer, and Jones reunited as Red Rider in 2002 to play a benefit show after their 1980s guitar tech, John Garrish, was mugged and stabbed to death in the Yorkville section of Toronto.\n\nSince that time, Cochrane, Greer, and Jones have continued to tour annually as Red Rider, assisted by other musicians.\n\n[[Professional wrestler]] [[Kurt Angle]] used an instrumental version of \"Lunatic Fringe\" as his entrance music in [[TNA Wrestling|TNA]]. UFC fighter and former Pride Champion Dan \"Hendo\" Henderson also uses \"Lunatic Fringe\" as his intro song.\n\n== Members ==\n\n<!--Years are correct for members of band during first period of existence.

[[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Rock music|rock]] band popular in the 1980s. While they achieved great success in Canada, the band never had a song in the [[Top 40]] in the [[United States]], although \"[[Lunatic Fringe (song)|Lunatic Fringe]]\" became popular on [[album-oriented rock]] radio. They also charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with \u201cWhite Hot\u201d and \"[[Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)]]\", and charted comparably to \"Lunatic Fringe\" on Mainstream Rock (AOR) with \"[[Big League (song)|Big League]]\" (which remains popular to this day), \"Human Race\", and \"Power\".\n\n== Band history ==\n\n===As Red Rider ===\n\nRed Rider was formed in [[Toronto]] in 1975 when Peter Boynton (keyboards, synthesizers, vocals), [[Ken Greer]] (guitars, keyboards, backing vocals) and Rob Baker ([[Drum kit|drums]]) joined up with Arvo Lepp (guitar) and Jon Checkowski (bass) and began playing around Toronto, performing both original and cover music.\n\nIn 1978 their manager at that time was contacted by [[Capitol Records]] about adding singer/guitarist/composer [[Tom Cochrane]] to the group. Cochrane was invited to one of the band's gigs in [[London, Ontario]] to rehearse with them. Boynton, Greer and Baker were impressed with his playing and songwriting but Lepp and Checkowski were not as enthused and decided to leave the band. [[Jeff Jones (musician)|Jeff Jones]] (formerly with [[Ocean (band)|Ocean]] and the original bassist for [[Rush (band)|Rush]]) was then brought in on bass, and it was the lineup of Cochrane, Boynton, Greer, Baker and Jones that were signed to Capitol and released their first album ''[[Don't Fight It (album)|Don't Fight It]]'' in October 1979. With the singles \"White Hot\" and \"Don't Fight It\", the album quickly reached gold status.\n\nTheir second album, ''[[As Far as Siam]]'', was released in June 1981 and featured the hit \"Lunatic Fringe\", which featured steel guitarist Greer. The song was used in the 1985 movie ''[[Vision Quest]]'', appeared in the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' episode \"Smuggler's Blues\" and saw high rotation on the United States cable network [[MTV]]. It is now a mainstay on American [[classic rock]] radio.\n\nPeter Boynton was replaced by keyboardist [[Steve Sexton]] on Red Rider's third album ''[[Neruda (album)|Neruda]]'', released in March 1983, and the track \"Napoleon Sheds His Skin\" would become one of the more popular songs from the album, while \"Human Race\" picked up considerable FM radio airplay in the US, becoming their second best known song there after \"Lunatic Fringe\". Moreover, the song \"Can't Turn Back\" was used in the ''Miami Vice'' episode \"Tale of the Goat\".\n\nFor their next release, ''[[Breaking Curfew]]'' (September 1984), [[John Webster (musician)|John Webster]] (formerly with Canadian soft rockers [[Stonebolt]]) replaced Sexton on keyboards. The album did not sell as well as ''Neruda'' and a dispute with [[Bruce Allen (manager)|Bruce Allen]], the band's manager, over the future direction of the band resulted in Red Rider's departure from the Bruce Allen camp and a change in band members, as Jeff Jones and Rob Baker left. The album did contain the band's top-charting single, [[Young Thing, Wild Dreams (Rock Me)]], which reached number 71 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n=== As Tom Cochrane & Red Rider ===\n\nIn what became a strong signal regarding the future of the band, they officially became known as Tom Cochrane & Red Rider and released their [[Tom Cochrane and Red Rider|self-titled fifth album]] in May 1986, with new members [[Ken Sinnaeve|Ken \"Spider\" Sinnaeve]] on bass and Randall Coryell on drums, although [[Graham Broad]] ([[Go West (band)|Go West]] and [[Roger Waters]]' band) played drums on the album, recorded in [[Wales]] at [[Rockfield Studios]] and [[Metalworks Studios]] in [[Mississauga]], [[Ontario]] over the early months of 1985, produced by Patrick Moran.\n\nIn 1987 Capitol released a compilation CD titled ''[[Over 60 Minutes with Red Rider]]'', covering the band's first four albums. Also in 1987, the band, who had been nominated 11 times for [[Juno Awards]], finally was awarded one for Group of the Year.\n\nDuring the late 80s, guitarist Peter Mueller was added to the band.\n\nIn the fall of 1988, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Victory Day (album)|Victory Day]]'', which contained the track \"Big League\", about the death of a young hockey player. The young man's father approached Cochrane on the day of a concert, mentioning that his son was a big fan of Red Rider's song, \"Boy Inside The Man\".  Cochrane asked the man if his son was going to be attending the concert and the man responded that his son had recently died in a car accident.<ref>[http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/tomcochrane.html MelodicRock.com interview with Tom Cochrane.] Accessed September 27, 2008.</ref> Another note about \"Big League\" is that Cochrane and Greer played it at GM place at the start of the 2008/09 hockey season to commemorate the passing of [[Luc Bourdon]], a member of the [[Vancouver Canucks]].\nThe song was also featured in a segment on [[CBC Television]]'s ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]''.\n\nRed Rider's final album, ''[[The Symphony Sessions (Red Rider album)|The Symphony Sessions]]'', which was recorded on March 17 and 18, 1989, and released in December 1989, saw the band performing with the [[Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]], as [[Procol Harum]] had done seventeen years before. Cochrane's solo career was taking off and the band broke up in early 1990, shortly after the album was released.\n\nThe three-[[compact disc|CD]] [[box set]] ''Ashes to Diamonds'', which includes material by both Red Rider and Cochrane as a solo artist, was released in 1993.\n\nCochrane, Greer, and Jones reunited as Red Rider in 2002 to play a benefit show after their 80s guitar tech, John Garrish, was mugged and stabbed to death in the Yorkville section of Toronto.\n\nSince that time, Cochrane, Greer, and Jones have continued to tour annually as Red Rider, assisted by other musicians.\n\n[[Professional wrestler]] [[Kurt Angle]] used an instrumental version of \"Lunatic Fringe\" as his entrance music in [[TNA Wrestling|TNA]]. UFC fighter and former Pride Champion Dan \"Hendo\" Henderson also uses \"Lunatic Fringe\" as his intro song.\n\n== Members ==\n\n<!--Years are correct for members of band during first period of existence.
