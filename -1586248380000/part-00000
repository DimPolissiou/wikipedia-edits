[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] commented on 19th century evolutionary linguistics:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"Language was considered a specific sphere, a fourth natural kingdom ; this led to methods of reasoning which would have caused astonishment in other sciences. Today one cannot read a dozen lines written at that time without being struck by absurdities of reasoning and by the terminology used to justify these absurdities\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=de Saussure|first=Ferdinand |title=Course in general linguistics |place=New York|publisher=Philosophy Library |date=1959 |orig-year=First published 1916|pages= |chapter= | url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |isbn= 9780231157278| author-link=Ferdinand_de_Saussure}}</ref>|}}\n\n[[Mark Aronoff]] however argues that historical linguistics had its golden age during the time of Schleicher and his supporters, enjoying a place among the hard sciences, and considers the return of Darwnian linguistics as a positive development. [[Esa Itkonen]] nonetheless deems the revival of Darwinism as a hopeless enterprise:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"There is ... an application of intelligence in linguistic change which is absent in biological evolution; and this suffices to make the two domains totally disanalogous ... {{Square bracket open|1}}Grammaticalisation depends on{{Square bracket close|1}} cognitive processes, ultimately serving the goal of problem solving, which intelligent entities like humans must perform all the time, but which biological entities like genes cannot perform. Trying to eliminate this basic difference leads to confusion.\u201d<ref name=Itkonen_1999>{{cite journal |last=Itkonen |first=Esa |year=1999 |title=Functionalism yes, biologism no |url= |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sprachwissenschaft |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013221 |doi=10.1515/zfsw.1999.18.2.219|access-date=}}</ref>|}}\n\nItkonen also points out that the principles of natural selection are not applicable because language innovation and acceptance have the same source which is the speech community. In biological evolution, mutation and selection have different sources. This makes it possible for people to change their languages, but not their [[genotype]].<ref name=Itkonen_2011>{{cite journal |last1= Itkonen|first1= Esa|last2= |first2= |date= 2011|title= On Coseriu\u2019s legacy|url= http://www.romling.uni-tuebingen.de/energeia/zeitschrift/2011/pdf/On_Coserius_legacy.pdf|journal=Energeia |volume= |issue= III|pages= 1\u201329|doi= |access-date=2020-01-14 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{col div|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Biolinguistics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[FOXP2]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Historical linguistics]]\n* [[Phylogenetic tree]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Atkinson QD, Meade A, Venditti C, Greenhill SJ, Pagel M|title=Languages evolve in punctuational bursts |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5863 |pages=588 |year=2008 |pmid=18239118 |doi=10.1126/science.1149683}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last = Botha |editor-first = R |editor2 = Knight, C. |title = The Cradle of Language |series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749}}\n**{{cite book | last1 = Diller | first1 = Karl C. |last2 = Cann | first2 =Rebecca L. |title = Evidence Against a Genetic-Based Revolution in Language 50,000 Years Ago |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =135\u2013149}}\n**{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257\u2013280}}\n**{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62\u201392}}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1075/eoc.4.1.07can | last1 = Cangelosi | first1 = A. | authorlink2 = Stevan Harnad | last2 = Harnad | first2 = S. | year = 2001 | title = The adaptive advantage of symbolic theft over sensorimotor toil: Grounding language in perceptual categories | url = http://cogprints.org/2036/ | journal = Evolution of Communication | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 117\u2013142 }}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Carstairs-McCarthy|first1=Andrew|title=Language evolution: What linguists can contribute |journal=Lingua| volume=117|issue=3| year=2007| pages=503\u2013509| doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2005.07.004}}\n*{{Cite book  | last1 = Christiansen| first1 =  Morten H.|authorlink1=Morten H.

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] commented on 19th century evolutionary linguistics:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"Language was considered a specific sphere, a fourth natural kingdom ; this led to methods of reasoning which would have caused astonishment in other sciences. Today one cannot read a dozen lines written at that time without being struck by absurdities of reasoning and by the terminology used to justify these absurdities\u201d<ref>{{cite book |last=de Saussure|first=Ferdinand |title=Course in general linguistics |place=New York|publisher=Philosophy Library |date=1959 |orig-year=First published 1916|pages= |chapter= | url=https://monoskop.org/images/0/0b/Saussure_Ferdinand_de_Course_in_General_Linguistics_1959.pdf |isbn= 9780231157278| author-link=Ferdinand_de_Saussure}}</ref>|}}\n\n[[Mark Aronoff]] however argues that historical linguistics had its golden age during the time of Schleicher and his supporters, enjoying a place among the hard sciences, and considers the return of Darwnian linguistics as a positive development. [[Esa Itkonen]] nonetheless deems the revival of Darwinism as a hopeless enterprise:\n{{Quote|text=\n\"There is ... an application of intelligence in linguistic change which is absent in biological evolution; and this suffices to make the two domains totally disanalogous ... {{Square bracket open|1}}Grammaticalisation depends on{{Square bracket close|1}} cognitive processes, ultimately serving the goal of problem solving, which intelligent entities like humans must perform all the time, but which biological entities like genes cannot perform. Trying to eliminate this basic difference leads to confusion.\u201d<ref name=Itkonen_1999>{{cite journal |last=Itkonen |first=Esa |year=1999 |title=Functionalism yes, biologism no |url= |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Sprachwissenschaft |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=219\u2013221 |doi=10.1515/zfsw.1999.18.2.219|access-date=}}</ref>|}}\n\nItkonen also points out that the principles of natural selection are not applicable because language innovation and acceptance have the same source which is the speech community. In biological evolution, mutation and selection have different sources. This makes it possible for people to change their languages, but not their [[genotype]].<ref name=Itkonen_2011>{{cite journal |last1= Itkonen|first1= Esa|last2= |first2= |date= 2011|title= On Coseriu\u2019s legacy|url= http://www.romling.uni-tuebingen.de/energeia/zeitschrift/2011/pdf/On_Coserius_legacy.pdf|journal=Energeia |volume= |issue= III|pages= 1-29|doi= |access-date=2020-01-14 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Evolutionary biology}}\n{{col div|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Biolinguistics]]\n* [[Evolutionary psychology of language]]\n* [[FOXP2]]\n* [[Origin of language]]\n* [[Historical linguistics]]\n* [[Phylogenetic tree]]\n* [[Universal Darwinism]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |vauthors=Atkinson QD, Meade A, Venditti C, Greenhill SJ, Pagel M|title=Languages evolve in punctuational bursts |journal=Science |volume=319 |issue=5863 |pages=588 |year=2008 |pmid=18239118 |doi=10.1126/science.1149683}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last = Botha |editor-first = R |editor2 = Knight, C. |title = The Cradle of Language |series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749}}\n**{{cite book | last1 = Diller | first1 = Karl C. |last2 = Cann | first2 =Rebecca L. |title = Evidence Against a Genetic-Based Revolution in Language 50,000 Years Ago |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =135\u2013149}}\n**{{cite book |last = Power| first = Camilla |title=Sexual Selection Models for the Emergence of Symbolic Communication: Why They Should be Reversed |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749| pages= 257\u2013280}}\n**{{cite book |last = Watts | first = Ian  |title=Red Ochre, Body Painting, and Language: Interpreting the Blombos Ochre |editor=Rudolf Botha |editor2=Chris Knight| work= The Cradle of Language|series = Oxford Series in the Evolution of Language |year = 2009 |publisher = Oxford University Press |location = Oxford. |isbn = 978-0-19-954586-5 | oclc = 804498749 | pages =62\u201392}}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1075/eoc.4.1.07can | last1 = Cangelosi | first1 = A. | authorlink2 = Stevan Harnad | last2 = Harnad | first2 = S. | year = 2001 | title = The adaptive advantage of symbolic theft over sensorimotor toil: Grounding language in perceptual categories | url = http://cogprints.org/2036/ | journal = Evolution of Communication | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 117\u2013142 }}\n*{{cite journal|last1=Carstairs-McCarthy|first1=Andrew|title=Language evolution: What linguists can contribute |journal=Lingua| volume=117|issue=3| year=2007| pages=503\u2013509| doi=10.1016/j.lingua.2005.07.004}}\n*{{Cite book  | last1 = Christiansen| first1 =  Morten H.|authorlink1=Morten H.

His mother soon remarried, but she soon died of cancer as well. His inexperienced stepfather soon moved away, leaving Ladislav alone with his brother Jaroslav in an apartment in [[Motol (Prague)|Motol]]. After completing a special school, he was trained by a glazier. His IQ was determined as 88, a below average score. Shortly before his capture, he lived in an apartment by himself because his brother had taken up military service. He was arrested on February 11, 1982, in connection with an investigation into the murder of Anna \u0160., committed at the beginning of October 1981. During the subsequent investigation, he indicated the existence of other victims, gradually admitting to another four murders, eighteen rapes and an attempted murder.\n\n==Crimes==\n* '''Eva R. (29)''' -  He committed his first murder on December 1, 1978 in [[D\u011b\u010d\u00edn]], where he said he \"knew the beauty of [his] country, but also looked for some women.\" He had been planning to visit D\u011b\u010d\u00edn, since he was passing by bus on his way to [[Germany]]. He attacked Eva R. on [[Elbe]]'s embankment after he left the cinema, knocked her down, dragged her into some bushes and then strangled her. Hojer then proceeded to masturbate over the corpse. His victim had lived a very promiscious life. At age 29, she was married for the third time. On the day of her murder, she left her husband to visit the cinema, intending to later visit a lover at the crime scene. But the man forgot about the last meeting, and suspicion fell on both men. During the investigation, other lovers were found, including one who was wrongly accused of the killing. Like in several of the following cases, a man admitted to the murder for attention.\n* '''Ivona S. (25)''' - Another woman was murdered on the morning of February 9, 1980 on the night train R770 from Prague to D\u011b\u010d\u00edn. This medical student sat on their train with her husband, a military officer, but got off near their final destination. The man traveled by another train later. At that time, Hojer himself was in [[military service]] and was going to D\u011b\u010d\u00edn to visit a friend. He observed Ivona S. as she boarded the train. As she walked out of the toilet cubicle, he walked behind the woman and strangled her using her own scarf. There was not enough space in the cubicle to store the body, hence why he only masturbated for a bit before he proceeded to throw Ivona's body out from a window. He disembarked at a station in [[\u00dast\u00ed nad Labem]] and in about two hours returned to Prague with another train. Ivona S.'s body was eventually found around 8 o'clock in the morning by the [[Czechoslovak State Railways|\u010cSD]] cleaning service. A witness in \u00dast\u00ed had spotted a soldier who was in a hurry but could not describe him in detail. Since the other 46 passengers were identified, this soldier became the main suspect. Hojer had an alibi, as his disappearance was not recorded on the day of the murder. The investigation was then accompanied by a number of coincidences: one of the suspects, a railroad worker, committed suicide. In his apartment, there were newspaper clippings about the case and an English-written medical book, though the man did not know English himself. He had also told colleagues that he hoped the authorities close the investigation. Another suspected was a distant relative of the victim, who, although almost ignorant of the case, broke down while attending her funeral and also committed suicide. The lost plastic bag which was with Ivona's clothes was never found. At the time, this was a highly mysterious case.\n* '''Unknown (25-35)''' - In August 1980, again during his military holiday, Hojer went to see a friend, this time in [[Ko\u0161ice]]. He decided to see the Ru\u017e\u00edn reservoir dam, which was a sought-after recreation site. Due to bad weather, however, the place was abandoned, except for a lonely woman on the shore who was observing the dam. Unlike his other attacks, Hojer did not even call out to the woman, but the victim fought back. But when she was strangled, he prematurely ejaculated and lost interest. Her body was tied up with some found wire, heavied with a stone and thrown into the water. After the act, the tank was flooded. The body was discovered by workers on October 11, 1981, already at a considerable stage of decay (the head and wrists were non-violently separated from the body). According to the clothing brand Triola, she was a Czechoslovak national aged between 25 and 35 years of age. It was determined that the woman hadn't had any surgeries performed or any major injuries, which prevented the use of medical records to identify her. Due to the inability of [[Slovakia|Slovak]] investigators to find out more information, the woman's identity remains unknown.\n* '''Ivana M. (18)''' - On January 30, 1981, he arrived in the morning in [[Brno]] and traveled all day. By about 3 o'clock in the morning, he came across the attractive Ivana M. at a tram stop, as she was returning from a local zoo. He tried to talk to her, but Ivana ran away. Hojer shoved her to the ground and dragged her to the local park, where he tried to rape her, but then proceeded to stab and finally strangle the woman. He then cut off her breasts and genitalia with a scissor blade, which he took home in a plastic bag. He placed the breasts on the table top, penetrated his penis into the genitalia that he had cut off beforehand and then put the remains in a refrigerator. After about a week, he cooked them in salted water and tried to eat some of the \"devilish\" mustard and horse radish. But the dish did not taste good, so he flushed the remains down the toilet. The victim has suffered 39 stab wounds and her wallet, jewelry and watch were stolen. The first suspects were part of the large [[Greece|Greek]] community that Ivana often met up with. Later on, a [[Jordan]]ian student admitted to the murder before he unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide. In the subsequent interrogation, he said he had admitted to the gruesome killing in order to divert attention from his academic failures, thus heavily damaging the reputation of his family.\n* '''Anna \u0160. (51)''' - The last murder was committed on October 3, 1981, at 22 o'clock near the victim's residence near the bridge over Motolsk\u00fd Potok in [[Prague 5]]. Hojer wandered around the premises for at least an hour before he passed by 51-year-old Anna \u0160., who was returning from an evening concert. Because of her good looks, he considered her younger and persuaded Anna to have sex. The conversation was limited to four sentences, after the woman had her dress and stockings slit with a knife before being raped. Finally, Hojer pulled her stockings over her head and strangled Anna \u0160. so she couldn't identify him. He then threw her overcoat over her head so nobody except the killer and the investigators would know the cause of death. Her cry was heard by a large number of witnesses, but nobody connected it with a violent sexual assault. The body was discovered by a random passer-by who wanted to relieve himself in the bushes. This is the only murder that worried Hojer, as he then proceeded to walk 300 meters from his residence and went to work at his job at the [[glassblowing]] workshop. He was afraid that people would notice something and discover the killer. He even admitted to the murder several times in his favorite pub, but nobody took him seriously.\n* '''Attempted murder''' - Only by a lucky coincidence by a young girl, sitting drunk at a curb next a tram stop, survived an attack by Hojer. He dragged her into a nearby park, where he stripped the girl and tried to rape her. However, he had an erection problem and hence forced [[oral sex]] on her. He also pushed various objects into her vagina and asked her to put her hand there. The girl was covering her mouth all the time and was pushed by the neck, losing consciousness several times. The girl eventually managed to persuade Hojer to continue at her home, where no one would disturb them. She asked him to dress her up because she could not go naked on the street. So he let her go and put her clothes back on, but the girl pushed him away and ran down the street. Hojer caught and then knocked her on the ground, before proceeding to hit her head on the pavement several times. Her shouting was heard by a policeman, who accidentally leaned out of his apartment window and shouted \"You will leave her!\" at the assailant. The would-be killer mocked the wounded girl and then fled.\n\n==Investigation, conviction and execution==\nHe was arrested on the basis of the testimony of a mentally-ill patient who admitted to the murder of Anna \u0160., but the investigation later revealed that he had been securely behind bars the entire time. But the man knew how she was murdered, which was still unpublished information. Finally, the patient told the authorities that his friend showed him the scene of the crime and told how Anna was killed. That friend was Hojer, who thereafter admitted to the murder. Later, particles of cloth from his trousers were found, along with other things, as well as his [[blood type]] coinciding with the saliva and sperm samples secured at the crime scene. Hojer also possessed a knife, which he used to cut up the victims' garments.\n\nDuring 1982, he admitted to another murder, bringing the count to five. Criminologists believe he committed at least two other murders, but he did not admit to them. Hojer made the confession exclusively in writing, because he was ashamed of some of his deeds and refused to speak with anyone.\n\nFor his brutal deeds, he was [[sentenced to death]]. He also withdrew his confession once. Although there was a possibility that he had committed other crimes, there was anxiety about trying to confuse the investigators with false accusations, so the investigation was closed. Ladislav Hojer was executed on August 7, 1986 in [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison]]. Before he was punished, he expressed his fear of death, and the execution was delayed twice due to the offender's illness.<ref>http://www.odsouzeni.estranky.cz/clanky/co-prinesla-media/rozhovor-s-poslednim-ceskym-katem_-pred-popravou-rvacka_-po-ni-panak-rumu___.html</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nAccording to expert opinions in psychiatry, sexology and psychology, he was a primitive psychopath: an amoral, anabolic personality with schizoid features and aggressive tendencies. Criminal behavior was committed in uninterrupted consciousness and deliberately made it more difficult to reveal. He was able to hinder and correct his repeated actions. His attitude toward murders is indicative of insensitivity and brutality, the absence of at least additional sympathy, conscience or regret.\n\nThe reports showed that:\n\n 1. mental disorder was not detected\n 2. resocialization, even a long-term punishment, is not possible\n 3. protective treatment in a closed psychiatric institution is not proposed.\n\nA clear guideline for explaining Hojer's motives was his exclusively negative experience with women. He tried to establish the acquaintance by using an ad. A well-dressed woman arrived at the meeting, promising to get acquainted with a financially secure middle-aged man. Hojer repulsed her with his appearance, repulsed, and reproached so hard that she had left after a few minutes. It was much more promising for Hojer to become acquainted with the young woman he met at a party with his friends. She offered him sexual intercourse in the next room. It is likely that Hojer's panic has fallen as the woman has become active and moved away. He tossed it so hard that the door's glass filled through, and ran away from the apartment. Later, he learned that this girl, with a very bad reputation, spoke to his acquaintances with him. He was always very vulgar and contemptuous about women, but he was rather passive and uncertain in their presence. He did not know how to communicate with women, and he often imagined the scenes in which the helpless girl prayed for mercy.\n\nDuring the investigations and in particular reconstructions, Hojer built a special and almost friendly relationship with the criminalists. Chief Investigator Ji\u0159\u00ed Markovi\u010d even wanted to invite him to his home for a Sunday lunch. This idea was eventually summoned by his colleagues. When the Slovak murder was clarified, there was no company available, so Markovi\u010d had to play Hojer's game. Reconstructions were often very problematic because they were too much in the situation, and therefore the living folks were instead replaced by mannequins. In some reconstructions, the investigators met the threats of visiting citizens who demanded Hojer's release and [[lynching]]. Hojer did not understand their reaction, which clearly testifies to his inability to understand the seriousness of his crimes.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of Hojer's personality was a very dark sense of humor. One day, for example, he offered criminalists in the car that when he stops at two trackers they were passing by, he is \"wicked and killed\" to have a quick case. His remarkably primitive way of expression was remarkable. He used the turns like \"I took oxygen; I caught her behind my mouth; she remained in my hands; I did not care what drunk, especially that she had a good skeleton \", etc. He said rhythm as his motto: \"When my tail stands, my brain stops.\" The imminent death penalty did not allow himself until the last minute and even enjoyed his stay in custody. It was the first time in his life, when he became the focus of one's interest.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091207010348/http://www.policie-cr.cz/11-ladislav-hojer-brutalni-vrah-zen.html policie-cr.cz Article]\n* [http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/hojer/hojer.html kriminalistika.eu Article]\n* [http://xman.idnes.cz/xman-styl.aspx?c=A080409_164135_xman-novinky_fro Xman.cz Article]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hojer, Ladislav}}\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak serial killers]]\n[[Category:Cannibals]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:People executed by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]\n[[Category:20th-century criminals]]\n[[Category:Executed serial killers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox serial killer\n| name        = Ladislav Hojer\n| image       = \n| image_size  =\n| caption     = \n| alt         = \n| birth_name  = \n| alias       = \n| birth_date  = {{Birth date|1958|03|15}}\n| birth_place = [[Czechoslovakia]]\n| death_date  = {{Death date and age|1986|08|07|1958|03|15}}\n| death_place = [[Prague]], Czechoslovakia\n| cause       = Executed by [[hanging]]\n| conviction  = [[Murder]]\n| sentence    = [[Death]]\n| victims     = 5-7+\n| beginyear   = 1978\n| endyear     = 1981\n| country     = [[Czechoslovakia]]\n| states      = [[\u00dast\u00ed nad Labem]], [[Ko\u0161ice Self-governing Region]], [[South Moravian Region]], [[Bohemia]]\n| apprehended = \n| imprisoned  = \n}}\n'''Ladislav Hojer''' (born March 15, 1958 - August 7, 1986 in [[Prague]]) was a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] sadistic rapist, [[serial killer]] and [[cannibal]] who murdered a total of five women between 1978 and 1981 in Czechoslovakia.\n\n==Biography==\nLadislav's father died of [[cancer]] when he was still little.

He attacked Eva R. on [[Elbe]]'s embankment after he left the cinema, knocked her down, dragged her into some bushes and then strangled her. Hojer then proceeded to masturbate over the corpse. His victim had lived a very promiscious life. At age 29, she was married for the third time. On the day of her murder, she left her husband to visit the cinema, intending to later visit a lover at the crime scene. But the man forgot about the last meeting, and suspicion fell on both men. During the investigation, other lovers were found, including one who was wrongly accused of the killing. Like in several of the following cases, a man admitted to the murder for attention.\n* '''Ivona S. (25)''' - Another woman was murdered on the morning of February 9, 1980 on the night train R770 from Prague to D\u011b\u010d\u00edn. This medical student sat on their train with her husband, a military officer, but got off near their final destination. The man traveled by another train later. At that time, Hojer himself was in [[military service]] and was going to D\u011b\u010d\u00edn to visit a friend. He observed Ivona S. as she boarded the train. As she walked out of the toilet cubicle, he walked behind the woman and strangled her using her own scarf. There was not enough space in the cubicle to store the body, hence why he only masturbated for a bit before he proceeded to throw Ivona's body out from a window. He disembarked at a station in [[\u00dast\u00ed nad Labem]] and in about two hours returned to Prague with another train. Ivona S.'s body was eventually found around 8 o'clock in the morning by the [[Czechoslovak State Railways|\u010cSD]] cleaning service. A witness in \u00dast\u00ed had spotted a soldier who was in a hurry but could not describe him in detail. Since the other 46 passengers were identified, this soldier became the main suspect. Hojer had an alibi, as his disappearance was not recorded on the day of the murder. The investigation was then accompanied by a number of coincidences: one of the suspects, a railroad worker, committed suicide. In his apartment, there were newspaper clippings about the case and an English-written medical book, though the man did not know English himself. He had also told colleagues that he hoped the authorities close the investigation. Another suspected was a distant relative of the victim, who, although almost ignorant of the case, broke down while attending her funeral and also committed suicide. The lost plastic bag which was with Ivona's clothes was never found. At the time, this was a highly mysterious case.\n* '''Unknown (25-35)''' - In August 1980, again during his military holiday, Hojer went to see a friend, this time in [[Ko\u0161ice]]. He decided to see the Ru\u017e\u00edn reservoir dam, which was a sought-after recreation site. Due to bad weather, however, the place was abandoned, except for a lonely woman on the shore who was observing the dam. Unlike his other attacks, Hojer did not even call out to the woman, but the victim fought back. But when she was strangled, he prematurely ejaculated and lost interest. Her body was tied up with some found wire, heavied with a stone and thrown into the water. After the act, the tank was flooded. The body was discovered by workers on October 11, 1981, already at a considerable stage of decay (the head and wrists were non-violently separated from the body). According to the clothing brand Triola, she was a Czechoslovak national aged between 25 and 35 years of age. It was determined that the woman hadn't had any surgeries performed or any major injuries, which prevented the use of medical records to identify her. Due to the inability of [[Slovakia|Slovak]] investigators to find out more information, the woman's identity remains unknown.\n* '''Ivana M. (18)''' - On January 30, 1981, he arrived in the morning in [[Brno]] and traveled all day. By about 3 o'clock in the morning, he came across the attractive Ivana M. at a tram stop, as she was returning from a local zoo. He tried to talk to her, but Ivana ran away. Hojer shoved her to the ground and dragged her to the local park, where he tried to rape her, but then proceeded to stab and finally strangle the woman. He then cut off her breasts and genitalia with a scissor blade, which he took home in a plastic bag. He placed the breasts on the table top, penetrated his penis into the genitalia that he had cut off beforehand and then put the remains in a refrigerator. After about a week, he cooked them in salted water and tried to eat some of the \"devilish\" mustard and horse radish. But the dish did not taste good, so he flushed the remains down the toilet. The victim has suffered 39 stab wounds and her wallet, jewelry and watch were stolen. The first suspects were part of the large [[Greece|Greek]] community that Ivana often met up with. Later on, a [[Jordan]]ian student admitted to the murder before he unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide. In the subsequent interrogation, he said he had admitted to the gruesome killing in order to divert attention from his academic failures, thus heavily damaging the reputation of his family.\n* '''Anna \u0160. (51)''' - The last murder was committed on October 3, 1981, at 22 o'clock near the victim's residence near the bridge over Motolsk\u00fd Potok in [[Prague 5]]. Hojer wandered around the premises for at least an hour before he passed by 51-year-old Anna \u0160., who was returning from an evening concert. Because of her good looks, he considered her younger and persuaded Anna to have sex. The conversation was limited to four sentences, after the woman had her dress and stockings slit with a knife before being raped. Finally, Hojer pulled her stockings over her head and strangled Anna \u0160. so she couldn't identify him. He then threw her overcoat over her head so nobody except the killer and the investigators would know the cause of death. Her cry was heard by a large number of witnesses, but nobody connected it with a violent sexual assault. The body was discovered by a random passer-by who wanted to relieve himself in the bushes. This is the only murder that worried Hojer, as he then proceeded to walk 300 meters from his residence and went to work at his job at the [[glassblowing]] workshop. He was afraid that people would notice something and discover the killer. He even admitted to the murder several times in his favorite pub, but nobody took him seriously.\n* '''Attempted murder''' - Only by a lucky coincidence by a young girl, sitting drunk at a curb next a tram stop, survived an attack by Hojer. He dragged her into a nearby park, where he stripped the girl and tried to rape her. However, he had an erection problem and hence forced [[oral sex]] on her. He also pushed various objects into her vagina and asked her to put her hand there. The girl was covering her mouth all the time and was pushed by the neck, losing consciousness several times. The girl eventually managed to persuade Hojer to continue at her home, where no one would disturb them. She asked him to dress her up because she could not go naked on the street. So he let her go and put her clothes back on, but the girl pushed him away and ran down the street. Hojer caught and then knocked her on the ground, before proceeding to hit her head on the pavement several times. Her shouting was heard by a policeman, who accidentally leaned out of his apartment window and shouted \"You will leave her!\" at the assailant. The would-be killer mocked the wounded girl and then fled.\n\n==Investigation, conviction and execution==\nHe was arrested on the basis of the testimony of a mentally-ill patient who admitted to the murder of Anna \u0160., but the investigation later revealed that he had been securely behind bars the entire time. But the man knew how she was murdered, which was still unpublished information. Finally, the patient told the authorities that his friend showed him the scene of the crime and told how Anna was killed. That friend was Hojer, who thereafter admitted to the murder. Later, particles of cloth from his trousers were found, along with other things, as well as his [[blood type]] coinciding with the saliva and sperm samples secured at the crime scene. Hojer also possessed a knife, which he used to cut up the victims' garments.\n\nDuring 1982, he admitted to another murder, bringing the count to five. Criminologists believe he committed at least two other murders, but he did not admit to them. Hojer made the confession exclusively in writing, because he was ashamed of some of his deeds and refused to speak with anyone.\n\nFor his brutal deeds, he was [[sentenced to death]]. He also withdrew his confession once. Although there was a possibility that he had committed other crimes, there was anxiety about trying to confuse the investigators with false accusations, so the investigation was closed. Ladislav Hojer was executed on August 7, 1986 in [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison]]. Before he was punished, he expressed his fear of death, and the execution was delayed twice due to the offender's illness.<ref>http://www.odsouzeni.estranky.cz/clanky/co-prinesla-media/rozhovor-s-poslednim-ceskym-katem_-pred-popravou-rvacka_-po-ni-panak-rumu___.html</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nAccording to expert opinions in psychiatry, sexology and psychology, he was a primitive psychopath: an amoral, anabolic personality with schizoid features and aggressive tendencies. Criminal behavior was committed in uninterrupted consciousness and deliberately made it more difficult to reveal. He was able to hinder and correct his repeated actions. His attitude toward murders is indicative of insensitivity and brutality, the absence of at least additional sympathy, conscience or regret.\n\nThe reports showed that:\n\n 1. mental disorder was not detected\n 2. resocialization, even a long-term punishment, is not possible\n 3. protective treatment in a closed psychiatric institution is not proposed.\n\nA clear guideline for explaining Hojer's motives was his exclusively negative experience with women. He tried to establish the acquaintance by using an ad. A well-dressed woman arrived at the meeting, promising to get acquainted with a financially secure middle-aged man. Hojer repulsed her with his appearance, repulsed, and reproached so hard that she had left after a few minutes. It was much more promising for Hojer to become acquainted with the young woman he met at a party with his friends. She offered him sexual intercourse in the next room. It is likely that Hojer's panic has fallen as the woman has become active and moved away. He tossed it so hard that the door's glass filled through, and ran away from the apartment. Later, he learned that this girl, with a very bad reputation, spoke to his acquaintances with him. He was always very vulgar and contemptuous about women, but he was rather passive and uncertain in their presence. He did not know how to communicate with women, and he often imagined the scenes in which the helpless girl prayed for mercy.\n\nDuring the investigations and in particular reconstructions, Hojer built a special and almost friendly relationship with the criminalists. Chief Investigator Ji\u0159\u00ed Markovi\u010d even wanted to invite him to his home for a Sunday lunch. This idea was eventually summoned by his colleagues. When the Slovak murder was clarified, there was no company available, so Markovi\u010d had to play Hojer's game. Reconstructions were often very problematic because they were too much in the situation, and therefore the living folks were instead replaced by mannequins. In some reconstructions, the investigators met the threats of visiting citizens who demanded Hojer's release and [[lynching]]. Hojer did not understand their reaction, which clearly testifies to his inability to understand the seriousness of his crimes.\n\nAnother distinctive feature of Hojer's personality was a very dark sense of humor. One day, for example, he offered criminalists in the car that when he stops at two trackers they were passing by, he is \"wicked and killed\" to have a quick case. His remarkably primitive way of expression was remarkable. He used the turns like \"I took oxygen; I caught her behind my mouth; she remained in my hands; I did not care what drunk, especially that she had a good skeleton \", etc. He said rhythm as his motto: \"When my tail stands, my brain stops.\" The imminent death penalty did not allow himself until the last minute and even enjoyed his stay in custody. It was the first time in his life, when he became the focus of one's interest.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091207010348/http://www.policie-cr.cz/11-ladislav-hojer-brutalni-vrah-zen.html policie-cr.cz Article]\n* [http://kriminalistika.eu/muzeumzla/hojer/hojer.html kriminalistika.eu Article]\n* [http://xman.idnes.cz/xman-styl.aspx?c=A080409_164135_xman-novinky_fro Xman.cz Article]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hojer, Ladislav}}\n[[Category:1958 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak serial killers]]\n[[Category:Cannibals]]\n[[Category:Czechoslovak people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:People executed by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]\n[[Category:20th-century criminals]]\n[[Category:Executed serial killers]]\n", "name_user": "Haunted Spy", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislav_Hojer"}

The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have [[piston valve]]s, though some models with [[rotary valve]]s do exist.\n\nThe euphonium may be played in bass clef as a non-[[transposing instrument]] or in treble clef as a transposing instrument. In British brass bands, it is typically treated as a treble-clef instrument, while in American band music, parts may be written in either treble clef or bass clef, or both.\n\n== Name ==\nThe euphonium is in the family of [[brass instrument]]s, more particularly low-brass instruments with many relatives. It is extremely similar to a [[baritone horn]]. The difference is that the bore size of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the euphonium, and the baritone is a primarily cylindrical bore, whereas the euphonium is predominantly conical bore.<ref name=\"Euphonium\" /> It is controversial whether this is sufficient to make them two different instruments. In the trombone family large and small bore trombones are both called trombones, while the cylindrical [[trumpet]] and the conical [[flugelhorn]] are given different names. As with the trumpet and flugelhorn, the two instruments are easily doubled by one player, with some modification of breath and [[embouchure]], since the two have identical range and essentially identical fingering.<ref name=\"DW\">{{cite web| last = Werden| first = David| title = Euphonium, Baritone, or ???| url = http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm| accessdate = 2008-01-29| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212225121/http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm| archivedate = 12 February 2008| df = dmy-all}}</ref> The cylindrical baritone offers a brighter sound and the conical euphonium offers a more mellow sound.\n\nThe ''American baritone'', featuring three valves on the front of the instrument and a curved, forward-pointing bell, was dominant in American school bands throughout most of the 20th century, its weight, shape, and configuration conforming to the [[Marching instrument|needs of the marching band]]. While this instrument is a conical-cylindrical bore hybrid, somewhere between the classic baritone horn and euphonium, it was almost universally labelled a \"baritone\" by both band directors and composers, thus contributing to the confusion of terminology in the United States.\n\nSeveral late 19th century music catalogs (such as Pepper and Lyon & Healy) sold a euphonium-like instrument called the \"B{{music|flat}} bass\" (to distinguish it from the E{{music|flat}} and BB{{music|flat}} bass).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5-_7UCbLfDqTE1BNnNYTGNiQmM/edit|title=Lyon & Healy Catalog circa 1880}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horn-u-copia.net/books/L&H-1894.pdf|title=Lyon & Healy Catalog circa 1894|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407064700/http://www.horn-u-copia.net/books/L%26H-1894.pdf|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In these catalog drawings, the B{{music|flat}} Bass had thicker tubing than the baritone; both had three valves. Along the same lines, [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] introduced the \"Bass-baritone\", and distinguished it from the baritone. The thicker tubing of the three-valve B{{music|flat}} bass allowed for production of strong false-tones, providing chromatic access to the pedal register.\n\n[[Ferdinand Sommer]]'s original name for the instrument was the ''euphonion''.<ref name=\"Grove\">{{GroveOnline|title=Euphonium|author=Clifford Bevan|access-date=January 4, 2016}}</ref> It is sometimes called the tenor tuba in B{{music|flat}}, although this can also refer to other [[Tuba#Types and construction|varieties of tuba]]. Names in other languages, as included in scores, can be ambiguous as well. They include French ''basse'', ''saxhorn basse'', and ''tuba basse''; German ''Baryton'', ''Tenorbass'', and ''Tenorbasshorn''; Italian ''baritono'', ''bombardino'', ''eufonio'', and ''flicorno basso''.<ref name=\"Grove\"/> The most common German name, ''Baryton'', may have influenced Americans to adopt the name \"baritone\" for the instrument, due to the influx of German musicians to the United States in the nineteenth century.<ref name=\"Grove\" />\n\n== History and development ==\n[[File:Serpent groves.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], the oldest ancestor of all low brass instruments]]\n\nAs a baritone-voiced brass instrument, the euphonium traces its ancestry to the [[ophicleide]] and ultimately back to the [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]]. The search for a satisfactory foundational wind instrument that could support massed sound above its pitch took many years. While the serpent was used for over two centuries dating back to the late [[Renaissance]], it was notoriously difficult to control its pitch and tone quality due to its disproportionately small open finger holes. The ophicleide, which was used in bands and orchestras for a few decades in the early to mid-19th century, used a system of keys and was an improvement over the serpent but was still unreliable, especially in the high register.\n\nWith the invention of the piston valve system {{circa}} 1818, the construction of brass instruments with an even sound and facility of playing in all registers became possible. The euphonium is said to have been invented, as a \"wide-bore, valved bugle of baritone range\", by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar in 1843, though [[Carl Moritz]] in 1838 and [[Adolphe Sax]] in 1843 have also been credited.{{by whom|date=October 2019}} While Sax's family of [[saxhorn]]s were invented at about the same time and the bass saxhorn is very similar to a euphonium, there are also differences\u2014such as the bass saxhorn being narrower throughout the length of the instrument.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc984120/m2/1/high_res_d/KLEINSTEUBER-DISSERTATION-2017.pdf|title=AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE SAXHORN BASSE (FRENCH TUBA) IN THE MODERN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA|last=Kleinsteuber|first=Carl|date=May 2017|website=University of North Texas|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"British-style\" compensating euphonium was developed by [[David Blaikley]] in 1874, and has been in use in Britain with the basic construction little changed since then.\n\nModern day euphonium makers have been working to further enhance the construction of the euphonium. Companies such as [https://www.adams-music.com/shop/product/detail/?i=Adams+Euphonium&id=1EP0A&t=wf&lid=1033 Adams] and [http://www.besson.com/en/instruments/euphoniums/ Besson] have been leading the way in perfecting the instrument. Adams euphoniums have developed an adjustable lead pipe receiver which allows players to change the timbre of the instrument to whatever they find preferable. Besson has also been credited with the adjustable main tuning slide trigger, which allows players more flexibility with intonation.\n\n== Construction and general characteristics ==\nThe euphonium, like the tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B{{music|flat}}. For a valved brass instrument like the euphonium, this means that when no [[valve]]s are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B{{music|flat}} [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. It is generally orchestrated as a [[Transposing instrument|non-transposing instrument]] like the [[trombone]], written at [[concert pitch]] in the [[bass clef]] with higher passages in the [[tenor clef]]. [[Treble clef]] euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much [[concert band]] music:<ref group=\"note\">The major-ninth is transposition for the sake of trumpet players doubling on euphonium.</ref> in the [[Brass band (British style)|British-style brass band]] tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B{{music|flat}} transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.\n\nProfessional models have three top-action valves, played with the first three fingers of the right hand, plus a \"compensating\" fourth valve, generally found midway down the right side of the instrument, played with the left index finger; such an instrument is shown at the top of this page. Beginner models often have only the three top-action valves, while some intermediate \"student\" models may have a fourth top-action valve, played with the fourth finger of the right hand. Compensating systems are expensive to build, and there is in general a substantial difference in price between compensating and non-compensating models. For a thorough discussion of the valves and the compensation system, see the article on [[brass instruments]].\n\n[[File:EuphoniumAndTuba wb.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A euphonium (left) and tuba (right), the two lowest conical-bore instruments]]\n\nThe euphonium has an extensive range, comfortably from E<sub>2</sub> to about E{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> for intermediate players {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} (using [[scientific pitch notation]]). In professional hands this may extend from B<sub>0</sub> to as high as B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>. The lowest notes obtainable depend on the valve set-up of the instrument. All instruments are chromatic down to E<sub>2</sub>, but four-valved instruments extend that down to at least C<sub>2</sub>. Non-compensating four-valved instruments suffer from intonation problems from E{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> down to C<sub>2</sub> and cannot produce the low B<sub>1</sub>; compensating instruments do not have such intonation problems and can play the low B<sub>1</sub>.<ref group=\"note\">Thus, only on four-valved, compensating instruments is a full chromatic scale from the pedal range up possible.</ref> From B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> down lies the \"pedal range\", i.e., the fundamentals of the instrument's harmonic series. They are easily produced on the euphonium as compared to other brass instruments, and the extent of the range depends on the make of the instrument in exactly the same way as just described. Thus, on a compensating four-valved instrument, the lowest note possible is B<sub>0</sub>, sometimes called double pedal B, which is six ledger lines below the bass clef.\n\nAs with the other conical-bore instruments, the [[cornet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn|horn]], and [[tuba]], the euphonium's tubing (excepting the tubing in the valve section, which is necessarily cylindrical) gradually increases in diameter throughout its length, resulting in a softer, gentler tone compared to cylindrical-bore instruments such as the [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[sudrophone]], and [[baritone horn]]. While a truly characteristic euphonium sound is rather hard to define precisely, most players would agree that an ideal sound is dark, rich, warm, and velvety, with virtually no hardness to it. This also has to do with the different models preferred by British and American players.<ref name=\"Harvard Dictionary of Music\">{{Cite journal|last =Apel|first=Willi|year = 1969| title = Harvard Dictionary of Music|pages = 105\u2013110|place=Cambridge|publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1972.|postscript =<!-- None -->\n}}</ref>\n\nThough the euphonium's fingerings are no different from those of the trumpet or tuba, beginning euphoniumists will likely experience significant problems with intonation, response and range compared to other beginning brass players{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}. In addition, it is very difficult for students, even of high-school age, to develop the rich sound characteristic of the euphonium, due partly to the instrument models used in schools and partly to the lack of awareness of good euphonium sound models.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Types ==\n===Compensating===\nThe compensating euphonium is common among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The compensating valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming off of the back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E<sub>2</sub> down to B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.\n\n=== Double-bell ===\n{{Main|Double bell euphonium}}\n\nA creation unique to the United States was the [[Double bell euphonium|double-bell euphonium]], featuring a second smaller bell in addition to the main one; the player could switch bells for certain passages or even for individual notes by use of an additional valve, operated with the left hand. Ostensibly, the smaller bell was intended to emulate the sound of a trombone (it was cylindrical-bore) and was possibly intended for performance situations in which trombones were not available. The extent to which the difference in sound and timbre was apparent to the listener, however, is up for debate. ''Harry Whittier'' of the Patrick S. Gilmore band introduced the instrument in 1888, and it was used widely in both school and service bands for several decades. ''Harold Brasch'' (see \"List of important players\" below) brought the British-style compensating euphonium to the United States c. 1939, but the double-belled euphonium may have remained in common use even into the 1950s and 1960s. In any case, they have become rare (they were last in Conn's advertisements in the 1940s, and King's catalog in the 1960s),<ref>1963 H.N. White/King catalog (Baritone/Euphonium), {{cite web |url=http://www.hnwhite.com/Euphoniums%20and%20Baritones.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-20 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524063626/http://www.hnwhite.com/Euphoniums%20and%20Baritones.htm |archivedate=24 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and are generally unknown to younger players. They are chiefly known now through their mention in the song \"[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]\" from the musical ''[[The Music Man]]'' by [[Meredith Willson]].{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Marchingeuph.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[King Musical Instruments|King]] marching euphonium]]\n\n=== Marching ===\nA marching version of the euphonium may be found in a marching band, though it is often replaced by its smaller, easier-to-carry cousin, the [[Baritone horn#Marching Baritone Horn|marching baritone]] (which has a similar bell and valve configuration to a trumpet). Marching euphoniums are used by marching bands in schools, and in [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|Drum and Bugle Corps]], and some corps (such as the [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps|Blue Devils]] and [[Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps|Phantom Regiment]]) march all-euphonium sections rather than only marching Baritone or a mix of both. Depending on the manufacturer, the weight of these instruments can be straining to the average marcher and require great strength to hold during practices and performances, leading to nerve problems in the right pinky, a callus on the left hand, and possibly back and arm problems.\n\nAnother form of the marching euphonium is the convertible euphonium. Recently widely produced, the horn resembles a convertible tuba, being able to change from a concert upright to a marching forward bell on either the left or right shoulder. These are mainly produced by Jupiter or Yamaha, but other less expensive versions can be found.\n\n=== Five valves ===\nThe five-valve euphonium (noncompensating) is an extremely rare variation of the euphonium manufactured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Britain's [[Besson (music company)|Besson]] musical instrument company and Highams of Manchester Musical Instrument Company. \nHigham and Besson's ''Clearbore'' five-valve euphonium was economical but not widely used.<ref>Arnold Myers, in Trevor Herbert, ed., ''The British Brass Band: A Musical and Social History'' (Oxford, 2000), 179. {{ISBN|0191590126}}</ref>\n\nThe Besson five-valve euphonium featured the standard three [[piston valve]]s horizontally on top, but had an additional two piston valves off to the side. The standard euphonium has eight possible [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] and non-fingering positions by which sound is produced. The Besson and the Highams \"clearbore\" model rare fourth and fifth extra \"side\" valves change the possible fingering and non-fingering positions from eight to thirty-two.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe term 'five-valve euphonium' does not refer to variations of the [[double bell euphonium]] made by various brass instrument companies during the same time period.{{Weasel inline|date=April 2010}} Some of the double-bell euphoniums had five valves, with the fifth valve either on top with the other four, or by itself off to the side, but the double-bell fifth valve was used for switching the sound to the second smaller [[trombone]]-sized [[Wind instrument#Parts|bell]], and not for changing the fingering [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the instrument.

It has been called the \"king of band instruments\", or the \"[[cello]] of the band\", because of its similarity in timbre and ensemble role to the stringed instrument. Euphoniums are widely used in many [[march (music)|marches]] (such as those by [[John Philip Sousa]]), and in brass band music of the [[Music of the United Kingdom|British tradition]].\n\nOther ensembles including euphonium are the tuba-euphonium quartet or larger tuba-euphonium ensemble; the [[brass quintet]], where it can supply the tenor voice, though the trombone is much more common in this role; and other mixed brass ensemble. Such ensembles are almost non-existent: they are more likely to be semi-professional or amateur in nature. Most of the [[United States Armed Forces]] [[service bands]] include a tuba-euphonium quartet made up of players from the band that occasionally performs in its own right.\n\nThe euphonium is not traditionally an orchestral instrument and has not been common in symphony orchestras. However, there are a few works from the late Romantic period, in which composers wrote a part for ''tenor tuba'', all of which are played on the euphonium: most notably [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[Planets Suite]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Music|last=Latham|first=Alison|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0198662122|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198662129/page/435 435]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198662129/page/435}}</ref> and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' by [[Richard Strauss]]. In addition, the euphonium is sometimes used in older orchestral works as a replacement for its predecessors, such as the [[ophicleide]], or, less correctly, the bass trumpet or the [[Wagner tuba]], both of which are significantly different instruments, and still in use today.\n\nWhile the euphonium was not historically part of the standard jazz [[big band]] or combo, the instrument's technical facility and large range make it well-suited to a jazz solo role, and a jazz euphonium niche has been carved out over the last 40 or so years, largely starting with the pioneer [[Rich Matteson]] (see \"List of important players\" below). The euphonium can also double on a trombone part in a jazz combo. Jazz euphoniums are most likely to be found in tuba-euphonium groups, though modern [[funk]] or [[rock music|rock]] bands occasionally feature a brass player doubling on euphonium, and this trend is growing.\n\nDue to this dearth of performance opportunities, aspiring euphonium players in the United States are in a rather inconvenient position when seeking future employment. Often, college players must either obtain a graduate degree and go on to teach at the college level, or audition for one of the major or regional military service bands. Because these bands are relatively few in number and the number of euphonium positions in the bands is small (2\u20134 in most service bands), job openings do not occur very often and when they do are highly competitive; before the current slate of openings in four separate bands, the last opening for a euphonium player in an American service band was in May 2004. A career strictly as a solo performer, unaffiliated with any university or performing ensemble, is a very rare sight, but some performers, such as Riki McDonnell, have managed to do it.\n\nIn Britain, Australia and New Zealand the strongest euphonium players are most likely to find a position in a [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]], but even though they often play at world-class levels, the members of the top brass bands are in most cases unpaid amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} There are hundreds, if not thousands, of brass bands in Britain (and the Commonwealth) ranging in standard from world class to local bands. Even [[The Salvation Army]] has strong ties to the brass band world, as this was a common and practical musical genre in the 1800s. Almost all brass bands in Britain perform regularly, particularly during the summer months. A large number of bands also enter contests against other brass bands of a similar standard. Each band requires two euphoniums (principal and second) and consequently there are considerable opportunities for euphonium players.\n\nDue to limited vocational opportunities, there are a considerable number of relatively serious, quasi-professional avocational euphonium players participating in many higher-caliber unpaid ensembles. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n== College use in the United States ==\nUnlike a generation or two ago, many colleges with music programs now offer students the opportunity to major in euphonium. However, due to the small number of euphonium students at most schools (2\u20134 is common{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}), it is possible, and even likely, that they will study with a professor whose major instrument is not the euphonium. Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.\n\n== Notable euphonists ==\n{{Main|List of euphonium players}}\n\nThe euphonium world is and has become more crowded than is commonly thought, and there have been many noteworthy players throughout the instrument's history. Traditionally, three main national schools of euphonium playing have been discernible: American, British, and Japanese. Now, euphoniumists are able to learn this specific art in many other countries around the world today.\n\nGerman Ferdinand Sommer, if one discounts the claims of Moritz and Sax each of whose horns also approached a euphonium in nature, in addition to being credited with inventing the euphonium as the Sommerhorn in 1843, as a soloist on the horn, qualifies as the first euphonium player to significantly advance and alter the understanding of the instrument.<ref>Baritone History, North Dakota State University, at {{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221235020/http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} retrieved 10/15/2011</ref><ref>Bone, Lloyd E., The Euphonium Sourcebook, University of Indiana Press, 2007 edition, P.7</ref> Below are a select few of the players most famous and influential in their respective countries, and whose contributions to the euphonium world are undeniable, in terms of recordings, commissions, pedagogy, and increased recognition of the instrument.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n* [[Alfred James Phasey]] (1834\u20131888), English ophicleide, baritone and euphonium artist credited with modifying the bore of the baritone [[saxhorn]], precursor of the [[baritone horn]], to enlarge it and make it more resonant thereby creating the first true euphonium which he went on to popularize as a performer and author of an early instructional method for tenor brass.<ref>Bouldersdome, H.

Since its invention in 1843, the euphonium has always had an important role in ensembles, but solo literature was slow to appear, consisting of only a handful of lighter solos until the 1960s. Since then, however, the breadth and depth of the solo euphonium repertoire has increased dramatically.\n\nIn the current age, there has been a huge number of new commissions and repertoire development and promotion through Steven Mead's World of the Euphonium Series and the Beyond the Horizon series from Euphonium.com. There has also been a vast number of new commissions by more and more players and a proliferation of large scale Consortium Commissions that are occurring including current ones in 2008 and 2009 organized by Brian Meixner (Libby Larson), Adam Frey (The Euphonium Foundation Consortium), and Jason Ham (David Gillingham).\n\n[[File:Amilcareponchielli.jpg|thumb|right|187px|[[Amilcare Ponchielli]], composer of the first original euphonium solo]]\n\nUpon its invention, it was clear that the euphonium had, compared to its predecessors the serpent and ophicleide, a wide range and had a consistently rich, pleasing sound throughout that range. It was flexible both in tone quality and intonation and could blend well with a variety of ensembles, gaining it immediate popularity with composers and conductors as the principal tenor-voices solo instrument in [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] settings, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is no surprise, then, that when British composers \u2013 some of the same ones who were writing for brass bands \u2013 began to write serious, original music for the concert band in the early 20th century, they used the euphonium in a very similar role.\n\nWhen American composers also began writing for the concert band as its own artistic medium in the 1930s and 1940s, they continued the British brass and concert band tradition of using the euphonium as the principal tenor-voiced solo.\nThis is not to say that composers, then and now, valued the euphonium only for its lyrical capabilities. Indeed, examination of a large body of concert band literature reveals that the euphonium functions as a \"jack of all trades.\"\n\nThough the euphonium was, as previously noted, embraced from its earliest days by composers and arrangers in band settings, orchestral composers have, by and large, not taken advantage of this capability. There are, nevertheless, several orchestral works, a few of which are standard repertoire, in which composers have called for instruments, such as the Wagner tuba, for which euphonium is commonly substituted in the present.\n\nIn contrast to the long-standing practice of extensive euphonium use in wind bands and orchestras, there was, until approximately forty years ago, literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the euphonium, and euphoniumists were forced to borrow the literature of other instruments. Fortunately, given the instrument's multifaceted capabilities discussed above, solos for many different instruments are easily adaptable to performance on the euphonium.\n\nThe earliest surviving solo composition written specifically for euphonium or one of its saxhorn cousins is the ''Concerto per Flicorno Basso'' (1872) by Amilcare Ponchielli. For almost a century after this, the euphonium solo repertoire consisted of only a dozen or so virtuosic pieces, mostly light in character. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, American composers began to write the first of the \"new school\" of serious, artistic solo works specifically for euphonium. Since then, there has been a virtual explosion of solo repertoire for the euphonium. In a mere four decades, the solo literature has expanded from virtually zero to thousands of pieces. More and more composers have become aware of the tremendous soloistic capabilities of the euphonium, and have constantly \"pushed the envelope\" with new literature in terms of tessitura, endurance, technical demands, and extended techniques.\n\nFinally, the euphonium has, thanks to a handful of enterprising individuals, begun to make inroads in jazz, pop and other non-concert performance settings.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[William Bell (tuba player)]]\n* [[Baritone and Euphonium Manufacturers]]\n\n==References==\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051030200338/http://www.lowbrassnmore.com/euponiumhistory.htm Retrieved on 28 January 2008]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051217074115/http://nikknakks.net/Euphonium/ Retrieved on 28 January 2008]\n* [http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2198574/HISTORY-OF-THE-BARITONE-AND-THE-EUPHONIUM]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[doi:10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.L2274882|Weston, Stephen. 2015 \"Bass-Euphonium.\" ''Grove Music Online.'' 13 Sep. 2018.]] (by subscription)\n*[http://www.euphonium.com Euphonium.com] Focused on the IEI, new repertoire, a forum for the euphonium, and the activities of Adam Frey.\n* [http://www.euphonium.net/ Euphonium.net] Steven Mead's personal website.\n* [http://www.iteaonline.org/ The International Tuba-Euphonium Association], a professional organization for tubists and euphonists.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050921203827/http://www.tubanews.com/ Tuba News], a free monthly online publication for tuba and euphonium players.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071209063310/http://www.tubaeuphoniumpress.com/ Tuba-Euphonium Press], publishing house for new euphonium and tuba music.\n* [http://www.brass-forum.co.uk Brass-Forum.co.uk], a UK-based brass discussion forum.\n* [http://www.dwerden.com/talk/forum/ Tuba-Euphonium Forum], a discussion forum for euphonium and tuba.\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/brassacoustics.html Acoustics of Brass Instruments] from [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music Music Acoustics] at the University of New South Wales.\n* [http://www.olemiss.edu/lowbrass/lowbrassmethods/charts/euphoniumbcfingering.pdf Euphonium fingering chart] \n* [http://www.dwerden.com/emg/ Euphonium Music Guide] A list of original euphonium literature.\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Euphonium}}\n{{Musical instruments |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Bass (sound)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Brass instruments]]\n[[Category:B-flat instruments]]\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:Horns]]\n[[Category:German musical instruments]]\n[[Category:English musical instruments]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\n{{Infobox instrument\n| name=Euphonium\n| image=Euphonium Boosey and hawkes.jpg\n| image_capt\n| background=brass\n| classification=[[Wind instrument|Wind]],\n[[Brass instrument|brass]]\n[[Aerophone]]\n| hornbostel_sachs=423.232\n| hornbostel_sachs_desc=Valved [[aerophone]] sounded by lip movement\n| developed=1840s from the [[ophicleide]]\n|range={{Plain image with caption|Range bassoon.svg|(A<sub>1</sub>) '''B{{music|b}}<sub>1</sub>\u2013E<sub>5</sub>''' (A<sub>5</sub>)|210px|center|bottom}}<!--THE EUPHONIUM HAS AN IDENTICAL RANGE TO THE BASSOON, FOR MOST EXPERIENCED PLAYERS-->\nThis image represents the range for the instrument as it is commonly played.\n| related=\n* [[Saxhorn]]s\n** [[Flugelhorn]]\n** [[Alto horn]]\n** [[Baritone horn]]\n** [[Mellophone]]\n* [[Ophicleide]]\n* [[Tuba]]}}\n{{Brass}}\n\nThe '''euphonium''' is a medium-sized, 3 or 4-valve, often compensating, [[Bore (wind instruments)|conical-bore]], [[tenor]]-voiced [[brass instrument]] that derives its name from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f54\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2}} ''euph\u014dnos'',<ref name=\"Euphonium\">{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphonium|title=Euphonium|dictionary=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=2012-05-26|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130131090408/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/euphonium|archivedate=31 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> meaning \"well-sounding\" or \"sweet-voiced\" ({{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f56}} ''eu'' means \"well\" or \"good\" and {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03c9\u03bd\u03ae}} ''ph\u014dn\u0113'' means \"sound\", hence \"of good sound\"). The euphonium is a valved instrument. Nearly all current models have [[piston valve]]s, though some models with [[rotary valve]]s do exist. \n\nThe euphonium may be played in bass clef as a non-[[transposing instrument]] or in treble clef as a transposing instrument. In British brass bands, it is typically treated as a treble-clef instrument, while in American band music, parts may be written in either treble clef or bass clef, or both.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe euphonium is in the family of [[Brass instrument|brass instruments]], more particularly low-brass instruments with many relatives. It is extremely similar to a [[baritone horn]]. The difference is that the bore size of the baritone horn is typically smaller than that of the euphonium, and the baritone is a primarily cylindrical bore, whereas the euphonium is predominantly conical bore<ref name=\"Euphonium\" />. It is controversial whether this is sufficient to make them two different instruments. In the trombone family large and small bore trombones are both called trombones, while the cylindrical [[trumpet]] and the conical [[flugelhorn]] are given different names.  As with the trumpet and flugelhorn, the two instruments are easily doubled by one player, with some modification of breath and [[embouchure]], since the two have identical range and essentially identical fingering.<ref name=\"DW\">{{cite web| last = Werden| first = David| title = Euphonium, Baritone, or ???| url = http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm| accessdate = 2008-01-29| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080212225121/http://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-bareuph.cfm| archivedate = 12 February 2008| df = dmy-all}}</ref> The cylindrical baritone offers a brighter sound and the conical euphonium offers a more mellow sound.\n\nThe ''American baritone'', featuring three valves on the front of the instrument and a curved, forward-pointing bell, was dominant in American school bands throughout most of the 20th century, its weight, shape, and configuration conforming to the [[Marching instrument|needs of the marching band]].  While this instrument is a conical-cylindrical bore hybrid, somewhere between the classic baritone horn and euphonium, it was almost universally labelled a \"baritone\" by both band directors and composers, thus contributing to the confusion of terminology in the United States.\n\nSeveral late 19th century music catalogs (such as Pepper and Lyon & Healy) sold a euphonium-like instrument called the \"B{{music|flat}} bass\" (to distinguish it from the E{{music|flat}} and BB{{music|flat}} bass).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5-_7UCbLfDqTE1BNnNYTGNiQmM/edit|title=Lyon & Healy Catalog circa 1880}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horn-u-copia.net/books/L&H-1894.pdf|title=Lyon & Healy Catalog circa 1894|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407064700/http://www.horn-u-copia.net/books/L%26H-1894.pdf|archivedate=7 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In these catalog drawings, the B{{music|flat}} Bass had thicker tubing than the baritone; both had three valves.

The search for a satisfactory foundational wind instrument that could support massed sound above its pitch took many years.  While the serpent was used for over two centuries dating back to the late [[Renaissance]], it was notoriously difficult to control its pitch and tone quality due to its disproportionately small open finger holes.  The ophicleide, which was used in bands and orchestras for a few decades in the early to mid-19th century, used a system of keys and was an improvement over the serpent but was still unreliable, especially in the high register.\n\nWith the invention of the piston valve system {{circa}} 1818, the construction of brass instruments with an even sound and facility of playing in all registers became possible.  The euphonium is said to have been invented, as a \"wide-bore, valved bugle of baritone range\", by Ferdinand Sommer of Weimar in 1843, though [[Carl Moritz]] in 1838 and [[Adolphe Sax]] in 1843 have also been credited.{{by whom|date=October 2019}}  While Sax's family of [[saxhorn]]s were invented at about the same time and the bass saxhorn is very similar to a euphonium, there are also differences\u2014such as the bass saxhorn being narrower throughout the length of the instrument.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc984120/m2/1/high_res_d/KLEINSTEUBER-DISSERTATION-2017.pdf|title=AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE SAXHORN BASSE (FRENCH TUBA) IN THE MODERN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA|last=Kleinsteuber|first=Carl|date=May 2017|website=University of North Texas|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe \"British-style\" compensating euphonium was developed by [[David Blaikley]] in 1874, and has been in use in Britain with the basic construction little changed since then.\n\nModern day euphonium makers have been working to further enhance the construction of the euphonium. Companies such as [https://www.adams-music.com/shop/product/detail/?i=Adams+Euphonium&id=1EP0A&t=wf&lid=1033 Adams] and [http://www.besson.com/en/instruments/euphoniums/ Besson] have been leading the way in perfecting the instrument. Adams euphoniums have developed an adjustable lead pipe receiver which allows players to change the timbre of the instrument to whatever they find preferable. Besson has also been credited with the adjustable main tuning slide trigger, which allows players more flexibility with intonation.\n\n== Construction and general characteristics ==\n\nThe euphonium, like the tenor trombone, is pitched in concert B{{music|flat}}. For a valved brass instrument like the euphonium, this means that when no [[valve]]s are in use the instrument will produce partials of the B{{music|flat}} [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. It is generally orchestrated as a [[Transposing instrument|non-transposing instrument]] like the [[trombone]], written at [[concert pitch]] in the [[bass clef]] with higher passages in the [[tenor clef]]. [[Treble clef]] euphonium parts transposing down a major ninth are included in much [[concert band]] music:<ref group=\"note\">The major-ninth is transposition for the sake of trumpet players doubling on euphonium.</ref> in the [[Brass band (British style)|British-style brass band]] tradition, euphonium music is always written this way. In continental European band music, parts for the euphonium may be written in the bass clef as a B{{music|flat}} transposing instrument sounding a major second lower than written.\n\nProfessional models have three top-action valves, played with the first three fingers of the right hand, plus a \"compensating\" fourth valve, generally found midway down the right side of the instrument, played with the left index finger; such an instrument is shown at the top of this page.  Beginner models often have only the three top-action valves, while some intermediate \"student\" models may have a fourth top-action valve, played with the fourth finger of the right hand.  Compensating systems are expensive to build, and there is in general a substantial difference in price between compensating and non-compensating models.  For a thorough discussion of the valves and the compensation system, see the article on [[brass instruments]].\n\n[[File:EuphoniumAndTuba wb.jpg|thumb|left|225px|A euphonium (left) and tuba (right), the two lowest conical-bore instruments]]\n\nThe euphonium has an extensive range, comfortably from E<sub>2</sub> to about E{{music|flat}}<sub>4</sub> for intermediate players {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} (using [[scientific pitch notation]]).  In professional hands this may extend from B<sub>0</sub> to as high as B{{music|flat}}<sub>5</sub>.  The lowest notes obtainable depend on the valve set-up of the instrument. All instruments are chromatic down to E<sub>2</sub>, but four-valved instruments extend that down to at least C<sub>2</sub>.  Non-compensating four-valved instruments suffer from intonation problems from E{{music|flat}}<sub>2</sub> down to C<sub>2</sub> and cannot produce the low B<sub>1</sub>; compensating instruments do not have such intonation problems and can play the low B<sub>1</sub>.<ref group=\"note\">Thus, only on four-valved, compensating instruments is a full chromatic scale from the pedal range up possible.</ref> From B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub> down lies the \"pedal range\", i.e., the fundamentals of the instrument's harmonic series.  They are easily produced on the euphonium as compared to other brass instruments, and the extent of the range depends on the make of the instrument in exactly the same way as just described.  Thus, on a compensating four-valved instrument, the lowest note possible is B<sub>0</sub>, sometimes called double pedal B, which is six ledger lines below the bass clef.\n\nAs with the other conical-bore instruments, the [[cornet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn|horn]], and [[tuba]], the euphonium's tubing (excepting the tubing in the valve section, which is necessarily cylindrical) gradually increases in diameter throughout its length, resulting in a softer, gentler tone compared to cylindrical-bore instruments such as the [[trumpet]], [[trombone]], [[sudrophone]], and [[baritone horn]].  While a truly characteristic euphonium sound is rather hard to define precisely, most players would agree that an ideal sound is dark, rich, warm, and velvety, with virtually no hardness to it. This also has to do with the different models preferred by British and American players.<ref name=\"Harvard Dictionary of Music\">{{Cite journal|last =Apel|first=Willi|year = 1969| title = Harvard Dictionary of Music|pages = 105\u2013110|place=Cambridge|publisher = Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1972.|postscript =<!-- None -->\n}}</ref>\n\nThough the euphonium's fingerings are no different from those of the trumpet or tuba, beginning euphoniumists will likely experience significant problems with intonation, response and range compared to other beginning brass players{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}.  In addition, it is very difficult for students, even of high-school age, to develop the rich sound characteristic of the euphonium, due partly to the instrument models used in schools and partly to the lack of awareness of good euphonium sound models.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n== Types ==\n\n===Compensating===\n\nThe compensating euphonium is common among professionals. It utilizes a three-plus-one-valve system with three upright valves and one side valve. The compensating valve system uses extra tubing, usually coming off of the back of the three upright valves, in order to achieve proper intonation in the lower range of the instrument. This range being from E<sub>2</sub> down to B{{music|flat}}<sub>1</sub>. Not all four-valve and three-plus-one-valve euphoniums are compensating. Only those designed with extra tubing are compensating. There were, at one time, three-valve compensating euphoniums available. This configuration utilized extra tubing, just as the three-plus-one compensating models did, in order to bring the notes C<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> in tune. This three-valve compensating configuration is still available in British style baritone horns, usually on professional models.\n\n=== Double-bell ===\n{{Main article|Double bell euphonium}}\n\nA creation unique to the United States was the [[Double bell euphonium|double-bell euphonium]], featuring a second smaller bell in addition to the main one; the player could switch bells for certain passages or even for individual notes by use of an additional valve, operated with the left hand.  Ostensibly, the smaller bell was intended to emulate the sound of a trombone (it was cylindrical-bore) and was possibly intended for performance situations in which trombones were not available.  The extent to which the difference in sound and timbre was apparent to the listener, however, is up for debate.  ''Harry Whittier'' of the Patrick S. Gilmore band introduced the instrument in 1888, and it was used widely in both school and service bands for several decades.  ''Harold Brasch'' (see \"List of important players\" below) brought the British-style compensating euphonium to the United States c. 1939, but the double-belled euphonium may have remained in common use even into the 1950s and 1960s.  In any case, they have become rare (they were last in Conn's advertisements in the 1940s, and King's catalog in the 1960s),<ref>1963 H.N.

They are chiefly known now through their mention in the song \"[[Seventy-Six Trombones]]\" from the musical ''[[The Music Man]]'' by [[Meredith Willson]].{{clear left}}\n\n[[File:Marchingeuph.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[King Musical Instruments|King]] marching euphonium]]\n\n=== Marching ===\n\nA marching version of the euphonium may be found in a marching band, though it is often replaced by its smaller, easier-to-carry cousin, the [[Baritone horn#Marching Baritone Horn|marching baritone]] (which has a similar bell and valve configuration to a trumpet). Marching euphoniums are used by marching bands in schools, and in [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|Drum and Bugle Corps]], and some corps (such as the [[Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps|Blue Devils]] and [[Phantom Regiment Drum and Bugle Corps|Phantom Regiment]]) march all-euphonium sections rather than only marching Baritone or a mix of both. Depending on the manufacturer, the weight of these instruments can be straining to the average marcher and require great strength to hold during practices and performances, leading to nerve problems in the right pinky, a callus on the left hand, and possibly back and arm problems.\n\nAnother form of the marching euphonium is the convertible euphonium. Recently widely produced, the horn resembles a convertible tuba, being able to change from a concert upright to a marching forward bell on either the left or right shoulder. These are mainly produced by Jupiter or Yamaha, but other less expensive versions can be found.\n\n=== Five valves ===\nThe five-valve euphonium (noncompensating) is an extremely rare variation of the euphonium manufactured in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by Britain's [[Besson (music company)|Besson]] musical instrument company and Highams of Manchester Musical Instrument Company. \nHigham and Besson's ''Clearbore'' five-valve euphonium was economical but not widely-used.<ref>Arnold Myers, in Trevor Herbert, ed., ''The British Brass Band: A Musical and Social History'' (Oxford, 2000), 179. {{ISBN|0191590126}}</ref>\n\nThe Besson five-valve euphonium featured the standard three [[piston valve]]s horizontally on top, but had an additional two piston valves off to the side. The standard euphonium has eight possible [[Fingering (music)|fingering]] and non-fingering positions by which sound is produced. The Besson and the Highams \"clearbore\" model rare fourth and fifth extra \"side\" valves change the possible fingering and non-fingering positions from eight to thirty-two.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\nThe term 'five-valve euphonium' does not refer to variations of the [[double bell euphonium]] made by various brass instrument companies during the same time period.{{Weasel inline|date=April 2010}} Some of the double-bell euphoniums had five valves, with the fifth valve either on top with the other four, or by itself off to the side, but the double-bell fifth valve was used for switching the sound to the second smaller [[trombone]]-sized [[Wind instrument#Parts|bell]], and not for changing the fingering [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] of the instrument. Also, {{Interlanguage link multi|V\u00e1clav Franti\u0161ek \u010cerven\u00fd|cs|3=V\u00e1clav Franti\u0161ek \u010cerven\u00fd|lt=Cerveny}} Musical Instruments manufactures several euphoniums with five vertical [[rotary valve]]s today, but this is an unrelated recent development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n== The euphonium in ensembles and professional job opportunities ==\n{{Main article|Euphonium repertoire}}\n{{Tone|section|date=February 2019}}\n\nEuphonium has historically been exclusively a ''band'' instrument (rather than an ''orchestra'' or ''jazz'' instrument), whether of the ''wind'' or ''brass'' variety, where it is frequently featured as a solo instrument. It has been called the \"king of band instruments\", or the \"[[cello]] of the band\", because of its similarity in timbre and ensemble role to the stringed instrument. Euphoniums are widely used in many [[march (music)|marches]] (such as those by [[John Philip Sousa]]), and in brass band music of the [[Music of the United Kingdom|British tradition]].\n\nOther ensembles including euphonium are the tuba-euphonium quartet or larger tuba-euphonium ensemble; the [[brass quintet]], where it can supply the tenor voice, though the trombone is much more common in this role; and other mixed brass ensemble. Such ensembles are almost non-existent: they are more likely to be semi-professional or amateur in nature.  Most of the [[United States Armed Forces]] [[service bands]] include a tuba-euphonium quartet made up of players from the band that occasionally performs in its own right.\n\nThe euphonium is not traditionally an orchestral instrument and has not been common in symphony orchestras. However, there are a few works from the late Romantic period, in which composers wrote a part for ''tenor tuba'', all of which are played on the euphonium: most notably [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[Planets Suite]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Music|last=Latham|first=Alison|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0198662122|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198662129/page/435 435]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780198662129/page/435}}</ref> and ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]'' by [[Richard Strauss]]. In addition, the euphonium is sometimes used in older orchestral works as a replacement for its predecessors, such as the [[ophicleide]], or, less correctly, the bass trumpet or the [[Wagner tuba]], both of which are significantly different instruments, and still in use today.\n\nWhile the euphonium was not historically part of the standard jazz [[big band]] or combo, the instrument's technical facility and large range make it well-suited to a jazz solo role, and a jazz euphonium niche has been carved out over the last 40 or so years, largely starting with the pioneer [[Rich Matteson]] (see \"List of important players\" below).  The euphonium can also double on a trombone part in a jazz combo. Jazz euphoniums are most likely to be found in tuba-euphonium groups, though modern [[funk]] or [[rock music|rock]] bands occasionally feature a brass player doubling on euphonium, and this trend is growing.\n\nDue to this dearth of performance opportunities, aspiring euphonium players in the United States are in a rather inconvenient position when seeking future employment.  Often, college players must either obtain a graduate degree and go on to teach at the college level, or audition for one of the major or regional military service bands. Because these bands are relatively few in number and the number of euphonium positions in the bands is small (2\u20134 in most service bands), job openings do not occur very often and when they do are highly competitive; before the current slate of openings in four separate bands, the last opening for a euphonium player in an American service band was in May 2004. A career strictly as a solo performer, unaffiliated with any university or performing ensemble, is a very rare sight, but some performers, such as Riki McDonnell, have managed to do it.\n\nIn Britain, Australia and New Zealand the strongest euphonium players are most likely to find a position in a [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]], but even though they often play at world-class levels, the members of the top brass bands are in most cases unpaid amateurs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} There are hundreds, if not thousands, of brass bands in Britain (and the Commonwealth) ranging in standard from world class to local bands. Even [[The Salvation Army]] has strong ties to the brass band world, as this was a common and practical musical genre in the 1800s.  Almost all brass bands in Britain perform regularly, particularly during the summer months. A large number of bands also enter contests against other brass bands of a similar standard. Each band requires two euphoniums (principal and second) and consequently there are considerable opportunities for euphonium players.\n\nDue to limited vocational opportunities, there are a considerable number of relatively serious, quasi-professional avocational euphonium players participating in many higher-caliber unpaid ensembles. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\n== College use in the United States ==\nUnlike a generation or two ago, many colleges with music programs now offer students the opportunity to major in euphonium.  However, due to the small number of euphonium students at most schools (2\u20134 is common{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}), it is possible, and even likely, that they will study with a professor whose major instrument is not the euphonium.  Most often tubas and euphoniums will be combined into a studio taught by one professor, and at small schools they may be grouped with trombones and/or French horns as well, taught by one low brass professor. Universities will usually require professors in this situation to have a high level of proficiency on all the instruments they teach, and some of the best college euphonium studios are taught by non-euphonium players.\n\n== Notable euphonists ==\n{{Main article|List of euphonium players}}\n\nThe euphonium world is and has become more crowded than is commonly thought, and there have been many noteworthy players throughout the instrument's history.  Traditionally, three main national schools of euphonium playing have been discernible: American, British, and Japanese.  Now, euphoniumists are able to learn this specific art in many other countries around the world today.\n\nGerman Ferdinand Sommer, if one discounts the claims of Moritz and Sax each of whose horns also approached a euphonium in nature, in addition to being credited with inventing the euphonium as the Sommerhorn in 1843, as a soloist on the horn, qualifies as the first euphonium player to significantly advance and alter the understanding of the instrument.<ref>Baritone History, North Dakota State University, at {{cite web |url=http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221235020/http://www.nd.edu/~baritone/history.html |archivedate=21 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }} retrieved 10/15/2011</ref><ref>Bone, Lloyd E., The Euphonium Sourcebook, University of Indiana Press, 2007 edition, P.7</ref> Below are a select few of the players most famous and influential in their respective countries, and whose contributions to the euphonium world are undeniable, in terms of recordings, commissions, pedagogy, and increased recognition of the instrument.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n* [[Alfred James Phasey]] (1834\u20131888), English ophicleide, baritone and euphonium artist credited with modifying the bore of the baritone [[saxhorn]], precursor of the [[baritone horn]], to enlarge it and make it more resonant thereby creating the first true euphonium which he went on to popularize as a performer and author of an early instructional method for tenor brass.<ref>Bouldersdome, H.

Since its invention in 1843, the euphonium has always had an important role in ensembles, but solo literature was slow to appear, consisting of only a handful of lighter solos until the 1960's.  Since then, however, the breadth and depth of the solo euphonium repertoire has increased dramatically.\n\nIn the current age, there has been a huge number of new commissions and repertoire development and promotion through Steven Mead's World of the Euphonium Series and the Beyond the Horizon series from Euphonium.com.   There has also been a vast number of new commissions by more and more players and a proliferation of large scale Consortium Commissions that are occurring including current ones in 2008 and 2009 organized by Brian Meixner (Libby Larson), Adam Frey (The Euphonium Foundation Consortium), and Jason Ham (David Gillingham).\n\n[[File:Amilcareponchielli.jpg|thumb|right|187px|[[Amilcare Ponchielli]], composer of the first original euphonium solo]]\n\nUpon its invention, it was clear that the euphonium had, compared to its predecessors the serpent and ophicleide, a wide range and had a consistently rich, pleasing sound throughout that range.  It was flexible both in tone quality and intonation and could blend well with a variety of ensembles, gaining it immediate popularity with composers and conductors as the principal tenor-voices solo instrument in [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]] settings, especially in [[United Kingdom|Britain]].  It is no surprise, then, that when British composers \u2013 some of the same ones who were writing for brass bands \u2013 began to write serious, original music for the concert band in the early 20th century, they used the euphonium in a very similar role.\n\nWhen American composers also began writing for the concert band as its own artistic medium in the 1930s and 1940s, they continued the British brass and concert band tradition of using the euphonium as the principal tenor-voiced solo.\nThis is not to say that composers, then and now, valued the euphonium only for its lyrical capabilities.  Indeed, examination of a large body of concert band literature reveals that the euphonium functions as a \"jack of all trades.\"\n\nThough the euphonium was, as previously noted, embraced from its earliest days by composers and arrangers in band settings, orchestral composers have, by and large, not taken advantage of this capability.  There are, nevertheless, several orchestral works, a few of which are standard repertoire, in which composers have called for instruments, such as the Wagner tuba, for which euphonium is commonly substituted in the present.\n\nIn contrast to the long-standing practice of extensive euphonium use in wind bands and orchestras, there was, until approximately forty years ago, literally no body of solo literature written specifically for the euphonium, and euphoniumists were forced to borrow the literature of other instruments. Fortunately, given the instrument's multifaceted capabilities discussed above, solos for many different instruments are easily adaptable to performance on the euphonium.\n\nThe earliest surviving solo composition written specifically for euphonium or one of its saxhorn cousins is the ''Concerto per Flicorno Basso'' (1872) by Amilcare Ponchielli.  For almost a century after this, the euphonium solo repertoire consisted of only a dozen or so virtuosic pieces, mostly light in character.  However, in the 1960s and 1970s, American composers began to write the first of the \"new school\" of serious, artistic solo works specifically for euphonium.  Since then, there has been a virtual explosion of solo repertoire for the euphonium.  In a mere four decades, the solo literature has expanded from virtually zero to thousands of pieces.  More and more composers have become aware of the tremendous soloistic capabilities of the euphonium, and have constantly \"pushed the envelope\" with new literature in terms of tessitura, endurance, technical demands, and extended techniques.\n\nFinally, the euphonium has, thanks to a handful of enterprising individuals, begun to make inroads in jazz, pop and other non-concert performance settings.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[William Bell (tuba player)]]\n* [[Baritone and Euphonium Manufacturers]]\n\n==References==\n===Explanatory notes===\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n* https://web.archive.org/web/20051030200338/http://www.lowbrassnmore.com/euponiumhistory.htmRetrieved on 28 January 2008 \n* https://web.archive.org/web/20051217074115/http://nikknakks.net/Euphonium/Retrieved on 28 January 2008 \n* http://www.docstoc.com/docs/2198574/HISTORY-OF-THE-BARITONE-AND-THE-EUPHONIUM\n*\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[[doi:10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.L2274882|Weston, Stephen. 2015 \"Bass-Euphonium.\" ''Grove Music Online.'' 13 Sep. 2018.]] (by subscription)\n*[http://www.euphonium.com Euphonium.com] Focused on the IEI, new repertoire, a forum for the euphonium, and the activities of Adam Frey.\n* [http://www.euphonium.net/ Euphonium.net] Steven Mead's personal website.\n* [http://www.iteaonline.org/ The International Tuba-Euphonium Association], a professional organization for tubists and euphonists.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050921203827/http://www.tubanews.com/ Tuba News], a free monthly online publication for tuba and euphonium players.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071209063310/http://www.tubaeuphoniumpress.com/ Tuba-Euphonium Press], publishing house for new euphonium and tuba music.\n* [http://www.brass-forum.co.uk Brass-Forum.co.uk], a UK-based brass discussion forum.\n* [http://www.dwerden.com/talk/forum/ Tuba-Euphonium Forum], a discussion forum for euphonium and tuba.\n* [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~jw/brassacoustics.html Acoustics of Brass Instruments] from [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music Music Acoustics] at the University of New South Wales.\n* [http://www.olemiss.edu/lowbrass/lowbrassmethods/charts/euphoniumbcfingering.pdf Euphonium fingering chart] \n* [http://www.dwerden.com/emg/ Euphonium Music Guide] A list of original euphonium literature.\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Euphonium}}\n{{Musical instruments |state=autocollapse}}\n{{Bass (sound)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Brass instruments]]\n[[Category:B-flat instruments]]\n[[Category:United States Marine Corps]]\n[[Category:Horns]]\n[[Category:German musical instruments]]\n[[Category:English musical instruments]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: widely- \u2192 widely , 1960's \u2192 1960s", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphonium"}

This assembly adopted the [[Constitution of Ethiopia|constitution of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] in December 1994. The elections for Ethiopia's first popularly chosen national parliament and regional legislatures were held in May and June 1995. Most opposition parties chose to boycott these elections. There was a landslide victory for the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF). International and non-governmental observers concluded that opposition parties would have been able to participate had they chosen to do so.\nThe current government of Ethiopia was installed in August 1995. The first President was [[Negasso Gidada]]. The EPRDF-led government of Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]] promoted a policy of [[ethnic federalism]], devolving significant powers to regional, ethnically based authorities. Ethiopia today has nine semi-autonomous administrative regions that have the power to raise and spend their own revenues.

The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Region or city (\u12ad\u120d\u120d/\u12e8\u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12f3\u12f5\u122d)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Capital\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Area {{smaller|{{nobold|(km<sup>2</sup>)}}}}\n! colspan=\"4\" | Population<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/Central |title=Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2005\u20132013 |accessdate=2 May 2017 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September.

The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970\u20131983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture.

Currently, the maternal mortality rate stands at 420 per 100,000 live births.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Only a minority of Ethiopians are born in hospitals, while most are born in rural households. Those who are expected to give birth at home have elderly women serve as midwives who assist with the delivery (Kater, 2000).

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\n\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour.

In 2018 Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on state TV: \"We built one of the strongest ground and air force in Africa{{nbsp}}... we should build our naval force capacity in the future.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-44369382|title=Why landlocked Ethiopia wants to launch a navy|last=Olewe|first=Dickens|date=14 June 2018|access-date=7 July 2019|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Ethiopia|Regions of Ethiopia|List of zones of Ethiopia|Districts of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Map of zones of Ethiopia.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Ethiopia's [[Regions of Ethiopia|regions]] and [[list of zones of Ethiopia|zones]]]]\n\nBefore 1996, Ethiopia was divided into thirteen [[Provinces of Ethiopia|provinces]], many derived from historical regions. The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Region or city (\u12ad\u120d\u120d/\u12e8\u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12f3\u12f5\u122d)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Capital\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Area {{smaller|{{nobold|(km<sup>2</sup>)}}}}\n! colspan=\"4\" | Population<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/Central |title=Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2005\u20132013 |accessdate=2 May 2017 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies in the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. The territories that have frontiers with Ethiopia are Eritrea to the north and then, moving in a clockwise direction, Djibouti, the ''de facto'' state of [[Somaliland]], Somalia, Kenya, South Sudan and Sudan. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. There is a great diversity of terrain with wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has many [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\n\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.\n\nThere are on average seven hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\n==Environment==\n{{see also|Environmental issues in Ethiopia}}\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Ethiopian wolf]]]]\n\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name=\"Massicot\"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory. However, with last sightings at [[Finicha'a]], this canid is thought to be potentially [[local extinction|locally extinct]]. The Ethiopian wolf is perhaps the most researched of all the endangered species within Ethiopia.\n\nEthiopia is a global center of avian diversity. To date more than 856 bird species have been recorded in Ethiopia, twenty of which are endemic to the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lepage|first=Denis|title=Bird Checklists of the World|url=http://avibase.bsc-eoc.org/checklist.jsp?region=et&list=clements|publisher=Avibase|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> Sixteen species are endangered or critically endangered.

The sequence of general education in Ethiopia is six years of primary school, four years of lower secondary school and two years of higher secondary school.<ref>{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Teferra|first1=Damtew|last2=Altbach|first2=Philip G.|title=African Higher Education: An International Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RROdAAAAMAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-34186-0|pages= 316\u201325}}</ref>\n\nAccess to education in Ethiopia has improved significantly.

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first names.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia from Italy, showing the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\n\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1{{nbsp}}M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from most countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 06:00 as opposed to 00:00, coinciding with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) six hours to the Western time. For example, 02:00 local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 20:00 is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\n\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entr\u00e9es and side dishes. Almost universally in Ethiopia, it is common to eat from the same dish in the center of the table with a group of people.

These rules do not apply to temporary residents of Quebec or [[First Nation]] children. If a parent had the right to attend English schools, but did not, they do not lose the right for their children. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/en/parents-and-guardians/instruction-in-english/eligibility/|title=Eligibility|last=author|first=default|website=www.education.gouv.qc.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\nEnglish is taught as a second language in French primary schools from grade 1 onward, and a few schools also offer English immersion programs for advanced students. English schools offer a large range of programs that include French as a second language, [[French immersion]], and fully bilingual programs that teach both English and French as first languages.\n\n===Religion in schools===\nFormerly, school boards were divided between [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] (called \"confessional schools\"). Attempts were made to set up a [[Jewish]] school board before the Second World War, but it failed partly due to divisions within the Jewish community. This confessional system was established through the [[British North America Act, 1867]] (today the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]), which granted power over education to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. Article 93 of the act made it unconstitutional for Quebec to change this system. Consequently, a constitutional amendment was required to operate what some see as the separation of the State and the church in Quebec.\n\nThe Quebec Education Act of 1988 provided for a change to linguistic school boards. In 1997, a unanimous vote by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] allowed for Quebec to request that the Government of Canada exempt the province from Article 93 of the Constitution Act. This request was passed by the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]], resulting in [[Royal Assent]] being granted to the Constitutional Amendment, 1997, (Quebec).\n\nIn the 1996-1997 school year, Quebec had 156 school districts including 135 Catholic districts, 18 Protestant school districts, and three First Nations districts. The school districts operated 2,670 public schools, including 1,895 primary schools, 576 general or professional secondary schools, and 199 combined primary and secondary schools.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/19980128012244/http://www.gouv.qc.ca/educ/sortie/meqf2.htm Les r\u00e9seaux scolaires publics et priv\u00e9s].\" Government of Quebec. January 28, 1998. Retrieved on December 21, 2012. \"En 1996-1997, on d\u00e9nombre 156 commissions scolaires dont 135 reconnues comme catholiques, dix-huit reconnues comme protestantes, et trois \u00e0 statut particulier qui desservent principalement les \u00e9l\u00e8ves autochtones.

Article 5 of the Quebec Public Education Act had been modified in 1997 so as to allow minority religious groups to be allowed religious education classes of their faith where their number were large enough, but this was removed in 2000.  Then, in order to prevent court challenges by these same minority religious groups wanting specialist religious education in schools, the government invoked the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]], which expires after a maximum of 5 years.  In 2005 the government of [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Jean Charest]] decided not to renew the clause, abrogate Article 5 of the Public Education Act, modify Article 41 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and then eliminate the choice in moral and religious instruction that existed previously and, finally, impose a controversial new [[Ethics and religious culture]] curriculum to all schools, even the private ones. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The ERC course has been taught starting in September 2008. Several court challenges have been launched against its compulsory nature.\n\n===Private schools===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nQuebec has the highest proportion of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to the well-to-do. Many middle- and lower-income families send their children to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a pro-rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.\n\nMost of the private schools are secondary institutions, though there are a few primary schools, most of them serving precise religious or cultural groups such as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox Christians]] or certain [[Jew]]ish faiths.\n\nApproximately 17% of the high school population of Quebec currently attends a private high school. The figure is even higher in urban centres such as Montreal, where 30% of high school students are in the private sector.<ref>[http://www.ourkids.net/quebec-schools.php Learning in Quebec]. ourkids.net. Retrieved Apr 25, 2018.</ref>  A study released in August 2004 by the [[Quebec Ministry of Education]] revealed that, over the preceding five years, the private sector had grown by 12% while the public sector had shrunk 5.6%, with a slightly steeper rate in the last year.\n\nPrivate secondary schools usually select their students by having them go through their own scholastic exams and by making a study of the entire primary school record.\n\nThe Quebec public sector teachers' unions oppose any form of subsidy to private schools. They claim (1) that private schools select only the brightest and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties, and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector. Private schools usually have teachers who are not unionized, or who belong to associations not affiliated with the main body of Quebec public sector teachers' unions. The debate over the subsidies has been going on for several decades.\n\n=== ''Polyvalentes'' ===\nA ''polyvalente'' (English: ''comprehensive'') is a multi-functional [[High school|secondary school]] specific to the Quebec school system. The difference between a ''polyvalente'' and a regular high school is that a ''polyvalente'' also contains a section dedicated to vocational training, in addition to general training. However, the term has not been officially used since February 10, 2001. It is preferable to use the term ''\u00e9cole secondaire'' (secondary school) for any type of institution where a high school education is offered, except for institutions already known as ''polyvalente''  The first ''polyvalentes'' were created during the 1960s under the initiative of [[Ministry of Education and Higher Education (Quebec)|education minister]] [[Paul G\u00e9rin-Lajoie]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.actualites.uqam.ca/2013/4128-rapport-parent-un-document-fondateur|title=Le rapport Parent: un document fondateur {{!}} UQAM|work=Actualit\u00e9s UQAM|access-date=2018-04-23|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==Post-secondary education==\nStudents may pursue post-secondary education after completing compulsory schooling (elementary and secondary) in Quebec. Post-secondary education in Quebec includes two levels: college education and university education. Of note, the term 'post-secondary' in this entry is used specifically within the context of Quebec. College level education is given by institutions known as [[CEGEP]]s. Unique to Qu\u00e9bec, this level is a bridge between compulsory schooling and university education. At the university level, education is provided by individual universities. These institutions have an education structure tantamount to that found elsewhere in North America.\n\n===Colleges===\n{{main|College education in Quebec}}\nCollege education is given by institutions known as CEGEPs, which is officially coined in French as ''Coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel''. Both private and public institutions of this type exist within the province. \n\nUnique to Qu\u00e9bec, college education serves to bridge compulsory schooling and university education, since it is the only province that requires 11 years of study (instead of 12) to obtain a high school diploma. For admission purposes, [[Canadian provinces]] other than Quebec do not consider completion of grade 11 in Quebec (Sec V)\u2014or, more simply, the secondary diploma of Quebec\u2014to be sufficient for university admission (or admission at other post-secondary institutions). Hence, although some exceptions exist, successful completion of college education in Quebec is generally required to gain qualifications for university admission.\n\nStudents who enter college can specialize in a number of different technical or pre-university fields. The term of study is two years for pre-university and three years for most vocational or technical diplomas. Students completing college earn the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales''  sometimes with other designations attached to this title. Of interest, the term CEGEP can only legally be used to describe the state-run post-secondary (post-grade 11) schools, where tuition is free. The 26 private institutions which offer a post-secondary program recognized by the [[Quebec Ministry of Education]] receive a subsidy for each of their 15,000 students, and grant the same diplomas as the public colleges. Unlike the state-run colleges, the private post-secondary schools do not have to combine pre-university and vocational programs in one institution. About half offer pre-university and the other half offer vocational programs.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nHolders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor's degree. Under Canadian law, bachelor's degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. Those unfamiliar with Quebec may wonder if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four-year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four-year first university degree programs are the norm. However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of advanced standing credit at any university, it is clear that this is not the case. What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total duration of study when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined.\n\nGraduates of two-year college programs often receive up to one year of advanced standing at universities outside of Quebec, but no more than this. Effectively, the first year of college study is considered equivalent to grade twelve in all other provinces, while the second year is considered to be equal to the freshman university year. Chronologically and legally, this is true and has been in effect for the entire modern era of education in Canada.\n\n===Universities===\n{{main|Higher education in Quebec}}\nPrimary school, secondary school, and college add up to 13 years of pre-university study, one more than other provinces (although part of college study is post-secondary, as evidenced by the treatment of college diplomas in and outside of Quebec). For this reason, most undergraduate [[university]] degrees in Quebec universities are three years in length for Quebec students who have obtained a college diploma.  Universities from outside Quebec have four-year bachelor's degree programs, because secondary study in all provinces outside of Quebec ends with grade 12 (rather than secondary study ending with grade 11 and then being followed by two years of college study, as in Quebec). University education in Quebec is much like in other [[North America]]n jurisdictions. In addition to formerly private institutions, the government of Quebec founded a network of universities in several cities across the province, called the [[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]. All universities in the province have since become public in a similar fashion to other Canadian provinces.\n\nFrom the standpoint of post-secondary institutions outside of Quebec who may be trying to determine transfer credit, there are essentially two ways in which to interpret the two-year college program, bolstered by local and countrywide legislation. The first option is to remove the first year of college study from consideration, since it is in fact the twelfth year of study overall in Quebec (similar to grade 12), and the laws of the land throughout Canada dictate that a high school diploma from Quebec lacks one additional year in order to be considered the equivalent of a high school diploma elsewhere.  The second option would be to include both years of college study in the evaluation, knowing that the maximum of possible transfer credit/advanced standing is one year at the [[freshman]] level.  This second option is viable if one is uncomfortable with using the chronological separation of year 12 and year 13 as their rationale, especially since college courses are not necessarily all taken in a predetermined chronological order, as the order can vary from student to student.\n\nQuebec subsidizes post-secondary education and controls [[tuition fees]], resulting in low student costs in university education. There are three levels of tuition: Quebec resident (lowest level), Out-of-province Canadian resident (tuition set to average Canadian tuition) and International tuition (highest). The Quebec resident tuition is only available to residents of Quebec, residents of jurisdictions that have bilateral agreements with the Quebec government, and to students enrolled in French literature or Quebec studies programs.\n\nGreater [[Montreal]] has eleven universities, founded over the course of 200 years. In 2015, it had more than 155,000 students (full-time equivalent), or 65% of Quebec's student population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.montrealinternational.com/en/publications/the-contribution-of-greater-montreal-universities-to-the-quebec-economy/|last=|first=|date=|website=Montreal International|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25|title=Market studies & publications}}</ref>\n\n== Abolishment of the school boards ==\nOn February 8th, 2020 at 3:21am, Bill 40 was passed to get rid of the 69 school boards that have been running for the past 175 years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|first=|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-education-reform-school-boards-1.5457100|title=Quebec passes education reforms abolishing school boards|date=February 8, 2020|work=CBC News|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>This included 60 French school boards and nine English school boards. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/quebecs-bill-40-further-undermines-the-provinces-english-language-school-system-131595|title=Qu\u00e9bec's Bill 40 further undermines the province's English-language school system|last=Bourhis|first=Richard|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>Bill 40 did not affect Quebec's three Indigenous school boards.<ref name=\":1\" />The political party, [[Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec]], passed Bill 40, although there was many oppositions from other political parties, as well as teacher unions, parents groups, etc.<ref name=\":1\" />With the elimination of the school boards, it has turned into what is known as service centers.<ref name=\":0\" />The abolishing of school boards is said to save the government more than $10 million. <ref name=\":0\" />Quebec has tried to take power away from school boards by limiting their responsibilities.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Montpetit|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-40-kills-school-boards-after-175-years-1.5458564|title=Quebec just killed its school boards after 175 years, but will students benefit?|date=February 10, 2020|work=CBC News|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>Their reason for this is to try to improve the quality of education in Quebec.<ref name=\":2\" />French service centers are now to be run with five staff members, five parents and five members of the community.<ref name=\":0\" />On the other hand, English school board commissioners remain on the job until November 1st 2020 but they will then involve four staff members, four community representatives and between eight and seventeen parents.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lalonde|first=Michelle|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/school-board-commissioners-reeling-from-sudden-end-to-their-mandate/|title=School board commissioners reeling from sudden end to their mandate|date=February 10, 2020|work=Montreal Gazette|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe English school boards of Quebec are trying to invoke Article 23 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom]], which is the official language minority education rights.<ref name=\":1\" />They are planning to take legal action and try to get exempted from Bill 40.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBill 40 is seen as a complement to the Charter of French Language, also known as [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]].<ref name=\":1\" />Bill 101 was adopted to increase the use of French in comparison to English.<ref name=\":1\" />Bill 101 states that all students must attend a French language school unless they have a parent who did a majority of their schooling in English and is a Canadian citizen or the student did a majority of their schooling in English already.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==List of Quebec universities==\n\n===French-language universities===\n*[[\u00c9cole polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al]]\n*[[HEC Montr\u00e9al]]\n*[[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]]\n*[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]\n**[[\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure]] (ETS)\n**[[Institut national de la recherche scientifique|Institut national de recherche scientifique]] (INRS)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi]] (UQAC)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]] (UQAM)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski]] (UQAR)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] (UQTR)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] (UQAT)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais]] (UQO)\n*[[Universit\u00e9 Laval]]\n*[[Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke]]\n\n===English-language universities===\n*[[McGill University]]\n*[[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]]\n*[[Bishop's University]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Education in Montreal]]\n*[[Education in Canada]]\n*[[List of schools in Quebec]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Talbot, Allan D.

If a parent had the right to attend English schools, but did not, they do not lose the right for their children. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/en/parents-and-guardians/instruction-in-english/eligibility/|title=Eligibility|last=author|first=default|website=www.education.gouv.qc.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref>\n\nEnglish is taught as a second language in French primary schools from grade 1 onward, and a few schools also offer English immersion programs for advanced students. English schools offer a large range of programs that include French as a second language, [[French immersion]], and fully bilingual programs that teach both English and French as first languages.\n\n===Religion in schools===\nFormerly, school boards were divided between [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] (called \"confessional schools\"). Attempts were made to set up a [[Jewish]] school board before the Second World War, but it failed partly due to divisions within the Jewish community. This confessional system was established through the [[British North America Act, 1867]] (today the [[Constitution Act, 1867]]), which granted power over education to the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]]. Article 93 of the act made it unconstitutional for Quebec to change this system. Consequently, a constitutional amendment was required to operate what some see as the separation of the State and the church in Quebec.\n\nThe Quebec Education Act of 1988 provided for a change to linguistic school boards. In 1997, a unanimous vote by the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] allowed for Quebec to request that the Government of Canada exempt the province from Article 93 of the Constitution Act. This request was passed by the [[Parliament of Canada|federal parliament]], resulting in [[Royal Assent]] being granted to the Constitutional Amendment, 1997, (Quebec).\n\nIn the 1996-1997 school year, Quebec had 156 school districts including 135 Catholic districts, 18 Protestant school districts, and three First Nations districts. The school districts operated 2,670 public schools, including 1,895 primary schools, 576 general or professional secondary schools, and 199 combined primary and secondary schools.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/19980128012244/http://www.gouv.qc.ca/educ/sortie/meqf2.htm Les r\u00e9seaux scolaires publics et priv\u00e9s].\" Government of Quebec. January 28, 1998. Retrieved on December 21, 2012. \"En 1996-1997, on d\u00e9nombre 156 commissions scolaires dont 135 reconnues comme catholiques, dix-huit reconnues comme protestantes, et trois \u00e0 statut particulier qui desservent principalement les \u00e9l\u00e8ves autochtones.

Article 5 of the Quebec Public Education Act had been modified in 1997 so as to allow minority religious groups to be allowed religious education classes of their faith where their number were large enough, but this was removed in 2000.  Then, in order to prevent court challenges by these same minority religious groups wanting specialist religious education in schools, the government invoked the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]], which expires after a maximum of 5 years.  In 2005 the government of [[Premier of Quebec|Premier]] [[Jean Charest]] decided not to renew the clause, abrogate Article 5 of the Public Education Act, modify Article 41 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and then eliminate the choice in moral and religious instruction that existed previously and, finally, impose a controversial new [[Ethics and religious culture]] curriculum to all schools, even the private ones. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}  The ERC course has been taught starting in September 2008. Several court challenges have been launched against its compulsory nature.\n\n===Private schools===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}\nQuebec has the highest proportion of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to the well-to-do. Many middle- and lower-income families send their children to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a pro-rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.\n\nMost of the private schools are secondary institutions, though there are a few primary schools, most of them serving precise religious or cultural groups such as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Orthodox Christians]] or certain [[Jew]]ish faiths.\n\nApproximately 17% of the high school population of Quebec currently attends a private high school. The figure is even higher in urban centres such as Montreal, where 30% of high school students are in the private sector.<ref>[http://www.ourkids.net/quebec-schools.php Learning in Quebec]. ourkids.net. Retrieved Apr 25, 2018.</ref>  A study released in August 2004 by the [[Quebec Ministry of Education]] revealed that, over the preceding five years, the private sector had grown by 12% while the public sector had shrunk 5.6%, with a slightly steeper rate in the last year.\n\nPrivate secondary schools usually select their students by having them go through their own scholastic exams and by making a study of the entire primary school record.\n\nThe Quebec public sector teachers' unions oppose any form of subsidy to private schools. They claim (1) that private schools select only the brightest and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties, and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector. Private schools usually have teachers who are not unionized, or who belong to associations not affiliated with the main body of Quebec public sector teachers' unions. The debate over the subsidies has been going on for several decades.\n\n=== ''Polyvalentes'' ===\nA ''polyvalente'' (English: ''comprehensive'') is a multi-functional [[High school|secondary school]] specific to the Quebec school system. The difference between a ''polyvalente'' and a regular high school is that a ''polyvalente'' also contains a section dedicated to vocational training, in addition to general training. However, the term has not been officially used since February 10, 2001. It is preferable to use the term ''\u00e9cole secondaire'' (secondary school) for any type of institution where a high school education is offered, except for institutions already known as ''polyvalente''  The first ''polyvalentes'' were created during the 1960s under the initiative of [[Ministry of Education and Higher Education (Quebec)|education minister]] [[Paul G\u00e9rin-Lajoie]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.actualites.uqam.ca/2013/4128-rapport-parent-un-document-fondateur|title=Le rapport Parent: un document fondateur {{!}} UQAM|work=Actualit\u00e9s UQAM|access-date=2018-04-23|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==Post-secondary education==\nStudents may pursue post-secondary education after completing compulsory schooling (elementary and secondary) in Quebec. Post-secondary education in Quebec includes two levels: college education and university education. Of note, the term 'post-secondary' in this entry is used specifically within the context of Quebec. College level education is given by institutions known as [[CEGEP]]s. Unique to Qu\u00e9bec, this level is a bridge between compulsory schooling and university education. At the university level, education is provided by individual universities. These institutions have an education structure tantamount to that found elsewhere in North America.\n\n===Colleges===\n{{main|College education in Quebec}}\nCollege education is given by institutions known as CEGEPs, which is officially coined in French as ''Coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel''. Both private and public institutions of this type exist within the province. \n\nUnique to Qu\u00e9bec, college education serves to bridge compulsory schooling and university education, since it is the only province that requires 11 years of study (instead of 12) to obtain a high school diploma. For admission purposes, [[Canadian provinces]] other than Quebec do not consider completion of grade 11 in Quebec (Sec V)\u2014or, more simply, the secondary diploma of Quebec\u2014to be sufficient for university admission (or admission at other post-secondary institutions). Hence, although some exceptions exist, successful completion of college education in Quebec is generally required to gain qualifications for university admission.\n\nStudents who enter college can specialize in a number of different technical or pre-university fields. The term of study is two years for pre-university and three years for most vocational or technical diplomas. Students completing college earn the ''Dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes coll\u00e9giales''  sometimes with other designations attached to this title. Of interest, the term CEGEP can only legally be used to describe the state-run post-secondary (post-grade 11) schools, where tuition is free. The 26 private institutions which offer a post-secondary program recognized by the [[Quebec Ministry of Education]] receive a subsidy for each of their 15,000 students, and grant the same diplomas as the public colleges. Unlike the state-run colleges, the private post-secondary schools do not have to combine pre-university and vocational programs in one institution. About half offer pre-university and the other half offer vocational programs.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nHolders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor's degree. Under Canadian law, bachelor's degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. Those unfamiliar with Quebec may wonder if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four-year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four-year first university degree programs are the norm. However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of advanced standing credit at any university, it is clear that this is not the case. What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total duration of study when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined.\n\nGraduates of two-year college programs often receive up to one year of advanced standing at universities outside of Quebec, but no more than this. Effectively, the first year of college study is considered equivalent to grade twelve in all other provinces, while the second year is considered to be equal to the freshman university year. Chronologically and legally, this is true and has been in effect for the entire modern era of education in Canada.\n\n===Universities===\n{{main|Higher education in Quebec}}\nPrimary school, secondary school, and college add up to 13 years of pre-university study, one more than other provinces (although part of college study is post-secondary, as evidenced by the treatment of college diplomas in and outside of Quebec). For this reason, most undergraduate [[university]] degrees in Quebec universities are three years in length for Quebec students who have obtained a college diploma.  Universities from outside Quebec have four-year bachelor's degree programs, because secondary study in all provinces outside of Quebec ends with grade 12 (rather than secondary study ending with grade 11 and then being followed by two years of college study, as in Quebec). University education in Quebec is much like in other [[North America]]n jurisdictions. In addition to formerly private institutions, the government of Quebec founded a network of universities in several cities across the province, called the [[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]. All universities in the province have since become public in a similar fashion to other Canadian provinces.\n\nFrom the standpoint of post-secondary institutions outside of Quebec who may be trying to determine transfer credit, there are essentially two ways in which to interpret the two-year college program, bolstered by local and countrywide legislation. The first option is to remove the first year of college study from consideration, since it is in fact the twelfth year of study overall in Quebec (similar to grade 12), and the laws of the land throughout Canada dictate that a high school diploma from Quebec lacks one additional year in order to be considered the equivalent of a high school diploma elsewhere.  The second option would be to include both years of college study in the evaluation, knowing that the maximum of possible transfer credit/advanced standing is one year at the [[freshman]] level.  This second option is viable if one is uncomfortable with using the chronological separation of year 12 and year 13 as their rationale, especially since college courses are not necessarily all taken in a predetermined chronological order, as the order can vary from student to student.\n\nQuebec subsidizes post-secondary education and controls [[tuition fees]], resulting in low student costs in university education. There are three levels of tuition: Quebec resident (lowest level), Out-of-province Canadian resident (tuition set to average Canadian tuition) and International tuition (highest). The Quebec resident tuition is only available to residents of Quebec, residents of jurisdictions that have bilateral agreements with the Quebec government, and to students enrolled in French literature or Quebec studies programs.\n\nGreater [[Montreal]] has eleven universities, founded over the course of 200 years. In 2015, it had more than 155,000 students (full-time equivalent), or 65% of Quebec's student population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.montrealinternational.com/en/publications/the-contribution-of-greater-montreal-universities-to-the-quebec-economy/|last=|first=|date=|website=Montreal International|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25|title=Market studies & publications}}</ref>\n\n== Abolishment of the school boards ==\nOn February 8th, 2020 at 3:21am, Bill 40 was passed to get rid of the 69 school boards that have been running for the past 175 years.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|first=CBC News|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-education-reform-school-boards-1.5457100|title=Quebec passes education reforms abolishing school boards|date=February 8, 2020|work=CBC News|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>This included 60 French school boards and nine English school boards. <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/quebecs-bill-40-further-undermines-the-provinces-english-language-school-system-131595|title=Qu\u00e9bec's Bill 40 further undermines the province's English-language school system|last=Bourhis|first=Richard|website=The Conversation|language=en|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>Bill 40 did not affect Quebec's three Indigenous school boards.<ref name=\":1\" />The political party, [[Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec]], passed Bill 40, although there was many oppositions from other political parties, as well as teacher unions, parents groups, etc.<ref name=\":1\" />With the elimination of the school boards, it has turned into what is known as service centers.<ref name=\":0\" />The abolishing of school boards is said to save the government more than $10 million. <ref name=\":0\" />Quebec has tried to take power away from school boards by limiting their responsibilities.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Montpetit|first=Jonathan|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-40-kills-school-boards-after-175-years-1.5458564|title=Quebec just killed its school boards after 175 years, but will students benefit?|date=February 10, 2020|work=CBC News|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>Their reason for this is to try to improve the quality of education in Quebec.<ref name=\":2\" />French service centers are now to be run with five staff members, five parents and five members of the community.<ref name=\":0\" />On the other hand, English school board commissioners remain on the job until November 1st 2020 but they will then involve four staff members, four community representatives and between eight and seventeen parents.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lalonde|first=Michelle|url=https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/school-board-commissioners-reeling-from-sudden-end-to-their-mandate/|title=School board commissioners reeling from sudden end to their mandate|date=February 10, 2020|work=Montreal Gazette|access-date=2020-04-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe English school boards of Quebec are trying to invoke Article 23 of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom]], which is the official language minority education rights.<ref name=\":1\" />They are planning to take legal action and try to get exempted from Bill 40.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBill 40 is seen as a complement to the Charter of French Language, also known as [[Charter of the French Language|Bill 101]].<ref name=\":1\" />Bill 101 was adopted to increase the use of French in comparison to English.<ref name=\":1\" />Bill 101 states that all students must attend a French language school unless they have a parent who did a majority of their schooling in English and is a Canadian citizen or the student did a majority of their schooling in English already.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==List of Quebec universities==\n\n===French-language universities===\n*[[\u00c9cole polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al]]\n*[[HEC Montr\u00e9al]]\n*[[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]]\n*[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec]]\n**[[\u00c9cole de Technologie Sup\u00e9rieure]] (ETS)\n**[[Institut national de la recherche scientifique|Institut national de recherche scientifique]] (INRS)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Chicoutimi]] (UQAC)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al]] (UQAM)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Rimouski]] (UQAR)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]] (UQTR)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Abitibi-T\u00e9miscamingue]] (UQAT)\n**[[Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec en Outaouais]] (UQO)\n*[[Universit\u00e9 Laval]]\n*[[Universit\u00e9 de Sherbrooke]]\n\n===English-language universities===\n*[[McGill University]]\n*[[Concordia University (Quebec)|Concordia University]]\n*[[Bishop's University]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Education in Montreal]]\n*[[Education in Canada]]\n*[[List of schools in Quebec]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Talbot, Allan D.
