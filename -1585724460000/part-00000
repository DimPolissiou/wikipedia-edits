It is suggested{{citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=April 2015}} that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as ''{{lang|es|La Jolla}}''. An alternative, [[false etymology|pseudo-etymological]] suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternate spelling of the Spanish phrase ''{{lang|es|la [[wikt:joya#Spanish|joya]]}}'', which means \"the jewel\".

When California became a state in 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated as part of the chartered City of San Diego. In 1870, Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A [[Real estate bubble|real estate boom]] in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.\n\nIn the 1890s, the San Diego, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla Railway was built, connecting La Jolla to the rest of San Diego. La Jolla became known as a resort area. To attract visitors to the beach, the railway built facilities such as a bath house and a dance pavilion. Visitors were housed in small cottages and bungalows above La Jolla Cove, as well as a temporary [[tent city]] erected every summer. Two of the cottages that were built in 1894 still exist: the \"Red Roost\" and the \"Red Rest\", also known as the \"Neptune and Cove Tea Room\"; the two cottages have been vacant since the 1980s, and are covered in tarpaulins. The La Jolla Park Hotel opened in 1893. The Hotel Cabrillo was built in 1908 by \"Squire\" James A. Wilson and was later incorporated into the La Valencia Hotel.<ref name=\"Hollins\">{{cite journal|last=Hollins|first=Jeremy|title=Village Memories: A Photo Essay on La Jolla's Past|journal=Journal of San Diego History|pages=295\u2013305|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v54-4/pdf/v54-4Hollins.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, La Jolla comprised 100 buildings and 350 residents. The first reading room (library) was built in 1898.<ref name = \"Hollins\" /> A volunteer fire brigade was organized in 1907; the city of San Diego established a regular fire house in 1914.

She was wealthy in her own right from her investments and writing, and she inherited a large sum from her brother George H. Scripps in 1900. She devoted herself to philanthropic endeavors, particularly those benefiting her adopted home of La Jolla. She commissioned many of La Jolla's most notable buildings, usually designed by [[Irving Gill]] or his nephew and partner [[Louis John Gill]]. Many of these buildings are now on the  [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]] or are listed as historic by the city of San Diego; these include the [[La Jolla Woman's Club]] (1914), the [[La Jolla Recreational Center]] (1915), the earliest buildings of [[The Bishop's School (La Jolla)|The Bishop's School]], and the [[Old Scripps Building]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], as well as her own residence, built in 1915 and now housing the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]]. Her donations also launched the [[Scripps Health|Scripps Memorial Hospital]] in 1924 (originally located on Prospect Street in La Jolla until it moved to its present site in 1964), the Scripps Metabolic Clinic (now the [[Scripps Research Institute]]), and the [[Children's Pool Beach|Children's Pool]]. Ellen Browning Scripps also founded [[Scripps College]], a women's college,  in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrippscollege.edu/about/ellen-browning-scripps|title=About Scripps College - History|website=www.scrippscollege.edu}}</ref> Scripps College is located in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]] in Los Angeles County (not to be confused with [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], a community of [[San Diego]]).\n\n===Scripps Institution of Oceanography===\n[[File:SIOpier.jpg|right|thumb|Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier]]\nThe [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], one of the nation's oldest oceanographic institutes, was founded in 1903 by [[William Emerson Ritter]], chair of the zoology department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with financial support from Scripps and her brother [[E. W. Scripps]]. At first the institution operated out of a boathouse in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]]. In 1905 they purchased a {{convert|170|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in La Jolla where the Institution still stands today. The first laboratory buildings there opened in 1907. The institution became part of the [[University of California]] in 1912. Ultimately it became the nucleus for the establishment of the University of California San Diego.\n\n===Camp Matthews===\nFrom 1917 through 1964 the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained a military base in La Jolla. The base was used for marksmanship training and was known as [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews]]. During and after [[World War II]] the population of La Jolla grew, causing residential development to draw close to the base, so that it became less and less suitable as a firing range because of risk to the adjacent civilian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html#18 |title=A Brief History of the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego |last=Denger |first=Mark J. |work=The California State Military Museum |access-date=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424141525/http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df= }}</ref> Meanwhile, the site was being eyed as a location for a proposed new campus of the University of California. In 1962 Camp Matthews was declared surplus by the Marine Corps. The base formally closed in 1964, and that same year the first class of undergraduates enrolled in the University of California San Diego.\n\n===University of California, San Diego===\nLocal civic leaders had long toyed with the idea of a [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego campus]] of the [[University of California]], and the quest became more definite following World War II. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, under its director [[Roger Revelle]], had become an important defense contractor, and local aerospace companies like [[Convair]] were pressing for local training for their scientists and engineers. The state legislature proposed the idea in 1955, and the Regents of the University formally approved it in 1960.<ref name=\"Shragge\">{{cite journal|last=Shragge|first=Abraham J.|date=Fall 2001|title=Growing Up Together: The University of California's One Hundred-Year Partnership with the San Diego Region|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=47|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/2001-4/ucsd.htm}}</ref> During the planning stage of the university's establishment, it was briefly known as the \"University of California, La Jolla\", but the name was changed to \"University of California, San Diego\" before its founding in 1960.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://ucsd.edu/timeline/|title=Timeline|work=University of California San Diego|access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> The founding chancellor was [[Herbert York]], named in 1961, and the second chancellor was [[John Semple Galbraith]], named in 1964.

The first college was established in 1965 and was named [[Revelle College]] after [[Roger Revelle]], who is regarded as the \"father\" of the university.<ref name = \"timeline\" /> A [[UC San Diego School of Medicine|medical school]] was established in 1968. The landmark [[Geisel Library]] with its [[Brutalist architecture]] opened in 1970.\n\n===Antisemitism===\nThe Camp Matthews site for the University was selected with some hesitation; one of the concerns was \"whether La Jollans in particular would lay aside old prejudices in order to welcome a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse professoriate into their midst\".<ref name = \"Shragge\" /> La Jolla had a history of restrictive housing policies, often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure [[Europe]]an ancestry could own property; this excluded [[Judaism|Jews]], who were not considered [[White people|white]]. Such \"[[Covenant (law)|restrictive covenants]]\" were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity|work=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|access-date=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708050943/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Ffair_housing_equal_opp%2Fprogdesc%2Ftitle8|archivedate=8 July 2015|df=}}</ref> However, realtors and property owners in La Jolla continued to use more subtle ways of preventing or discouraging Jews from owning property there.<ref name=\"Garson\">For example, when the world-famous mathematician and philosopher [[Jacob Bronowski]] came to the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] in 1963, he wanted to build a home on La Jolla Farms Road for his family.

A large [[Christian cross]] was placed at the top in 1913 as a prominent landmark. It has been replaced twice, most recently in 1954 with a {{convert|29|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cross ({{convert|43|ft|m}} tall including the base). Originally known as the \"Mount Soledad Easter Cross\", its presence on publicly owned land was challenged in the 1980s as a violation of the [[separation of church and state]].

By an act of Congress, the federal government took possession of it under [[Eminent domain in the United States|eminent domain]] in 2006. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] declared the cross unconstitutional in 2011, and the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] declined to hear an appeal.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2012/jun/25/mount-soledad-case/|title=Supreme Court won't hear Mt.

This unique ZIP code allows addresses to read La Jolla, CA, and is the only community within the City of San Diego so recognized. Additionally, it is in the 919xx/920xx sequence used for suburban and rural ZIP Codes in San Diego County, rather than the 921xx sequence used for the remainder of the City of San Diego proper. These conditions sometimes lead to the erroneous impression that La Jolla is a separate city, rather than a part of San Diego. The 92037 ZIP code extends the northeasterly boundary to Genesee Avenue and the northerly boundary to [[Del Mar, California]]. The UCSD campus, although it is part of La Jolla, has ZIP Codes 92092 and 92093.\n\nDespite the city and postal service definitions, La Jolla does not have universally accepted boundaries. In the 1980s, the trustees of Scripps Hospital voted to move the campus from downtown La Jolla to [[University City, San Diego|University City]], east of Interstate 5 and not within the traditional boundaries of La Jolla. The governing documents of the hospital required it to be located in La Jolla, however. A court ruled that \"La Jolla\" exists merely as a \"state of mind\" and thus allowed the relocation of the hospital.<ref>Morgan, Neil.

It is suggested{{citation needed|reason=By whom?|date=April 2015}} that the Kumeyaay name for the area was transcribed by the Spanish settlers as ''{{lang|es|La Jolla}}''. An alternative, [[false etymology|pseudo-etymological]] suggestion for the origin of the name is that it is an alternate spelling of the Spanish phrase ''{{lang|es|la [[wikt:joya#Spanish|joya]]}}'', which means \"the jewel\".

When California became a state in 1850, the La Jolla area was incorporated as part of the chartered City of San Diego. In 1870, Charles Dean acquired several of the pueblo lots and subdivided them into an area that became known as La Jolla Park. Dean was unable to develop the land and left San Diego in 1881. A [[Real estate bubble|real estate boom]] in the 1880s led speculators Frank T. Botsford and George W. Heald to further develop the sparsely settled area.\n\nIn the 1890s, the San Diego, Pacific Beach, and La Jolla Railway was built, connecting La Jolla to the rest of San Diego. La Jolla became known as a resort area. To attract visitors to the beach, the railway built facilities such as a bath house and a dance pavilion. Visitors were housed in small cottages and bungalows above La Jolla Cove, as well as a temporary [[tent city]] erected every summer. Two of the cottages that were built in 1894 still exist: the \"Red Roost\" and the \"Red Rest\", also known as the \"Neptune and Cove Tea Room\"; the two cottages have been vacant since the 1980s, and are covered in tarpaulins. The La Jolla Park Hotel opened in 1893. The Hotel Cabrillo was built in 1908 by \"Squire\" James A. Wilson and was later incorporated into the La Valencia Hotel.<ref name=\"Hollins\">{{cite journal|last=Hollins|first=Jeremy|title=Village Memories: A Photo Essay on La Jolla's Past|journal=Journal of San Diego History|pages=295\u2013305|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/v54-4/pdf/v54-4Hollins.pdf}}</ref>\n\nBy 1900, La Jolla comprised 100 buildings and 350 residents. The first reading room (library) was built in 1898.<ref name = \"Hollins\" /> A volunteer fire brigade was organized in 1907; the city of San Diego established a regular fire house in 1914.

She was wealthy in her own right from her investments and writing, and she inherited a large sum from her brother George H. Scripps in 1900. She devoted herself to philanthropic endeavors, particularly those benefiting her adopted home of La Jolla. She commissioned many of La Jolla's most notable buildings, usually designed by [[Irving Gill]] or his nephew and partner [[Louis John Gill]]. Many of these buildings are now on the  [[National Register of Historic Places listings in San Diego County, California|National Register of Historic Places]] or are listed as historic by the city of San Diego; these include the [[La Jolla Woman's Club]] (1914), the [[La Jolla Recreational Center]] (1915), the earliest buildings of [[The Bishop's School (La Jolla)|The Bishop's School]], and the [[Old Scripps Building]] at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], as well as her own residence, built in 1915 and now housing the [[Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego]]. Her donations also launched the [[Scripps Health|Scripps Memorial Hospital]] in 1924 (originally located on Prospect Street in La Jolla until it moved to its present site in 1964), the Scripps Metabolic Clinic (now the [[Scripps Research Institute]]), and the [[Children's Pool Beach|Children's Pool]]. Ellen Browning Scripps also founded [[Scripps College]], a women's college,  in 1926.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scrippscollege.edu/about/ellen-browning-scripps|title=About Scripps College - History|website=www.scrippscollege.edu}}</ref> Scripps College is located in [[Claremont, California|Claremont]] in Los Angeles County (not to be confused with [[Clairemont, San Diego|Clairemont]], a community of [[San Diego]]).\n\n===Scripps Institution of Oceanography===\n[[File:SIOpier.jpg|right|thumb|Scripps Institution of Oceanography pier]]\nThe [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], one of the nation's oldest oceanographic institutes, was founded in 1903 by [[William Emerson Ritter]], chair of the zoology department at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with financial support from Scripps and her brother [[E. W. Scripps]]. At first the institution operated out of a boathouse in [[Coronado, California|Coronado]]. In 1905 they purchased a {{convert|170|acre|ha|adj=on}} site in La Jolla where the Institution still stands today. The first laboratory buildings there opened in 1907. The institution became part of the [[University of California]] in 1912. Ultimately it became the nucleus for the establishment of the University of California San Diego.\n\n===Camp Matthews===\nFrom 1917 through 1964 the [[United States Marine Corps]] maintained a military base in La Jolla. The base was used for marksmanship training and was known as [[Camp Calvin B. Matthews]]. During and after [[World War II]] the population of La Jolla grew, causing residential development to draw close to the base, so that it became less and less suitable as a firing range because of risk to the adjacent civilian population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html#18 |title=A Brief History of the U.S. Marine Corps in San Diego |last=Denger |first=Mark J. |work=The California State Military Museum |access-date=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424141525/http://www.militarymuseum.org/SDMarines.html |archivedate=24 April 2013 |df= }}</ref> Meanwhile, the site was being eyed as a location for a proposed new campus of the University of California. In 1962 Camp Matthews was declared surplus by the Marine Corps. The base formally closed in 1964, and that same year the first class of undergraduates enrolled in the University of California San Diego.\n\n===University of California, San Diego===\nLocal civic leaders had long toyed with the idea of a [[University of California, San Diego|San Diego campus]] of the [[University of California]], and the quest became more definite following World War II. The Scripps Institution of Oceanography, under its director [[Roger Revelle]], had become an important defense contractor, and local aerospace companies like [[Convair]] were pressing for local training for their scientists and engineers. The state legislature proposed the idea in 1955, and the Regents of the University formally approved it in 1960.<ref name=\"Shragge\">{{cite journal|last=Shragge|first=Abraham J.|date=Fall 2001|title=Growing Up Together: The University of California's One Hundred-Year Partnership with the San Diego Region|journal=Journal of San Diego History|volume=47|issue=4|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/2001-4/ucsd.htm}}</ref> During the planning stage of the university's establishment, it was briefly known as the \"University of California, La Jolla\", but the name was changed to \"University of California, San Diego\" before its founding in 1960.<ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|url=http://ucsd.edu/timeline/|title=Timeline|work=University of California San Diego|access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref> The founding chancellor was [[Herbert York]], named in 1961, and the second chancellor was [[John Semple Galbraith]], named in 1964. The university was designed to have a \"college\" system; there are now six colleges. The first college was established in 1965 and was named [[Revelle College]] after [[Roger Revelle]], who is regarded as the \"father\" of the university.<ref name = \"timeline\" /> A [[UC San Diego School of Medicine|medical school]] was established in 1968. The landmark [[Geisel Library]] with its [[Brutalist architecture]] opened in 1970.\n\n===Antisemitism===\nThe Camp Matthews site for the University was selected with some hesitation; one of the concerns was \"whether La Jollans in particular would lay aside old prejudices in order to welcome a culturally, ethnically, and religiously diverse professoriate into their midst\".<ref name = \"Shragge\" /> La Jolla had a history of restrictive housing policies, often specified in deeds and ownership documents. In La Jolla Shores and La Jolla Hermosa, only people with pure [[Europe]]an ancestry could own property; this excluded [[Judaism|Jews]], who were not considered [[White people|white]]. Such \"[[Covenant (law)|restrictive covenants]]\" were once fairly common throughout the United States; the 1948 Supreme Court case ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' ruled them to be unenforceable, and Congress outlawed them twenty years later via the Fair Housing Act (Title VII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity|work=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|access-date=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708050943/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Ffair_housing_equal_opp%2Fprogdesc%2Ftitle8|archivedate=8 July 2015|df=}}</ref> However, realtors and property owners in La Jolla continued to use more subtle ways of preventing or discouraging Jews from owning property there.<ref name=\"Garson\">For example, when the world-famous mathematician and philosopher [[Jacob Bronowski]] came to the [[Salk Institute for Biological Studies|Salk Institute]] in 1963, he wanted to build a home on La Jolla Farms Road for his family.

A large [[Christian cross]] was placed at the top in 1913 as a prominent landmark. It has been replaced twice, most recently in 1954 with a {{convert|29|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} cross ({{convert|43|ft|m}} tall including the base). Originally known as the \"Mount Soledad Easter Cross\", its presence on publicly owned land was challenged in the 1980s as a violation of the [[separation of church and state]]. Since then the cross has had a war memorial built around it and was renamed \"Mount Soledad Veterans War Memorial\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/01/04/california.cross/|title=Appeals court says cross on federal land is unconstitutional|date=January 5, 2011|work=CNN|access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe issue has been in almost continual litigation ever since, with the city attempting to sell or give away the land under the cross.

This unique ZIP code allows addresses to read La Jolla, CA, and is the only community within the City of San Diego so recognized. Additionally, it is in the 919xx/920xx sequence used for suburban and rural ZIP Codes in San Diego County, rather than the 921xx sequence used for the remainder of the City of San Diego proper. These conditions sometimes lead to the erroneous impression that La Jolla is a separate city, rather than a part of San Diego. The 92037 ZIP code extends the northeasterly boundary to Genesee Avenue and the northerly boundary to [[Del Mar, California]]. The UCSD campus, although it is part of La Jolla, has ZIP Codes 92092 and 92093.\n\nDespite the city and postal service definitions, La Jolla does not have universally accepted boundaries. In the 1980s, the trustees of Scripps Hospital voted to move the campus from downtown La Jolla to [[University City, San Diego|University City]], east of Interstate 5 and not within the traditional boundaries of La Jolla. The governing documents of the hospital required it to be located in La Jolla, however. A court ruled that \"La Jolla\" exists merely as a \"state of mind\" and thus allowed the relocation of the hospital.<ref>Morgan, Neil.

For further use two licenses are available \u2013 a commercial and a discounted one.

Any paid license includes the current version with all of its future updates and a free upgrade to the next major version and all of its subsequent updates, when they are released.

Nuclear medicine imaging, in a sense, is \"[[radiology]] done inside out\" or \"endoradiology\" because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than [[radiation]] that is generated by external sources like [[X-rays]]. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology, as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy, but on the function. For such reason, it is called a [[Functional imaging|physiological imaging modality]]. [[Single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetershcs.com/Nuclear-Medicine|title=Nuclear Medicine|access-date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnostic medical imaging ==\n\n===Diagnostic===\nIn nuclear medicine imaging, [[radiopharmaceuticals]] are taken internally, for example, intravenously or orally. Then, external detectors ([[gamma camera]]s) capture and form images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals. This process is unlike a diagnostic X-ray, where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image.\n\nThere are several techniques of diagnostic nuclear medicine. \n* 2D: ''[[Scintigraphy]]'' (\"scint\") is the use of internal radionuclides to create two-dimensional images.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/scintigraphy scintigraphy] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2007 by Saunders; Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. 2007; McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies</ref>\n<gallery>\n  File:Nl bone scan2.jpg|A nuclear medicine whole body bone scan.

The nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion scan plays a pivotal role in the noninvasive evaluation of coronary artery disease. The study not only identifies patients with coronary artery disease; it also provides overall prognostic information or overall risk of adverse cardiac events for the patient.\n  File:parathyroid subtraction.jpg|A nuclear medicine parathyroid scan demonstrates a parathyroid adenoma adjacent to the left inferior pole of the thyroid gland. The above study was performed with Technetium-Sestamibi (1st column) and iodine-123 (2nd column) simultaneous imaging and the subtraction technique (3rd column).\n  File:HIDA.jpg|Normal hepatobiliary scan (HIDA scan).

''[[Positron emission tomography]]'' (PET) uses coincidence detection to image functional processes.\n\n<gallery>\n  File:hemangioma scan.jpg|A nuclear medicine SPECT liver scan with technetium-99m labeled autologous red blood cells.

Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body [[PET scan]]s or [[PET-CT|PET/CT]] scans, [[gallium scan]]s, [[indium white blood cell scan]]s, [[MIBG]] and [[octreotide scan]]s.\n[[File:Iodine wb scan.jpg|thumb|Iodine-123 whole body scan for thyroid cancer evaluation. The study above was performed after the total thyroidectomy and TSH stimulation with thyroid hormone medication withdrawal. The study shows a small residual thyroid tissue in the neck and a mediastinum lesion, consistent with the thyroid cancer metastatic disease. The observable uptakes in the stomach and bladder are normal physiologic findings.]]\nWhile the ability of nuclear metabolism to image disease processes from differences in metabolism is unsurpassed, it is not unique. Certain techniques such as [[fMRI]] image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.\n\nDiagnostic tests in nuclear medicine exploit the way that the body handles substances differently when there is disease or pathology present. The radionuclide introduced into the body is often chemically bound to a complex that acts characteristically within the body; this is commonly known as a [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]]. In the presence of disease, a tracer will often be distributed around the body and/or processed differently. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate ([[Medronic acid|MDP]]) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching [[technetium-99m]] to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a \"hot spot\", which is a focal increase in radio accumulation or a general increase in radio accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a \"cold spot\". Many tracer complexes have been developed to image or treat many different organs, glands, and physiological processes.\n\n=== Hybrid scanning techniques ===\nIn some centers, the nuclear medicine scans can be superimposed, using software or hybrid cameras, on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight the part of the body in which the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated. This practice is often referred to as image fusion or co-registration, for example SPECT/CT and PET/CT. The fusion imaging technique in nuclear medicine provides information about the anatomy and function, which would otherwise be unavailable or would require a more invasive procedure or surgery.\n<gallery>\n  File:nl petct.jpg|Normal whole body PET/CT scan with [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]]-18. The whole body PET/CT scan is commonly used in the detection, staging and follow-up of various cancers.\n  File:abnl petct.jpg|Abnormal whole body PET/CT scan with multiple metastases from a cancer. The whole body PET/CT scan has become an important tool in the evaluation of cancer.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Practical concerns in nuclear imaging ===\n\nAlthough the risks of low-level radiation exposures are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human radiation exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, \"ALARP\". (Originally, this was known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), but this has changed in modern draftings of the legislation to add more emphasis on the \"Reasonably\" and less on the \"Achievable\".)\n\nWorking with the ALARP principle, before a patient is exposed for a nuclear medicine examination, the benefit of the examination must be identified. This needs to take into account the particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.\n\nWhen the benefit does justify the procedure, then the radiation exposure (the amount of radiation given to the patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image and make it more photographically appealing, but if the clinical question can be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.\n\nAs a result, the radiation dose from nuclear medicine imaging varies greatly depending on the type of study. The effective radiation dose can be lower than or comparable to or can far exceed the general day-to-day environmental annual [[background radiation]] dose. Likewise, it can also be less than, in the range of, or higher than the radiation dose from an abdomen/pelvis CT scan.\n\nSome nuclear medicine procedures require special patient preparation before the study to obtain the most accurate result. Pre-imaging preparations may include dietary preparation or the withholding of certain medications. Patients are encouraged to consult with the nuclear medicine department prior to a scan.\n\n=== Analysis ===\n\nThe end result of the nuclear medicine imaging process is a \"dataset\" comprising one or more images. In multi-image datasets the array of images may represent a time sequence (i.e. cine or movie) often called a \"dynamic\" dataset, a cardiac gated time sequence, or a spatial sequence where the gamma-camera is moved relative to the patient. [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] (single photon emission computed tomography) is the process by which images acquired from a rotating gamma-camera are reconstructed to produce an image of a \"slice\" through the patient at a particular position. A collection of parallel slices form a slice-stack, a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] representation of the distribution of radionuclide in the patient.\n\nThe nuclear medicine computer may require millions of lines of source code to provide quantitative analysis packages for each of the specific imaging techniques available in nuclear medicine.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nTime sequences can be further analysed using [[Receptor-ligand kinetics|kinetic]] models such as [[multi-compartment model]]s or a [[Patlak plot]].\n\n==Interventional nuclear medicine==\n{{Main|Unsealed source radiotherapy|Brachytherapy}}\nRadionuclide therapy can be used to treat conditions such as [[hyperthyroidism]], [[thyroid cancer]], and blood disorders.\n\nIn nuclear medicine therapy, the radiation treatment dose is administered internally (e.g. intravenous or oral routes) rather than from an external radiation source.\n\nThe radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine therapy emit ionizing radiation that travels only a short distance, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects and damage to noninvolved organs or nearby structures. Most nuclear medicine therapies can be performed as outpatient procedures since there are few side effects from the treatment and the radiation exposure to the general public can be kept within a safe limit.\n\n'''Common nuclear medicine [[Unsealed source radiotherapy|(unsealed source) therapies]]'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The multidisciplinary nature of nuclear medicine makes it difficult for medical historians to determine the birthdate of nuclear medicine. This can probably be best placed between the discovery of artificial radioactivity in 1934 and the production of radionuclides by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] for medicine related use, in 1946.<ref name=\"Edwards\">Edwards Cl: Tumor localizing radionuclides in retrospect and prospect. Semin Nucl Med 3:186\u2013189, 1979.</ref>\n\nThe origins of this medical idea date back as far as the mid-1920s in [[Freiburg]], Germany, when [[George de Hevesy]] made experiments with radionuclides administered to rats, thus displaying metabolic pathways of these substances and establishing the [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] principle. Possibly, the genesis of this medical field took place in 1936, when [[John H. Lawrence|John Lawrence]], known as \"the father of nuclear medicine\", took a leave of absence from his faculty position at [[Yale Medical School]], to visit his brother [[Ernest Lawrence]] at his new radiation laboratory (now known as the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]) in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]]. Later on, John Lawrence made the first application in patients of an artificial radionuclide when he used [[phosphorus-32]] to treat [[leukemia]].<ref>[http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/40/1/16N.full.pdf Donner Laboratory: The Birthplace of. Nuclear Medicine]</ref><ref>[http://interactive.snm.org/index.cfm?PageID=1107 Important Moments in the History of Nuclear Medicine]</ref>\n \nMany historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie]] and [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]] in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine.<ref name=\"Edwards\" /> In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by [[Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen]] for X-ray, [[Henri Becquerel]] for radioactive uranium salts, and [[Marie Curie]] (mother of Ir\u00e8ne Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term \"radioactivity.\" [[Taro Takemi]] studied the application of [[nuclear physics]] to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers.\n \nNuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty when on May 11,1946 an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Massachusetts General Hospital's Dr. [[Saul Hertz]] and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dr.Arthur Roberts, described the successful use of treating Graves' Disease with radioactive iodine (RAI) was published.<ref name=\"pmid21025609\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hertz S, Roberts A | title = Radioactive iodine in the study of thyroid physiology; the use of radioactive iodine therapy in hyperthyroidism | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 81\u20136 | date = May 1946 | pmid = 21025609 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1946.02870190005002| url = }}</ref> Additionally, [[Sam Seidlin]].<ref name=\"pmid20274882\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Seidlin SM, Marinelli LD, Oshry E | title = Radioactive iodine therapy; effect on functioning metastases of adenocarcinoma of the thyroid | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 132 | issue = 14 | pages = 838\u201347 | date = December 1946 | pmid = 20274882 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1946.02870490016004| url = }}</ref> brought further development in the field describing a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine ([[I-131]]). These articles are considered by many historians as the most important articles ever published in nuclear medicine.<ref name=\"nmtext\">{{cite book | vauthors = Henkin R, etal | title = Nuclear Medicine | edition = First | date = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-8016-7701-4}}</ref> Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of [[Technetium-99m]]. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a [[radionuclide generator|generator]] system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed in a wide variety of nuclear medicine imaging studies.\n \nWidespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by [[Benedict Cassen]] in developing the first [[rectilinear scanner]] and [[Hal O. Anger]]'s scintillation camera ([[Anger camera]]) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.\n\nBy the early 1960s, in southern [[Scandinavia]], [[Niels A. Lassen]], [[:sv:David H. Ingvar|David H.

In 1971, [[American Medical Association]] officially recognized nuclear medicine as a medical specialty.<ref name=\"snm\">{{cite web |url= http://interactive.snm.org/docs/whatisnucmed.pdf |title=What is nuclear medicine|website=Society of Nuclear Medicine}}</ref> In 1972, the [[American Board of Nuclear Medicine]] was established, and in 1974, the [[American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine]] was established, cementing nuclear medicine as a stand-alone medical specialty.\n \nIn the 1980s, radiopharmaceuticals were designed for use in diagnosis of heart disease. The development of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), around the same time, led to three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart and establishment of the field of nuclear cardiology.\n\nMore recent developments in nuclear medicine include the invention of the first positron emission tomography scanner ([[positron emission tomography|PET]]). The concept of emission and transmission tomography, later developed into single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), was introduced by [[David E. Kuhl]] and Roy Edwards in the late 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Their work led to the design and construction of several tomographic instruments at the University of Pennsylvania. Tomographic imaging techniques were further developed at the Washington University School of Medicine. These innovations led to fusion imaging with SPECT and CT by Bruce Hasegawa from University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the first PET/CT prototype by D. W. Townsend from University of Pittsburgh in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nPET and PET/CT imaging experienced slower growth in its early years owing to the cost of the modality and the requirement for an on-site or nearby cyclotron. However, an administrative decision to approve medical reimbursement of limited PET and PET/CT applications in oncology has led to phenomenal growth and widespread acceptance over the last few years, which also was facilitated by establishing 18F-labelled tracers for standard procedures, allowing work at non-cyclotron-equipped sites. PET/CT imaging is now an integral part of oncology for diagnosis, staging and treatment monitoring. A fully integrated MRI/PET scanner is on the market from early 2011.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Sources of radionuclides ==\n{{see also|Radiopharmacology|}}\n<sup>99m</sup>Tc is normally supplied to hospitals through a [[radionuclide generator]] containing the parent radionuclide [[molybdenum-99]]. <sup>99</sup>Mo is [[Technetium-99m#Production|typically obtained]] as a fission product of [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] in nuclear reactors, however global supply shortages have lead to the exploration of [[Technetium-99m#Production|other methods of production]].

Some studies require the labeling of a patient's own blood cells with a radionuclide ([[leukocyte scintigraphy]] and [[red blood cell]] scintigraphy). Most diagnostic radionuclides emit [[gamma ray]]s either directly from their decay or indirectly through [[electron-positron annihilation]], while the cell-damaging properties of [[beta particles]] are used in therapeutic applications. Refined radionuclides for use in nuclear medicine are derived from [[nuclear fission|fission]] or fusion processes in [[nuclear reactor]]s, which produce radionuclides with longer half-lives, or [[cyclotron]]s, which produce radionuclides with shorter half-lives, or take advantage of natural decay processes in dedicated generators, i.e. molybdenum/technetium or strontium/rubidium.\n\nThe most commonly used intravenous radionuclides are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, thallium-201, gallium-67, fluorine-18 [[fluorodeoxyglucose]], and indium-111 labeled [[leukocyte]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The most commonly used gaseous/aerosol radionuclides are xenon-133, krypton-81m, ([[aerosolised]]) technetium-99m.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718042409/http://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/technegas/home.html Technegas] a radioaerosol invented in Australia by Dr Bill Burch and Dr Richard Fawdry</ref>\n\n==Radiation dose==\nA patient undergoing a nuclear medicine procedure will receive a radiation dose. Under present international guidelines it is assumed that any radiation dose, however small, presents a risk. The radiation dose delivered to a patient in a nuclear medicine investigation, though unproven, is generally accepted to present a very small risk of inducing cancer. In this respect it is similar to the risk from X-ray investigations except that the dose is delivered internally rather than from an external source such as an X-ray machine, and dosage amounts are typically significantly higher than those of X-rays.\n\nThe radiation dose from a nuclear medicine investigation is expressed as an [[Effective dose (radiation safety)|effective dose]] with units of [[sievert]]s (usually given in millisieverts, mSv). The effective dose resulting from an investigation is influenced by the amount of radioactivity administered in mega[[becquerel]]s (MBq), the [[half-life|physical properties]] of the [[radiopharmaceutical]] used, its distribution in the body and its rate of clearance from the body.\n\nEffective doses can range from 6 \u03bcSv (0.006 mSv) for a 3 MBq [[chromium]]-51 EDTA measurement of glomerular filtration rate to 37 mSv (37,000 \u03bcSv) for a 150 MBq [[thallium]]-201 non-specific tumour imaging procedure. The common bone scan with 600 MBq of technetium-99m-MDP has an effective dose of approximately 3.5 mSv (3,500 \u03bcSv) (1).\n\nFormerly, units of measurement were the [[curie]] (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 [[grams]] of [[Radium]] ([[Ra-226]]); the [[rad (unit)|rad]] (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the [[Gray (unit)|gray]]; and the rem ([[R\u00f6ntgen equivalent man]]), now replaced with the [[sievert]]. The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only [[alpha radiation]] will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher [[Relative Biological Effectiveness]] (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively before the advent of nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of [[Health Physics]]; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of [[Medical Physics]].\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Human subject research]]\n* [[List of Nuclear Medicine Societies]]\n* [[Nuclear medicine physician]]\n* [[Radiographer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Mas JC | title = A Patient's Guide to Nuclear Medicine Procedures: English-Spanish. | publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine | date = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-9726478-9-2 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Taylor A, Schuster DM, Naomi Alazraki N | title = A Clinicians' Guide to Nuclear Medicine | edition = 2nd | publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-932004-72-7 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Shumate MJ, Kooby DA, Alazraki NP | title = A Clinician's Guide to Nuclear Oncology: Practical Molecular Imaging and Radionuclide Therapies.| publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine | date = January 2007 | isbn = 978-0-9726478-8-5 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Ell P, Gambhir S | title = Nuclear Medicine in Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | date = 2004 | pages = 1950 | isbn = 978-0-443-07312-0}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Jones DW, Hogg P, Seeram E | title = Practical SPECT/CT In Nuclear Medicine | date = March 2013 | isbn = 978-1447147022 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Nuclear medicine}}\n{{wikibooks|Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine}}\n{{wikinewspar2|Canada pursues new nuclear research reactor to produce medical isotopes|Canadian nuclear reactor shutdown causes worldwide medical isotope shortage}}\n* {{DMOZ|Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties/Nuclear_Medicine/}}\n* [https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo28578 Solving the Medical Isotope Crisis] Hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, First Session, September 9, 2009\n\n{{Library resources box \n|by=no \n|onlinebooks=no \n|others=no \n|about=yes \n|label=Nuclear medicine}}\n\n{{Medicine}}\n{{Nuclear technology}}\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Radiology]]\n[[Category:Nuclear medicine| ]]\n[[Category:Medicinal radiochemistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox interventions \n|  Name        = Nuclear medicine\n|  Image       = \n|  Caption     = \n|  ICD10       = {{ICD10PCS|C|C}} \n|  ICD9unlinked = {{ICD9proc|92}} \n|  MeshID      = D009683\n|  OPS301      = {{OPS301|3-70}}-{{OPS301|3-72}}, {{OPS301|8-53}} \n|  OtherCodes  = \n}}\n\n'''Nuclear medicine''' is a [[medical specialty]] involving the application of [[radioactivity|radioactive]] substances in the diagnosis and treatment of [[disease]]. Nuclear medicine imaging, in a sense, is \"[[radiology]] done inside out\" or \"endoradiology\" because it records radiation emitting from within the body rather than [[radiation]] that is generated by external sources like [[X-rays]]. In addition, nuclear medicine scans differ from radiology as the emphasis is not on imaging anatomy but the function and for such reason, it is called a [[Functional imaging|physiological imaging modality]]. [[Single photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) and [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintpetershcs.com/Nuclear-Medicine|title=Nuclear Medicine|access-date=20 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Diagnostic medical imaging ==\n\n===Diagnostic===\nIn nuclear medicine imaging, [[radiopharmaceuticals]] are taken internally, for example, intravenously or orally. Then, external detectors ([[gamma camera]]s) capture and form images from the radiation emitted by the radiopharmaceuticals. This process is unlike a diagnostic X-ray, where external radiation is passed through the body to form an image.\n\nThere are several techniques of diagnostic nuclear medicine. \n* 2D: ''[[Scintigraphy]]'' (\"scint\") is the use of internal radionuclides to create two-dimensional images.<ref>[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/scintigraphy scintigraphy] Citing: Dorland's Medical Dictionary for Health Consumers, 2007 by Saunders; Saunders Comprehensive Veterinary Dictionary, 3 ed. 2007; McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary of Modern Medicine, 2002 by The McGraw-Hill Companies</ref>\n<gallery>\n  File:Nl bone scan2.jpg|A nuclear medicine whole body bone scan.

Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.). In addition, there are nuclear medicine studies that allow imaging of the whole body based on certain cellular receptors or functions. Examples are whole body [[PET scan]]s or [[PET-CT|PET/CT]] scans, [[gallium scan]]s, [[indium white blood cell scan]]s, [[MIBG]] and [[octreotide scan]]s.\n[[File:Iodine wb scan.jpg|thumb|Iodine-123 whole body scan for thyroid cancer evaluation. The study above was performed after the total thyroidectomy and TSH stimulation with thyroid hormone medication withdrawal. The study shows a small residual thyroid tissue in the neck and a mediastinum lesion, consistent with the thyroid cancer metastatic disease. The observable uptakes in the stomach and bladder are normal physiologic findings.]]\nWhile the ability of nuclear metabolism to image disease processes from differences in metabolism is unsurpassed, it is not unique. Certain techniques such as [[fMRI]] image tissues (particularly cerebral tissues) by blood flow and thus show metabolism. Also, contrast-enhancement techniques in both CT and MRI show regions of tissue that are handling pharmaceuticals differently, due to an inflammatory process.\n\nDiagnostic tests in nuclear medicine exploit the way that the body handles substances differently when there is disease or pathology present. The radionuclide introduced into the body is often chemically bound to a complex that acts characteristically within the body; this is commonly known as a [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]]. In the presence of disease, a tracer will often be distributed around the body and/or processed differently. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate ([[Medronic acid|MDP]]) can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching [[technetium-99m]] to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a \"hot spot\", which is a focal increase in radio accumulation or a general increase in radio accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a \"cold spot\". Many tracer complexes have been developed to image or treat many different organs, glands, and physiological processes.\n\n=== Hybrid scanning techniques ===\nIn some centers, the nuclear medicine scans can be superimposed, using software or hybrid cameras, on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight the part of the body in which the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated. This practice is often referred to as image fusion or co-registration, for example SPECT/CT and PET/CT. The fusion imaging technique in nuclear medicine provides information about the anatomy and function, which would otherwise be unavailable or would require a more invasive procedure or surgery.\n<gallery>\n  File:nl petct.jpg|Normal whole body PET/CT scan with [[Fludeoxyglucose (18F)|FDG]]-18. The whole body PET/CT scan is commonly used in the detection, staging and follow-up of various cancers.\n  File:abnl petct.jpg|Abnormal whole body PET/CT scan with multiple metastases from a cancer. The whole body PET/CT scan has become an important tool in the evaluation of cancer.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Practical concerns in nuclear imaging ===\n\nAlthough the risks of low-level radiation exposures are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human radiation exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, \"ALARP\". (Originally, this was known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), but this has changed in modern draftings of the legislation to add more emphasis on the \"Reasonably\" and less on the \"Achievable\".)\n\nWorking with the ALARP principle, before a patient is exposed for a nuclear medicine examination, the benefit of the examination must be identified. This needs to take into account the particular circumstances of the patient in question, where appropriate. For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.\n\nWhen the benefit does justify the procedure, then the radiation exposure (the amount of radiation given to the patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image and make it more photographically appealing, but if the clinical question can be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.\n\nAs a result, the radiation dose from nuclear medicine imaging varies greatly depending on the type of study. The effective radiation dose can be lower than or comparable to or can far exceed the general day-to-day environmental annual [[background radiation]] dose. Likewise, it can also be less than, in the range of, or higher than the radiation dose from an abdomen/pelvis CT scan.\n\nSome nuclear medicine procedures require special patient preparation before the study to obtain the most accurate result. Pre-imaging preparations may include dietary preparation or the withholding of certain medications. Patients are encouraged to consult with the nuclear medicine department prior to a scan.\n\n=== Analysis ===\n\nThe end result of the nuclear medicine imaging process is a \"dataset\" comprising one or more images. In multi-image datasets the array of images may represent a time sequence (i.e. cine or movie) often called a \"dynamic\" dataset, a cardiac gated time sequence, or a spatial sequence where the gamma-camera is moved relative to the patient. [[Single photon emission computed tomography|SPECT]] (single photon emission computed tomography) is the process by which images acquired from a rotating gamma-camera are reconstructed to produce an image of a \"slice\" through the patient at a particular position. A collection of parallel slices form a slice-stack, a [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] representation of the distribution of radionuclide in the patient.\n\nThe nuclear medicine computer may require millions of lines of source code to provide quantitative analysis packages for each of the specific imaging techniques available in nuclear medicine.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nTime sequences can be further analysed using [[Receptor-ligand kinetics|kinetic]] models such as [[multi-compartment model]]s or a [[Patlak plot]].\n\n==Interventional nuclear medicine==\n{{Main|Unsealed source radiotherapy|Brachytherapy}}\nRadionuclide therapy can be used to treat conditions such as [[hyperthyroidism]], [[thyroid cancer]], and blood disorders.\n\nIn nuclear medicine therapy, the radiation treatment dose is administered internally (e.g. intravenous or oral routes) rather than from an external radiation source.\n\nThe radiopharmaceuticals used in nuclear medicine therapy emit ionizing radiation that travels only a short distance, thereby minimizing unwanted side effects and damage to noninvolved organs or nearby structures. Most nuclear medicine therapies can be performed as outpatient procedures since there are few side effects from the treatment and the radiation exposure to the general public can be kept within a safe limit.\n\n'''Common nuclear medicine [[Unsealed source radiotherapy|(unsealed source) therapies]]'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The multidisciplinary nature of nuclear medicine makes it difficult for medical historians to determine the birthdate of nuclear medicine. This can probably be best placed between the discovery of artificial radioactivity in 1934 and the production of radionuclides by [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] for medicine related use, in 1946.<ref name=\"Edwards\">Edwards Cl: Tumor localizing radionuclides in retrospect and prospect. Semin Nucl Med 3:186\u2013189, 1979.</ref>\n\nThe origins of this medical idea date back as far as the mid-1920s in [[Freiburg]], Germany, when [[George de Hevesy]] made experiments with radionuclides administered to rats, thus displaying metabolic pathways of these substances and establishing the [[Radioactive tracer|tracer]] principle. Possibly, the genesis of this medical field took place in 1936, when [[John H. Lawrence|John Lawrence]], known as \"the father of nuclear medicine\", took a leave of absence from his faculty position at [[Yale Medical School]], to visit his brother [[Ernest Lawrence]] at his new radiation laboratory (now known as the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]) in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]]. Later on, John Lawrence made the first application in patients of an artificial radionuclide when he used [[phosphorus-32]] to treat [[leukemia]].<ref>[http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/40/1/16N.full.pdf Donner Laboratory: The Birthplace of. Nuclear Medicine]</ref><ref>[http://interactive.snm.org/index.cfm?PageID=1107 Important Moments in the History of Nuclear Medicine]</ref>\n \nMany historians consider the discovery of artificially produced radionuclides by [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie]] and [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie]] in 1934 as the most significant milestone in nuclear medicine.<ref name=\"Edwards\" /> In February 1934, they reported the first artificial production of radioactive material in the journal [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], after discovering radioactivity in aluminum foil that was irradiated with a polonium preparation. Their work built upon earlier discoveries by [[Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen]] for X-ray, [[Henri Becquerel]] for radioactive uranium salts, and [[Marie Curie]] (mother of Ir\u00e8ne Curie) for radioactive thorium, polonium and coining the term \"radioactivity.\" [[Taro Takemi]] studied the application of [[nuclear physics]] to medicine in the 1930s. The history of nuclear medicine will not be complete without mentioning these early pioneers.\n \nNuclear medicine gained public recognition as a potential specialty when on May 11,1946 an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) by Massachusetts General Hospital's Dr. [[Saul Hertz]] and Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Dr.Arthur Roberts, described the successful use of treating Graves' Disease with radioactive iodine (RAI) was published.<ref name=\"pmid21025609\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hertz S, Roberts A | title = Radioactive iodine in the study of thyroid physiology; the use of radioactive iodine therapy in hyperthyroidism | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 81\u20136 | date = May 1946 | pmid = 21025609 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1946.02870190005002| url = }}</ref> Additionally, [[Sam Seidlin]].<ref name=\"pmid20274882\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Seidlin SM, Marinelli LD, Oshry E | title = Radioactive iodine therapy; effect on functioning metastases of adenocarcinoma of the thyroid | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 132 | issue = 14 | pages = 838\u201347 | date = December 1946 | pmid = 20274882 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1946.02870490016004| url = }}</ref> brought further development in the field describing a successful treatment of a patient with thyroid cancer metastases using radioiodine ([[I-131]]). These articles are considered by many historians as the most important articles ever published in nuclear medicine.<ref name=\"nmtext\">{{cite book | vauthors = Henkin R, etal | title = Nuclear Medicine | edition = First | date = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-8016-7701-4}}</ref> Although the earliest use of I-131 was devoted to therapy of thyroid cancer, its use was later expanded to include imaging of the thyroid gland, quantification of the thyroid function, and therapy for hyperthyroidism. Among the many radionuclides that were discovered for medical-use, none were as important as the discovery and development of [[Technetium-99m]]. It was first discovered in 1937 by C. Perrier and E. Segre as an artificial element to fill space number 43 in the Periodic Table. The development of a [[radionuclide generator|generator]] system to produce Technetium-99m in the 1960s became a practical method for medical use. Today, Technetium-99m is the most utilized element in nuclear medicine and is employed in a wide variety of nuclear medicine imaging studies.\n \nWidespread clinical use of nuclear medicine began in the early 1950s, as knowledge expanded about radionuclides, detection of radioactivity, and using certain radionuclides to trace biochemical processes. Pioneering works by [[Benedict Cassen]] in developing the first [[rectilinear scanner]] and [[Hal O. Anger]]'s scintillation camera ([[Anger camera]]) broadened the young discipline of nuclear medicine into a full-fledged medical imaging specialty.\n\nBy the early 1960s, in southern [[Scandinavia]], [[Niels A. Lassen]], [[:sv:David H. Ingvar|David H. Ingvar]], and [[:da:Erik Skinh\u00f8j|Erik Skinh\u00f8j]] developed techniques that provided the first blood flow maps of the brain, which initially involved [[xenon-133]] inhalation;<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Lassen NA, Ingvar DH  |author-link1=Niels A.

In 1971, [[American Medical Association]] officially recognized nuclear medicine as a medical specialty.<ref name=\"snm\">{{cite web |url= http://interactive.snm.org/docs/whatisnucmed.pdf |title=What is nuclear medicine|website=Society of Nuclear Medicine}}</ref> In 1972, the [[American Board of Nuclear Medicine]] was established, and in 1974, the [[American Osteopathic Board of Nuclear Medicine]] was established, cementing nuclear medicine as a stand-alone medical specialty.\n \nIn the 1980s, radiopharmaceuticals were designed for use in diagnosis of heart disease. The development of single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), around the same time, led to three-dimensional reconstruction of the heart and establishment of the field of nuclear cardiology.\n\nMore recent developments in nuclear medicine include the invention of the first positron emission tomography scanner ([[positron emission tomography|PET]]). The concept of emission and transmission tomography, later developed into single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), was introduced by [[David E. Kuhl]] and Roy Edwards in the late 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Their work led to the design and construction of several tomographic instruments at the University of Pennsylvania. Tomographic imaging techniques were further developed at the Washington University School of Medicine. These innovations led to fusion imaging with SPECT and CT by Bruce Hasegawa from University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and the first PET/CT prototype by D. W. Townsend from University of Pittsburgh in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nPET and PET/CT imaging experienced slower growth in its early years owing to the cost of the modality and the requirement for an on-site or nearby cyclotron. However, an administrative decision to approve medical reimbursement of limited PET and PET/CT applications in oncology has led to phenomenal growth and widespread acceptance over the last few years, which also was facilitated by establishing 18F-labelled tracers for standard procedures, allowing work at non-cyclotron-equipped sites. PET/CT imaging is now an integral part of oncology for diagnosis, staging and treatment monitoring. A fully integrated MRI/PET scanner is on the market from early 2011.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Sources of radionuclides ==\n{{see also|Radiopharmacology|}}\n<sup>99m</sup>Tc is normally supplied to hospitals through a [[radionuclide generator]] containing the parent radionuclide [[molybdenum-99]]. <sup>99</sup>Mo is [[Technetium-99m#Production|typically obtained]] as a fission product of [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] in nuclear reactors, however global supply shortages have lead to the exploration of [[Technetium-99m#Production|other methods of production]]. About a third of the world's supply, and most of Europe's supply, of medical isotopes is produced at the [[Petten nuclear reactor]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Another third of the world's supply, and most of North America's supply, was produced at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] in [[Chalk River, Ontario|Chalk River]], [[Ontario]], Canada until its permanent shutdown in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=Canada permanently closes NRU research reactor |url=https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newscanada-permanently-closes-nru-research-reactor-6107149/ |website=Nuclear Engineering International |date=6 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe most commonly used radioisotope in PET [[Fluorine-18|<sup>18</sup>F]], is not produced in any nuclear reactor, but rather in a circular accelerator called a [[cyclotron]]. The cyclotron is used to accelerate [[proton]]s to bombard the stable heavy isotope of oxygen [[Oxygen-18|<sup>18</sup>O]]. The <sup>18</sup>O constitutes about 0.20% of ordinary [[oxygen]] (mostly [[oxygen-16]]), from which it is extracted.

Some studies require the labeling of a patient's own blood cells with a radionuclide ([[leukocyte scintigraphy]] and [[red blood cell]] scintigraphy). Most diagnostic radionuclides emit [[gamma ray]]s either directly from their decay or indirectly through [[electron-positron annihilation]], while the cell-damaging properties of [[beta particles]] are used in therapeutic applications. Refined radionuclides for use in nuclear medicine are derived from [[nuclear fission|fission]] or fusion processes in [[nuclear reactor]]s, which produce radionuclides with longer half-lives, or [[cyclotron]]s, which produce radionuclides with shorter half-lives, or take advantage of natural decay processes in dedicated generators, i.e. molybdenum/technetium or strontium/rubidium.\n\nThe most commonly used intravenous radionuclides are technetium-99m, iodine-123, iodine-131, thallium-201, gallium-67, fluorine-18 [[fluorodeoxyglucose]], and indium-111 labeled [[leukocyte]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} The most commonly used gaseous/aerosol radionuclides are xenon-133, krypton-81m, ([[aerosolised]]) technetium-99m.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718042409/http://jcsmr.anu.edu.au/technegas/home.html Technegas] a radioaerosol invented in Australia by Dr Bill Burch and Dr Richard Fawdry</ref>\n\n==Radiation dose==\nA patient undergoing a nuclear medicine procedure will receive a radiation dose. Under present international guidelines it is assumed that any radiation dose, however small, presents a risk. The radiation dose delivered to a patient in a nuclear medicine investigation, though unproven, is generally accepted to present a very small risk of inducing cancer. In this respect it is similar to the risk from X-ray investigations except that the dose is delivered internally rather than from an external source such as an X-ray machine, and dosage amounts are typically significantly higher than those of X-rays.\n\nThe radiation dose from a nuclear medicine investigation is expressed as an [[Effective dose (radiation safety)|effective dose]] with units of [[sievert]]s (usually given in millisieverts, mSv). The effective dose resulting from an investigation is influenced by the amount of radioactivity administered in mega[[becquerel]]s (MBq), the [[half-life|physical properties]] of the [[radiopharmaceutical]] used, its distribution in the body and its rate of clearance from the body.\n\nEffective doses can range from 6 \u03bcSv (0.006 mSv) for a 3 MBq [[chromium]]-51 EDTA measurement of glomerular filtration rate to 37 mSv (37,000 \u03bcSv) for a 150 MBq [[thallium]]-201 non-specific tumour imaging procedure. The common bone scan with 600 MBq of technetium-99m-MDP has an effective dose of approximately 3.5 mSv (3,500 \u03bcSv) (1).\n\nFormerly, units of measurement were the [[curie]] (Ci), being 3.7E10 Bq, and also 1.0 [[grams]] of [[Radium]] ([[Ra-226]]); the [[rad (unit)|rad]] (radiation absorbed dose), now replaced by the [[Gray (unit)|gray]]; and the rem ([[R\u00f6ntgen equivalent man]]), now replaced with the [[sievert]]. The rad and rem are essentially equivalent for almost all nuclear medicine procedures, and only [[alpha radiation]] will produce a higher Rem or Sv value, due to its much higher [[Relative Biological Effectiveness]] (RBE). Alpha emitters are nowadays rarely used in nuclear medicine, but were used extensively before the advent of nuclear reactor and accelerator produced radionuclides. The concepts involved in radiation exposure to humans are covered by the field of [[Health Physics]]; the development and practice of safe and effective nuclear medicinal techniques is a key focus of [[Medical Physics]].\n\n== See also ==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n* [[Human subject research]]\n* [[List of Nuclear Medicine Societies]]\n* [[Nuclear medicine physician]]\n* [[Radiographer]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Mas JC | title = A Patient's Guide to Nuclear Medicine Procedures: English-Spanish. | publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine | date = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-9726478-9-2 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Taylor A, Schuster DM, Naomi Alazraki N | title = A Clinicians' Guide to Nuclear Medicine | edition = 2nd | publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-932004-72-7 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Shumate MJ, Kooby DA, Alazraki NP | title = A Clinician's Guide to Nuclear Oncology: Practical Molecular Imaging and Radionuclide Therapies.| publisher = Society of Nuclear Medicine | date = January 2007 | isbn = 978-0-9726478-8-5 }}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Ell P, Gambhir S | title = Nuclear Medicine in Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | date = 2004 | pages = 1950 | isbn = 978-0-443-07312-0}}\n* {{cite book | vauthors = Jones DW, Hogg P, Seeram E | title = Practical SPECT/CT In Nuclear Medicine | date = March 2013 | isbn = 978-1447147022 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Nuclear medicine}}\n{{wikibooks|Basic Physics of Nuclear Medicine}}\n{{wikinewspar2|Canada pursues new nuclear research reactor to produce medical isotopes|Canadian nuclear reactor shutdown causes worldwide medical isotope shortage}}\n* {{DMOZ|Health/Medicine/Medical_Specialties/Nuclear_Medicine/}}\n* [https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo28578 Solving the Medical Isotope Crisis] Hearing before the Subcommittee on Energy and Environment of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of Representatives, One Hundred Eleventh Congress, First Session, September 9, 2009\n\n{{Library resources box \n|by=no \n|onlinebooks=no \n|others=no \n|about=yes \n|label=Nuclear medicine}}\n\n{{Medicine}}\n{{Nuclear technology}}\n{{Portal bar|Nuclear technology|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Radiology]]\n[[Category:Nuclear medicine| ]]\n[[Category:Medicinal radiochemistry]]\n", "name_user": "Ian R Bryce", "label": "safe", "comment": "Parsing only.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"}

Bonifacio planned to capture ''El Polvorin'', the San Jose del Monte powder magazine along with ''El Dep\u00f3sito'', a water station supplying Manila. The defending Spaniards were outnumbered, but fought the rebels until reinforcements arrived. Once reinforced, the Spaniards drove Bonifacio's forces back with heavy casualties.

In Pandacan ''Katipuneros'' attacked the parish church, making the parish priest run for his life.<ref name=\"Agoncillo 1990 p=173\" />\n\nAfter their defeat in San Juan del Monte, Bonifacio's troops regrouped near [[Marikina]], [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] and [[Montalban, Rizal|Montalban]], where they proceeded to attack these areas. They captured these areas but were driven back by Spanish counterattacks, and Bonifacio eventually ordered a retreat to Balara. On the way, Bonifacio was nearly killed shielding [[Emilio Jacinto]] from a Spanish bullet that grazed his collar.<ref name=\"Agoncillo 1990 p=173\" /> Despite his reverses, Bonifacio was not completely defeated and was still considered a threat.<ref name=\"salazar\" />\n\nNorth of Manila, the towns of [[San Francisco de Malabon]], [[Noveleta, Cavite|Noveleta]] and [[Kawit, Cavite|Kawit]] in [[Cavite]] rose in rebellion.<ref name=\"Agoncillo 1990 p=173\" /> In [[Nueva Ecija]] rebels in San Isidro led by Mariano Llanera attacked the Spanish garrison on September 2\u20134; they were repulsed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=174}}</ref>\n\nBy 30 August, the revolt had spread to eight [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], prompting the Spanish Governor-General [[Ram\u00f3n Blanco, 1st Marquis of Pe\u00f1a Plata]], to declare a \"state of war\" in these provinces and place them under [[martial law]].

It is located in the [[Thunder Bay District]], at the north end of [[Ontario Highway 614|Highway 614]], {{convert|331|km}} east of [[Thunder Bay]] and {{convert|378|km}} north-west of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]].\n\n==History==\n\nManitouwadge (''Manidoowaazh'' in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], meaning \"Cave of the Great Spirit\") is part of the wide-ranging territory of the [[Ojibwe]] people.  The town itself was founded by General Engineering Co Limited (later as [[Noranda (mining company)|Noranda]] and now part of [[Xstrata]]) after staking claims in 1953 to support of [[copper]] mine.<ref>https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/manitouwadge</ref> The other mine in Manitouwadge is the Willroy mine, named after two of the \"Weekend Prospectors\"  '''Will'''iam Dawidowich and '''Roy''' Barker. Full production at Geco and Willroy began in 1957.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1974 Manitouwadge was classified as an Improvement District.  The community became an incorporated township in 1975.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[gold]] was discovered at [[Hemlo, Ontario|Hemlo]],<ref name=\"Barnes1\">{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Michael|title=Gold in Ontario|date=1995|publisher=The Boston Mills Press|location=Erin|isbn=155046146X|pages=91\u201394}}</ref>  near the intersection of [[List of secondary highways in Thunder Bay District#Highway 614|highways 614]] and [[Ontario Highway 17|17]], about {{convert|50|km}} south of the town. Noranda acquired the mining rights to a significant portion of the ground in that area, and built the [[Golden Giant Mine]]. It offered housing in Manitouwadge to many of the employees of the new mine, and the town boomed.\n\nWhen the Geco mine closed in 1995, Manitouwadge's population decreased significantly. After peaking at nearly 4000 people in the early 1990s, it decreased to less than 3000 by 2001. With the closing of the Golden Giant Mine in 2006, the population dropped to 2,100 by 2011.<ref name=\"cp2011\"/>\n\n===Today===\n\nWhile mining has always been at the forefront of Manitouwadge's economic activity, forestry also plays a significant part in the town's economy. The town is also turning itself into a retirement community, offering some of the lowest housing prices in the country.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=1,937 | 2016_pop_delta=-8.0 | 2016_land_area=352.07 | 2016_pop_density=5.5\n |2016_median_age=50.3 | 2016_median_age_m=49.5 | 2016_median_age_f=51.1\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=1,082 | 2016_mean_hh_income=66,048 | 2016_access_date=2019-07-13\n |2011_population=2,105 | 2011_pop_delta=-8.5 | 2011_land_area=352.06 | 2011_pop_density=6.0\n |2011_median_age= | 2011_median_age_m= | 2011_median_age_f=\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=1,129 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-03-29\n |2006_population=2,300 | 2006_pop_delta=-22.0 | 2006_land_area=351.97 | 2006_pop_density=6.5\n |2006_median_age=42.8 | 2006_median_age_m=43.4 | 2006_median_age_f=42.2\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=1,212 | 2006_mean_hh_income=78,894 | 2006_access_date=2011-04-21\n |2001_population=2,949 | 2001_pop_delta=-13.1 | 2001_land_area=351.97 | 2001_pop_density=8.4\n |2001_median_age=36.6 | 2001_median_age_m=38.1 | 2001_median_age_f=35.0\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=1,317 | 2001_mean_hh_income=70,921 | 2001_access_date=2011-04-21\n}}\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Manitouwadge, Ontario Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = centre\n|percentages = \n|footnote    = <ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 1996 Census|1996]], [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], [[Canada 2006 Census|2006]], [[Canada 2011 Census|2011]] census</ref><ref name=\"cp2011m\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n| 1991| 3972\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]| 3395\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]| 2949\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]| 2300\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]| 2105\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]| 1937\n}}\n\n==Recreation==\n\nCurrently there are no recreational activities due to corona virus\n\n===Hiking and skiing===\n\nTrails for hiking in the summer and trails for snowmobilers in the winter are also abundant.

It is located in the [[Thunder Bay District]], at the north end of [[Ontario Highway 614|Highway 614]], {{convert|331|km}} east of [[Thunder Bay]] and {{convert|378|km}} north-west of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]].\n\n==History==\n\nManitouwadge (''Manidoowaazh'' in [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], meaning \"Cave of the Great Spirit\") is part of the wide-ranging territory of the [[Ojibwe]] people.  The town itself was founded by General Engineering Co Limited (later as [[Noranda (mining company)|Noranda]] and now part of [[Xstrata]]) after staking claims in 1953 to support of [[copper]] mine.<ref>https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/manitouwadge</ref> The other mine in Manitouwadge is the Willroy mine, named after two of the \"Weekend Prospectors\"  '''Will'''iam Dawidowich and '''Roy''' Barker. Full production at Geco and Willroy began in 1957.\n\nFrom 1954 to 1974 Manitouwadge was classified as an Improvement District.  The community became an incorporated township in 1975.\n\nIn the early 1980s, [[gold]] was discovered at [[Hemlo, Ontario|Hemlo]],<ref name=\"Barnes1\">{{cite book|last1=Barnes|first1=Michael|title=Gold in Ontario|date=1995|publisher=The Boston Mills Press|location=Erin|isbn=155046146X|pages=91\u201394}}</ref>  near the intersection of [[List of secondary highways in Thunder Bay District#Highway 614|highways 614]] and [[Ontario Highway 17|17]], about {{convert|50|km}} south of the town. Noranda acquired the mining rights to a significant portion of the ground in that area, and built the [[Golden Giant Mine]]. It offered housing in Manitouwadge to many of the employees of the new mine, and the town boomed.\n\nWhen the Geco mine closed in 1995, Manitouwadge's population decreased significantly. After peaking at nearly 4000 people in the early 1990s, it decreased to less than 3000 by 2001. With the closing of the Golden Giant Mine in 2006, the population dropped to 2,100 by 2011.<ref name=\"cp2011\"/>\n\n===Today===\n\nWhile mining has always been at the forefront of Manitouwadge's economic activity, forestry also plays a significant part in the town's economy. The town is also turning itself into a retirement community, offering some of the lowest housing prices in the country.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=1,937 | 2016_pop_delta=-8.0 | 2016_land_area=352.07 | 2016_pop_density=5.5\n |2016_median_age=50.3 | 2016_median_age_m=49.5 | 2016_median_age_f=51.1\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=1,082 | 2016_mean_hh_income=66,048 | 2016_access_date=2019-07-13\n |2011_population=2,105 | 2011_pop_delta=-8.5 | 2011_land_area=352.06 | 2011_pop_density=6.0\n |2011_median_age= | 2011_median_age_m= | 2011_median_age_f=\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=1,129 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-03-29\n |2006_population=2,300 | 2006_pop_delta=-22.0 | 2006_land_area=351.97 | 2006_pop_density=6.5\n |2006_median_age=42.8 | 2006_median_age_m=43.4 | 2006_median_age_f=42.2\n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=1,212 | 2006_mean_hh_income=78,894 | 2006_access_date=2011-04-21\n |2001_population=2,949 | 2001_pop_delta=-13.1 | 2001_land_area=351.97 | 2001_pop_density=8.4\n |2001_median_age=36.6 | 2001_median_age_m=38.1 | 2001_median_age_f=35.0\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=1,317 | 2001_mean_hh_income=70,921 | 2001_access_date=2011-04-21\n}}\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Manitouwadge, Ontario Historical populations\n|type        = Canada\n|align       = centre\n|percentages = \n|footnote    = <ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 1996 Census|1996]], [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], [[Canada 2006 Census|2006]], [[Canada 2011 Census|2011]] census</ref><ref name=\"cp2011m\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n| 1991| 3972\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]| 3395\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]| 2949\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]| 2300\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]| 2105\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]| 1937\n}}\n\n==Recreation==\n\nCurrently there are no recreational activities due to corona virus\n\n===Hiking and skiing===\n\nTrails for hiking in the summer and trails for snowmobilers in the winter are also abundant.

Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that, at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to \"smear\" and discredit the victim's family, in order to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] ordered an independent inquiry by a prominent [[Queens Counsel|QC]] into undercover policing and corruption, which was described as \"devastating\" when published in 2014.

Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2006, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that, at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to \"smear\" and discredit the victim's family, in order to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both [[Scotland Yard]] and the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] ordered an independent inquiry by a prominent [[Queens Counsel|QC]] into undercover policing and corruption, which was described as \"devastating\" when published in 2014.

The single-bay inverted sesquiplane wings were braced with streamlined struts and wires and were characterised by their squared off wing-tips, constant chord, and moderate 3\u00b0 30' dihedral on the lower mainplanes. The square section fuselage, rounded off at the nose, housed the four crew in three open cockpits with pilot and co-pilot side by side. At the aft end of the fuselage a large triangular fin, with rudder, supported the biplane tailplanes, which were also strut-braced. The tail-skid undercarriage had mainwheels on divided axles, strut-supported beneath the engines and attached to the lower longerons of the fuselage. Controls were conventional with elevators on upper and lower tailplanes, large horn-balanced rudder and horn balanced ailerons on the lower wings only.<ref name=\"Caproni\"/>\n\nThe Ca.67 was similar to the Caproni Ca.66 in overall design and span but differed in having 2 [[Lorraine-Dietrich 12Db]] engines and increased payload.
