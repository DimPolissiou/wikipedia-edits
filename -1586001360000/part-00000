The fourth season continues in Lima with a new generation of students but will also follow some of the McKinley graduates from the third season, notably to the fictional New York Academy of the Dramatic Arts (NYADA) in New York City. The season follows the club competing on the show choir circuit, while its members, faculty and alumni deal with [[Adolescent sexuality|sex]], [[bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], [[gender identity]], [[child sexual abuse|child molestation]], [[dyslexia]], [[school violence]], [[false pregnancy|pregnancy scares]] and other social issues. As of the season premiere, fourteen main cast members retained that status from the third season: glee club director [[Will Schuester]] ([[Matthew Morrison]]), cheerleading coach [[Sue Sylvester]] ([[Jane Lynch]]), glee club members [[Artie Abrams]] ([[Kevin McHale (actor)|Kevin McHale]]), [[Blaine Anderson]] ([[Darren Criss]]), [[Tina Cohen-Chang]] ([[Jenna Ushkowitz]]), and [[Brittany Pierce]] ([[Heather Morris]]), and graduates [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), [[Mike Chang]] ([[Harry Shum, Jr.]]), [[Finn Hudson]] ([[Cory Monteith]]), [[Kurt Hummel]] ([[Chris Colfer]]), [[Mercedes Jones]] ([[Amber Riley]]), [[Santana Lopez]] ([[Naya Rivera]]) and [[Puck (Glee)|Noah \"Puck\" Puckerman]] ([[Mark Salling]]).

If one conceives of religion and science according to these definitions then a conflict between them appears impossible. For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary.

What he finds particularly odd and unjustified is in how atheists often come to invoke scientific authority on their non-scientific philosophical conclusions like there being no point or no meaning to the universe as the only viable option when the scientific method and science never have had any way of addressing questions of meaning or God in the first place.

By 1616 [[Galileo]] went to Rome to try to persuade Catholic Church authorities not to ban Copernicus' ideas. In the end, a decree of the Congregation of the Index was issued, declaring that the ideas that the Sun stood still and that the Earth moved were \"false\" and \"altogether contrary to Holy Scripture\", and suspending Copernicus's ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'' until it could be corrected. Galileo was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves. He was required to \"abjure, curse and detest\" those opinions.<ref>Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288\u201393).</ref> However, before all this, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in a book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism as physically proven since the scientific consensus at the time was that the evidence for heliocentrism was very weak. The Church had merely sided with the scientific consensus of the time.  Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often portrayed as an unlearned fool who lacked mathematical training. Although the preface of his book claims that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name \"Simplicio\" in Italian also has the connotation of \"simpleton\".<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoonworldsy00gali/page/82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&Wallace-2003|Moss & Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&pg=PA11 p. 11]</ref> Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.<ref>See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133\u201334)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says \"this of course is untrue\" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].</ref> However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the physical Copernican advocacy.

''[[Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. Ballantine Books, 1999.</ref> While Gould spoke of independence from the perspective of science, [[W. T.

Stace]], ''[[Time and Eternity: an Essay in the Philosophy of Religion]]'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, NJ, 1952.</ref> They originate from different perceptions of reality, as [[Arnold O.

In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.<ref name=\"nas.edu\" /></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Archbishop [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], both science and religion represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as [[Scientific theory|descriptive]] and religion as [[Normative|prescriptive]]. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world ''ought to be'', in the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of [[Pythagoras]] in the sixth century B.C.<ref name=habgood>''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills & Brown, 1964, pp. 11, 14\u201316, 48\u201355, 68\u201369, 87, 90\u201391.</ref> In contrast, proponents of a [[science of morality|normative moral science]] take issue with the idea that science has ''no'' way of guiding \"oughts\". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by [[Galileo]] and proponents of his views.<ref name=habgood />\n\nIn the view of the [[Lubavitcher]] rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]] such as Lobachevsky's [[hyperbolic geometry]] and Riemann's [[elliptic geometry]] proved that [[Euclid]]'s axioms, such as, \"there is only one straight line between two points\", are in fact arbitrary.

Even many 19th-century Christian communities welcomed scientists who claimed that science was not at all concerned with discovering the ultimate nature of reality.<ref name=\"habgood\" /> According to [[Lawrence M.

Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a \"caricature\". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.<ref>David C.

The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], \"Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period \"characterized by dramatic revolutions in science\" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged.

Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself.

For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the \"handmaiden\" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15\u201318|editor=Ronald Numbers}}</ref>  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis<ref name=\"flat\">Jeffrey Russell.

Given the close relationship that Confucianism shares with Buddhism, many of the same arguments used to reconcile Buddhism with science also readily translate to Confucianism. However, modern scholars have also attempted to define the relationship between science and Confucianism on Confucianism's own terms and the results have usually led to the conclusion that Confucianism and science are fundamentally compatible.<ref>Mary Evelyn Tucker \"Confucianism and Ecology: The Interrelation of Heaven, Earth, and Humans (Religions of the World and Ecology)\" Center for the Study of World Religions (August 15, 1998)</ref>\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n{{See also|Hindu views on evolution|List of numbers in Hindu scriptures|Hindu cosmology|Hindu units of time|Indian astronomy|Hindu calendar|Indian mathematics|List of Indian inventions and discoveries}}\n[[File:Hindu Goddess 002.JPG|thumb|[[Saraswati]] is regarded as [[Devi|goddess]] of knowledge, music, arts and science.]]\nIn [[Hinduism]], the dividing line between objective sciences and spiritual knowledge (''adhyatma vidya'') is a linguistic paradox.<ref name=\"Mitcham\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics|author=Carl Mitcham|publisher=Macmillan Reference|year=2005|page=917|isbn=978-0-02-865831-5}}</ref> Hindu scholastic activities and ancient Indian scientific advancements were so interconnected that many [[Hindu scriptures]] are also ancient scientific manuals and vice versa.

According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents \u2013 soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}<ref>Nayanar (2005b), p. 190, G\u0101th\u0101 10.310</ref>\n\nThe Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nThrough the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

By 1616 [[Galileo]] went to Rome to try to persuade Catholic Church authorities not to ban Copernicus' ideas. In the end, a decree of the Congregation of the Index was issued, declaring that the ideas that the Sun stood still and that the Earth moved were \"false\" and \"altogether contrary to Holy Scripture\", and suspending Copernicus's ''[[De Revolutionibus]]'' until it could be corrected. Galileo was found \"vehemently suspect of heresy\", namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the center of the universe, that the Earth is not at its centre and moves. He was required to \"abjure, curse and detest\" those opinions.<ref>Fantoli (2005, p. 139), Finocchiaro (1989, pp. 288\u201393).</ref> However, before all this, Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in a book, and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism as physically proven since the scientific consensus at the time was that the evidence for heliocentrism was very weak. The Church had merely sided with the scientific consensus of the time.  Pope Urban VIII asked that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo's book. Only the latter was fulfilled by Galileo. Whether unknowingly or deliberately, Simplicio, the defender of the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic geocentric view in ''Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems'', was often portrayed as an unlearned fool who lacked mathematical training. Although the preface of his book claims that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ([[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name \"Simplicio\" in Italian also has the connotation of \"simpleton\".<ref>[[#Reference-Finocchiaro-1997|Finocchiaro (1997)]], [https://archive.org/details/galileoonworldsy00gali/page/82 p. 82]; [[#Reference-Moss&Wallace-2003|Moss & Wallace (2003)]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw50esHmgacC&pg=PA11 p. 11]</ref> Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope, Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio. Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book.<ref>See Langford [[#Reference-Langford-1998|(1966, pp. 133\u201334)]], and Seeger [[#Reference-Seeger-1966|(1966, p. 30)]], for example. Drake [[#Reference-Drake-1978|(1978, p. 355)]] asserts that Simplicio's character is modelled on the Aristotelian philosophers, Lodovico delle Colombe and [[Cesare Cremonini (philosopher)|Cesare Cremonini]], rather than Urban. He also considers that the demand for Galileo to include the Pope's argument in the ''Dialogue'' left him with no option but to put it in the mouth of Simplicio [[#Reference-Drake-1953|(Drake, 1953, p. 491)]]. Even [[Arthur Koestler]], who is generally quite harsh on Galileo in ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler non-fiction book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'' [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959)]], after noting that Urban suspected Galileo of having intended Simplicio to be a caricature of him, says \"this of course is untrue\" [[#Reference-Koestler-1990|(1959, p. 483)]].</ref> However, the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly, nor the physical Copernican advocacy.

''[[Rocks of Ages: Science and Religion in the Fullness of Life]]''. Ballantine Books, 1999.</ref> While Gould spoke of independence from the perspective of science, [[W. T. Stace]] viewed independence from the perspective of the [[philosophy of religion]].

Stace]], ''[[Time and Eternity: an Essay in the Philosophy of Religion]]'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, NJ, 1952.</ref> They originate from different perceptions of reality, as [[Arnold O.

In science, explanations must be based on evidence drawn from examining the natural world. Scientifically based observations or experiments that conflict with an explanation eventually must lead to modification or even abandonment of that explanation. Religious faith, in contrast, does not depend on empirical evidence, is not necessarily modified in the face of conflicting evidence, and typically involves supernatural forces or entities. Because they are not a part of nature, supernatural entities cannot be investigated by science. In this sense, science and religion are separate and address aspects of human understanding in different ways. Attempts to put science and religion against each other create controversy where none needs to exist.<ref name=\"nas.edu\" /></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Archbishop [[John Habgood, Baron Habgood|John Habgood]], both science and religion represent distinct ways of approaching experience and these differences are sources of debate. He views science as [[Scientific theory|descriptive]] and religion as [[Normative|prescriptive]]. He stated that if science and mathematics concentrate on what the world ''ought to be'', in the way that religion does, it may lead to improperly ascribing properties to the natural world as happened among the followers of [[Pythagoras]] in the sixth century B.C.<ref name=habgood>''Religion and Science'', [[John Habgood]], Mills & Brown, 1964, pp. 11, 14\u201316, 48\u201355, 68\u201369, 87, 90\u201391.</ref> In contrast, proponents of a [[science of morality|normative moral science]] take issue with the idea that science has ''no'' way of guiding \"oughts\". Habgood also stated that he believed that the reverse situation, where religion attempts to be descriptive, can also lead to inappropriately assigning properties to the natural world. A notable example is the now defunct belief in the [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] (geocentric) planetary model that held sway until changes in scientific and religious thinking were brought about by [[Galileo]] and proponents of his views.<ref name=habgood />\n\nIn the view of the [[Lubavitcher]] rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]] such as Lobachevsky's [[hyperbolic geometry]] and Riemann's [[elliptic geometry]] proved that [[Euclid]]'s axioms, such as, \"there is only one straight line between two points\", are in fact arbitrary.

Even many 19th-century Christian communities welcomed scientists who claimed that science was not at all concerned with discovering the ultimate nature of reality.<ref name=\"habgood\" /> According to [[Lawrence M.

In their views, not only did the monks save and cultivate the remnants of ancient civilization during the barbarian invasions, but the medieval church promoted learning and science through its sponsorship of many [[universities]] which, under its leadership, grew rapidly in Europe in the 11th and 12th centuries. Saint Thomas Aquinas, the Church's \"model theologian\", not only argued that reason is in harmony with faith, he even recognized that reason can contribute to understanding revelation, and so encouraged intellectual development. He was not unlike other medieval theologians who sought out reason in the effort to defend his faith.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fides et Ratio (Faith and Reason), IV |url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/ENCYC/JP2FIDES.HTM#Ch4b |author=Pope John Paul II |date=September 1998 |accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> Some of today's scholars, such as [[Stanley Jaki]], have claimed that Christianity with its particular [[worldview]], was a crucial factor for the emergence of modern science.<ref>Jaki, Stanley L.

Lindberg states that the widespread popular belief that the Middle Ages was a time of ignorance and superstition due to the Christian church is a \"caricature\". According to Lindberg, while there are some portions of the classical tradition which suggest this view, these were exceptional cases. It was common to tolerate and encourage critical thinking about the nature of the world. The relation between Christianity and science is complex and cannot be simplified to either harmony or conflict, according to Lindberg.<ref>David C.

The belief that God created the world and therefore humans, can lead to the view that he arranged for humans to know the world. This is underwritten by the doctrine of [[imago dei]]. In the words of [[Thomas Aquinas]], \"Since human beings are said to be in the image of God in virtue of their having a nature that includes an intellect, such a nature is most in the image of God in virtue of being most able to imitate God\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-science/#Con |title=Religion and Science (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |accessdate=2013-06-16}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a period \"characterized by dramatic revolutions in science\" and the rise of Protestant challenges to the authority of the Catholic Church via individual liberty, the authority of Christian scriptures became strongly challenged.

Dickinson also argues that immediately following the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] matters were even worse {{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The interpretations of Scripture by Luther and Calvin became as sacred to their followers as the Scripture itself.

For instance, the claim that early Christians rejected scientific findings by the Greco-Romans is false, since the \"handmaiden\" view of secular studies was seen to shed light on theology.  This view was widely adapted throughout the early medieval period and afterwards by theologians (such as Augustine) and ultimately resulted in fostering interest in knowledge about nature through time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lindberg|first=David|title=Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths About Science and Religion|chapter=Myth 1: That the Rise of Christianity was Responsible for the Demise of Ancient Science|year=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05741-8|pages=15\u201318|editor=Ronald Numbers}}</ref>  Also, the claim that people of the [[Middle Ages]] widely believed that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]] was first propagated in the same period that originated the conflict thesis<ref name=\"flat\">Jeffrey Russell.

According to Jain doctrine, the [[universe]] and its constituents \u2013 soul, matter, space, time, and principles of motion have always existed (a [[static universe]] similar to that of [[Epicureanism]] and [[Steady State theory|steady state cosmological model]]). All the constituents and actions are governed by [[Universal Law|universal]] [[natural laws]]. It is not possible to create matter out of nothing and hence the sum total of matter in the universe remains the same (similar to law of [[conservation of mass]]). Similarly, the [[soul]] of each living being is unique and uncreated and has existed since beginningless time.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}<ref>Nayanar (2005b), p. 190, G\u0101th\u0101 10.310</ref>\n\nThe Jain theory of [[Causality|causation]] holds that a cause and its effect are always identical in nature and hence a conscious and immaterial entity like God cannot create a material entity like the universe. Furthermore, according to the Jain concept of divinity, any soul who destroys its karmas and desires, achieves liberation. A soul who destroys all its passions and desires has no desire to interfere in the working of the universe. Moral rewards and sufferings are not the work of a divine being, but a result of an innate moral order in the [[cosmos]]; a self-regulating mechanism whereby the individual reaps the fruits of his own actions through the workings of the karmas.\n\nThrough the ages, [[Jain Philosophy#Jain philosophers|Jain philosophers]] have adamantly rejected and opposed the concept of creator and omnipotent God and this has resulted in Jainism being labeled as ''[[Nastika|nastika darsana]]'' or [[Atheism|atheist philosophy]] by the rival [[Indian philosophy|religious philosophies]]. The theme of non-creationism and absence of omnipotent God and divine grace runs strongly in all the philosophical dimensions of Jainism, including its [[Jain cosmology|cosmology]], [[Karma in Jainism|karma]], [[Moksa (Jainism)|moksa]] and its moral code of conduct. Jainism asserts a religious and virtuous life is possible without the idea of a creator god.<ref>{{cite journal | last =Soni | first =Jayandra | editor =E.

Roddenberry was retained as an \"executive consultant\", due to the high regard the series' fans held him in; while he had little real authority he was still kept involved in the creative process. The fans often complained about particular plot developments proposed for the films, such as the death of [[Spock]] in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|Star Trek II]]'', that Roddenberry had opposed. So, before any drafts of the screenplay for ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' were circulated, Bennett arranged for each individual copy to have subtle clues distinguishing it from the others. Shortly after Roddenberry opposed the destruction of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' at the climax of that film, fans began to complain to Paramount and Bennett. He found that a leaked copy of the script was the one given to Roddenberry, but was unable to do anything about it.<ref name=\"Star Trek films\">{{cite book|last1=Engel|first1=Joel|authorlink1=|title=Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind ''Star Trek''|pages=[https://archive.org/details/generoddenberrym00enge/page/210 210\u201311]|date=1994|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|isbn=0786860049|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/generoddenberrym00enge/page/210}}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of leaks at [[Tesla Motors]] in 2008, CEO [[Elon Musk]] reportedly sent slightly different versions of an e-mail to each employee in an attempt to reveal potential leakers. The e-mail was disguised as a request to employees to sign a new [[non-disclosure agreement]]. The plan was undermined when the company's general counsel forwarded his own unique version of the e-mail with the attached agreement. As a result, Musk's scheme was realized by employees who now had a safe copy to leak.<ref>{{cite web \n |url=http://gawker.com/5164035/tesla-ceo-in-digital-witch-hunt \n |author=Owen Thomas \n |year=2009 \n |title=Tesla CEO in Digital Witch Hunt \n |accessdate=2013-11-16 \n |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020092330/http://gawker.com/5164035/tesla-ceo-in-digital-witch-hunt \n |archivedate=2013-10-20 \n }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed as a method for the [[Presidency of Donald Trump| Trump Administration]] to catch leaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whats-in-sessions-toolkit-for-hunting-anti-trump-leakers|title=What's in Sessions' toolkit for hunting anti-Trump leakers?|last=Wallace|first=Christopher|date=2017-08-04|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, British celebrity [[Coleen Rooney]] used the technique to identify who was leaking information from her private [[Instagram]] stories to tabloid newspaper [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] by posting fake stories which were blocked to all but one account. When these details appeared in the press, she publicly identified the leaks as coming from the account of Rebekah Vardy, wife of footballer [[Jamie Vardy]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosseinsky |first1=Katie |year=2019 |title=Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account of leaking stories to the press |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/colleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-of-leaking-stories-about-her-a4257461.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=2019-10-09}}</ref>.\n\n==Barium meal test==\nAccording to the book ''[[Spycatcher]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spycatcher|last=Wright, Peter, 1916-1995.|date=1989|publisher=Mandarin|isbn=1863300007|oclc=27626618}}</ref> by [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]] (published in 1987) the technique is standard practice that has been used by [[MI5]] (and other intelligence agencies) for many years, under the name \"[[barium meal]] test\". A barium meal test is more sophisticated than a canary trap because it is flexible and may take many different forms. However, the basic premise is to reveal a secret to a suspected enemy (but nobody else) then monitor whether there is evidence of the fake information being utilised by the other side. For example, a suspected double agent could be offered some tempting \"bait\": e.g., be told that important information was stored at a [[dead drop]] site. The fake dead drop site could then be periodically checked for signs of disturbance. If the site showed signs of being disturbed (for instance, in order to copy microfilm stored there), then this would confirm that the suspected enemy really was an enemy, i.e., a double agent.\n\n==Embedding information==\nThe technique of embedding significant information in a hidden form in a medium has been used in many ways, which are usually classified according to intent:\n\n* [[Watermark]]s are used to show that items are authentic and not forged.\n* [[Steganography]] is used to hide a secret message in an apparently innocuous message, in order to escape detection.\n* A canary trap hides information in a document that uniquely identifies it, so that copies of it can be traced.\n* [[Screener (promotional)|Screener]] versions of DVDs are often marked in some way so as to allow the tracking of unauthorised releases to their source.\n* As with the ''Star Trek'' incident, major films or television productions frequently give out scripts to the cast and crew in which one or two lines are different in each individual version. Thus if the entire script is copied and leaked to the public, the producers can track down the specific person who leaked the script. In practice this does not prevent generalized information about the script from being leaked, but it does discourage leaking verbatim copies of the script itself.\n* [[Trap street]]s on maps, or intentionally fictitious streets, are sometimes included to track copyright violations by those who might republish copyrighted maps illegally.\n* [[Fictitious entry|Spurious words]] are sometimes included in dictionaries so as to detect other publishers copying from them. The [[OED]] contains an appendix of such words with which edition of which dictionary first used them and which first duplicated them.\n* [[Zero-width spaces]] are Unicode characters that are not visually rendered. An arbitrary number of these characters can be inserted betw&#8203;een the letters of a word. Though they are not visible, they will typically persist even as that word is copied and pasted and transmitted multiple times. This can be used to create persistent, invisible fingerprints in digital text.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters|title=Zero-Width Characters - Invisibly fingerprinting text|author=Zach Aysan}}</ref>\n* [[Mailing lists]] for purchase are typically seeded with a small number of postal or e-mail addresses that route back to the seller of the list. This is used to detect re-use of the list (typically sold on a per-mailing basis) or resale of the list (usually prohibited).\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n* The canary trap was used in several of Tom Clancy's novels.  Chronologically it first appears in ''[[Without Remorse]]'', when a CIA official alters a report given to a senator, revealing an internal leak who was giving information to the [[KGB]].  Different versions of the report were given to other suspected leakers.\n* Barium meals are also administered in Robert Littel's book ''[[The Company (Littell novel)|The Company]]'', and later in the TV miniseries with same name.\n* The technique (not named) was used in the 1970s BBC television serial ''[[1990 (TV series)|1990]]''.  The same unnamed technique also appeared in [[Irving Wallace]]'s book ''[[The Word (novel)|The Word]]'' (1972).\n* A variation of the canary trap was used in the film ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'', with various rendezvous dates leaked to different groups.\n* In the [[Strawberries and Cream (The Mentalist)|third-season finale]] of ''[[The Mentalist]]'', the characters use a canary trap (giving different hotel room numbers to different suspects) to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within their agency. A similar ruse is used in the TV series ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]''.\n* In ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', the second book in the [[A Song of Ice and Fire]] series, [[Tyrion Lannister]] uses the trap to find out which member of the King's [[Privy Council]] is reporting to his sister, the Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]. To the Grand Maester Pycelle, he tells of a plot to marry his niece, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Princess Myrcella]], to Prince [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]] of the powerful [[House Martell]], from [[Dorne]]. To [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], he claims he will instead send Myrcella to be raised by [[Lysa Arryn]] and married to her son Robert. To [[Varys]], he says his plan is to send his nephew [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] to the Martells. When Cersei confronts him, and knows only of the plan to send Myrcella to Dorne, Tyrion knows Pycelle to be the leak.\n** This plotline is also depicted in \"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]\", during [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|the second season]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', the television adaptation of the books.\n* When distributing the film ''[[Broken (1993 film)|Broken]]'' to friends, [[Trent Reznor]] claims that he watermarked the tapes with dropouts at certain points so that he could identify if a leak would surface.\n* In the film ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'' starring Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock, a canary trap is employed by a drug ring to decide the loyalty of a returning member who is detective Mullins' brother.\n* In ''Han Solo at Stars' End'', the first book in ''[[The Han Solo Adventures]]'', the title character uses a canary trap to find a traitor and murderer among his passengers.  He tells each that their target is a different planet, all false, knowing that the traitor would have learned the real destination when they killed the group's leader.\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Recruitment of spies|aka=Clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting}}\n*{{annotated link|Coded anti-piracy}}\n*{{annotated link|Fictitious entry}}\n*{{annotated link|Honeytoken}}\n*{{annotated link|Machine Identification Code|aka=Printer steganography}}\n*{{annotated link|Traitor tracing}}\n*{{annotated link|Watermark}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/CS1023/readings/finger.html Fingerprinting] gives a good overview of different kinds of canary trap techniques.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024010726/http://www.eff.org/Privacy/printers/docucolor/ EFF.org DocuColor Tracking Dot Decoding Guide]  How to read the date, time, and printer serial number from forensic tracking codes in a Xerox DocuColor color laser printout.\n\n[[Category:Espionage techniques]]\n[[Category:Steganography]]\n[[Category:Computer security procedures]]\n[[Category:Watermarking]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects}}\n{{refimprove|date=September 2014}}\nA '''canary trap''' is a method for exposing an information leak by giving different versions of a sensitive document to each of several suspects and seeing which version gets leaked.

There are over a thousand possible permutations, but only ninety-six numbered copies of the actual document. The reason the summary paragraphs are so lurid is to entice a reporter to quote them verbatim in the public media. If he quotes something from two or three of those paragraphs, we know which copy he saw and, therefore, who leaked it.'' </blockquote>\n\nA refinement of this technique uses a thesaurus program to shuffle through synonyms, thus making every copy of the document unique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/nba-canary-trap-media-2014-12|title=The NBA Used An Espionage Trick Known As 'Canary Trap' To Catch Teams Leaking Info To The Media|last=Gaines|first=Cork|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==Known canary trap cases==\n\nFollowing the troubled production of ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' in the late 1970s, [[Paramount Pictures]] effectively replaced [[Gene Roddenberry]] as producer of [[Star Trek (film series)|further movies]] in the [[Media franchise|franchise]] with [[Harve Bennett]]. Roddenberry was retained as an \"executive consultant\", due to the high regard the series' fans held him in; while he had little real authority he was still kept involved in the creative process. The fans often complained about particular plot developments proposed for the films, such as the death of [[Spock]] in ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan|Star Trek II]]'', that Roddenberry had opposed. So, before any drafts of the screenplay for ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'' were circulated, Bennett arranged for each individual copy to have subtle clues distinguishing it from the others. Shortly after Roddenberry opposed the destruction of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' at the climax of that film, fans began to complain to Paramount and Bennett. He found that a leaked copy of the script was the one given to Roddenberry, but was unable to do anything about it.<ref name=\"Star Trek films\">{{cite book|last1=Engel|first1=Joel|authorlink1=|title=Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind ''Star Trek''|pages=[https://archive.org/details/generoddenberrym00enge/page/210 210\u201311]|date=1994|publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]|isbn=0786860049|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/generoddenberrym00enge/page/210}}</ref>\n\nAfter a series of leaks at [[Tesla Motors]] in 2008, CEO [[Elon Musk]] reportedly sent slightly different versions of an e-mail to each employee in an attempt to reveal potential leakers. The e-mail was disguised as a request to employees to sign a new [[non-disclosure agreement]]. The plan was undermined when the company's general counsel forwarded his own unique version of the e-mail with the attached agreement. As a result, Musk's scheme was realized by employees who now had a safe copy to leak.<ref>{{cite web \n |url=http://gawker.com/5164035/tesla-ceo-in-digital-witch-hunt \n |author=Owen Thomas \n |year=2009 \n |title=Tesla CEO in Digital Witch Hunt \n |accessdate=2013-11-16 \n |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020092330/http://gawker.com/5164035/tesla-ceo-in-digital-witch-hunt \n |archivedate=2013-10-20 \n }}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, it was proposed as a method for the [[Presidency of Donald Trump| Trump Administration]] to catch leaks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/whats-in-sessions-toolkit-for-hunting-anti-trump-leakers|title=What's in Sessions' toolkit for hunting anti-Trump leakers?|last=Wallace|first=Christopher|date=2017-08-04|website=Fox News|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, British celebrity [[Coleen Rooney]] used the technique to identify who was leaking information from her private [[Instagram]] stories to tabloid newspaper [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] by posting fake stories which were blocked to all but one account. When these details appeared in the press, she publicly identified the leaks as coming from the account of Rebekah Vardy, wife of footballer [[Jamie Vardy]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rosseinsky |first1=Katie |year=2019 |title=Coleen Rooney accuses Rebekah Vardy's Instagram account of leaking stories to the press |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/colleen-rooney-accuses-rebekah-vardy-of-leaking-stories-about-her-a4257461.html |website=[[Evening Standard]] |accessdate=2019-10-09}}</ref>.\n\n==Barium meal test==\nAccording to the book ''[[Spycatcher]]''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spycatcher|last=Wright, Peter, 1916-1995.|date=1989|publisher=Mandarin|isbn=1863300007|oclc=27626618}}</ref> by [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]] (published in 1987) the technique is standard practice that has been used by [[MI5]] (and other intelligence agencies) for many years, under the name \"[[barium meal]] test\". A barium meal test is more sophisticated than a canary trap because it is flexible and may take many different forms. However, the basic premise is to reveal a secret to a suspected enemy (but nobody else) then monitor whether there is evidence of the fake information being utilised by the other side. For example, a suspected double agent could be offered some tempting \"bait\": e.g., be told that important information was stored at a [[dead drop]] site. The fake dead drop site could then be periodically checked for signs of disturbance. If the site showed signs of being disturbed (for instance, in order to copy microfilm stored there), then this would confirm that the suspected enemy really was an enemy, i.e., a double agent.\n\n==Embedding information==\nThe technique of embedding significant information in a hidden form in a medium has been used in many ways, which are usually classified according to intent:\n\n* [[Watermark]]s are used to show that items are authentic and not forged.\n* [[Steganography]] is used to hide a secret message in an apparently innocuous message, in order to escape detection.\n* A canary trap hides information in a document that uniquely identifies it, so that copies of it can be traced.\n* [[Screener (promotional)|Screener]] versions of DVDs are often marked in some way so as to allow the tracking of unauthorised releases to their source.\n* As with the ''Star Trek'' incident, major films or television productions frequently give out scripts to the cast and crew in which one or two lines are different in each individual version. Thus if the entire script is copied and leaked to the public, the producers can track down the specific person who leaked the script. In practice this does not prevent generalized information about the script from being leaked, but it does discourage leaking verbatim copies of the script itself.\n* [[Trap street]]s on maps, or intentionally fictitious streets, are sometimes included to track copyright violations by those who might republish copyrighted maps illegally.\n* [[Fictitious entry|Spurious words]] are sometimes included in dictionaries so as to detect other publishers copying from them. The [[OED]] contains an appendix of such words with which edition of which dictionary first used them and which first duplicated them.\n* [[Zero-width spaces]] are Unicode characters that are not visually rendered. An arbitrary number of these characters can be inserted betw&#8203;een the letters of a word. Though they are not visible, they will typically persist even as that word is copied and pasted and transmitted multiple times. This can be used to create persistent, invisible fingerprints in digital text.<ref>{{cite website|url=https://www.zachaysan.com/writing/2017-12-30-zero-width-characters|title=Zero-Width Characters - Invisibly fingerprinting text|author=Zach Aysan}}</ref>\n* [[Mailing lists]] for purchase are typically seeded with a small number of postal or e-mail addresses that route back to the seller of the list. This is used to detect re-use of the list (typically sold on a per-mailing basis) or resale of the list (usually prohibited).\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n* The canary trap was used in several of Tom Clancy's novels.  Chronologically it first appears in ''[[Without Remorse]]'', when a CIA official alters a report given to a senator, revealing an internal leak who was giving information to the [[KGB]].  Different versions of the report were given to other suspected leaks.\n* Barium meals are also administered in Robert Littel's book ''[[The Company (Littell novel)|The Company]]'', and later in the TV miniseries with same name.\n* The technique (not named) was used in the 1970s BBC television serial ''[[1990 (TV series)|1990]]''.  The same unnamed technique also appeared in [[Irving Wallace]]'s book ''[[The Word (novel)|The Word]]'' (1972).\n* A variation of the canary trap was used in the film ''[[Miami Vice (film)|Miami Vice]]'', with various rendezvous dates leaked to different groups.\n* In the [[Strawberries and Cream (The Mentalist)|third-season finale]] of ''[[The Mentalist]]'', the characters use a canary trap (giving different hotel room numbers to different suspects) to uncover a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within their agency. A similar ruse is used in the TV series ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]''.\n* In ''[[A Clash of Kings]]'', the second book in the [[A Song of Ice and Fire]] series, [[Tyrion Lannister]] uses the trap to find out which member of the King's [[Privy Council]] is reporting to his sister, the Queen Regent [[Cersei Lannister]]. To the Grand Maester Pycelle, he tells of a plot to marry his niece, [[Myrcella Baratheon|Princess Myrcella]], to Prince [[Trystane Martell|Trystane]] of the powerful [[House Martell]], from [[Dorne]]. To [[Petyr Baelish|Littlefinger]], he claims he will instead send Myrcella to be raised by [[Lysa Arryn]] and married to her son Robert. To [[Varys]], he says his plan is to send his nephew [[Tommen Baratheon|Tommen]] to the Martells. When Cersei confronts him, and knows only of the plan to send Myrcella to Dorne, Tyrion knows Pycelle to be the leak.\n** This plotline is also depicted in \"[[What Is Dead May Never Die]]\", during [[Game of Thrones (season 2)|the second season]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', the television adaptation of the books.\n* When distributing the film ''[[Broken (1993 film)|Broken]]'' to friends, [[Trent Reznor]] claims that he watermarked the tapes with dropouts at certain points so that he could identify if a leak would surface.\n* In the film ''[[The Heat (film)|The Heat]]'' starring Melissa McCarthy and Sandra Bullock, a canary trap is employed by a drug ring to decide the loyalty of a returning member who is detective Mullins' brother.\n* In ''Han Solo at Stars' End'', the first book in ''[[The Han Solo Adventures]]'', the title character uses a canary trap to find a traitor and murderer among his passengers.  He tells each that their target is a different planet, all false, knowing that the traitor would have learned the real destination when they killed the group's leader.\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Recruitment of spies|aka=Clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting}}\n*{{annotated link|Coded anti-piracy}}\n*{{annotated link|Fictitious entry}}\n*{{annotated link|Honeytoken}}\n*{{annotated link|Machine Identification Code|aka=Printer steganography}}\n*{{annotated link|Traitor tracing}}\n*{{annotated link|Watermark}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/CS1023/readings/finger.html Fingerprinting] gives a good overview of different kinds of canary trap techniques.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051024010726/http://www.eff.org/Privacy/printers/docucolor/ EFF.org DocuColor Tracking Dot Decoding Guide]  How to read the date, time, and printer serial number from forensic tracking codes in a Xerox DocuColor color laser printout.\n\n[[Category:Espionage techniques]]\n[[Category:Steganography]]\n[[Category:Computer security procedures]]\n[[Category:Watermarking]]\n", "name_user": "Eric", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eIn popular culture:rv odd error", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canary_trap"}
