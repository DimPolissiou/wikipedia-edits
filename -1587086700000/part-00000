For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying. Depending on the syntax of the language, the quotative appears either directly before or after the reported speech.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction Volume One |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref>\n\n==== English ====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n<br>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty.

They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \u3086\u304d !! \u306f !! \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000!! \u306b\u306f !! \u5f7c\u5973 !! \u304c !! \u597d\u304d !! \u3068 !! \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying. Depending on the syntax of the language, the quotative appears either directly before or after the reported speech.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The International Encyclopedia of Language and Social Interaction Volume One |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref>\n\n==== English ====\nIn English, the verb ''\"be like\"'' or ''\"said\"'' are being used as quotatives in American English. <ref> Frederica Barbieri.

The verb is usually a verb of communication or thought. In spoken Japanese, the use of pronouns and honorific form are commonly seen; yet, honorific form is not an evidence between direct and indirect speech. Thus, Japanese fails to distinguish between direct and indirect speech as shown in the above examples.\n<ref name=\"Coulmas p164\"/>\n<br>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit.

Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The combined armies of the [[Balkan]] states overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success.\n\nThe war was a comprehensive and unmitigated disaster for the Ottomans, who lost 83% of their territories in Europe and 69% of their European population.<ref name=\"uslu\">[http://www.academia.edu/2966094/Balkan_Savaslari_ve_Balkan_Savaslarinda_Bulgaristan ''Balkan Sava\u015flar\u0131 ve Balkan Sava\u015flar\u0131'nda Bulgaristan''], S\u00fcleyman Uslu</ref> As a result of the war, the League captured and partitioned almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire. Ensuing events also led to the creation of an [[independent Albania]] which angered the [[Serbs]]. However, Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which provoked the start of the [[Second Balkan War]].\n\n== Background ==\nTensions among the [[Balkan]] states over their rival aspirations to the provinces of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[Rumelia]], namely [[Eastern Rumelia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], subsided somewhat following intervention by the [[Great Powers]] in the mid-19th century, aimed at securing both more complete protection for the provinces' Christian majority and protection of the status quo. By 1867, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] had both secured independence, which was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878). The question of the viability of Ottoman rule was revived after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of July 1908, which compelled the [[Sultan]] to restore the suspended Ottoman constitution.\n\nSerbia's aspirations to take over [[Ottoman Bosnia|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were thwarted by the [[Bosnian crisis]] and the Austrian annexation of the province in October 1908. The Serbs directed their expansionism to the south. Following the annexation, the [[Young Turks]] tried to induce the Muslim population of [[Bosnia]] to emigrate to the Ottoman Empire. Those who took up the offer were re-settled by the Ottoman authorities in districts of northern Macedonia where there were few Muslims. The experiment proved to be a catastrophe for the Empire since the immigrants readily united with the existing population of Albanian Muslims. They participated in the series of [[Albanian nationalism and independence#1911 Highlanders Uprising|Albanian uprisings]] before and during the spring [[Albanian Revolt of 1912]]. Some Albanian government troops switched sides.\n\nIn May 1912, the Albanian Hamidian revolutionaries, who wanted to reinstall Sultan Abdulhamit II to power, drove the Young Turkish forces out of [[Skopje]]<ref>Olsi Jazexhi, ''Ottomans into Illyrians : passages to nationhood in 20th century Albania,'' pp 86\u201389</ref> and pressed south towards Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), forcing the Young Turks to grant effective autonomy over large regions in June 1912.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A short History of Kosovo,'' pp 246\u2013247</ref> Serbia, which had helped arm the Albanian Catholic and Hamidian rebels and sent secret agents to some of the prominent leaders, took the revolt as a pretext for war.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp. 250\u2013251.</ref> Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria had all been in talks about possible offensives against the Ottoman Empire before the Albanian revolt of 1912 broke out; a formal agreement between Serbia and Montenegro had been signed on 7 March.<ref>Hall, ''The Balkan Wars 1912\u20131913,'' pp 10\u201313</ref> On 18 October 1912, [[Peter I of Serbia]] issued a declaration, 'To the Serbian People', which appeared to support Albanians as well as Serbs:\n\n{{quote |The Turkish governments showed no interest in their duties towards their citizens and turned a deaf ear to all complaints and suggestions. Things got so far out of hand that no one was satisfied with the situation in Turkey in Europe. It became unbearable for the Serbs, the Greeks and for the Albanians, too.  By the grace of God, I have therefore ordered my brave army to join in the Holy War to free our brethren and to ensure a better future. In Old Serbia, my army will meet not only upon Christian Serbs, but also upon Muslim Serbs, who are equally dear to us, and in addition to them, upon Christian and Muslim Albanians with whom our people have shared joy and sorrow for thirteen centuries now. To all of them we bring freedom, brotherhood and equality.}}\n\nIn a search for allies, Serbia was ready to negotiate a treaty with Bulgaria.<ref>The war correspondence of Leon Trotsky: Hall, ''The Balkan Wars, 1912\u201313,'' 1980, p. 221</ref> The agreement provided that, in the event of victory against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the [[Kriva Palanka]]\u2013[[Ohrid]] line. Serbia's expansion was accepted by Bulgaria as being to the north of the [[Shar Mountains]] (i.e. [[Kosovo]]). The intervening area was agreed to be \"disputed\"; it would be arbitrated by the [[Tsar of Russia]] in the event of a successful war against the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Hall, ''The Balkan Wars, 1912\u20131913'' p. 11</ref> During the course of the war, it became apparent that the Albanians did not consider Serbia as a liberator, as suggested by King Peter I, nor did the Serbian forces observe his declaration of amity toward Albanians.\n\nAfter the successful coup d'\u00e9tat for [[Bulgarian unification|unification]] with Eastern Rumelia,<ref>Joseph Vincent Fulle, ''Bismarck's Diplomacy at Its Zenith,'' 2005, p.22</ref> Bulgaria began to dream that its national unification would be realized. For that purpose, it developed a large army, and identified as the \"[[Prussia]] of the Balkans.\"<ref>[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/4/4/7/14477/14477-h/14477-h.htm Emile Joseph Dillon, ''The Inside Story of the Peace Conference'', Ch. XV]</ref> But Bulgaria could not win a war alone against the Ottomans.\n\nIn Greece, [[Hellenic Army]] officers had rebelled in the [[Goudi coup]] of August 1909 and secured the appointment of a progressive government under [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], which they hoped would resolve the [[History of Crete#Modern Crete|Crete question]] in Greece's favour. They also wanted to reverse their defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] by the Ottomans. An emergency military reorganization led by a French military mission had been started for that purpose, but its work was interrupted by the outbreak of war in the Balkans. In the discussions that led Greece to join the [[Balkan League]], Bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on the distribution of territorial gains, unlike its deal with Serbia over Macedonia. Bulgaria's diplomatic policy was to push Serbia into an agreement limiting its access to Macedonia,<ref>Hugh Seton-Watson & Christopher Seton-Watson, ''The Making of a New Europe,'' 1981, p. 116</ref> while at the same time refusing any such agreement with Greece. Bulgaria believed that its army would be able to occupy the larger part of Aegean Macedonia and the important port city of Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]]) before the Greeks.\n\nIn 1911, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] had launched an [[Italo-Turkish War|invasion of Tripolitania]] in present-day [[Libya]], which was quickly followed by the occupation of the [[Dodecanese]] Islands in the [[Aegean Sea]]. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire and the successful [[Albanian revolt of 1912]]  encouraged the Balkan states to imagine they might win a war against the Ottomans. By the spring and summer of 1912, the various Christian Balkan nations had created a network of military alliances which became known as the Balkan League.\n\nThe Great Powers, most notably France and [[Austria-Hungary]], reacted to the formation of these alliances by trying to dissuade the League from going to war, but failed. In late September, both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] was the first to declare war, on 25 September ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/8 October. After issuing an impossible ultimatum to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] on 13 October, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece declared war on the Empire on 17 October. The declarations of war attracted a large number of war correspondents. An estimated [[Journalists of the Balkan Wars|200\u2013300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans]] in November 1912.<ref>\u201cCorrespondants de guerre\u201d, ''Le Petit Journal Illustr\u00e9'' (Paris), 3 novembre 1912.</ref>\n\n== Order of battle and plans ==\n[[File:Balkan 1912.svg|thumb|Political boundaries in the Balkans before the First Balkan War]]\nThe Ottoman [[order of battle]] when the war broke out constituted a total of 12,024 officers; 324,718 other ranks; 47,960 animals; 2,318 artillery pieces, and 388 machine guns.

The Bulgarians also possessed a small navy of six torpedo boats, which were restricted to operations along the country's [[Black Sea]] coast.<ref name=Hall17>Hall (2000), p. 17</ref>\n\nBulgaria was focused on actions in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. It deployed its main force in Thrace, forming three armies. The [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]] (79,370 men), under general [[Vasil Kutinchev]] with three infantry divisions, was deployed to the south of [[Yambol]], with direction of operations along the [[Tundzha]] river. The [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]] (122,748 men), under general [[Nikola Ivanov]], with two infantry divisions and one infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianople ([[Edirne]]). According to the plans, the [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]] (94,884 men), under general [[Radko Dimitriev]], was deployed east of and behind the First, and was covered by the cavalry division hiding it from Turkish view. The Third Army had three infantry divisions and was assigned to cross the [[Stranja]] mountain and to take the fortress of Kirk Kilisse ([[K\u0131rklareli]]). The 2nd (49,180) and 7th (48,523 men) divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in [[Western Thrace]] and Eastern Macedonia respectively.\n\n=== Serbia ===\n{{further|Order of battle of the Serbian Army in the First Balkan War}}\n\nSerbia called upon about 255,000 men (out of a population of 2,912,000 people) with about 228 heavy guns, grouped in 10 infantry divisions, two independent brigades and a cavalry division, under the effective command of the former War Minister [[Radomir Putnik]].<ref name=Hall18>Hall (2000), p. 18</ref> The Serbian High Command, in its pre-war wargames,{{clarify|date=January 2017}} had concluded that the likeliest site of the decisive battle against the Ottoman [[Vardar Army]] would be on the [[Ov\u010de Pole]] plateau, before [[Skopje]]. Hence, the main forces were formed in three armies for the advance towards Skopje, while a division and an independent brigade were to cooperate with the Montenegrins in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]].\n\nThe First Army (132,000 men) was the strongest and was commanded by General [[Petar Bojovi\u0107]], forming the center of the drive towards Skopje. The Second Army (74,000 men) was commanded by General [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]], and consisted of one Serbian and one Bulgarian (7th Rila) division. It formed the left wing of the Army and advanced towards [[Stracin]]. The inclusion of a Bulgarian division was according to a pre-war arrangement between Serbian and Bulgarian armies, but that division ceased to obey the orders of Gen. Stepanovi\u0107 as soon as the war began, following only the orders of the Bulgarian High Command. The Third Army (76,000 men) was commanded by General [[Bo\u017eidar Jankovi\u0107]] and, being the army on the right wing, had the task to take Kosovo. It would then join the other armies in the expected battle at Ov\u010de Polje. There were two other concentrations in northwestern Serbia across the Serbo-Austrohungarian borders, the Ibar Army (25,000 men) under General [[Mihailo \u017divkovi\u0107]] and the Javor brigade (12,000 men) under Lt Colonel Milovoje An\u0111elkovi\u0107.\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{Further|Order of battle of the Hellenic Army in the First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Greek Artillery Balkans.jpg|thumb|Greek artillerymen with 75 mm field gun]]\nGreece, at the time a state of 2,666,000 people,<ref name=\"Erickson70\">Erickson (2003), p. 70</ref> was considered the weakest of the three main allies, since it fielded the smallest army and had suffered a defeat against the Ottomans 16 years before in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. A British consular dispatch from 1910 expresses the common perception of the Greek Army's capabilities at the time: \"if there is war we shall probably see that the only thing Greek officers can do besides talking is to run away\".<ref name=\"Fotakis42\">Fotakis (2005), p. 42</ref> However, Greece was the only Balkan country to possess a substantial navy. This was vital to the League, as it could prevent Ottoman reinforcements from being rapidly transferred by ship from Asia to Europe. This fact was readily appreciated by the Serbs and Bulgarians, and was the chief factor in initiating the process of Greece's inclusion in their alliance.<ref>Fotakis (2005), p. 44</ref> As the Greek ambassador to Sofia put it during the negotiations that led to Greece's entry into the League: \"Greece can provide 600,000 men for the war effort. 200,000 men in the field, and the fleet will be able to stop 400,000 men being landed by Turkey between Salonica and [[Gallipoli]].\"<ref name=Hall17>Hall (2000), p. 17</ref>\n\nThe Greek Army was still undergoing reorganization by a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]], which arrived in early 1911. Under French supervision, the Greeks had adopted the triangular infantry division as their main formation, but more importantly, the overhaul of the mobilization system allowed the country to field and equip a far greater number of troops than it had in 1897. While foreign observers estimated Greece would mobilize a force of approximately 50,000 men, the Greek Army fielded 125,000, with another 140,000 in the National Guard and reserves.<ref name=\"Erickson70\"/><ref name=\"Fotakis42\"/> Upon mobilization, as in 1897, this force was grouped in two field armies, reflecting the geographic division between the two operational theaters open to the Greeks: [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus]]. The [[Army of Thessaly]] (\u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) was placed under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]], with Lt Gen [[Panagiotis Danglis]] as his chief of staff. It fielded the bulk of the Greek forces: seven infantry divisions, a cavalry regiment and four independent [[Evzones]] light mountain infantry battalions, roughly 100,000 men. It was expected to overcome the fortified Ottoman border positions and advance towards south and central Macedonia, aiming to take [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Bitola]]. The remaining 10,000 to 13,000 men in eight battalions were assigned to the [[Army of Epirus]] (\u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac \u0397\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5) under Lt Gen [[Konstantinos Sapountzakis]]. As it had no hope of capturing [[Ioannina]], the heavily fortified capital of Epirus, its initial mission was to pin down the Ottoman forces there, until sufficient reinforcements could be sent from the Army of Thessaly after its successful conclusion of operations.\n\n[[File:Averof.jpg|thumb|The armored cruiser {{ship|Greek cruiser|Georgios Averof||2}}, flagship of the Greek fleet. At the time, she was the most modern warship involved in the conflict, and played a crucial role in operations in the Aegean Sea.]]\nThe Greek Navy was relatively modern, strengthened by the recent purchase of numerous new units and undergoing reforms under the supervision of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British mission]]. Invited by Prime Minister Venizelos in 1910, the mission began its work upon its arrival in May 1911. Granted extraordinary powers and led by Vice Admiral Lionel Grand Tufnell, it thoroughly reorganized the Navy Ministry and dramatically improved the number and quality of exercises in gunnery and fleet maneuvers.<ref name=\"Fotakis 2005, pp. 25\u201335\">Fotakis (2005), pp. 25\u201335</ref> In 1912, the core unit of the fleet was the fast [[armoured cruiser]] [[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']], completed in 1910 and, at that time, the fastest and most modern warship in the combatant navies.<ref>Fotakis (2005), p. 45</ref> It was complemented by three rather antiquated battleships of the {{sclass-|Hydra|battleship|4}}. There were also eight destroyers built in 1906\u20131907, and six new destroyers that were hastily bought in summer 1912 as the imminence of war became apparent.<ref name=\"Fotakis 2005, pp. 25\u201335\"/>\n\nNevertheless, at the outbreak of the war, the Greek fleet was far from ready. The Ottoman battlefleet retained a clear advantage in number of ships, speed of the main surface units and, more importantly, in the number and caliber of the ships' guns.<ref>Fotakis (2005), pp. 45\u201346</ref> In addition, as the war caught the fleet in the middle of its expansion and reorganization, fully a third of the fleet (the six new destroyers and the submarine {{ship|Greek submarine|Delfin|1912|2}}) only reached Greece after hostilities had started, forcing the navy to reshuffle crews, who consequently suffered from lacking familiarization and training time. Coal stockpiles and other war stores were also in short supply, while the ''Georgios Averof'' had arrived with barely any ammunition, and would remain so until late November.<ref>Fotakis (2005), p. 46</ref>\n\n=== Montenegro ===\nMontenegro was also considered as the smallest nation in the Balkan Peninsula, but in recent years before the war, with support from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], it had improved its military skills. Also, it was the only Balkan country never to be fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Due to Montenegro being the smallest member of the League, it did not have much influence. Despite this, it was advantageous for Montenegro,{{clarify|date=March 2017}} because when the Ottoman Empire was trying to counter the actions of Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece, Montenegro had enough time for preparations which helped its successful military campaign.\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\nIn 1912, the Ottomans were in a difficult position. They had a large population, 26 million, but just over 6.1 million of them lived in the European part of the Empire. Of these, only 2.3 million were Muslims, the rest being Christians, who were considered unfit for conscription. The very poor transport network, especially in the Asian part, dictated that the only reliable way for a mass transfer of troops to the European theater was by sea, but that was at risk due to the Greek fleet in the Aegean Sea. In addition, the Ottomans were still engaged in a protracted war against the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] in Libya (and by now in the [[Dodecanese]] islands of the Aegean), which had dominated the Ottoman military effort for over a year. The conflict lasted until 15 October, a few days after the outbreak of hostilities in the Balkans. The Ottomans were unable to significantly reinforce their positions in the Balkans as their relations with the Balkan states deteriorated over the course of the year.<ref>Hall (2000), p. 19</ref>\n\n==== Ottoman forces in the Balkans ====\n[[File:Ottoman troops with flag.jpg|thumb|Ottoman troops during the Balkan Wars]]\nThe Ottomans' military capabilities were hampered by a number of factors, beginning with domestic strife, caused by the [[Young Turk Revolution]] and the counter-revolutionary coup several months later (see [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]] and [[31 March Incident]]). This resulted in different groups competing for influence within the military. A German mission had tried to reorganize the army, but its recommendations had not been fully implemented. The Ottoman army was caught in the midst of reform and reorganization. In addition, several of the army's best battalions had been transferred to [[Yemen Vilayet|Yemen]] to face the ongoing rebellion there. In the summer of 1912, the Ottoman High Command made the disastrous decision to dismiss some 70,000 mobilized troops.<ref name=\"Hall18\"/><ref>Uyar & Erickson (2009), pp. 225\u2013226</ref> The regular army (''Nizam'') was composed of well-equipped and trained active divisions, but the reserve units (''Redif'') that reinforced it were ill-equipped, especially in artillery, and badly trained.\n\nThe Ottomans' strategic situation was difficult, as their borders were almost impossible to defend against a co-ordinated attack by the Balkan states. The Ottoman leadership decided to defend the entirety of their territory. As a result, the available forces\u2014which could not be easily reinforced from Asia due to Greek control of the sea and the inadequacy of the Ottoman railway system\u2014were dispersed too thinly across the region. They failed to stand up to the rapidly mobilized Balkan armies.<ref>Uyar & Erickson (2009), pp. 226\u2013227</ref> The Ottomans had three armies in Europe (the Macedonian, Vardar and Thracian Armies), with 1,203 pieces of mobile and 1,115 fixed artillery on fortified areas. The Ottoman High Command repeated its error of previous wars by ignoring the established command structure and by creating new superior commands, the [[Eastern Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eastern Army]] and [[Western Army (Ottoman Empire)|Western Army]], reflecting the division of the operational theater between the Thracian (against the Bulgarians) and Macedonian (against Greeks, Serbs and Montenegrins) fronts.<ref>Uyar & Erickson (2009), pp. 227\u2013228</ref>\n\nThe Western Army fielded at least 200,000 men<ref name=\"Erickson2\">Erickson (2003), p. 170</ref> while the Eastern Army fielded 115,000 men against the Bulgarian Army.<ref name=\"Hall 2000, p. 22\">Hall (2000), p. 22</ref> The [[Eastern Army (Ottoman Empire)|Eastern Army]] was commanded by Nazim Pasha and numbered seven corps of 11 Regular Infantry, 13 Redif and 1+ Cavalry divisions:\n* [[I Corps (Ottoman Empire)|I Corps]] with three divisions (2nd Infantry (minus regiment), 3rd Infantry and 1st Provisional divisions).\n* [[II Corps (Ottoman Empire)|II Corps]] with three divisions (4th (minus regiment) and 5th Infantry and U\u015fak Redif divisions).\n* [[III Corps (Ottoman Empire)|III Corps]] with four divisions (7th, 8th and 9th Infantry Divisions, all minus a regiment, and the Afyonkarahisar Redif Division).\n* [[IV Corps (Ottoman Empire)|IV Corps]] with three divisions (12th Infantry Division (minus regiment), \u0130zmit and Bursa Redif divisions).\n* [[XVII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|XVII Corps]] with three divisions (Samsun, Ere\u011fli and \u0130zmir Redif divisions).\n* [[Adrianople Fortified Area Command|Edirne Fortified Area]] with six-plus divisions (10th and 11th Infantry, Edirne, Babaeski and G\u00fcm\u00fclcine Redif and the Fortress division, 4th Rifle and 12th Cavalry regiments).\n* [[K\u0131rcaali Detachment]] with two-plus divisions (K\u0131rcaali Redif, K\u0131rcaali Mustahf\u0131z division and 36th Infantry Regiment).\n* An independent cavalry division and the 5th Light Cavalry Brigade\n\nThe [[Western Army (Ottoman Empire)|Western Army]] (Macedonian and [[Vardar Army]]) was composed of ten corps with 32 infantry and two cavalry divisions.\nAgainst Serbia, the Ottomans deployed the [[Vardar Army]] (HQ in [[Skopje]] under [[Halepli Zeki Pasha]], with five Corps of 18 Infantry divisions, one cavalry division and two independent cavalry brigades under the:\n* [[V Corps (Ottoman Empire)|V Corps]] with four divisions  (13th, 15th, 16th Infantry and the \u0130\u015ftip Redif divisions)\n* [[VI Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VI Corps]] with four divisions (17th, 18th Infantry and the Manast\u0131r and Drama Redif divisions)\n* [[VII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VII Corps]] with three division (19th Infantry and \u00dcsk\u00fcp and Pri\u015ftine Redif divisions)\n* [[II Corps (Ottoman Empire)|II Corps]] with three divisions (U\u015fak, Denizli and \u0130zmir Redif divisions)\n* Sand\u017eak Corps{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} with four divisions (20th Infantry (minus regiment), 60th Infantry, Metrovi\u00e7a Redif Division, Ta\u015fl\u0131ca Redif Regiment, [[Firzovik Detachment|Firzovik]] and [[Ta\u015fl\u0131ca Detachment|Taslica]] detachments)\n* An independent Cavalry Division and the 7th and 8th Cavalry Brigades.\n\nThe Macedonian Army (HQ in [[Thessaloniki]] under [[Ali R\u0131za Pasha]]) was composed of 14 divisions in five corps detailed against Greece, Bulgaria and Montenegro.\n\nAgainst Greece, seven-plus divisions were deployed:\n* [[VIII Corps (Ottoman Empire)|VIII Provisional Corps]] with three divisions (22nd Infantry and Nasli\u00e7 and Ayd\u0131n Redif divisions).\n* [[Yanya Corps]] with three divisions (23rd Infantry, Yanya Redif and Bizani Fortress divisions).\n* Selanik Redif division and [[Karaburun Detachment]] as independent units.\n\nAgainst Bulgaria in south-eastern Macedonia, two divisions forming the [[Struma Corps]] (14th Infantry and Serez Redif divisions, plus the [[Nevrekop Detachment]]) were deployed.\n\nAgainst Montenegro, four-plus divisions were deployed:\n* [[\u0130\u015fkodra Corps]] with two-plus divisions (24th Infantry, Elbasan Redif, [[\u0130\u015fkodra Fortified Area Command|\u0130\u015fkodra Fortified Area]])\n* [[\u0130pek Detachment]] with two divisions (21st Infantry and Prizren Redif divisions)\n\nAccording to the organizational plan, the men of the Western Group were to total 598,000, but slow mobilization and the inefficiency of the rail system drastically reduced the number of men available. According to the Western Army Staff, when war began, they had only 200,000 men available.<ref name=\"Erickson2\"/> Although during the next period more men reached the units, due to war casualties, the Western Group never came near its nominal strength. In time of war, the Ottomans had planned to bring more troops in from Syria, both ''Nizamiye'' and ''Redif.''<ref name=\"Erickson2\"/> Greek naval supremacy prevented those reinforcements from arriving. Instead those soldiers had to deploy via the land route, and most never made it to the Balkans.<ref>Uyar & Erickson (2009), p. 227</ref>\n\nThe Ottoman General Staff, assisted by the German Military Mission, developed 12 war plans, designed to counter various combinations of opponents. Work on plan No. 5, which was against a combination of Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro, was very advanced, and had been sent to the Army staffs for them to develop local plans.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 62</ref>\n\n==== Ottoman Navy ====\n\n[[File:barbaroshayreddin.jpg|thumb|{{ship|Ottoman battleship|Barbaros Hayreddin||2}}, the Ottoman flagship (pictured here) and her sister {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Turgut Reis||2}} were more heavily protected and had more and heavier primary armament than ''Georgios Averof,'' but were five knots slower.]]\nThe Ottoman fleet had performed abysmally in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], forcing the Ottoman government to begin a drastic overhaul. Older ships were retired and newer ones acquired, chiefly from France and Germany. In addition, in 1908 the Ottomans called in a [[British naval missions to the Ottoman Empire|British naval mission]] to update their training and doctrine.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 9\u201314</ref> In the event, the British mission, headed by Admiral Sir [[Douglas Gamble]], would find its task almost impossible. To a large extent this was due to the political upheaval in the aftermath of the [[Young Turk Revolution]]; between 1908 and 1911, the office of Navy Minister changed hands nine times. Inter-departmental infighting and the entrenched interests of the bloated and over-aged officer corps, many of whom occupied their positions as a quasi-[[sinecure]], further obstructed drastic reform. In addition, British attempts to control the Navy's construction programme were met with suspicion by the Ottoman ministers, and funds for Gamble's ambitious plans for new ships were not available.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nTo counter the Greek acquisition of the ''Georgios Averof,'' the Ottomans initially tried to buy the new German armoured cruiser {{SMS|Bl\u00fccher}} or the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Moltke}}. Not able to afford the ships' high cost, the Ottomans acquired two old {{sclass-|Brandenburg|battleship|0}} [[pre-dreadnought battleship]]s, which became {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Barbaros Hayreddin||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman battleship|Turgut Reis||2}}.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 16\u201317</ref> Along with the cruisers {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Mecidiye||2}}, these two ships were to form the relatively modern core of the Ottoman battlefleet.<ref name=\"Erickson 2003, p. 131\">Erickson (2003), p. 131</ref> By the summer of 1912, however, they were already in poor condition due to chronic neglect: the rangefinders and ammunition hoists had been removed, the telephones were not working, the pumps were corroded, and most of the watertight doors could no longer be closed.<ref name=\"OSN20\">Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), p. 20</ref>\n\n== Operations ==\n\n=== Bulgarian theater ===\n\n[[File:Yaroslav Veshin - Na nozh.jpg|thumb|\"Bulgarians overrun the Ottoman positions ''\u00e0 la bayonette''\", by the Czech painter [[Jaroslav V\u011b\u0161\u00edn]].]]\nMontenegro started the First Balkan War by declaring war against the Ottomans on {{OldStyleDate|8 October|1912|25 September}}. The western region of the Balkans, including Albania, Kosovo, and Macedonia was less important to the resolution of the war and the survival of the Ottoman Empire than the Thracian theater, where the Bulgarians fought major battles against the Ottoman forces. Although the geography dictated that Thrace would be the major battlefield in a war with the Ottoman Empire,<ref name=\"Hall 2000, p. 22\"/> the position of the Ottoman Army there was jeopardized by erroneous intelligence estimates of their opponents' order of battle. Unaware of the secret prewar political and military settlement over Macedonia between Bulgaria and Serbia, the Ottoman leadership assigned the bulk of their forces there. The German ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim|Hans Baron von Wangenheim]], one of the most influential people in the Ottoman capital, had reported to Berlin on 21 October that the Ottoman forces believed that the bulk of the Bulgarian army would be deployed in Macedonia with the Serbs. Subsequently, the Ottoman HQ under Abdullah Pasha expected to meet only three Bulgarian infantry divisions, accompanied by cavalry, east of Adrianople.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 85</ref> According to E. J. Erickson this assumption possibly resulted from their analysis of the objectives of the Balkan Pact \u2013 but it had deadly consequences for the Ottoman Army in Thrace, which would have to defend the area against the bulk of the Bulgarian army against impossible odds.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 86</ref> This misappraisal was also the reason of the catastrophic aggressive Ottoman strategy at the start of the campaign in Thrace.\n\n====Bulgarian offensive and advance to \u00c7atalca====\n\n{{further|Battle of Kirk Kilisse|Battle of Lule Burgas|First Battle of \u00c7atalca}}\n\n[[File:Bulgarian Army FBW.JPG|thumb|Bulgarian military operations during the First Balkan War]]\nIn the Thracian front the Bulgarian army had placed 346,182 men against the Ottoman 1st Army with 105,000 men in eastern Thrace and the Kircaali detachment of 24,000 men in western Thrace. The Bulgarian forces were divided into the 1st (Lt. Gen. [[Vasil Kutinchev]]), 2nd (Lt. Gen. [[Nikola Ivanov]]) and 3rd (Lt. Gen.

The Ottoman XV Corps urgently left the area to defend the [[Gallipoli peninsula]] against an expected Greek amphibious assault which never materialized.<ref name=\"Erickson82\">Erickson (2003), p. 82</ref> The absence of this Corps created an immediate vacuum between Adrianople and [[Didymoteicho|Demotika]], and the 11th Infantry Division from the Eastern Army's IV Corps was moved there to replace it. Thus one complete army corps was removed from the Eastern Army's order of battle.<ref name=\"Erickson82\">Erickson (2003), p. 82</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of the insufficient intelligence on the invading forces, the Ottoman offensive plan failed completely in the face of Bulgarian superiority, forcing [[K\u00f6lemen Abdullah Pasha]] to abandon [[Battle of Kirk Kelesse|Kirk Kilisse]], which was taken without resistance by the Bulgarian [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]].<ref name=\"Erickson82\"/> The fortress of Adrianople, with some 61,250 men, was isolated and [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|besieged]] by the Bulgarian [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]], although for the time being no assault was possible due to the lack of siege equipment in the Bulgarian inventory.<ref>Seton-Watson (1917), p. 238</ref> Another consequence of the Greek naval supremacy in the Aegean was that the Ottoman forces did not receive the reinforcements projected in the war plans, consisting of a further corps to be transferred by sea from [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and [[Ottoman Syria|Palestine]].<ref name=\"Erickson333\">Erickson (2003), p. 333</ref> Thus the Greek Navy played a crucial albeit indirect role in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing three corps, a significant portion of the Ottoman Army, in the all-important opening round of the war.<ref name=\"Erickson333\"/> Another, more direct, role was the emergency transportation of the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division from the Macedonian to the Thracian front after the termination of operations there.<ref>Seton-Watson (1917), p. 202</ref>\n\n[[File:Chataldzha attack.jpg|thumb|The Bulgarian attack at [[\u00c7atalca]].]]\nAfter the battle of Kirk Kilisse the Bulgarian high command decided to wait a few days, a decision which allowed the Ottoman forces to occupy a new defensive position on the [[L\u00fcleburgaz]]-[[Karaa\u011fa\u00e7, Edirne|Karaa\u011fa\u00e7]]-[[P\u0131narhisar]] line. Despite this, the Bulgarian attack by the First and Third Army which together accounted for 107,386 rifleman, 3,115 cavalry, 116 machine guns and 360 artillery pieces defeated the reinforced Ottoman Army consisting of 126,000 riflemen, 3,500 cavalry, 96 machine guns and 342 artillery pieces<ref name=\"Erickson102\">Erickson (2003), p.102</ref> and reached the [[Sea of Marmara]].

The Ottoman Kircaali detachment (Kircaali Redif and Kircaali Mustahfiz Divisions and 36th Regiment with 24,000 men), tasked with defending a 400&nbsp;km front across the [[Thessaloniki]]-[[Alexandroupoli]] railroad, failed to offer serious resistance and on 26 November their commander Yaver Pasha was captured together with 10,131 officers and men by [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]]. After the occupation of Thessaloniki by the Greek army, his surrender completed the isolation of the Ottoman forces in Macedonia from those in Thrace.\n\n[[File:Chataldja armistice.jpg|thumb|The delegates at the \u00c7atalca armistice; General [[Ivan Fichev]], [[Nazim Pasha]] and General [[Mihail Savov]] are seen in the first row.]]\nOn {{OldStyleDate|17 November|1912|4 November}}, the offensive against the \u00c7atalca Line began, despite clear warnings from Russia that if the Bulgarians occupied Constantinople it would attack them. The Bulgarians launched their [[First Battle of \u00c7atalca|attack]] along the defensive line with 176,351 men and 462 artillery pieces against the Ottomans' 140,571 men and 316 artillery pieces,<ref name=\"Erickson 2003, p. 131\"/> but despite Bulgarian superiority, the Ottomans succeeded in repulsing them. An armistice was consequently agreed on {{OldStyleDate|3 December|1912|20 November}} between the Ottomans and Bulgaria, the latter also representing Serbia and Montenegro, and peace negotiations began in London. Greece also participated in the conference, but refused to agree to a truce, continuing its operations in the Epirus sector. The negotiations were interrupted on {{OldStyleDate|23 January|1913|10 January}}, when a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of 1913|Young Turk coup d'\u00e9tat]] in [[Constantinople]] under [[Enver Pasha]] overthrew the government of [[K\u00e2mil Pasha]]. Upon expiration of the armistice, on {{OldStyleDate|3 February|1913|21 January}}, hostilities recommenced.\n\n==== Ottoman counteroffensive ====\n{{further|Order of battle of the Bulgarian Army in the First Balkan War (1913)}}\n\nOn 20 February Ottoman forces began their attack, both in \u00c7atalca and south, at Gallipoli. There the Ottoman X Corps, with 19,858 men and 48 guns, landed at [[\u015eark\u00f6y]], at the same time as an attack of around 15,000 men supported by 36 guns (part of the 30,000-strong Ottoman army isolated in the Gallipoli peninsula) at [[Bulair]] further south. Both attacks were supported by fire from Ottoman warships, and were intended in the long term to relieve pressure on Edirne. Confronting them were about 10,000 men with 78 guns.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 262</ref> The Ottomans were probably unaware of the presence in the area of the newly formed [[Fourth Army (Bulgaria)|4th Bulgarian Army]] of 92,289 men under General [[Stiliyan Kovachev]]. The Ottoman attack in the thin [[isthmus]], with a front of just 1,800m, was hampered by thick fog and strong Bulgarian artillery and machine gunfire. As a result, the attack stalled, and was repulsed by a Bulgarian counterattack. By the end of the day both armies had returned to their original positions. Meanwhile, the Ottoman X Corps, which had landed at [[\u015eark\u00f6y]], advanced until by {{OldStyleDate|23 February|1913|10 February}} the reinforcements sent by General Kovachev succeeded in halting them. Casualties on both sides were light. After the failure of the frontal attack in Bulair, the Ottoman forces at \u015eark\u00f6y re-embarked into their ships on 11 February and were transported to Gallipoli.\n\nThe Ottoman attack at \u00c7atalca, directed against the powerful Bulgarian First and Third Armies, was initially launched only as a diversion from the Gallipoli-\u015eark\u00f6y operation, pinning down the Bulgarian forces [[in situ]]. Nevertheless, it resulted in unexpected success. The Bulgarians, who were weakened by [[cholera]] and concerned that an Ottoman amphibious invasion might endanger their armies, deliberately withdrew about 15&nbsp;km and to the south over 20&nbsp;km to their secondary defensive positions on higher ground to the west. With the end of the attack in Gallipoli the Ottomans canceled the operation, reluctant to leave the \u00c7atalca Line, but several days passed before the Bulgarians realized that the offensive was over. By 15 February the front had again stabilized but the fighting along the static lines continued until the armistice. The battle, which resulted in heavy Bulgarian casualties, could be characterized as an Ottoman victory at the tactical level, but strategically it was a failure, since it did nothing to prevent the failure of the Gallipoli-\u015eark\u00f6y operation or relieve the pressure on Edirne.\n\n==== Fall of Adrianople and Serbo-Bulgarian friction ====\n{{Main|Siege of Odrin (1912\u201313){{!}}Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)}}\n\n[[File:Bulgarian soldiers with dead Turkish civilians (Edirne).jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in the Ayvaz Baba fort, outside Adrianople, after its capture.]]\nThe failure of the \u015eark\u00f6y-Bulair operation and the deployment of the 2nd Serbian Army together with its much needed heavy siege artillery sealed Adrianople's fate. On 11 March after a two weeks' bombardment which destroyed many of the fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison. Under the command of General [[Nikola Ivanov]], the Bulgarian 2nd Army with 106,425 men and two Serb divisions with 47,275 men conquered the city, with the Bulgarians suffering 8,093 and the Serbs 1,462 casualties.<ref>''The war between Bulgaria and Turkey 1912\u20131913, Volume V'', Ministry of War 1930, p.1057</ref> The Ottoman casualties for the entire Adrianople campaign reached 23,000 killed.<ref>Zafirov \u2013 \u0417\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0414., \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0432, \u0415., \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435: \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, 2007, {{ISBN|954-528-752-7}}, Zafirov p. 444</ref> The number of prisoners is less clear.

The Bulgarian censor rigorously cut any references about the Serbian participation in the operation in the telegrams of the foreign correspondents. Public opinion in Sofia thus failed to realise the crucial services Serbia rendered in the battle. Accordingly, the Serbs claimed that their troops of the 20th Regiment were those who captured the Ottoman commander of the city, and that Colonel Gavrilovi\u0107 was the allied officer who accepted Shukri's official surrender of the garrison, a statement that the Bulgarians disputed. Subsequently, the Serbs officially protested, pointing out that although they had sent their troops to Adrianople to win for Bulgaria territory whose acquisition had never been foreseen by their mutual treaty,<ref name=\"Seton-Watson\">Seton-Watson, pp. 210\u2013238</ref> the Bulgarians had never fulfilled the clause of the treaty requiring Bulgaria to send 100,000 men to help the Serbians on their Vardar front. The Bulgarians answered that their staff had informed the Serbs about that on 23 August.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} The friction escalated some weeks later when the Bulgarian delegates in London bluntly warned the Serbs that they must not expect Bulgarian support on their Adriatic claims. The Serbs angrily replied that was a clear withdrawal from the prewar agreement of mutual understanding according to the Kriva Palanka-Adriatic line of expansion, but the Bulgarians insisted that in their view, the Vardar Macedonian part of the agreement remained active and the Serbs were still obliged to surrender the area as agreed.<ref name=\"Seton-Watson\"/> The Serbs answered by accusing the Bulgarians of maximalism, pointing out that if they lost both northern Albania and Vardar Macedonia, their participation in the common war would have been virtually for nothing. The tension soon was expressed in a series of hostile incidents between the two armies along their common line of occupation across the Vardar valley. The developments essentially ended the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance and made a future war between the two countries inevitable.\n\n=== Greek theater ===\n\n====Macedonian front====\n\n[[File:Gr\u00e8ce 1ere Guerre balkanique.png|thumb|Greek operations during the First Balkan War (borders depicted are post-Second Balkan War)]]\nOttoman intelligence had also disastrously misread Greek military intentions. In retrospect, it would appear that the Ottoman staffs believed that the Greek attack would be shared equally between the two major avenues of approach, Macedonia and Epirus. The 2nd Army staff had therefore evenly balanced the combat strength of the seven Ottoman divisions between the Yanya Corps and VIII Corps, in Epirus and southern Macedonia respectively. The Greek Army also fielded seven divisions, but, having the initiative, concentrated all seven against VIII Corps, leaving only a number of independent battalions of scarcely divisional strength in the Epirus front. This had fatal consequences for the Western Group of Armies, since it led to the early loss of the strategic center of all three Macedonian fronts, the city of [[Thessaloniki]], a fact that sealed their fate.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 215</ref> In an unexpectedly brilliant and rapid campaign, the Army of Thessaly seized the city. In the absence of secure sea lines of communications, the retention of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople corridor was essential to the overall strategic posture of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Once this was gone, the defeat of the Ottoman Army became inevitable. To be sure, the Bulgarians and the Serbs played an important role in the defeat of the main Ottoman armies. Their great victories at Kirkkilise, L\u00fcleburgaz, Kumanovo, and Monastir (Bitola) shattered the Eastern and Vardar Armies. However, these victories were not decisive in the sense that they ended the war. The Ottoman field armies survived, and in Thrace, they actually grew stronger day by day. In the strategic point of view these victories were enabled partially by the weakened condition of the Ottoman armies brought about by the active presence of the Greek army and fleet.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 334</ref>\n\nWith the declaration of war, the Greek Army of Thessaly under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] advanced to the north, successfully [[Battle of Sarantaporo|overcoming Ottoman opposition]] in the fortified mountain passes of [[Sarantaporo]]. After another victory at [[Battle of Yenidje|Giannitsa (Yenidje)]] on {{OldStyleDate|2 November|1912|20 October}}, the Ottoman commander [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] surrendered Thessaloniki and its garrison of 26,000 men to the Greeks on {{OldStyleDate|9 November|1912|27 October}}. Two Corps HQs (Ustruma and VIII), two Nizamiye divisions (14th and 22nd) and four Redif divisions (Salonika, Drama, Naslic and Serez) were thus lost to the Ottoman order of battle. Additionally, the Ottoman forces lost 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns and 70,000 rifles (Thessaloniki was the central arms depot for the Western Armies). The Ottoman forces estimated that 15,000 officers and men had been killed during the campaign in south Macedonia, bringing total losses up to 41,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Edward|title=Defeat in detail : the Ottoman army in the Balkans, 1912\u20131913|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0275978885|page=226}}</ref> Another direct consequence was that the destruction of the Macedonian Army sealed the fate of the Ottoman Vardar Army, which was fighting the Serbs to the north. The fall of Thessaloniki left it strategically isolated, without logistical supply and depth to maneuver, ensuring its destruction.\n\nUpon learning of the outcome of the battle of Giannitsa (Yenidje), the Bulgarian high command urgently dispatched their 7th ''Rila'' Division from the north in the direction of the city. The division arrived there a week later, the day after its surrender to the Greeks. Until 10 November, the Greek-occupied zone had been expanded to the line from [[Lake Dojran]] to the [[Pangaion hills]] west to [[Kavalla]]. In western Macedonia however, the lack of coordination between the Greek and Serbian HQs cost the Greeks a setback in the [[Battle of Vevi (1912)|Battle of Vevi]] on {{OldStyleDate|15 November|1912|2 November}}, when the Greek [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]] crossed its way with the VI Ottoman Corps (a part of the Vardar Army consisting of the 16th, 17th and 18th Nizamiye divisions), retreating to Albania following the battle of Prilep against the Serbs. The Greek division, surprised by the presence of the Ottoman Corps, isolated from the rest of Greek army and outnumbered by the now counterattacking Ottomans centered on [[Bitola|Monastir (Bitola)]], was forced to retreat. As a result, the Serbs beat the Greeks to Bitola.\n\n====Epirus front====\nIn the [[Epirus]] front the Greek army was initially heavily outnumbered, but due to the passive attitude of the Ottomans succeeded in conquering [[Preveza]] on 21 October 1912 and pushing north to the direction of [[Ioannina]].

Instead, the Ottoman Navy spent the first two months of the war in operations against the Bulgarians in the Black Sea, giving the Greeks valuable time to complete their preparations and allowing them to consolidate their control of the Aegean.<ref>Fotakis (2005), pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\nBy mid-November Greek naval detachments had seized the islands of [[Imbros]], [[Thasos]], [[Agios Efstratios]], [[Samothrace]], [[Psara]] and [[Ikaria]], while landings were undertaken on the larger islands of [[Lesbos]] and [[Chios]] only on 21 and 27 November respectively.

Two days later he led his forces out, hoping again to trap the patrolling Greek destroyers between two divisions of the Ottoman fleet, one heading for Imbros and the other waiting at the entrance of the straits. The plan failed as the Greek ships quickly broke contact. At the same time the ''Mecidiye'' came under attack by the Greek submarine ''Delfin'', which launched a torpedo against it but missed; the first such attack in history.<ref name=\"OSN22\"/> During this period, the Ottoman Army continued to press upon a reluctant Navy a plan for the re-occupation of Tenedos, which the Greek destroyers used as a base, by an amphibious operation. The operation was scheduled for 4 January. On that day, weather conditions were ideal and the fleet was ready, but the ''Yenihan'' regiment earmarked for the operation failed to arrive on time. The naval staff nevertheless ordered the fleet to sortie, and an engagement developed with the Greek fleet, without any significant results on either side.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 22\u201323</ref> Similar sorties followed on 10 and 11 January, but the results of these \"cat and mouse\" operations were always the same: \"the Greek destroyers always managed to remain outside the Ottoman warships' range, and each time the cruisers fired a few rounds before breaking off the chase.\"<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), p. 23</ref>\n\n[[File:Savuranoglu hamidiye.jpg|thumb|Ottoman cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}}. Its exploits during its eight-month cruise through the Mediterranean were a major morale booster for the Ottomans.]]\nIn preparation for the next attempt to break the Greek blockade, the Ottoman Admiralty decided to create a diversion by sending the light cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}}, captained by Rauf Bey, to raid Greek merchant shipping in the Aegean. It was hoped that the ''Georgios Averof'', the only major Greek unit fast enough to catch the ''Hamidiye'', would be drawn in pursuit and leave the remainder of the Greek fleet weakened.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref name=\"OSN26\">Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), p. 26</ref> In the event, ''Hamidiye'' slipped through the Greek patrols on the night of 14\u201315 January and bombarded the harbor of the Greek island of [[Syros]], sinking the Greek [[auxiliary cruiser]] {{ship|Greek cruiser|Makedonia||2}} which lay in anchor there (it was later raised and repaired). The ''Hamidiye'' then left the Aegean for the Eastern Mediterranean, making stops at [[Beirut]] and [[Port Said]] before entering the [[Red Sea]]. Although providing a major morale boost for the Ottomans, the operation failed to achieve its primary objective, as Kountouriotis refused to leave his post and pursue the ''Hamidiye''.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref name=\"OSN26\"/><ref name=\"Hall65\">Hall (2000), p. 65</ref>\n\nFour days later, on {{OldStyleDate|18 January|1913|5 January}}, when the Ottoman fleet again sallied from the straits towards Lemnos, it was defeated for a second time in the [[Battle of Lemnos (1913)|Battle of Lemnos]]. This time, the Ottoman warships concentrated their fire on the ''Averof'', which again made use of its superior speed and tried to \"[[cross the T]]\" of the Ottoman fleet. ''Barbaros Hayreddin'' was again heavily damaged, and the Ottoman fleet was forced to return to the shelter of the Dardanelles and their forts. The Ottomans suffered 41 killed and 101 wounded.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 23\u201324, 196</ref> It was the last attempt of the Ottoman Navy to leave the Dardanelles, thereby leaving the Greeks dominant in the Aegean. On {{OldStyleDate|5 February|1913|24 January}}, a Greek [[Farman MF.7]], piloted by Lt. [[Michael Moutoussis|Moutousis]] and with Ensign [[Aristeidis Moraitinis (aviator)|Moraitinis]] as an observer, carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the Ottoman fleet in its anchorage at [[Nara Burnu|Nagara]], and launched four bombs on the anchored ships. Although it scored no hits, this operation is regarded as the first naval-air operation in military history.<ref>{{cite web |title=History: Balkan Wars |url=http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_2.asp |accessdate=3 May 2010 |publisher=Hellenic Air Force |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718062057/http://www.haf.gr/en/history/history/history_2.asp |archivedate=18 July 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Boyne |first=  Walter J. | title=Air Warfare: an International Encyclopedia: A-L | publisher=ABC-CLIO | year=2002| editor= | pages= 66, 268|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FW_50wm8VnMC&pg=PA66&dq=moutousis%2B1913&lr=&hl=el&cd=1#v=onepage&q=moraitinis&f=false| isbn=978-1-57607-345-2}}</ref>\n\nGeneral Ivanov, commander of the 2nd Bulgarian Army, acknowledged the role of the Greek fleet in the overall Balkan League victory by stating that \"the activity of the entire Greek fleet and above all the ''Averof'' was the chief factor in the general success of the allies\".<ref name=\"Hall65\"/>\n\n=== Serbian and Montenegrin theater ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\n\n[[File:Montenegrins attacking Decic Fortress.jpg|thumb|left|Montenegrins attacking De\u010di\u0107 fortress]]\n[[File:Skadar predaja zastave.jpg|alt=|thumb|Ottoman flag surrendered to Montenegrin king [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|Nicholas]]]]\nThe Serbian forces operated against the major part of Ottoman Western army which were located in the areas of Novi Pazar, Kosovo and northern and eastern Macedonia. Strategically the Serbian forces were divided into four independent armies and groups: the Javor brigade and the Ibar Army, which operated against Ottoman forces in the area of Novi Pazar; the Third Army, which operated against Ottoman forces in the areas of Kosovo and Metohija; the First Army, which operated against Ottoman forces in the area of northern Macedonia; and the Second Army (operating from the Bulgarian territory), which operated against Ottoman forces in the area of eastern Macedonia. The decisive battle was expected to be fought in the area of northern Macedonia, more specifically in the plains of [[Ov\u010de Pole]], where the main forces of Ottoman Vardar Army were expected to concentrate.\n\nAccording to the plan of the Serbian Supreme Command, three Serbian armies (First, Second and Third) were supposed to encircle and destroy the Vardar Army in that area, with the First Army advancing from the north (along the line of Vranje-Kumanovo-Ov\u010de Pole ), the Second Army advancing from the east (along the line of Kriva Palanka-Kratovo-Ov\u010de Pole) and the Third Army advancing from the north-west (along the line of Pri\u0161tina-Skopje-Ov\u010de Pole). In the execution of this plan, the main role was given to the First Army while the Second Army was expected to cut off the Vardar Army's retreat route, and if necessary attack its rear and right flank. The main goal of Third Army was to take Kosovo and Metohija, and if necessary give assistance to the First Army by attacking the Vardar Army's left flank and rear. The Ibar Army and the Javor brigade had a minor role in the Serbian plan: they were expected to secure the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and replace Third Army in Kosovo after advancing farther south.\n\n[[File:Montenegrin heavy cannon, 1912.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Montenegrin artillery crossing the [[Lim (river)|Lim river]] during attack on [[Berane]]]]\n[[File:Montenegro Danillo 1912.jpg|thumb|Crown Prince Danilo visiting a Montenegrin battery]]\nThe Serbian Army under General (later Marshal) Putnik achieved three decisive victories in [[Vardar Macedonia]], its primary objective in the war, effectively destroying the Ottoman forces in the region and conquering northern Macedonia. They also helped the Montenegrins to take the [[Sand\u017eak]] and sent two divisions to help the Bulgarians at the siege of Edirne. The last battle for Macedonia was the [[Battle of Monastir]], in which the remains of the Ottoman Vardar Army were forced to retreat to central Albania. After the battle, Prime Minister Pasic asked Gen. Putnik to take part in the race for Thessaloniki. Putnik declined and instead turned his army to the west, towards Albania, foreseeing that a future confrontation between the Greeks and Bulgarians over Thessaloniki could greatly help Serbia's own plans for Vardar Macedonia. After the Great Powers applied pressure on them, the Serbs started to withdraw from northern Albania and the [[Sand\u017eak]], although they left behind their heavy artillery park to help the Montenegrins in the continuing siege of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. On 23 April 1913, Shkod\u00ebr's garrison was forced to surrender due to starvation.\n\n==Reasons for the Ottoman defeat==\nThe principal reason for the Ottoman defeat in the fall of 1912 was the decision on the part of the Ottoman government to respond to the ultimatum from the Balkan League on 15 October 1912 by declaring war at a time when the Ottoman mobilization ordered on 1 October was only partially complete.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 124\u2013127</ref> At the time of the declaration of war there were 580,000 Ottoman soldiers in the Balkans facing 912,000 soldiers of the Balkan League.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 127</ref> The bad condition of the roads together with sparse railroad network had led to the Ottoman mobilization being grossly behind schedule, and many of the commanders were new to their units, having only been appointed on 1 October 1912.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/> The Turkish historian Handan Nezir Akme\u0219e wrote that the best response when faced with the Balkan League ultimatum on 15 October on the part of the Ottomans would have been to try to stall for time via diplomacy while completing the mobilization instead of declaring war immediately.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/>\n\nThe War Minister [[Naz\u0131m Pasha]] and the Navy Minister [[Mahmud Muhtar Pasha]] had presented over-optimistic pictures of the Ottoman readiness for war to the Cabinet in October 1912 and advised that the Ottoman forces should take the offensive at once at the outbreak of hostilities.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/> By contrast, many senior army commanders were advocating taking the defensive when the war began, arguing that the incomplete mobilization together with serious logistic problems made taking the offensive impossible.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/> Other reasons for the defeat were:\n* Under the tyrannical and paranoid regime of Sultan Abdulhamid II, the Ottoman Army had been forbidden to engage in war games or maneuvers out of the fear that this might be the cover for a coup d'\u00e9tat.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 128\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 128</ref> The four years since the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 had not been enough time for the Ottoman Army to learn how to conduct large-scale maneuvers.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 128\"/> War games in 1909 and 1910 had shown that many Ottoman officers did not know how to efficiently move large bodies of troops such as divisions and corps, a deficiency that General Baron [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Colmar von der Goltz]] stated after watching the 1909 war games would take at least five years of training to address.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 120\u2013121</ref>\n* The Ottoman army was divided into two classes; ''Nizamiye'' troops who were conscripted for five years; and ''Redif'' who were reservists who served for seven years.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 5</ref> Training of the ''Redif'' troops had been neglected for decades, and the 50,000 ''Redif'' troops in the Balkans in 1912 had received extremely rudimentary training at best.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 128\u2013129</ref> One German officer, Major [[Otto von Lossow]] serving with the Ottomans complained some of the ''Redif'' troops did not know how to handle or fire a rifle.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 129</ref>\n* Support services in the Ottoman army such as logistics and medical services were extremely poor.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> There was a major shortage of doctors, no ambulances, few stretchers and the few medical faculties were entirely inadequate for treating the large numbers of wounded.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> Most of the wounded died as a result, which damaged morale. In particular, the badly organized transport corps was so inefficient that it was unable to supply the troops in the field with food, who were forced to resort to requisitioning food from local villages.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> Even so, Ottoman soldiers lived below the subsistence level with a daily diet of 90 grammes of cheese and 150 grammes of meat while having to march all day long, leaving much of the army sickly and exhausted.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> \n* The heavy rainfall in the fall of 1912 had turned the mud roads of the Balkans into quagmires which made it extremely difficult to supply the army in the field with ammunition, which led to constant shortages at the front.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 130</ref>\n* After the 1908 Revolution, the Ottoman officer corps had become politicized with many officers devoting themselves to politics at the expense of studying war.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e pages 130-131\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 130\u2013131</ref> Furthermore, the politicization of the Army had led to the Army being divided into factions, most notably between those who were members of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] and its opponents.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e pages 130-131\"/> Additionally, the Ottoman officer corps had been divided between ''Alayli'' (\u201cranker\u201d) officers who had been promoted up from NCOs and privates and the ''Mektepli'' (\u201ccollege-trained\u201d) officers who had graduated from the War College.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 132</ref> After the 1909 counter-revolution attempt, many of the ''Alayli'' officers had been purged.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\"/>  The bulk of the Ottoman Army, comprising peasant conscripts from Anatolia were much more comfortable with the ''Alayli''  officers than with the ''Mektepli'' officers who came from a different social milieu.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\"/> Furthermore, the decision to conscript non-Muslims for the first time meant that ''[[jihad]]'', the traditional motivating force for the Ottoman Army, was not employed in 1912, something that the officers of the German military mission advising the Ottomans believed was bad for Muslim morale.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Balkans attack Turkey in 1912, Danish cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1912 Danish cartoon shows Balkan states attacking Ottoman Empire in First Balkan War, October 1912]]\n\nThe [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] ended the First Balkan War on 30 May 1913. All Ottoman territory west of the [[Enez]]-[[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y]] line was ceded to the Balkan League, according to the ''status quo'' at the time of the armistice. The treaty also declared [[Independent Albania|Albania]] to be an independent state. Almost all of the territory that was designated to form the new Albanian state was currently occupied by either Serbia or Greece, which only reluctantly withdrew their troops. Having unresolved disputes with Serbia over the division of northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and with Greece over southern Macedonia, Bulgaria was prepared, if the need arose, to solve the problems by force, and began transferring its forces from [[Eastern Thrace]] to the disputed regions. Unwilling to yield to any pressure Greece and Serbia settled their mutual differences and signed a military alliance directed against Bulgaria on 1 May 1913, even before the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] had been concluded. This was soon followed by a [[Greek-Serbian Alliance of 1913|treaty of \"mutual friendship and protection\"]] on 19 May/June 1, 1913. Thus the scene for the [[Second Balkan War]] was set.\n\n==Fate of noncombatant population==\nThe First Balkan War caused extensive suffering for the noncombatant population in the areas through which the troops passed. The victorious countries resorted to a policy of national and religious assimilation in the newly acquired territories.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportofinternat00inteuoft Carnegie Report, pp. 148\u2013158]</ref> 50,000 Turks fled the [[Lozengrad]] region.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 340</ref> In January\u2013February 1913, the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] baptized thousands of [[Pomaks]] from the [[Rhodopes]] and [[Pirin]] regions.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 156</ref> In [[Vardar Macedonia]], beginning during the autumn of 1912, Serbian authorities put pressure on local people to declare themselves Serbs.

Bulgarian priests and teachers were persecuted, forced to flee, and replaced by Serbians.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 158\u2013185</ref> Bulgarian schools were closed.

On the other hand, many Turkish villages in the regions of [[Florina]] and Kailare ([[Ptolemaida]]) were burned by the Greek army and the Muslim population in southwestern Macedonia was subjected to looting and other reprisals.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Great Powers==\nThe developments that led to the war did not go unnoticed by the Great Powers, although there was an official consensus between the European Powers over the [[Eastern Question|territorial integrity of the Ottoman Empire]], which led to a stern warning to the Balkan states, unofficially each of them took a different diplomatic approach due to their conflicting interests in the area. As a result, any possible preventative effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n* [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher =  Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> However, it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans for Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which Russia itself had long-held ambitions.\n* [[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austro-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French however failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n* The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging the Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time it encouraged the Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances it had given to the Russians in regard of their expansion there.\n* [[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for an exit from the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with the significant Slav populations that campaigned against the German\u2013Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of the Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But the Habsburgs failed to achieve German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances \u2013 even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and notes about that passed to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n* The [[German Empire]], already heavily involved in the internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But in its effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, it was playing with the idea to replace the Balkan positions of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in its [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments. Finally, when Serb-Austrian tensions again [[July Crisis|grew hot in July 1914]] when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], no one had strong reservations about the possible conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.\n\n===First Balkan War conflicts===\n====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles====\n{| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The combined armies of the [[Balkan]] states overcame the numerically inferior and strategically disadvantaged Ottoman armies and achieved rapid success.\n\nThe war was a comprehensive and unmitigated disaster for the Ottomans, who lost 83% of their territories in Europe and 69% of their European population.<ref name=\"uslu\">[http://www.academia.edu/2966094/Balkan_Savaslari_ve_Balkan_Savaslarinda_Bulgaristan ''Balkan Sava\u015flar\u0131 ve Balkan Sava\u015flar\u0131'nda Bulgaristan''], S\u00fcleyman Uslu</ref> As a result of the war, the League captured and partitioned almost all remaining European territories of the Ottoman Empire. Ensuing events also led to the creation of an [[independent Albania]] which angered the [[Serbs]]. However, Bulgaria was dissatisfied over the division of the spoils in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], which provoked the start of the [[Second Balkan War]].\n\n== Background ==\nTensions among the [[Balkan]] states over their rival aspirations to the provinces of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[Rumelia]], namely [[Eastern Rumelia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], subsided somewhat following intervention by the [[Great Powers]] in the mid-19th century, aimed at securing both more complete protection for the provinces' Christian majority and protection of the status quo. By 1867, [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] had both secured independence, which was confirmed by the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878). The question of the viability of Ottoman rule was revived after the [[Young Turk Revolution]] of July 1908, which compelled the [[Sultan]] to restore the suspended Ottoman constitution.\n\nSerbia's aspirations to take over [[Ottoman Bosnia|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were thwarted by the [[Bosnian crisis]] and the Austrian annexation of the province in October 1908. The Serbs directed their expansionism to the south. Following the annexation, the [[Young Turks]] tried to induce the Muslim population of [[Bosnia]] to emigrate to the Ottoman Empire. Those who took up the offer were re-settled by the Ottoman authorities in districts of northern Macedonia where there were few Muslims. The experiment proved to be a catastrophe for the Empire since the immigrants readily united with the existing population of Albanian Muslims. They participated in the series of [[Albanian nationalism and independence#1911 Highlanders Uprising|Albanian uprisings]] before and during the spring [[Albanian Revolt of 1912]]. Some Albanian government troops switched sides.\n\nIn May 1912, the Albanian Hamidian revolutionaries, who wanted to reinstall Sultan Abdulhamit II to power, drove the Young Turkish forces out of [[Skopje]]<ref>Olsi Jazexhi, ''Ottomans into Illyrians : passages to nationhood in 20th century Albania,'' pp 86\u201389</ref> and pressed south towards Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), forcing the Young Turks to grant effective autonomy over large regions in June 1912.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A short History of Kosovo,'' pp 246\u2013247</ref> Serbia, which had helped arm the Albanian Catholic and Hamidian rebels and sent secret agents to some of the prominent leaders, took the revolt as a pretext for war.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp. 250\u2013251.</ref> Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria had all been in talks about possible offensives against the Ottoman Empire before the Albanian revolt of 1912 broke out; a formal agreement between Serbia and Montenegro had been signed on 7 March.<ref>Hall, ''The Balkan Wars 1912\u20131913,'' pp 10\u201313</ref> On 18 October 1912, [[Peter I of Serbia]] issued a declaration, 'To the Serbian People', which appeared to support Albanians as well as Serbs:\n\n{{quote |The Turkish governments showed no interest in their duties towards their citizens and turned a deaf ear to all complaints and suggestions.

By the grace of God, I have therefore ordered my brave army to join in the Holy War to free our brethren and to ensure a better future. In Old Serbia, my army will meet not only upon Christian Serbs, but also upon Muslim Serbs, who are equally dear to us, and in addition to them, upon Christian and Muslim Albanians with whom our people have shared joy and sorrow for thirteen centuries now. To all of them we bring freedom, brotherhood and equality.}}\n\nIn a search for allies, Serbia was ready to negotiate a treaty with Bulgaria.<ref>The war correspondence of Leon Trotsky: Hall, ''The Balkan Wars, 1912\u201313,'' 1980, p. 221</ref> The agreement provided that, in the event of victory against the Ottomans, Bulgaria would receive all of Macedonia south of the [[Kriva Palanka]]\u2013[[Ohrid]] line. Serbia's expansion was accepted by Bulgaria as being to the north of the [[Shar Mountains]] (i.e. [[Kosovo]]). The intervening area was agreed to be \"disputed\"; it would be arbitrated by the [[Tsar of Russia]] in the event of a successful war against the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Hall, ''The Balkan Wars, 1912\u20131913'' p. 11</ref> During the course of the war, it became apparent that the Albanians did not consider Serbia as a liberator, as suggested by King Peter I, nor did the Serbian forces observe his declaration of amity toward Albanians.\n\nAfter the successful coup d'\u00e9tat for [[Bulgarian unification|unification]] with Eastern Rumelia,<ref>Joseph Vincent Fulle, ''Bismarck's Diplomacy at Its Zenith,'' 2005, p.22</ref> Bulgaria began to dream that its national unification would be realized. For that purpose, it developed a large army, and identified as the \"[[Prussia]] of the Balkans.\"<ref>[http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/1/4/4/7/14477/14477-h/14477-h.htm Emile Joseph Dillon, ''The Inside Story of the Peace Conference'', Ch. XV]</ref> But Bulgaria could not win a war alone against the Ottomans.\n\nIn Greece, [[Hellenic Army]] officers had rebelled in the [[Goudi coup]] of August 1909 and secured the appointment of a progressive government under [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], which they hoped would resolve the [[History of Crete#Modern Crete|Crete question]] in Greece's favour. They also wanted to reverse their defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]] by the Ottomans. An emergency military reorganization led by a French military mission had been started for that purpose, but its work was interrupted by the outbreak of war in the Balkans. In the discussions that led Greece to join the [[Balkan League]], Bulgaria refused to commit to any agreement on the distribution of territorial gains, unlike its deal with Serbia over Macedonia. Bulgaria's diplomatic policy was to push Serbia into an agreement limiting its access to Macedonia,<ref>Hugh Seton-Watson & Christopher Seton-Watson, ''The Making of a New Europe,'' 1981, p. 116</ref> while at the same time refusing any such agreement with Greece. Bulgaria believed that its army would be able to occupy the larger part of Aegean Macedonia and the important port city of Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]]) before the Greeks.\n\nIn 1911, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] had launched an [[Italo-Turkish War|invasion of Tripolitania]] in present-day [[Libya]], which was quickly followed by the occupation of the [[Dodecanese]] Islands in the [[Aegean Sea]]. The Italians' decisive military victories over the Ottoman Empire and the successful [[Albanian revolt of 1912]]  encouraged the Balkan states to imagine they might win a war against the Ottomans. By the spring and summer of 1912, the various Christian Balkan nations had created a network of military alliances which became known as the Balkan League.\n\nThe Great Powers, most notably France and [[Austria-Hungary]], reacted to the formation of these alliances by trying to dissuade the League from going to war, but failed. In late September, both the League and the Ottoman Empire mobilized their armies. [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] was the first to declare war, on 25 September ([[Old Style|O.S.]])/8 October. After issuing an impossible ultimatum to the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] on 13 October, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece declared war on the Empire on 17 October. The declarations of war attracted a large number of war correspondents. An estimated [[Journalists of the Balkan Wars|200\u2013300 journalists from around the world covered the war in the Balkans]] in November 1912.<ref>\u201cCorrespondants de guerre\u201d, ''Le Petit Journal Illustr\u00e9'' (Paris), 3 novembre 1912.</ref>\n\n== Order of battle and plans ==\n[[File:Balkan 1912.svg|thumb|Political boundaries in the Balkans before the First Balkan War]]\nThe Ottoman [[order of battle]] when the war broke out constituted a total of 12,024 officers; 324,718 other ranks; 47,960 animals; 2,318 artillery pieces, and 388 machine guns. From these a total 920 officers and 42,607 men had been assigned in non-divisional units and services, the remaining 293,206 officers and men were assigned into four Armies.<ref name=\"Turkish General Staff\">{{cite book | last =Balkan Harbi (1912\u20131913) | title =Harbin Sebepleri, Askeri Hazirliklar ve Osmani Devletinin Harbi Girisi | publisher = Genelkurmay Basimevi| year =1993 | page =100 }}</ref> Opposing them and in continuation of their secret prewar settlements of expansion, the three Slavic allies (Bulgarian, Serbs and Montenegrins) had extensive plans to coordinate their war efforts: the Serbs and Montenegrins in the theater of [[Sand\u017eak]], the Bulgarians and Serbs in the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] and Bulgaria alone in the [[Thracia]]n theater.\n\nThe bulk of the Bulgarian forces (346,182 men) was to attack Thrace, pitted against the Thracian Ottoman Army of 96,273 men and about 26,000 garrison troops<ref>''The War between Bulgaria and Turkey, 1912\u20131913, Volume II'', Ministry of War 1928, pp. 659\u2013663</ref> or about 115,000 in total, according to Hall's, Erickson's and the Turkish Gen. Staff's 1993 studies. The remaining Ottoman army of about 200,000<ref name=\"Erickson2\">Erickson (2003), p. 170</ref> was located in Macedonia, pitted against the Serbian (234,000 Serbs and 48,000 Bulgarians under Serb command) and Greek (115,000 men) armies. It was divided into the Vardar and Macedonian Ottoman armies, with independent static guards around the fortress cities of [[Ioannina]] (against the Greeks in [[Epirus]]) and [[Shkod\u00ebr]] (against the Montenegrins in north Albania).\n\n=== Bulgaria ===\n{{further|Order of battle of the Bulgarian Army in the First Balkan War (1912)}}\n\nBulgaria was militarily the most powerful of the four Balkan states, with a large, well-trained and well-equipped army.<ref name=Hall16>Hall (2000), p. 16</ref> Bulgaria mobilized a total of 599,878 men out of a population of 4.3 million.<ref name=Hall18>Hall (2000), p. 18</ref> The Bulgarian field army counted for nine infantry [[Division (military)|divisions]], one cavalry division and 1,116 artillery units.<ref name=Hall16>Hall (2000), p. 16</ref> The Commander-in-Chief was [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Tsar Ferdinand]], while operating command was in the hands of his deputy, General [[Mihail Savov]]. The Bulgarians also possessed a small navy of six torpedo boats, which were restricted to operations along the country's [[Black Sea]] coast.<ref name=Hall17>Hall (2000), p. 17</ref>\n\nBulgaria was focused on actions in [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. It deployed its main force in Thrace, forming three armies. The [[First Army (Bulgaria)|First Army]] (79,370 men), under general [[Vasil Kutinchev]] with three infantry divisions, was deployed to the south of [[Yambol]], with direction of operations along the [[Tundzha]] river. The [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]] (122,748 men), under general [[Nikola Ivanov]], with two infantry divisions and one infantry brigade, was deployed west of the First and was assigned to capture the strong fortress of Adrianople ([[Edirne]]). According to the plans, the [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]] (94,884 men), under general [[Radko Dimitriev]], was deployed east of and behind the First, and was covered by the cavalry division hiding it from Turkish view. The Third Army had three infantry divisions and was assigned to cross the [[Stranja]] mountain and to take the fortress of Kirk Kilisse ([[K\u0131rklareli]]). The 2nd (49,180) and 7th (48,523 men) divisions were assigned independent roles, operating in [[Western Thrace]] and Eastern Macedonia respectively.\n\n=== Serbia ===\n{{further|Order of battle of the Serbian Army in the First Balkan War}}\n\nSerbia called upon about 255,000 men (out of a population of 2,912,000 people) with about 228 heavy guns, grouped in 10 infantry divisions, two independent brigades and a cavalry division, under the effective command of the former War Minister [[Radomir Putnik]].<ref name=Hall18>Hall (2000), p. 18</ref> The Serbian High Command, in its pre-war wargames,{{clarify|date=January 2017}} had concluded that the likeliest site of the decisive battle against the Ottoman [[Vardar Army]] would be on the [[Ov\u010de Pole]] plateau, before [[Skopje]]. Hence, the main forces were formed in three armies for the advance towards Skopje, while a division and an independent brigade were to cooperate with the Montenegrins in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]].\n\nThe First Army (132,000 men) was the strongest and was commanded by General [[Petar Bojovi\u0107]], forming the center of the drive towards Skopje. The Second Army (74,000 men) was commanded by General [[Stepa Stepanovi\u0107]], and consisted of one Serbian and one Bulgarian (7th Rila) division. It formed the left wing of the Army and advanced towards [[Stracin]]. The inclusion of a Bulgarian division was according to a pre-war arrangement between Serbian and Bulgarian armies, but that division ceased to obey the orders of Gen. Stepanovi\u0107 as soon as the war began, following only the orders of the Bulgarian High Command. The Third Army (76,000 men) was commanded by General [[Bo\u017eidar Jankovi\u0107]] and, being the army on the right wing, had the task to take Kosovo. It would then join the other armies in the expected battle at Ov\u010de Polje. There were two other concentrations in northwestern Serbia across the Serbo-Austrohungarian borders, the Ibar Army (25,000 men) under General [[Mihailo \u017divkovi\u0107]] and the Javor brigade (12,000 men) under Lt Colonel Milovoje An\u0111elkovi\u0107.\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{Further|Order of battle of the Hellenic Army in the First Balkan War}}\n[[File:Greek Artillery Balkans.jpg|thumb|Greek artillerymen with 75 mm field gun]]\nGreece, at the time a state of 2,666,000 people,<ref name=\"Erickson70\">Erickson (2003), p. 70</ref> was considered the weakest of the three main allies, since it fielded the smallest army and had suffered a defeat against the Ottomans 16 years before in the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1897]]. A British consular dispatch from 1910 expresses the common perception of the Greek Army's capabilities at the time: \"if there is war we shall probably see that the only thing Greek officers can do besides talking is to run away\".<ref name=\"Fotakis42\">Fotakis (2005), p. 42</ref> However, Greece was the only Balkan country to possess a substantial navy. This was vital to the League, as it could prevent Ottoman reinforcements from being rapidly transferred by ship from Asia to Europe. This fact was readily appreciated by the Serbs and Bulgarians, and was the chief factor in initiating the process of Greece's inclusion in their alliance.<ref>Fotakis (2005), p. 44</ref> As the Greek ambassador to Sofia put it during the negotiations that led to Greece's entry into the League: \"Greece can provide 600,000 men for the war effort. 200,000 men in the field, and the fleet will be able to stop 400,000 men being landed by Turkey between Salonica and [[Gallipoli]].\"<ref name=Hall17>Hall (2000), p. 17</ref>\n\nThe Greek Army was still undergoing reorganization by a [[French military mission to Greece (1911\u20131914)|French military mission]], which arrived in early 1911. Under French supervision, the Greeks had adopted the triangular infantry division as their main formation, but more importantly, the overhaul of the mobilization system allowed the country to field and equip a far greater number of troops than it had in 1897. While foreign observers estimated Greece would mobilize a force of approximately 50,000 men, the Greek Army fielded 125,000, with another 140,000 in the National Guard and reserves.<ref name=\"Erickson70\"/><ref name=\"Fotakis42\"/> Upon mobilization, as in 1897, this force was grouped in two field armies, reflecting the geographic division between the two operational theaters open to the Greeks: [[Thessaly]] and [[Epirus]]. The [[Army of Thessaly]] (\u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) was placed under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]], with Lt Gen [[Panagiotis Danglis]] as his chief of staff. It fielded the bulk of the Greek forces: seven infantry divisions, a cavalry regiment and four independent [[Evzones]] light mountain infantry battalions, roughly 100,000 men. It was expected to overcome the fortified Ottoman border positions and advance towards south and central Macedonia, aiming to take [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Bitola]]. The remaining 10,000 to 13,000 men in eight battalions were assigned to the [[Army of Epirus]] (\u03a3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac \u0397\u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5) under Lt Gen [[Konstantinos Sapountzakis]]. As it had no hope of capturing [[Ioannina]], the heavily fortified capital of Epirus, its initial mission was to pin down the Ottoman forces there, until sufficient reinforcements could be sent from the Army of Thessaly after its successful conclusion of operations.\n\n[[File:Averof.jpg|thumb|The armored cruiser {{ship|Greek cruiser|Georgios Averof||2}}, flagship of the Greek fleet. At the time, she was the most modern warship involved in the conflict, and played a crucial role in operations in the Aegean Sea.]]\nThe Greek Navy was relatively modern, strengthened by the recent purchase of numerous new units and undergoing reforms under the supervision of a [[British naval mission to Greece (1911\u20131915)|British mission]]. Invited by Prime Minister Venizelos in 1910, the mission began its work upon its arrival in May 1911. Granted extraordinary powers and led by Vice Admiral Lionel Grand Tufnell, it thoroughly reorganized the Navy Ministry and dramatically improved the number and quality of exercises in gunnery and fleet maneuvers.<ref name=\"Fotakis 2005, pp. 25\u201335\">Fotakis (2005), pp. 25\u201335</ref> In 1912, the core unit of the fleet was the fast [[armoured cruiser]] [[Greek cruiser Georgios Averof|''Georgios Averof'']], completed in 1910 and, at that time, the fastest and most modern warship in the combatant navies.<ref>Fotakis (2005), p. 45</ref> It was complemented by three rather antiquated battleships of the {{sclass-|Hydra|battleship|4}}. There were also eight destroyers built in 1906\u20131907, and six new destroyers that were hastily bought in summer 1912 as the imminence of war became apparent.<ref name=\"Fotakis 2005, pp. 25\u201335\"/>\n\nNevertheless, at the outbreak of the war, the Greek fleet was far from ready. The Ottoman battlefleet retained a clear advantage in number of ships, speed of the main surface units and, more importantly, in the number and caliber of the ships' guns.<ref>Fotakis (2005), pp. 45\u201346</ref> In addition, as the war caught the fleet in the middle of its expansion and reorganization, fully a third of the fleet (the six new destroyers and the submarine {{ship|Greek submarine|Delfin|1912|2}}) only reached Greece after hostilities had started, forcing the navy to reshuffle crews, who consequently suffered from lacking familiarization and training time. Coal stockpiles and other war stores were also in short supply, while the ''Georgios Averof'' had arrived with barely any ammunition, and would remain so until late November.<ref>Fotakis (2005), p. 46</ref>\n\n=== Montenegro ===\nMontenegro was also considered as the smallest nation in the Balkan Peninsula, but in recent years before the war, with support from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], it had improved its military skills. Also, it was the only Balkan country never to be fully conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Due to Montenegro being the smallest member of the League, it did not have much influence. Despite this, it was advantageous for Montenegro,{{clarify|date=March 2017}} because when the Ottoman Empire was trying to counter the actions of Serbia, Bulgaria and Greece, Montenegro had enough time for preparations which helped its successful military campaign.\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\nIn 1912, the Ottomans were in a difficult position. They had a large population, 26 million, but just over 6.1 million of them lived in the European part of the Empire. Of these, only 2.3 million were Muslims, the rest being Christians, who were considered unfit for conscription. The very poor transport network, especially in the Asian part, dictated that the only reliable way for a mass transfer of troops to the European theater was by sea, but that was at risk due to the Greek fleet in the Aegean Sea. In addition, the Ottomans were still engaged in a protracted war against the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] in Libya (and by now in the [[Dodecanese]] islands of the Aegean), which had dominated the Ottoman military effort for over a year. The conflict lasted until 15 October, a few days after the outbreak of hostilities in the Balkans. The Ottomans were unable to significantly reinforce their positions in the Balkans as their relations with the Balkan states deteriorated over the course of the year.<ref>Hall (2000), p. 19</ref>\n\n==== Ottoman forces in the Balkans ====\n[[File:Ottoman troops with flag.jpg|thumb|Ottoman troops during the Balkan Wars]]\nThe Ottomans' military capabilities were hampered by a number of factors, beginning with domestic strife, caused by the [[Young Turk Revolution]] and the counter-revolutionary coup several months later (see [[Ottoman countercoup of 1909]] and [[31 March Incident]]). This resulted in different groups competing for influence within the military. A German mission had tried to reorganize the army, but its recommendations had not been fully implemented. The Ottoman army was caught in the midst of reform and reorganization. In addition, several of the army's best battalions had been transferred to [[Yemen Vilayet|Yemen]] to face the ongoing rebellion there. In the summer of 1912, the Ottoman High Command made the disastrous decision to dismiss some 70,000 mobilized troops.<ref name=\"Hall18\"/><ref>Uyar & Erickson (2009), pp. 225\u2013226</ref> The regular army (''Nizam'') was composed of well-equipped and trained active divisions, but the reserve units (''Redif'') that reinforced it were ill-equipped, especially in artillery, and badly trained.\n\nThe Ottomans' strategic situation was difficult, as their borders were almost impossible to defend against a co-ordinated attack by the Balkan states. The Ottoman leadership decided to defend the entirety of their territory.

Older ships were retired and newer ones acquired, chiefly from France and Germany.

To a large extent this was due to the political upheaval in the aftermath of the [[Young Turk Revolution]]; between 1908 and 1911, the office of Navy Minister changed hands nine times. Inter-departmental infighting and the entrenched interests of the bloated and over-aged officer corps, many of whom occupied their positions as a quasi-[[sinecure]], further obstructed drastic reform. In addition, British attempts to control the Navy's construction programme were met with suspicion by the Ottoman ministers, and funds for Gamble's ambitious plans for new ships were not available.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 14\u201315</ref>\n\nTo counter the Greek acquisition of the ''Georgios Averof,'' the Ottomans initially tried to buy the new German armoured cruiser {{SMS|Bl\u00fccher}} or the [[battlecruiser]] {{SMS|Moltke}}.

The western region of the Balkans, including Albania, Kosovo, and Macedonia was less important to the resolution of the war and the survival of the Ottoman Empire than the Thracian theater, where the Bulgarians fought major battles against the Ottoman forces. Although the geography dictated that Thrace would be the major battlefield in a war with the Ottoman Empire,<ref name=\"Hall 2000, p. 22\"/> the position of the Ottoman Army there was jeopardized by erroneous intelligence estimates of their opponents' order of battle. Unaware of the secret prewar political and military settlement over Macedonia between Bulgaria and Serbia, the Ottoman leadership assigned the bulk of their forces there. The German ambassador [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim|Hans Baron von Wangenheim]], one of the most influential people in the Ottoman capital, had reported to Berlin on 21 October that the Ottoman forces believed that the bulk of the Bulgarian army would be deployed in Macedonia with the Serbs. Subsequently, the Ottoman HQ under Abdullah Pasha expected to meet only three Bulgarian infantry divisions, accompanied by cavalry, east of Adrianople.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 85</ref> According to E. J. Erickson this assumption possibly resulted from their analysis of the objectives of the Balkan Pact \u2013 but it had deadly consequences for the Ottoman Army in Thrace, which would have to defend the area against the bulk of the Bulgarian army against impossible odds.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 86</ref> This misappraisal was also the reason of the catastrophic aggressive Ottoman strategy at the start of the campaign in Thrace.\n\n====Bulgarian offensive and advance to \u00c7atalca====\n\n{{further|Battle of Kirk Kilisse|Battle of Lule Burgas|First Battle of \u00c7atalca}}\n\n[[File:Bulgarian Army FBW.JPG|thumb|Bulgarian military operations during the First Balkan War]]\nIn the Thracian front the Bulgarian army had placed 346,182 men against the Ottoman 1st Army with 105,000 men in eastern Thrace and the Kircaali detachment of 24,000 men in western Thrace. The Bulgarian forces were divided into the 1st (Lt. Gen. [[Vasil Kutinchev]]), 2nd (Lt. Gen. [[Nikola Ivanov]]) and 3rd (Lt. Gen. [[Radko Dimitriev]]) Bulgarian Armies of 297,002 men in the eastern part and 49,180 (33,180 regulars and 16,000 irregulars) under the 2nd Bulgarian Division (Gen. Stilian Kovachev) in the western part.<ref>Hall (2000), pp. 22\u201324</ref> The first large-scale battle occurred against the [[Edirne]]-[[K\u0131rklareli]] defensive line, where the Bulgarian 1st and 3rd Armies (together 174,254 men) defeated the Ottoman East Army (of 96,273 combatants),<ref>Hall (2000), pp. 2224</ref><ref>''The war between Bulgaria and Turkey 1912\u20131913, Volume II'' Ministry of War 1928, p.660</ref> near Gechkenli, Seliolu and Petra. The Ottoman XV Corps urgently left the area to defend the [[Gallipoli peninsula]] against an expected Greek amphibious assault which never materialized.<ref name=\"Erickson82\">Erickson (2003), p. 82</ref> The absence of this Corps created an immediate vacuum between Adrianople and [[Didymoteicho|Demotika]], and the 11th Infantry Division from the Eastern Army's IV Corps was moved there to replace it. Thus one complete army corps was removed from the Eastern Army's order of battle.<ref name=\"Erickson82\">Erickson (2003), p. 82</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of the insufficient intelligence on the invading forces, the Ottoman offensive plan failed completely in the face of Bulgarian superiority, forcing [[K\u00f6lemen Abdullah Pasha]] to abandon [[Battle of Kirk Kelesse|Kirk Kilisse]], which was taken without resistance by the Bulgarian [[Third Army (Bulgaria)|Third Army]].<ref name=\"Erickson82\"/> The fortress of Adrianople, with some 61,250 men, was isolated and [[Battle of Adrianople (1913)|besieged]] by the Bulgarian [[Second Army (Bulgaria)|Second Army]], although for the time being no assault was possible due to the lack of siege equipment in the Bulgarian inventory.<ref>Seton-Watson (1917), p. 238</ref> Another consequence of the Greek naval supremacy in the Aegean was that the Ottoman forces did not receive the reinforcements projected in the war plans, consisting of a further corps to be transferred by sea from [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and [[Ottoman Syria|Palestine]].<ref name=\"Erickson333\">Erickson (2003), p. 333</ref> Thus the Greek Navy played a crucial albeit indirect role in the Thracian campaign by neutralizing three corps, a significant portion of the Ottoman Army, in the all-important opening round of the war.<ref name=\"Erickson333\"/> Another, more direct, role was the emergency transportation of the Bulgarian 7th Rila Division from the Macedonian to the Thracian front after the termination of operations there.<ref>Seton-Watson (1917), p. 202</ref>\n\n[[File:Chataldzha attack.jpg|thumb|The Bulgarian attack at [[\u00c7atalca]].]]\nAfter the battle of Kirk Kilisse the Bulgarian high command decided to wait a few days, a decision which allowed the Ottoman forces to occupy a new defensive position on the [[L\u00fcleburgaz]]-[[Karaa\u011fa\u00e7, Edirne|Karaa\u011fa\u00e7]]-[[P\u0131narhisar]] line. Despite this, the Bulgarian attack by the First and Third Army which together accounted for 107,386 rifleman, 3,115 cavalry, 116 machine guns and 360 artillery pieces defeated the reinforced Ottoman Army consisting of 126,000 riflemen, 3,500 cavalry, 96 machine guns and 342 artillery pieces<ref name=\"Erickson102\">Erickson (2003), p.102</ref> and reached the [[Sea of Marmara]].

The Ottoman Kircaali detachment (Kircaali Redif and Kircaali Mustahfiz Divisions and 36th Regiment with 24,000 men), tasked with defending a 400&nbsp;km front across the [[Thessaloniki]]-[[Alexandroupoli]] railroad, failed to offer serious resistance and on 26 November their commander Yaver Pasha was captured together with 10,131 officers and men by [[Macedonian-Adrianopolitan Volunteer Corps]]. After the occupation of Thessaloniki by the Greek army, his surrender completed the isolation of the Ottoman forces in Macedonia from those in Thrace.\n\n[[File:Chataldja armistice.jpg|thumb|The delegates at the \u00c7atalca armistice; General [[Ivan Fichev]], [[Nazim Pasha]] and General [[Mihail Savov]] are seen in the first row.]]\nOn {{OldStyleDate|17 November|1912|4 November}}, the offensive against the \u00c7atalca Line began, despite clear warnings from Russia that if the Bulgarians occupied Constantinople it would attack them. The Bulgarians launched their [[First Battle of \u00c7atalca|attack]] along the defensive line with 176,351 men and 462 artillery pieces against the Ottomans' 140,571 men and 316 artillery pieces,<ref name=\"Erickson 2003, p. 131\"/> but despite Bulgarian superiority, the Ottomans succeeded in repulsing them. An armistice was consequently agreed on {{OldStyleDate|3 December|1912|20 November}} between the Ottomans and Bulgaria, the latter also representing Serbia and Montenegro, and peace negotiations began in London. Greece also participated in the conference, but refused to agree to a truce, continuing its operations in the Epirus sector. The negotiations were interrupted on {{OldStyleDate|23 January|1913|10 January}}, when a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat of 1913|Young Turk coup d'\u00e9tat]] in [[Constantinople]] under [[Enver Pasha]] overthrew the government of [[K\u00e2mil Pasha]]. Upon expiration of the armistice, on {{OldStyleDate|3 February|1913|21 January}}, hostilities recommenced.\n\n==== Ottoman counteroffensive ====\n{{further|Order of battle of the Bulgarian Army in the First Balkan War (1913)}}\n\nOn 20 February Ottoman forces began their attack, both in \u00c7atalca and south, at Gallipoli. There the Ottoman X Corps, with 19,858 men and 48 guns, landed at [[\u015eark\u00f6y]], at the same time as an attack of around 15,000 men supported by 36 guns (part of the 30,000-strong Ottoman army isolated in the Gallipoli peninsula) at [[Bulair]] further south. Both attacks were supported by fire from Ottoman warships, and were intended in the long term to relieve pressure on Edirne. Confronting them were about 10,000 men with 78 guns.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 262</ref> The Ottomans were probably unaware of the presence in the area of the newly formed [[Fourth Army (Bulgaria)|4th Bulgarian Army]] of 92,289 men under General [[Stiliyan Kovachev]]. The Ottoman attack in the thin [[isthmus]], with a front of just 1,800m, was hampered by thick fog and strong Bulgarian artillery and machine gunfire. As a result, the attack stalled, and was repulsed by a Bulgarian counterattack. By the end of the day both armies had returned to their original positions. Meanwhile, the Ottoman X Corps, which had landed at [[\u015eark\u00f6y]], advanced until by {{OldStyleDate|23 February|1913|10 February}} the reinforcements sent by General Kovachev succeeded in halting them. Casualties on both sides were light. After the failure of the frontal attack in Bulair, the Ottoman forces at \u015eark\u00f6y re-embarked into their ships on 11 February and were transported to Gallipoli.\n\nThe Ottoman attack at \u00c7atalca, directed against the powerful Bulgarian First and Third Armies, was initially launched only as a diversion from the Gallipoli-\u015eark\u00f6y operation, pinning down the Bulgarian forces [[in situ]]. Nevertheless, it resulted in unexpected success. The Bulgarians, who were weakened by [[cholera]] and concerned that an Ottoman amphibious invasion might endanger their armies, deliberately withdrew about 15&nbsp;km and to the south over 20&nbsp;km to their secondary defensive positions on higher ground to the west. With the end of the attack in Gallipoli the Ottomans canceled the operation, reluctant to leave the \u00c7atalca Line, but several days passed before the Bulgarians realized that the offensive was over. By 15 February the front had again stabilized but the fighting along the static lines continued until the armistice. The battle, which resulted in heavy Bulgarian casualties, could be characterized as an Ottoman victory at the tactical level, but strategically it was a failure, since it did nothing to prevent the failure of the Gallipoli-\u015eark\u00f6y operation or relieve the pressure on Edirne.\n\n==== Fall of Adrianople and Serbo-Bulgarian friction ====\n{{Main|Siege of Odrin (1912\u201313){{!}}Siege of Adrianople (1912\u201313)}}\n\n[[File:Bulgarian soldiers with dead Turkish civilians (Edirne).jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in the Ayvaz Baba fort, outside Adrianople, after its capture.]]\nThe failure of the \u015eark\u00f6y-Bulair operation and the deployment of the 2nd Serbian Army together with its much needed heavy siege artillery sealed Adrianople's fate. On 11 March after a two weeks' bombardment which destroyed many of the fortified structures around the city, the final assault started with Allied forces enjoying a crushing superiority over the Ottoman garrison.

The Bulgarian censor rigorously cut any references about the Serbian participation in the operation in the telegrams of the foreign correspondents. Public opinion in Sofia thus failed to realise the crucial services Serbia rendered in the battle. Accordingly, the Serbs claimed that their troops of the 20th Regiment were those who captured the Ottoman commander of the city, and that Colonel Gavrilovi\u0107 was the allied officer who accepted Shukri's official surrender of the garrison, a statement that the Bulgarians disputed. Subsequently, the Serbs officially protested, pointing out that although they had sent their troops to Adrianople to win for Bulgaria territory whose acquisition had never been foreseen by their mutual treaty,<ref name=\"Seton-Watson\">Seton-Watson, pp. 210\u2013238</ref> the Bulgarians had never fulfilled the clause of the treaty requiring Bulgaria to send 100,000 men to help the Serbians on their Vardar front. The Bulgarians answered that their staff had informed the Serbs about that on 23 August.{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} The friction escalated some weeks later when the Bulgarian delegates in London bluntly warned the Serbs that they must not expect Bulgarian support on their Adriatic claims. The Serbs angrily replied that was a clear withdrawal from the prewar agreement of mutual understanding according to the Kriva Palanka-Adriatic line of expansion, but the Bulgarians insisted that in their view, the Vardar Macedonian part of the agreement remained active and the Serbs were still obliged to surrender the area as agreed.<ref name=\"Seton-Watson\"/> The Serbs answered by accusing the Bulgarians of maximalism, pointing out that if they lost both northern Albania and Vardar Macedonia, their participation in the common war would have been virtually for nothing. The tension soon was expressed in a series of hostile incidents between the two armies along their common line of occupation across the Vardar valley. The developments essentially ended the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance and made a future war between the two countries inevitable.\n\n=== Greek theater ===\n\n====Macedonian front====\n\n[[File:Gr\u00e8ce 1ere Guerre balkanique.png|thumb|Greek operations during the First Balkan War (borders depicted are post-Second Balkan War)]]\nOttoman intelligence had also disastrously misread Greek military intentions. In retrospect, it would appear that the Ottoman staffs believed that the Greek attack would be shared equally between the two major avenues of approach, Macedonia and Epirus. The 2nd Army staff had therefore evenly balanced the combat strength of the seven Ottoman divisions between the Yanya Corps and VIII Corps, in Epirus and southern Macedonia respectively. The Greek Army also fielded seven divisions, but, having the initiative, concentrated all seven against VIII Corps, leaving only a number of independent battalions of scarcely divisional strength in the Epirus front. This had fatal consequences for the Western Group of Armies, since it led to the early loss of the strategic center of all three Macedonian fronts, the city of [[Thessaloniki]], a fact that sealed their fate.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 215</ref> In an unexpectedly brilliant and rapid campaign, the Army of Thessaly seized the city. In the absence of secure sea lines of communications, the retention of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople corridor was essential to the overall strategic posture of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Once this was gone, the defeat of the Ottoman Army became inevitable. To be sure, the Bulgarians and the Serbs played an important role in the defeat of the main Ottoman armies. Their great victories at Kirkkilise, L\u00fcleburgaz, Kumanovo, and Monastir (Bitola) shattered the Eastern and Vardar Armies. However, these victories were not decisive in the sense that they ended the war. The Ottoman field armies survived, and in Thrace, they actually grew stronger day by day. In the strategic point of view these victories were enabled partially by the weakened condition of the Ottoman armies brought about by the active presence of the Greek army and fleet.<ref>Erickson (2003), p. 334</ref>\n\nWith the declaration of war, the Greek Army of Thessaly under Crown Prince [[Constantine I of Greece|Constantine]] advanced to the north, successfully [[Battle of Sarantaporo|overcoming Ottoman opposition]] in the fortified mountain passes of [[Sarantaporo]]. After another victory at [[Battle of Yenidje|Giannitsa (Yenidje)]] on {{OldStyleDate|2 November|1912|20 October}}, the Ottoman commander [[Hasan Tahsin Pasha]] surrendered Thessaloniki and its garrison of 26,000 men to the Greeks on {{OldStyleDate|9 November|1912|27 October}}. Two Corps HQs (Ustruma and VIII), two Nizamiye divisions (14th and 22nd) and four Redif divisions (Salonika, Drama, Naslic and Serez) were thus lost to the Ottoman order of battle. Additionally, the Ottoman forces lost 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns and 70,000 rifles (Thessaloniki was the central arms depot for the Western Armies). The Ottoman forces estimated that 15,000 officers and men had been killed during the campaign in south Macedonia, bringing total losses up to 41,000 soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Erickson|first1=Edward|title=Defeat in detail : the Ottoman army in the Balkans, 1912\u20131913|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn.|isbn=0275978885|page=226}}</ref> Another direct consequence was that the destruction of the Macedonian Army sealed the fate of the Ottoman Vardar Army, which was fighting the Serbs to the north. The fall of Thessaloniki left it strategically isolated, without logistical supply and depth to maneuver, ensuring its destruction.\n\nUpon learning of the outcome of the battle of Giannitsa (Yenidje), the Bulgarian high command urgently dispatched their 7th ''Rila'' Division from the north in the direction of the city. The division arrived there a week later, the day after its surrender to the Greeks. Until 10 November, the Greek-occupied zone had been expanded to the line from [[Lake Dojran]] to the [[Pangaion hills]] west to [[Kavalla]]. In western Macedonia however, the lack of coordination between the Greek and Serbian HQs cost the Greeks a setback in the [[Battle of Vevi (1912)|Battle of Vevi]] on {{OldStyleDate|15 November|1912|2 November}}, when the Greek [[5th Infantry Division (Greece)|5th Infantry Division]] crossed its way with the VI Ottoman Corps (a part of the Vardar Army consisting of the 16th, 17th and 18th Nizamiye divisions), retreating to Albania following the battle of Prilep against the Serbs. The Greek division, surprised by the presence of the Ottoman Corps, isolated from the rest of Greek army and outnumbered by the now counterattacking Ottomans centered on [[Bitola|Monastir (Bitola)]], was forced to retreat. As a result, the Serbs beat the Greeks to Bitola.\n\n====Epirus front====\nIn the [[Epirus]] front the Greek army was initially heavily outnumbered, but due to the passive attitude of the Ottomans succeeded in conquering [[Preveza]] on 21 October 1912 and pushing north to the direction of [[Ioannina]]. On 5 November, Major [[Spyros Spyromilios]] led a [[Himara revolt of 1912|revolt]] in the coastal area of [[Himar\u00eb]] and expelled the Ottoman garrison without facing significant resistance,<ref name=Kondis>{{cite book|last=Kondis |first=Basil |title=Greece and Albania, 1908\u20131914 |publisher=Institute for Balkan Studies |year=1978|isbn=|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=hoknTaDNHYKfOpfliLgC&id=tEloAAAAMAAJ |page=93}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?hl=el&id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&dq=epirus+4000&q=5+November&pgis=1#search_anchor Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization].

During the siege, on 8 February 1913, the Russian pilot N. de Sackoff, flying for the Greeks, became the first pilot ever shot down in combat, when his biplane was hit by ground fire following a bomb run on the walls of Fort [[Bizani]]. He came down near the small town of [[Preveza]], on the coast north of the Ionian island of [[Lefkas]], secured local Greek assistance, repaired his plane and resumed flight back to base.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, David, \"Flight and Flying: A Chronology\", Facts On File, Inc., New York, New York, 1994, Library of Congress card number 92-31491, {{ISBN|0-8160-1854-5}}, page 61.</ref> The fall of Ioannina allowed the Greek army to continue its advance into [[northern Epirus]], the southern part of modern Albania, which it occupied.

This move was of major strategic importance, as it provided the Greeks with a forward base in close distance to the Dardanelles Straits, the Ottoman fleet's main anchorage and refuge.<ref>Fotakis (2005), pp. 47\u201348</ref><ref name=\"Hall64\">Hall (2000), p. 64</ref> In view of the Ottoman fleet's superiority in speed and [[broadside]] weight, the Greek planners expected it to sortie from the straits early in the war. Given the Greek fleet's unpreparedness resulting from the premature outbreak of the war, such an early Ottoman attack might well have been able to achieve a crucial victory. Instead, the Ottoman Navy spent the first two months of the war in operations against the Bulgarians in the Black Sea, giving the Greeks valuable time to complete their preparations and allowing them to consolidate their control of the Aegean.<ref>Fotakis (2005), pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\nBy mid-November Greek naval detachments had seized the islands of [[Imbros]], [[Thasos]], [[Agios Efstratios]], [[Samothrace]], [[Psara]] and [[Ikaria]], while landings were undertaken on the larger islands of [[Lesbos]] and [[Chios]] only on 21 and 27 November respectively.

On the same day, Greek troops of the Epirus Army seized the Ottoman naval base of [[Preveza]]. The Ottomans scuttled the four ships present there, but the Greeks were able to salvage the Italian-built torpedo-boats {{ship|Ottoman torpedo boat|Antalya||2}} and {{ship|Ottoman torpedo boat|Tokat||2}}, which were commissioned into the Greek Navy as {{ship|Greek torpedo boat|Nikopolis||2}} and {{ship|Greek torpedo boat|Tatoi||2}} respectively.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 19\u201320, 156</ref> A few days later, on 9 November, the wooden Ottoman armed steamer ''Trabzon'' was intercepted and sunk by the Greek torpedo boat No. 14 under Lt.

Kountouriotis suggested [[naval mine|mining]] the straits, but was not taken up for fear of international reactions.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\">Fotakis (2005), p. 50</ref> On 7 December, the head of the Ottoman fleet Tahir Bey was replaced by Ramiz Naman Bey, the leader of the hawkish faction among the officer corps. A new strategy was agreed, whereby the Ottomans were to take advantage of any absence of ''Georgios Averof'' to attack the other Greek ships. The Ottoman staff formulated a plan to lure a number of the Greek destroyers on patrol into a trap. A first such effort on 12 December failed due to boiler trouble, but the second try two days later resulted in an indecisive engagement between the Greek destroyers and the cruiser ''Mecidiye''.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 21\u201322</ref>\n\nThe war's first major fleet action, the [[Battle of Elli]], was fought two days later, on {{OldStyleDate|16 December|1912|3 December}}. The Ottoman fleet, with four battleships, nine destroyers and six torpedo boats, sailed to the entrance of the straits. The lighter Ottoman vessels remained behind, but the battleship squadron moved on north under cover of the forts at [[Kumkale, \u00c7anakkale|Kumkale]] and engaged the Greek fleet, coming from Imbros, at 9:40. Leaving the older battleships to follow their original course, Kountouriotis led the ''Averof'' into independent action: utilizing her superior speed, she cut across the Ottoman fleet's bow. Under fire from two sides, the Ottomans were quickly forced to withdraw to the Dardanelles.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref name=\"OSN22\">Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), p. 22</ref> The whole engagement lasted less than an hour, in which the Ottomans suffered heavy damage to the ''Barbaros Hayreddin'' and 18 dead and 41 wounded (most during their disorderly retreat), and the Greeks one dead and seven wounded.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 22, 196</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of Elli, on 20 December the energetic Lt. Commander [[Rauf Bey]] was placed in effective command of the Ottoman fleet. Two days later he led his forces out, hoping again to trap the patrolling Greek destroyers between two divisions of the Ottoman fleet, one heading for Imbros and the other waiting at the entrance of the straits. The plan failed as the Greek ships quickly broke contact. At the same time the ''Mecidiye'' came under attack by the Greek submarine ''Delfin'', which launched a torpedo against it but missed; the first such attack in history.<ref name=\"OSN22\"/> During this period, the Ottoman Army continued to press upon a reluctant Navy a plan for the re-occupation of Tenedos, which the Greek destroyers used as a base, by an amphibious operation. The operation was scheduled for 4 January. On that day, weather conditions were ideal and the fleet was ready, but the ''Yenihan'' regiment earmarked for the operation failed to arrive on time. The naval staff nevertheless ordered the fleet to sortie, and an engagement developed with the Greek fleet, without any significant results on either side.<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 22\u201323</ref> Similar sorties followed on 10 and 11 January, but the results of these \"cat and mouse\" operations were always the same: \"the Greek destroyers always managed to remain outside the Ottoman warships' range, and each time the cruisers fired a few rounds before breaking off the chase.\"<ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), p. 23</ref>\n\n[[File:Savuranoglu hamidiye.jpg|thumb|Ottoman cruiser {{ship|Ottoman cruiser|Hamidiye||2}}.

The ''Hamidiye'' then left the Aegean for the Eastern Mediterranean, making stops at [[Beirut]] and [[Port Said]] before entering the [[Red Sea]]. Although providing a major morale boost for the Ottomans, the operation failed to achieve its primary objective, as Kountouriotis refused to leave his post and pursue the ''Hamidiye''.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref name=\"OSN26\"/><ref name=\"Hall65\">Hall (2000), p. 65</ref>\n\nFour days later, on {{OldStyleDate|18 January|1913|5 January}}, when the Ottoman fleet again sallied from the straits towards Lemnos, it was defeated for a second time in the [[Battle of Lemnos (1913)|Battle of Lemnos]]. This time, the Ottoman warships concentrated their fire on the ''Averof'', which again made use of its superior speed and tried to \"[[cross the T]]\" of the Ottoman fleet. ''Barbaros Hayreddin'' was again heavily damaged, and the Ottoman fleet was forced to return to the shelter of the Dardanelles and their forts. The Ottomans suffered 41 killed and 101 wounded.<ref name=\"Fotakis50\"/><ref>Langensiepen & G\u00fclery\u00fcz (1995), pp. 23\u201324, 196</ref> It was the last attempt of the Ottoman Navy to leave the Dardanelles, thereby leaving the Greeks dominant in the Aegean.

Strategically the Serbian forces were divided into four independent armies and groups: the Javor brigade and the Ibar Army, which operated against Ottoman forces in the area of Novi Pazar; the Third Army, which operated against Ottoman forces in the areas of Kosovo and Metohija; the First Army, which operated against Ottoman forces in the area of northern Macedonia; and the Second Army (operating from the Bulgarian territory), which operated against Ottoman forces in the area of eastern Macedonia. The decisive battle was expected to be fought in the area of northern Macedonia, more specifically in the plains of [[Ov\u010de Pole]], where the main forces of Ottoman Vardar Army were expected to concentrate.\n\nAccording to the plan of the Serbian Supreme Command, three Serbian armies (First, Second and Third) were supposed to encircle and destroy the Vardar Army in that area, with the First Army advancing from the north (along the line of Vranje-Kumanovo-Ov\u010de Pole ), the Second Army advancing from the east (along the line of Kriva Palanka-Kratovo-Ov\u010de Pole) and the Third Army advancing from the north-west (along the line of Pri\u0161tina-Skopje-Ov\u010de Pole). In the execution of this plan, the main role was given to the First Army while the Second Army was expected to cut off the Vardar Army's retreat route, and if necessary attack its rear and right flank. The main goal of Third Army was to take Kosovo and Metohija, and if necessary give assistance to the First Army by attacking the Vardar Army's left flank and rear. The Ibar Army and the Javor brigade had a minor role in the Serbian plan: they were expected to secure the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]] and replace Third Army in Kosovo after advancing farther south.\n\n[[File:Montenegrin heavy cannon, 1912.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Montenegrin artillery crossing the [[Lim (river)|Lim river]] during attack on [[Berane]]]]\n[[File:Montenegro Danillo 1912.jpg|thumb|Crown Prince Danilo visiting a Montenegrin battery]]\nThe Serbian Army under General (later Marshal) Putnik achieved three decisive victories in [[Vardar Macedonia]], its primary objective in the war, effectively destroying the Ottoman forces in the region and conquering northern Macedonia. They also helped the Montenegrins to take the [[Sand\u017eak]] and sent two divisions to help the Bulgarians at the siege of Edirne. The last battle for Macedonia was the [[Battle of Monastir]], in which the remains of the Ottoman Vardar Army were forced to retreat to central Albania. After the battle, Prime Minister Pasic asked Gen. Putnik to take part in the race for Thessaloniki. Putnik declined and instead turned his army to the west, towards Albania, foreseeing that a future confrontation between the Greeks and Bulgarians over Thessaloniki could greatly help Serbia's own plans for Vardar Macedonia. After the Great Powers applied pressure on them, the Serbs started to withdraw from northern Albania and the [[Sand\u017eak]], although they left behind their heavy artillery park to help the Montenegrins in the continuing siege of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. On 23 April 1913, Shkod\u00ebr's garrison was forced to surrender due to starvation.\n\n==Reasons for the Ottoman defeat==\nThe principal reason for the Ottoman defeat in the fall of 1912 was the decision on the part of the Ottoman government to respond to the ultimatum from the Balkan League on 15 October 1912 by declaring war at a time when the Ottoman mobilization ordered on 1 October was only partially complete.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 124\u2013127</ref> At the time of the declaration of war there were 580,000 Ottoman soldiers in the Balkans facing 912,000 soldiers of the Balkan League.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 127</ref> The bad condition of the roads together with sparse railroad network had led to the Ottoman mobilization being grossly behind schedule, and many of the commanders were new to their units, having only been appointed on 1 October 1912.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/> The Turkish historian Handan Nezir Akme\u0219e wrote that the best response when faced with the Balkan League ultimatum on 15 October on the part of the Ottomans would have been to try to stall for time via diplomacy while completing the mobilization instead of declaring war immediately.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/>\n\nThe War Minister [[Naz\u0131m Pasha]] and the Navy Minister [[Mahmud Muhtar Pasha]] had presented over-optimistic pictures of the Ottoman readiness for war to the Cabinet in October 1912 and advised that the Ottoman forces should take the offensive at once at the outbreak of hostilities.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/> By contrast, many senior army commanders were advocating taking the defensive when the war began, arguing that the incomplete mobilization together with serious logistic problems made taking the offensive impossible.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir page 127\"/> Other reasons for the defeat were:\n* Under the tyrannical and paranoid regime of Sultan Abdulhamid II, the Ottoman Army had been forbidden to engage in war games or maneuvers out of the fear that this might be the cover for a coup d'\u00e9tat.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 128\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 128</ref> The four years since the Young Turk Revolution of 1908 had not been enough time for the Ottoman Army to learn how to conduct large-scale maneuvers.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 128\"/> War games in 1909 and 1910 had shown that many Ottoman officers did not know how to efficiently move large bodies of troops such as divisions and corps, a deficiency that General Baron [[Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz|Colmar von der Goltz]] stated after watching the 1909 war games would take at least five years of training to address.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 120\u2013121</ref>\n* The Ottoman army was divided into two classes; ''Nizamiye'' troops who were conscripted for five years; and ''Redif'' who were reservists who served for seven years.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 5</ref> Training of the ''Redif'' troops had been neglected for decades, and the 50,000 ''Redif'' troops in the Balkans in 1912 had received extremely rudimentary training at best.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 128\u2013129</ref> One German officer, Major [[Otto von Lossow]] serving with the Ottomans complained some of the ''Redif'' troops did not know how to handle or fire a rifle.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 129</ref>\n* Support services in the Ottoman army such as logistics and medical services were extremely poor.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> There was a major shortage of doctors, no ambulances, few stretchers and the few medical faculties were entirely inadequate for treating the large numbers of wounded.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> Most of the wounded died as a result, which damaged morale. In particular, the badly organized transport corps was so inefficient that it was unable to supply the troops in the field with food, who were forced to resort to requisitioning food from local villages.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> Even so, Ottoman soldiers lived below the subsistence level with a daily diet of 90 grammes of cheese and 150 grammes of meat while having to march all day long, leaving much of the army sickly and exhausted.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 129\"/> \n* The heavy rainfall in the fall of 1912 had turned the mud roads of the Balkans into quagmires which made it extremely difficult to supply the army in the field with ammunition, which led to constant shortages at the front.<ref>Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 130</ref>\n* After the 1908 Revolution, the Ottoman officer corps had become politicized with many officers devoting themselves to politics at the expense of studying war.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e pages 130-131\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris pages 130\u2013131</ref> Furthermore, the politicization of the Army had led to the Army being divided into factions, most notably between those who were members of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] and its opponents.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e pages 130-131\"/> Additionally, the Ottoman officer corps had been divided between ''Alayli'' (\u201cranker\u201d) officers who had been promoted up from NCOs and privates and the ''Mektepli'' (\u201ccollege-trained\u201d) officers who had graduated from the War College.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\">Akme\u0219e, Handan Nezir ''The Birth of Modern Turkey The Ottoman Military and the March to World I'', London: I.B Tauris page 132</ref> After the 1909 counter-revolution attempt, many of the ''Alayli'' officers had been purged.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\"/>  The bulk of the Ottoman Army, comprising peasant conscripts from Anatolia were much more comfortable with the ''Alayli''  officers than with the ''Mektepli'' officers who came from a different social milieu.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\"/> Furthermore, the decision to conscript non-Muslims for the first time meant that ''[[jihad]]'', the traditional motivating force for the Ottoman Army, was not employed in 1912, something that the officers of the German military mission advising the Ottomans believed was bad for Muslim morale.<ref name=\"Akme\u0219e page 132\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n[[File:Balkans attack Turkey in 1912, Danish cartoon.jpg|thumb|right|1912 Danish cartoon shows Balkan states attacking Ottoman Empire in First Balkan War, October 1912]]\n\nThe [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] ended the First Balkan War on 30 May 1913. All Ottoman territory west of the [[Enez]]-[[K\u0131y\u0131k\u00f6y]] line was ceded to the Balkan League, according to the ''status quo'' at the time of the armistice. The treaty also declared [[Independent Albania|Albania]] to be an independent state. Almost all of the territory that was designated to form the new Albanian state was currently occupied by either Serbia or Greece, which only reluctantly withdrew their troops. Having unresolved disputes with Serbia over the division of northern [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and with Greece over southern Macedonia, Bulgaria was prepared, if the need arose, to solve the problems by force, and began transferring its forces from [[Eastern Thrace]] to the disputed regions. Unwilling to yield to any pressure Greece and Serbia settled their mutual differences and signed a military alliance directed against Bulgaria on 1 May 1913, even before the [[Treaty of London, 1913|Treaty of London]] had been concluded. This was soon followed by a [[Greek-Serbian Alliance of 1913|treaty of \"mutual friendship and protection\"]] on 19 May/June 1, 1913. Thus the scene for the [[Second Balkan War]] was set.\n\n==Fate of noncombatant population==\nThe First Balkan War caused extensive suffering for the noncombatant population in the areas through which the troops passed. The victorious countries resorted to a policy of national and religious assimilation in the newly acquired territories.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/reportofinternat00inteuoft Carnegie Report, pp. 148\u2013158]</ref> 50,000 Turks fled the [[Lozengrad]] region.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 340</ref> In January\u2013February 1913, the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church]] baptized thousands of [[Pomaks]] from the [[Rhodopes]] and [[Pirin]] regions.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 156</ref> In [[Vardar Macedonia]], beginning during the autumn of 1912, Serbian authorities put pressure on local people to declare themselves Serbs. The local governments, established by [[IMRO]] in [[Ohrid]], [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and other cities, were disbanded. Bulgarian priests and teachers were persecuted, forced to flee, and replaced by Serbians.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 158\u2013185</ref> Bulgarian schools were closed. Serbian troops carried out a policy of disarming the local militia, accompanied by beatings and threats.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 177</ref>\n\nGreeks in Southern Macedonia conducted a similar policy to the local Bulgarian and other non-Greek population.<ref>Carnegie Report, pp. 106, 186\u2013208</ref> During the war, local Muslims and Ottoman soldiers burned and pillaged Christian villages in Southwestern Macedonia. On the other hand, many Turkish villages in the regions of [[Florina]] and Kailare ([[Ptolemaida]]) were burned by the Greek army and the Muslim population in southwestern Macedonia was subjected to looting and other reprisals.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n==Albanian national interests==\nThe Balkan Powers expansionist campaign meant serious consequences for the Albanians interests. The aspirations of Montenegrins included Shkod\u00ebr and Serbia's aspiration was the port of Durr\u00ebs. The two countries did not take into consideration the already inhabited Albanian regions which were annexed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=A. CHEKREZI, A.B.

As a result, any possible preventative effect of the common official warning was cancelled by the mixed unofficial signals, and failed to prevent or to stop the war:\n* [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a prime mover in the establishment of the Balkan League and saw it as an essential tool in case of a future war against its rival, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<ref name=\"Stowell1\">{{cite book | last = Stowell | first = Ellery Cory|authorlink=Ellery Cory Stowell | title =The Diplomacy Of The War Of 1914: The Beginnings Of The War (1915) | publisher =  Kessinger Publishing, LLC. | year =2009 | isbn =978-1-104-48758-4 | page =94 }}</ref> However, it was unaware of the Bulgarian plans for Thrace and Constantinople, territories on which Russia itself had long-held ambitions.\n* [[French Third Republic|France]], not feeling ready for a war against Germany in 1912, took a totally negative position against the war, firmly informing its ally Russia that it would not take part in a potential conflict between Russia and Austro-Hungary if it resulted from the actions of the Balkan League. The French however failed to achieve British participation in a common intervention to stop the Balkan conflict.\n* The [[British Empire]], although officially a staunch supporter of the Ottoman Empire's integrity, took secret diplomatic steps encouraging the Greek entry into the League in order to counteract Russian influence. At the same time it encouraged the Bulgarian aspirations over Thrace, preferring a Bulgarian Thrace to a Russian one, despite the assurances it had given to the Russians in regard of their expansion there.\n* [[Austria-Hungary]], struggling for an exit from the [[Adriatic]] and seeking ways for expansion in the south at the expense of the Ottoman Empire, was totally opposed to any other nation's expansion in the area. At the same time, the Habsburg empire had its own internal problems with the significant Slav populations that campaigned against the German\u2013Hungarian control of the multinational state. Serbia, whose aspirations in the direction of the Austrian-held Bosnia were no secret, was considered an enemy and the main tool of Russian machinations that were behind the agitation of Austria's Slav subjects. But the Habsburgs failed to achieve German backup for a firm reaction. Initially, Emperor [[Wilhelm II]] told the [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] that Germany was ready to support Austria in all circumstances \u2013 even at the risk of a world war, but the Austro-Hungarians hesitated. Finally, in the [[German Imperial War Council of 8 December 1912]] the consensus was that Germany would not be ready for war until at least mid-1914 and notes about that passed to the Habsburgs. Consequently, no actions could be taken when the Serbs acceded to the Austrian ultimatum of 18 October and withdrew from Albania.\n* The [[German Empire]], already heavily involved in the internal Ottoman politics, officially opposed a war against the Empire. But in its effort to win Bulgaria for the [[Central Powers]], and seeing the [[Sick man of Europe|inevitability]] of Ottoman disintegration, it was playing with the idea to replace the Balkan positions of the Ottomans with a friendly Greater Bulgaria in its [[Treaty of San Stefano|San Stefano]] borders\u2014an idea that was based on the German origin of the [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria|Bulgarian King]] and his anti-Russian sentiments. Finally, when Serb-Austrian tensions again [[July Crisis|grew hot in July 1914]] when [[Black Hand (Serbia)|a Serbian backed organization]] assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|the heir of the Austro-Hungarian throne]], no one had strong reservations about the possible conflict and the [[First World War]] broke out.\n\n===First Balkan War conflicts===\n====Bulgarian-Ottoman battles====\n{| style=\"width:76%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[Synoptic Gospels]] ([[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) describe John baptising Jesus; in the [[Gospel of John]] this is implied in {{bibleverse||John|1:32\u20131:34|NKJV}}.\n\n===In Mark===\n[[File:Brueghel l'Ancien - La Pr\u00e9dication de Saint Jean-Baptiste.jpg|thumb|right|''The Preaching of St. John the Baptist'' by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], 1566|upright=1.8]]\nThe Gospel of Mark introduces John as a fulfilment of a prophecy from the [[Book of Isaiah]] (in fact, a conflation of texts from Isaiah, [[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]])<ref name=\"Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31\">Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.</ref>  about a messenger being sent ahead, and a voice crying out in the wilderness. John is described as wearing clothes of camel's hair, living on [[locust]]s and wild [[honey]]. John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan. The account describes how, as he emerges from the water, the heavens open and the Holy Spirit descends on him 'like a dove'. A voice from heaven then says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.\" ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|NRSV}})\n\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch [[Herod Antipas]], hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying [[Herodias]], the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who 'liked to listen' to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a 'righteous and holy man'.\n\nThe account then describes how Herod's daughter Herodias ([[NRSV]]; other translations refer to the girl as the ''daughter of Herodias'') dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.({{bibleref2|Mark|6:17\u201329|NRSV}})\n\nThere are a number of difficulties with this passage. The Gospel refers to Antipas as 'King'<ref>John R. Donahue, Daniel J.

And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nIn those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n;Death of John (Mark 6)\n\nKing Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\nBut an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.\n\n([[English Standard Version]])\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In Matthew===\n[[File:Mattia Preti - San Giovanni Battista Predicazione.jpg|thumb|''St. John the Baptist Preaching'', {{circa|1665}}, by [[Mattia Preti]]]]\nThe Gospel of Matthew account begins with the same modified quotation from Isaiah,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40.3&version=NRSV|title=Isaiah 40.3 NRSV \u2013 A voice cries out: \"In the wilderness |work=Bible Gateway}}</ref> moving the Malachi and Exodus material to later in the text, where it is quoted by Jesus.<ref name=\"Moyise2011\">{{cite book|author=Steve Moyise|title=Jesus and Scripture: Studying the New Testament Use of the Old Testament|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C9PRrvnVdzcC&pg=PA40|date=September 1, 2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3749-1|page=40}}</ref> The description of John is taken directly from Mark (\"clothing of camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey\"), along with the proclamation that one was coming who would baptise with the Holy Spirit \"and fire\" ({{bibleref2|Matthew|3:1\u201312|NRSV}}).\n\nUnlike Mark, Matthew describes John as critical of Pharisees and Sadducees and as preaching \"the kingdom of heaven is at hand\" and a \"coming judgment\".\n\nMatthew shortens the account of the beheading of John, and adds two elements: that Herod Antipas wants John dead, and that the death is reported to Jesus by his disciples.<ref name=\"Wink2006\">{{cite book|author=Walter Wink|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWNe6CwgPKwC&pg=PA27|date=November 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-03130-1|page=27}}</ref> Matthew's approach is to shift the focus away from Herod and onto John as a prototype of Jesus.

Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n\"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Matthew 11)\n\nNow when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\nAs they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.'\n\nTruly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n\"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\nFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\n; Death of John (Matthew 14)\n\nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.

His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.\n\nOne day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, 'to reconcile fathers to their children' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\"\n\n\"How can I be sure of this?\" Zechariah asked the angel. \"For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.\"\n\n\"I am Gabriel,\" the angel answered, \"who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said, \"he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.\"\n\nSix months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: \"You have been shown great favor \u2013 the Lord is with you.\"\n\nMary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. The child will be great and will be called 'Son of the Most High,' and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n\"How can this be?\" Mary asked the angel. \"For I have no husband.\"\n\n\"The Holy Spirit will descend on you,\" answered the angel, \"and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called 'holy,' and 'Son of God.' And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"I am the servant of the Lord,\" exclaimed Mary; \"let it be with me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her.\n\nSoon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried aloud: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.\"\n\nAnd Mary said:\n\n\"My soul exalts the Lord,\nmy spirit delights in God my Savior;\nfor he has remembered his humble servant girl;\nAnd from this hour all ages will count me happy!\n\nGreat things has the Almighty done for me;\nAnd holy is his name.\nFrom age to age his mercy rests\nOn those who honor him.\n\nMighty are the deeds of his arm;\nHe scatters the proud with their own devices,\nhe casts down princes from their thrones,\nand the humble he uplifts,\nthe hungry he loads with gifts,\nand the rich he sends empty away.\n\nHe has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,\nEver mindful of his mercy\n(As he promised to our forefathers)\nFor Abraham and his race for ever.\"\n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him 'Zechariah' after his father, when his mother spoke up: \"No, he is to be called John.\"\n\n\"You have no relation of that name!\" they exclaimed; and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words \u2013 'His name is John.' Everyone was surprised; and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about; and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another \u2013 \"What can this child be destined to become?\" For the Power of the Lord was with him.\n\nThen his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:\n\n\"Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nWho has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,\nand has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation\nIn the house of his servant David \u2013\n\nAs he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old \u2013\nsalvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,\nshowing mercy to our forefathers,\nAnd mindful of his sacred covenant.\n\nThis was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham \u2013\nThat we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,\nand should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,\nIn his presence all our days.\n\nAnd you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,\nFor you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,\nto give his people the knowledge of salvation\nIn the forgiveness of their sins,\n\nthrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWhereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,\nto give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,\nAnd guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nThe child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.\n\n; John and his baptism of Jesus, Imprisonment of John (Luke 3)\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah \u2013\n\n'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:\n\"Make ready the way of the Lord,\nMake his paths straight.\nEvery chasm will be filled,\nEvery mountain and hill will be leveled,\nThe winding ways will be straightened,\nThe rough roads made smooth,\nand everyone will see the salvation of God.\"'\n\nAnd John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: \"You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves 'Abraham is our ancestor,' for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n\"What are we to do then?\" the people asked. \"Let anyone who has two coats,\" answered John, \"share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.\"\n\nEven tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: \"Teacher, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,\" John answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked \"And we \u2013 what are we to do?\" he said: \"Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.\"\n\nThen, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all, said: \"I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.\"\n\nAnd so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,  crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,  and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice \u2013 \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.\"\n\n; John's disciples and fast (Luke 5:33)\n\"John's disciples,\" they said to Jesus, \"Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Luke 7)\nAll these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask \u2013 \"Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for some one else?\"\n\nWhen these men found Jesus, they said: \"John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask \u2013 'Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for somebody else?'\" At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the question was: \"Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard \u2013 the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.\"\n\nWhen John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says \u2013\n\n'I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\nand he will prepare your way before you.'\n\nThere is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\"\n\n(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. But the Pharisees and the students of the law, having rejected John's baptism, frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.)\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In the Gospel of John===\nThe fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as \"a man sent from God\" who \"was not the light\", but \"came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:6\u20138|NKJV}}</ref> John clearly denies being the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet', instead describing himself as the \"voice of one crying in the wilderness\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:23|NKJV}}, compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|40:3|NKJV}}</ref>\n\nUpon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the \"testifier and confessor ''par excellence''\", particularly when compared to figures like [[Nicodemus]].<ref>{{citation|last=Vande Vrede|first=Keith|title=A Contrast Between Nicodemus and John the Baptist in the Gospel of John|volume=57|date=December 2014|pages=715\u201326|editor-last=Kostenberger|editor-first=Andreas|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|issue=4|issn=0360-8808|editor-link=Andreas J.

He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.\n\nWhen the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John \u2013 \"Who are you?\", he told them clearly and simply: \"I am not the Christ.\"\n\n\"What then?\" they asked. \"Are you Elijah?\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"I am not.\"\n\"Are you 'the prophet'?\" He answered, \"No.\"\n\"Who then are you?\" they continued; \"tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us.

I was taking about him when I said 'After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.' I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.\"\n\nJohn also said: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him \u2013 he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.\" The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: \"There is the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.\n\n; John 3\nJohn, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. (For John had not yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of 'purification;' and the disciples came to John and said: \"Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony \u2013 he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.\" John's answer was \u2013 \"A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. You are yourselves witnesses that I said 'I am not the Christ,' but 'I have been sent before him as a messenger.' It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to the full. He must become greater, and I less.\"\n\nHe who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under 'God's displeasure.'\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===Comparative analysis===\nSimon J.

(Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)<ref name=\"Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31\">Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.</ref>\n\n; Baptism of Jesus\n\nThe gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy\". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the \"voice came out of heaven\" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down \"out of heaven\" (John 12:28\u201330, John 1:32).\n\nIn Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nIn the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.\n\n; John's knowledge of Jesus\n\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n; John and Elijah\n{{see also|Matthew 3:4}}\nThe Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to [[Elijah]]. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in [[2 Kings 1:8]], who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is \"Elijah who was to come\" (Matt. 11:14 \u2013 see also Matt. 17:11\u201313); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|NAB}}).\"\n\n==In Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews''==\nAn account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by [[Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100):<ref>\"Josephus, Flavius.\" In: Cross, F.

Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to [[Machaerus|Macherus]], the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death.

Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod's army in 36 AD.

The historians [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] and [[Theodoretus]] record that the [[shrine]] was [[desecration|desecrated]] under [[Julian the Apostate]] around 362, the bones being partly burned. A portion of the rescued relics were carried to [[Jerusalem]], then to [[Alexandria]], where on 27 May 395, they were laid in the [[basilica]] newly dedicated to the Forerunner on the former site of the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|temple of Serapis]]. The tomb at Sebaste continued, nevertheless, to be visited by pious [[pilgrim]]s, and [[Saint Jerome]] bears witness to miracles being worked there.\n\nWhat became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine.

However, the decapitation cloth of Saint John is kept at the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The Coptic Christian Orthodox Church also claim to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist.

The New Testament Gospels speak of this role. In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:17}} the role of John is referred to as being \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:76}} as \"thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" and in {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:77}} as being \"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.\"\n\nThere are several passages within the [[Old Testament]] which are interpreted by Christians as being [[prophecy|prophetic]] of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the [[Book of Malachi]] ({{Bibleref2|Malachi 3:1}}) that refers to a prophet who would ''prepare the way of the Lord'':\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.|Malachi 3:1<ref>{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:1|NRSV}}</ref>}}\n\nand also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5\u20136 where it says,\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.}}\n\nThe Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the [[Passover Seder]]. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew 17:10}}, \"Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?\" The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,\n\n{{quote|Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things.

After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, \"countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.\" Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where  disciples present before Jesus indicated some people believed he was John the Baptist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/were-jesus-and-john-the-baptist-competitors-finding-jesus-professor-describes-their-relationship.html|title=Were Jesus and John the Baptist Competitors?

Crosby, PhD, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA; Capuchin friar and priest; in his paper \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?,\" stated there was \"no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.\" He conveys that John's concept of what a messiah should be, was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby identifies twenty-five points in the Gospel accounts that lead to the conclusion that John's effectiveness as a \"precursor\" in encouraging others to follow Jesus was very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus\u2019 disciples. Crosby noted that while many others believed Jesus' miracles, there is no record of these \"signs\" convincing John, who continued a separate baptismal ministry, creating disciples resulting in a community that still exists in parts of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/disciples-st-john-baptist-under-attack-2013121593050127653.html|title=Disciples of St John the Baptist under attack|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\nCrosby stated \"an unbiased reading about John the Baptist \"leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus\u2019 messiahship.\"<ref>Crosby, Michael H.   \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?\"; Biblical Theology Bulletin, Volume 38 Nov, 2008; p158 -162 [http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120111755/http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf |date=2018-11-20 }}</ref>\n\nRobert L. Deffinbaugh, graduate from Dallas Theological Seminary pastor/teacher and elder at Community Bible Chapel in Richardson, Texas, wrote a paper \"John's Problem with Jesus ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:18\u201335|NET}}).\" Deffinbaugh comments of the difficulty of a more through examination of John because of the inclination to think of him in only positive terms.  He notes his  past piety, humility and encouraging some of his disciples to follow Jesus instead. While he was \"a great man,\" Deffinbaugh also writes John \"is not a perfect man,\" and discusses what he calls \"the worst moment of John\u2019s life, so far as the biblical record is concerned.\" He examines the incident where an imprisoned John the Baptist, after receiving news about Jesus, sends two of his disciples asking Jesus if he were the Messiah or another should be sought.\n\nJohn is not asking an incidental question, writes Deffinbaugh, but instead is issuing a public challenge precipitating a crises since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. The implication was, if Jesus failed to answer the question satisfactorily \"we will look for someone else to be the Messiah.\" Deffinbaugh conveys John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was implementing, as John had previously warned that \"Messiah would come with fire.\" Jesus answered the question by evidence of his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity, \"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.\" ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:22|NET}}).<ref>https://bible.org/seriespage/22-johns-problem-jesus-luke-718-35  June 22, 2004</ref>\n\n==In art==\n\n[[File:Puvis de Chavannes, Pierre-C\u00e9cile - The Beheading of St John the Baptist - c. 1869.jpg|thumb|left|[[Puvis de Chavannes]], ''The Beheading of St John the Baptist'', c. 1869]]\n[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1849\u201350]]\n[[File:Baptism-christ.jpg|thumb|left|''The Baptism of Jesus Christ'', by Piero della Francesca, 1449]]\n[[File:Fondazione Querini Stampalia - San Giovanni Battista (1674-81) - Michele Fabris.jpg|thumb|left|''John the Baptist'' by  Michele Fabris<br>[[Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia]]]]\n[[File:San juan Wood Sculture By Santiago Martinez.jpg|thumb|right|Wood sculpture of John the Baptist's head by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], 1942]]\n[[File:Allori C San Giovanni.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cristofano Allori]]'s ''John the Baptist in the desert'']]\n\nThe [[beheading of Saint John the Baptist]] is a standard theme in Christian art,<ref name=\"World History\">Wetterau, Bruce.

New York: Oxford University Press. 2005</ref>\n\nThe ''Baptism of Christ'' was one of the earliest scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' to be frequently depicted in [[Early Christian art]], and John's tall, thin, even gaunt, and bearded figure is already established by the 5th century. Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus. In [[Byzantine art]] the composition of the ''[[Deesis]]'' came to be included in every [[Eastern Orthodox]] church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the [[Theotokos]] (Mary) flank a [[Christ Pantocrator]] and intercede for humanity; in many ways this is the equivalent of Western [[Crucifixion]]s on [[rood]]s and elsewhere, where [[John the Evangelist]] takes the place of John the Baptist (except in the idiosyncratic ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]''). John the Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, or where the donor patron was named for him or there was some other connection of patronage \u2013 John was the patron saint of [[Florence]], among many other cities, which means he features among the supporting saints in many important works.\n\nA number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the [[predella]] of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably the large series in [[grisaille]] [[fresco]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiostro dello Scalzo|it}}, which was [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s largest work, and the frescoed ''Life'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] in the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]], both in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by [[Filippo Lippi]] in [[Prato Cathedral]]. These include the typical scenes:<ref>See [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] for further information on these scenes</ref> the ''Annunciation to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]'', John's birth, his naming by his father, the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'', John's departure for the desert, his preaching in the desert, the ''Baptism of Christ'', John before Herod, the dance of [[Salome]], and his beheading.\n\n[[File:'De Gray' Hours (f.24.v) St John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist, from a medieval [[book of hours]]]]\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - St John the Baptist - WGA12723.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1513\u20131516), [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n\nHis birth, which unlike the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late [[Middle Ages]], with depictions by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th-century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular, sometimes, as in an [[engraving]] by [[Israhel van Meckenem]], the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|title=Engraving by Israhel van Meckenem|publisher=Artsmia.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111185904/http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|archivedate=January 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Salome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Northern Renaissance taste for images of glamorous but dangerous women ([[Delilah]], [[Judith]] and others),<ref>On this see Chapter V, \"The Power of Women\", in H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints; National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}</ref> and was often painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and engraved by the [[Little Masters]]. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with [[Carlo Dolci]] painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and his successors.\n\nAs a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the ''[[Presentation of Christ]]'', the ''[[Marriage of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Holy Kinship]]''. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s versions of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the [[Madonna and Child]] that included John. [[Raphael]] in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', ''[[La belle jardini\u00e8re]]'', ''[[Aldobrandini Madonna]]'', ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', [[Madonna dell'Impannata (Raphael)|''Madonna dell'Impannata'']], which were among his best-known works. John was also often shown by himself as an older child or adolescent, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross \u2013 another theme [[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|influenced by Leonardo]], whose equivocal composition, reintroducing the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael [[Titian]] and [[Guido Reni]] among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes. [[Caravaggio]] painted an especially large number of works including John, from [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|at least five largely nude youths]] attributed to him, to three late works on his death \u2013 the great ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Execution]]'' in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|one in Madrid]], and [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio, London)|one in London]].\n\n[[File:St John the Baptist Titular Statue of Xewkija Gozo, Malta.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St John carved out of a blackberry tree by [[Pietro Paolo Azzopardi]] \u2013 1845. [[Xewkija]]]]\n\nAmiens cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This stresses the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains.\n\nA remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]]. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and Mary's mother [[Saint Anne|Anne]] in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with [[Symbolist]] painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Puvis de Chavannes]] ([[National Gallery, London]]). [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'' was illustrated by [[Aubrey Beardsley]], giving rise to some of his most memorable images.\n\n===In poetry===\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] poet [[Lucrezia Tornabuoni]] chose John the Baptist as one of biblical figures on which she wrote poetry.<ref>Robin, Larsen and Levin, p. 368</ref>\n\n===In music===\n{{sources|section|date=February 2019}}\n* [[Guido D'Arezzo]] (991/992 \u2013 after 1033) an Italian Benedictine monk founded the standard music stave based on a hymn to Saint John the Baptist.

In 1521, the island was given its formal name, \"''San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico''\", following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which [[Christopher Columbus]] had originally given the island. The names \"''San Juan Bautista''\" and \"''Puerto Rico''\" were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a [[Cartography|cartographic]] error. By 1746, the city's name (\"''Puerto Rico''\") had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island (\"''San Juan Bautista''\") had become that of the city. The [[List of U.S. state mottos|official motto]] of Puerto Rico also references the saint: ''Joannes Est Nomen Eius'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for \"his name is John\", from Luke 1:63).\n\nHe is also a patron saint of [[French Canada]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The Canadian cities of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] (1497), [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] (1604) and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Qu\u00e9bec]] were all named in his honor. His feast day of June 24, celebrated officially in [[Quebec]] as the ''[[F\u00eate Nationale du Qu\u00e9bec]]'', and in Newfoundland as [[Discovery Day]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]]. In [[Scotland]], he is the patron saint of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's [[Professional sports|professional]] [[football club]] is called [[St Johnstone F.C.]]\n\nAlso, on the night of June 23 on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of [[Porto]], the second largest city in [[Portugal]].

John is patron saint of [[Xewkija]], [[Gozo]], Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to June 24.\n\n[[Calamba City, Laguna]], [[Calumpit, Bulacan]], [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]] and [[Lian, Batangas|Lian]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas]], [[Sipocot]] and [[San Fernando, Camarines Sur]], [[Daet, Camarines Norte]] and [[San Juan, Metro Manila]] are among several places in the [[Philippines]] that venerate John as the town or city patron. A common practise of many [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino fiestas]] in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John's iconic act. The custom is similar in form to [[Songkran]] and [[Holi]], and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the [[Black Nazarene]] it enshrines, [[Quiapo Church]] in [[Manila]] is actually dedicated to Saint John.\n\nHe is also patron of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston]], which covers the whole of [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]].\n\nThe [[Baptistines (disambiguation)|Baptistines]] are the name given to a number of [[religious orders]] dedicated to the memory of John the Baptist.\n\nAlong with [[John the Evangelist]], John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of [[Freemasonry|Free and Accepted Masons]] (better known as the Freemasons).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ward.html|title=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|publisher=Freemasons-freemasonry.com|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn many Mediterranean countries, the [[summer solstice]] is dedicated to St. John. The associated ritual is very similar to [[Midsummer]] celebrations in the Anglo-Saxon tradition.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|Saints}}\n* [[Basilica of St. John the Baptist, Berlin]]\n* [[Biblical and Quranic narratives]]\n* [[Chronology of Jesus]]\n* [[Historical background of the New Testament]]\n* [[Legends and the Quran]]\n* [[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n* [[Messengers from John the Baptist]]\n* [[Portal:Catholicism/Patron Archive/August 29|John the Baptist, patron saint archive]]\n* [[Saint John the Baptist Church (disambiguation)]]\n* [[St. John Baptist Church (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Statue of John the Baptist, Charles Bridge]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books on John the Baptist\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Brooks Hansen]] (2009) ''John the Baptizer: A Novel''.

John proclaims baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sin, and says another will come after him who will not baptize with water, but with the Holy Spirit.\n\nJesus comes to John, and is baptized by him in the river Jordan.

A voice from heaven then says, \"You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.\" ({{bibleref2|Mark|1:11|NRSV}})\n\nLater in the gospel there is an account of John's death. It is introduced by an incident where the Tetrarch [[Herod Antipas]], hearing stories about Jesus, imagines that this is John the Baptist raised from the dead. It then explains that John had rebuked Herod for marrying [[Herodias]], the ex-wife of his brother (named here as Philip). Herodias demands his execution, but Herod, who 'liked to listen' to John, is reluctant to do so because he fears him, knowing he is a 'righteous and holy man'.\n\nThe account then describes how Herod's daughter Herodias ([[NRSV]]; other translations refer to the girl as the ''daughter of Herodias'') dances before Herod, who is pleased and offers her anything she asks for in return. When the girl asks her mother what she should request, she is told to demand the head of John the Baptist. Reluctantly, Herod orders the beheading of John, and his head is delivered to her, at her request, on a plate. John's disciples take the body away and bury it in a tomb.({{bibleref2|Mark|6:17\u201329|NRSV}})\n\nThere are a number of difficulties with this passage.

And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying, \"After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nIn those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, \"You are my beloved Son, with you I am well pleased.\"\n\n;Death of John (Mark 6)\n\nKing Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, \"John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" But others said, \"He is Elijah.\" And others said, \"He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old.\" But when Herod heard of it, he said, \"John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.\" For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. For John had been saying to Herod, \"It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.\" And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly.\n\nBut an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, \"Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.\" And he vowed to her, \"Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom.\" And she went out and said to her mother, \"For what should I ask?\" And she said, \"The head of John the Baptist.\" And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, \"I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\" And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.

Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.\n\nBut when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \"You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.\n\n\"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.\"\n\nThen Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?\" But Jesus answered him, \"Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.\" Then he consented. And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, a voice from heaven said, \"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Matthew 11)\n\nNow when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples and said to him, \"Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" And Jesus answered them, \"Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. And blessed is the one who is not offended by me.\"\n\nAs they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. This is he of whom it is written,\n\n\"'Behold, I send my messenger before your face,\nwho will prepare your way before you.'\n\nTruly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.\n\n\"But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates,\n\n\"'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance;\nwe sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.'\n\nFor John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds.\"\n\n; Death of John (Matthew 14)\n\nAt that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, and he said to his servants, \"This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him.\" For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because John had been saying to him, \"It is not lawful for you to have her.\" And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. Prompted by her mother, she said, \"Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.\" And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.

His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, was also a descendant of Aaron. They were both righteous people, who lived blameless lives, guiding their steps by all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord. But they had no child, Elizabeth being barren; and both of them were advanced in years.\n\nOne day, when Zechariah was officiating as priest before God, during the turn of his division, it fell to him by lot, in accordance with the practice among the priests, to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense; and, as it was the Hour of Incense, the people were all praying outside. And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the Altar of Incense. Zechariah was startled at the sight and was awe-struck. But the angel said to him: \"Do not be afraid, Zechariah; your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, whom you will call by the name John. He will be to you a joy and a delight; and many will rejoice over his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord; he will not drink any wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit from the very hour of his birth, and will reconcile many of the Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him in the spirit and with the power of Elijah, 'to reconcile fathers to their children' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and so make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.\"\n\n\"How can I be sure of this?\" Zechariah asked the angel. \"For I am an old man and my wife is advanced in years.\"\n\n\"I am Gabriel,\" the angel answered, \"who stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day when this takes place, because you did not believe what I said, though my words will be fulfilled in due course.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the people were watching for Zechariah, wondering at his remaining so long in the Temple. When he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision there. But Zechariah kept making signs to them, and remained dumb. And, as soon as his term of service was finished, he returned home. After this his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and lived in seclusion for five months. \"The Lord has done this for me,\" she said, \"he has shown me kindness and taken away the public disgrace of childlessness under which I have been living.\"\n\nSix months later the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a maiden there who was engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. Her name was Mary. Gabriel came into her presence and greeted her, saying: \"You have been shown great favor \u2013 the Lord is with you.\"\n\nMary was much disturbed at his words, and was wondering to herself what such a greeting could mean, when the angel spoke again: \"Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will give him the name Jesus. The child will be great and will be called 'Son of the Most High,' and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David, and he will reign over the descendants of Jacob for ever; And to his kingdom there will be no end.\"\n\n\"How can this be?\" Mary asked the angel. \"For I have no husband.\"\n\n\"The Holy Spirit will descend on you,\" answered the angel, \"and the Power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore the child will be called 'holy,' and 'Son of God.' And Elizabeth, your cousin, is herself also expecting a son in her old age; and it is now the sixth month with her, though she is called barren; for no promise from God will fail to be fulfilled.\"\n\n\"I am the servant of the Lord,\" exclaimed Mary; \"let it be with me as you have said.\" Then the angel left her.\n\nSoon after this Mary set out, and made her way quickly into the hill-country, to a town in Judah; and there she went into Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child moved within her, and Elizabeth herself was filled with the Holy Spirit, and cried aloud: \"Blessed are you among women, and blessed is your unborn child! But how have I this honor, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For, as soon as your greeting reached my ears, the child moved within me with delight! Happy indeed is she who believed that the promise which she received from the Lord would be fulfilled.\"\n\nAnd Mary said:\n\n\"My soul exalts the Lord,\nmy spirit delights in God my Savior;\nfor he has remembered his humble servant girl;\nAnd from this hour all ages will count me happy!\n\nGreat things has the Almighty done for me;\nAnd holy is his name.\nFrom age to age his mercy rests\nOn those who honor him.\n\nMighty are the deeds of his arm;\nHe scatters the proud with their own devices,\nhe casts down princes from their thrones,\nand the humble he uplifts,\nthe hungry he loads with gifts,\nand the rich he sends empty away.\n\nHe has stretched out his hand to his servant Israel,\nEver mindful of his mercy\n(As he promised to our forefathers)\nFor Abraham and his race for ever.\"\n\nMary stayed with Elizabeth about three months, and then returned to her home. When Elizabeth's time came, she gave birth to a son; and her neighbors and relations, hearing of the great goodness of the Lord to her, came to share her joy. A week later they met to circumcise the child, and were about to call him 'Zechariah' after his father, when his mother spoke up: \"No, he is to be called John.\"\n\n\"You have no relation of that name!\" they exclaimed; and they made signs to the child's father, to find out what he wished the child to be called. Asking for a writing-tablet, he wrote the words \u2013 'His name is John.' Everyone was surprised; and immediately Zechariah recovered his voice and the use of his tongue, and began to bless God. All their neighbors were awe-struck at this; and throughout the hill-country of Judea the whole story was much talked about; and all who heard it kept it in mind, asking one another \u2013 \"What can this child be destined to become?\" For the Power of the Lord was with him.\n\nThen his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, speaking under inspiration, said:\n\n\"Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,\nWho has visited his people and wrought their deliverance,\nand has raised up for us the Strength of our salvation\nIn the house of his servant David \u2013\n\nAs he promised by the lips of his holy prophets of old \u2013\nsalvation from our enemies and from the hands of all who hate us,\nshowing mercy to our forefathers,\nAnd mindful of his sacred covenant.\n\nThis was the oath which he swore to our forefather Abraham \u2013\nThat we should be rescued from the hands of our enemies,\nand should serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness,\nIn his presence all our days.\n\nAnd you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High,\nFor you will go before the Lord to make ready his way,\nto give his people the knowledge of salvation\nIn the forgiveness of their sins,\n\nthrough the tender mercy of our God,\nWhereby the Dawn will break on us from heaven,\nto give light to those who live in darkness and the shadow of death,\nAnd guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nThe child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the Wilds until the time came for his appearance before Israel.\n\n; John and his baptism of Jesus, Imprisonment of John (Luke 3)\n\nIn the fifteenth year of the reign of the Emperor Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was Governor of Judea, Herod Ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip Ruler of the territory comprising Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias Ruler of Abilene, and when Annas and Caiaphas were high priests, a command from God came to John, the son of Zechariah, while he was in the wilderness. And John went through the whole district of the Jordan, proclaiming baptism on repentance, for the forgiveness of sins. This was in fulfillment of what is said in the writings of the prophet Isaiah \u2013\n\n'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness:\n\"Make ready the way of the Lord,\nMake his paths straight.\nEvery chasm will be filled,\nEvery mountain and hill will be leveled,\nThe winding ways will be straightened,\nThe rough roads made smooth,\nand everyone will see the salvation of God.\"'\n\nAnd John said to the crowds that went to be baptized by him: \"You children of snakes! Who has prompted you to seek refuge from the coming judgment? Let your lives, then, prove your repentance; and do not begin to say among yourselves 'Abraham is our ancestor,' for I tell you that out of these stones God is able to raise descendants for Abraham! Already, indeed, the axe is lying at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that fails to bear good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.\"\n\n\"What are we to do then?\" the people asked. \"Let anyone who has two coats,\" answered John, \"share with the person who has none; and anyone who has food do the same.\"\n\nEven tax-gatherers came to be baptized, and said to John: \"Teacher, what are we to do?\"\n\n\"Do not collect more than you have authority to demand,\" John answered. And when some soldiers on active service asked \"And we \u2013 what are we to do?\" he said: \"Never use violence, or exact anything by false accusation; and be content with your pay.\"\n\nThen, while the people were in suspense, and were all debating with themselves whether John could be the Christ, John, addressing them all, said: \"I, indeed, baptize you with water; but there is coming one more powerful than I, and I am not fit even to unfasten his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. His winnowing-fan is in his hand so that he may clear his threshing-floor, and store the grain in his barn, but the chaff he will burn with a fire that cannot be put out.\"\n\nAnd so with many different appeals John told his good news to the people. But Prince Herod, being rebuked by John respecting Herodias, the wife of Herod's brother, and for all the evil things that he had done,  crowned them all by shutting John up in prison. Now after the baptism of all the people, and when Jesus had been baptized and was still praying, the heavens opened,  and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove, and from the heavens came a voice \u2013 \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy.\"\n\n; John's disciples and fast (Luke 5:33)\n\"John's disciples,\" they said to Jesus, \"Often fast and say prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, while yours are eating and drinking!\"\n\n; John questions Jesus (Luke 7)\nAll these events were reported to John by his disciples. So he summoned two of them, and sent them to the Master to ask \u2013 \"Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for some one else?\"\n\nWhen these men found Jesus, they said: \"John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask \u2013 'Are you 'the coming one,' or are we to look for somebody else?'\" At that very time Jesus had cured many people of diseases, afflictions, and wicked spirits, and had given many blind people their sight. So his answer to the question was: \"Go and report to John what you have witnessed and heard \u2013 the blind recover their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are made clean, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, the good news is told to the poor. And blessed is the person who finds no hindrance in me.\"\n\nWhen John's messengers had left, Jesus, speaking to the crowds, began to say with reference to John: \"What did you go out into the wilderness to look at? A reed waving in the wind? If not, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in rich clothing? Why, those who are accustomed to fine clothes and luxury live in royal palaces. What then did you go to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and far more than a prophet. This is the man of whom scripture says \u2013\n\n'I am sending my messenger ahead of you,\nand he will prepare your way before you.'\n\nThere is, I tell you, no one born of a woman who is greater than John; and yet the least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.\"\n\n(All the people, when they heard this, and even the tax-gatherers, having accepted John's baptism, acknowledged the justice of God. But the Pharisees and the students of the law, having rejected John's baptism, frustrated God's purpose in regard to them.)\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===In the Gospel of John===\nThe fourth gospel describes John the Baptist as \"a man sent from God\" who \"was not the light\", but \"came as a witness, to bear witness to the light, so that through him everyone might believe\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:6\u20138|NKJV}}</ref> John clearly denies being the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet', instead describing himself as the \"voice of one crying in the wilderness\".<ref>{{bibleverse||John|1:23|NKJV}}, compare {{bibleverse||Isaiah|40:3|NKJV}}</ref>\n\nUpon literary analysis, it is clear that John is the \"testifier and confessor ''par excellence''\", particularly when compared to figures like [[Nicodemus]].<ref>{{citation|last=Vande Vrede|first=Keith|title=A Contrast Between Nicodemus and John the Baptist in the Gospel of John|volume=57|date=December 2014|pages=715\u201326|editor-last=Kostenberger|editor-first=Andreas|journal=Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society|issue=4|issn=0360-8808|editor-link=Andreas J.

Unlike the other gospels, it is John himself who testifies to seeing \"the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him\". John explicitly announces that Jesus is the one \"who baptizes with the Holy Spirit\" and John even professes a \"belief that he is the Son of God\" and \"the Lamb of God\".\n\nThe Gospel of John reports that Jesus' disciples were baptizing and that a debate broke out between some of the disciples of John and another Jew about purification.<ref>{{bibleref2|John|3:22\u201336|9}}</ref> In this debate John argued that Jesus \"must become greater,\" while he (John) \"must become less\"<ref>{{bibleref2|John|3:30|31}}</ref> ([[Latin]] [[Vulgate]]: {{bibleref2|Ioannes|3:30|VULGATE|''illum oportet crescere me autem minui''}}).\n\nThe Gospel of John then points out that Jesus' disciples were baptizing more people than John.<ref>{{bibleref2|John|4:2}}</ref> Later, the Gospel relates that Jesus regarded John as \"a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light\".<ref>{{bibleref2|John|5:35|ESV}}</ref>\n\n{{hidden begin|border=solid 1px #aaa|title=John the Baptist in the Gospel of John}}\n; John 1\nThere appeared a man sent from God, whose name was John; he came as a witness \u2013 to bear witness to the light so that through him everyone might believe. He was not the light, but he came to bear witness to the light.\n\nWhen the religious authorities in Jerusalem sent some Priests and Levites to ask John \u2013 \"Who are you?\", he told them clearly and simply: \"I am not the Christ.\"\n\n\"What then?\" they asked. \"Are you Elijah?\"\n\"No,\" he said, \"I am not.\"\n\"Are you 'the prophet'?\" He answered, \"No.\"\n\"Who then are you?\" they continued; \"tell us so that we have an answer to give to those who have sent us. What do you say about yourself?\"\n\"I,\" he answered, \"am \u2013 'The voice of one crying aloud in the wilderness \u2013 \"make a straight road for the Lord\"', as the prophet Isaiah said.\"\nThese men had been sent from the Pharisees; and their next question was: \"Why then do you baptize, if you are not the Christ or Elijah or 'the prophet'?\" John's answer was \u2013 \"I baptize with water, but among you stands one whom you do not know; he is coming after me, yet I am not worthy even to unfasten his sandal.\" This happened at Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nThe next day John saw Jesus coming towards him, and exclaimed: \"Here is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! I was taking about him when I said 'After me there is coming a man who ranks ahead of me, because before I was born he already was.' I did not know who he was, but I have come baptizing with water to make him known to Israel.\"\n\nJohn also said: \"I saw the Spirit come down from heaven like a dove and rest on him. I myself did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me 'He on whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him \u2013 he it is who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' This I have seen myself, and I have declared my belief that he is the Son of God.\" The next day, when John was standing with two of his disciples, he looked at Jesus as he passed and exclaimed: \"There is the Lamb of God!\" The two disciples heard him say this, and followed Jesus.\n\n; John 3\nJohn, also, was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there were many streams there; and people were constantly coming and being baptized. (For John had not yet been imprisoned). Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a fellow Jew on the subject of 'purification;' and the disciples came to John and said: \"Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, and to whom you have yourself borne testimony \u2013 he, also, is baptizing, and everybody is going to him.\" John's answer was \u2013 \"A person can gain nothing but what is given them from heaven. You are yourselves witnesses that I said 'I am not the Christ,' but 'I have been sent before him as a messenger.' It is the groom who has the bride; but the groom's friend, who stands by and listens to him, is filled with joy when he hears the groom's voice. This joy I have felt to the full. He must become greater, and I less.\"\n\nHe who comes from above is above all others; but a child of earth is earthly, and his teaching is earthly, too. He who comes from heaven is above all others. He states what he has seen and what he heard, and yet no one accepts his statement. They who did accept his statement confirm the fact that God is true. For he whom God sent as his messenger gives us God's own teaching, for God does not limit the gift of the Spirit. The Father loves his Son, and has put everything in his hands. The person who believes in the Son has eternal life, while a person who rejects the Son will not even see that life, but remains under 'God's displeasure.'\n{{hidden end}}\n\n===Comparative analysis===\nSimon J. Joseph has argued that the Gospel demotes the historical John by painting him only as a prophetic forerunner to Jesus whereas his ministry actually complemented Jesus'.<ref name=\"Joseph2012\">{{cite book|author=Simon J.

(Matthew and Luke drop the first part of the reference.)<ref name=\"Carl R. Kazmierski 1996 page 31\">Carl R. Kazmierski, ''John the Baptist: Prophet and Evangelist'' (Liturgical Press, 1996) p. 31.</ref>\n\n; Baptism of Jesus\n\nThe gospels differ on the details of the Baptism. In Mark and Luke, Jesus himself sees the heavens open and hears a voice address him personally, saying, \"You are my dearly loved son; you bring me great joy\". They do not clarify whether others saw and heard these things. Although other incidents where the \"voice came out of heaven\" are recorded in which, for the sake of the crowds, it was heard audibly, John did say in his witness that he did see the spirit coming down \"out of heaven\" (John 12:28\u201330, John 1:32).\n\nIn Matthew, the voice from heaven does not address Jesus personally, saying instead \"This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.\"\n\nIn the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend as a dove, testifying about the experience as evidence of Jesus's status.\n\n; John's knowledge of Jesus\n\nJohn's knowledge of Jesus varies across gospels. In the Gospel of Mark, John preaches of a coming leader, but shows no signs of recognizing that Jesus is this leader. In Matthew, however, John immediately recognizes Jesus and John questions his own worthiness to baptize Jesus. In both Matthew and Luke, John later dispatches disciples to question Jesus about his status, asking \"Are you he who is to come, or shall we look for another?\" In Luke, John is a familial relative of Jesus whose birth was foretold by Gabriel. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist himself sees the spirit descend like a dove and he explicitly preaches that Jesus is the Son of God.\n\n; John and Elijah\n{{see also|Matthew 3:4}}\nThe Gospels vary in their depiction of John's relationship to [[Elijah]]. Matthew and Mark describe John's attire in a way reminiscent of the description of Elijah in [[2 Kings 1:8]], who also wore a garment of hair and a leather belt. In Matthew, Jesus explicitly teaches that John is \"Elijah who was to come\" (Matt. 11:14 \u2013 see also Matt. 17:11\u201313); many Christian theologians have taken this to mean that John was Elijah's successor. In the Gospel of John, John the Baptist explicitly denies being Elijah. In the annunciation narrative in Luke, an angel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and tells him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah ({{Bibleverse||Luke|1:16\u201317|NAB}}).\"\n\n==In Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews''==\nAn account of John the Baptist is found in all extant manuscripts of the ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (book 18, chapter 5, 2) by [[Flavius Josephus]] (37\u2013100):<ref>\"Josephus, Flavius.\" In: Cross, F.

Now when [many] others came in crowds about him, for they were very greatly moved [or pleased] by hearing his words, Herod, who feared lest the great influence John had over the people might put it into his power and inclination to raise a rebellion, (for they seemed ready to do any thing he should advise,) thought it best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties, by sparing a man who might make him repent of it when it would be too late. Accordingly he was sent a prisoner, out of Herod's suspicious temper, to [[Machaerus|Macherus]], the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death.

Some have claimed that this passage indicates that John died near the time of the destruction of Herod's army in 36 AD. However, in a different passage, Josephus states that the end of Herod's marriage with Aretas' daughter (after which John was killed) was only the beginning of hostilities between Herod and Aretas, which later escalated into the battle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hoehner|first1=Harold W.|title=Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fS28b9GC1dcC&pg=PA101#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780310877103|date=2010-08-10}}</ref>\n\nDivergences between the passage's presentation and the biblical accounts of John include baptism for those whose souls have already been \"purified beforehand by righteousness\" is for purification of the body, not general repentance of sin (Mark 1:4).<ref name=\"bibleverse||Mark|1:4|NRSV\">{{bibleverse||Mark|1:4|NRSV}}</ref> Biblical scholar [[John Dominic Crossan]] differentiates between Josephus's account of John and Jesus, saying, \"John had a monopoly, but Jesus had a franchise.\" To get baptized, Crossan writes, you went only to John; to stop the movement one only needed to stop John (therefore his movement ended with his death). Jesus invited all to come and see how he and his companions had already accepted the government of God, entered it and were living it.

A portion of the rescued relics were carried to [[Jerusalem]], then to [[Alexandria]], where on 27 May 395, they were laid in the [[basilica]] newly dedicated to the Forerunner on the former site of the [[Serapeum#Alexandria|temple of Serapis]]. The tomb at Sebaste continued, nevertheless, to be visited by pious [[pilgrim]]s, and [[Saint Jerome]] bears witness to miracles being worked there.\n\nWhat became of the head of John the Baptist is difficult to determine.

However, the decapitation cloth of Saint John is kept at the [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The Coptic Christian Orthodox Church also claim to hold the relics of Saint John the Baptist.

In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:17}} the role of John is referred to as being \"to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.\" In {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:76}} as \"thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways\" and in {{Bibleref2|Luke 1:77}} as being \"To give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins.\"\n\nThere are several passages within the [[Old Testament]] which are interpreted by Christians as being [[prophecy|prophetic]] of John the Baptist in this role. These include a passage in the [[Book of Malachi]] ({{Bibleref2|Malachi 3:1}}) that refers to a prophet who would ''prepare the way of the Lord'':\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.|Malachi 3:1<ref>{{bibleverse||Malachi|3:1|NRSV}}</ref>}}\n\nand also at the end of the next chapter in Malachi 4:5\u20136 where it says,\n\n{{quote|Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.}}\n\nThe Jews of Jesus' day expected Elijah to come before the Messiah; indeed, some present day Jews continue to await Elijah's coming as well, as in the Cup of Elijah the Prophet in the [[Passover Seder]]. This is why the disciples ask Jesus in {{Bibleref2|Matthew 17:10}}, \"Why then say the scribes that Elias must first come?\" The disciples are then told by Jesus that Elijah came in the person of John the Baptist,\n\n{{quote|Jesus replied, \"To be sure, Elijah comes and will restore all things. But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but have done to him everything they wished. In the same way the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.\" Then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about John the Baptist.|Matthew 17:11\u201313}} (see also 11:14: \"...if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who was to come.\")\n\nThese passages are applied to John in the [[Synoptic Gospels]].<ref>Mat 3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.\n</ref><ref>Mar 1:2 As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. Mar 1:3 The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</ref><ref>Luk 1:16\u201317 And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God. And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.</ref> But where Matthew specifically identifies John the Baptist as Elijah's spiritual successor ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 11.14, 17.13}}), the gospels of Mark and Luke are silent on the matter. The [[Gospel of John]] states that John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.\n\n{{quote|Now this was John's testimony when the Jews of Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not deny, but confessed freely, \"I am not the Christ.\" They asked him, \"Then who are you? Are you Elijah?\" He said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\"|John 1:19\u201321}}\n\n====Influence on Paul====\nMany scholars believe there was contact between the early church in the [[Apostolic Age]] and what is called the \"[[Qumran]]-[[Essene]] community\".<ref name=EDSS>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-508450-4| title = Paul, Letters of| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls| date = 2008| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195084504.001.0001}}{{subscription|[[OUP]]}}</ref> The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] were found at Qumran, which the majority of historians and archaeologists identify as an Essene settlement.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-506512-1| title = Essenes | encyclopedia = The Oxford Encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East| date = 2011| doi = 10.1093/acref/9780195065121.001.0001}}{{subscription|[[OUP]]}}</ref> John the Baptist is thought to have been either an Essene or \"associated\" with the community at Khirbet Qumran.

In particular, John should have done everything in his power to persuade the Jewish people that Jesus was the Messiah. He was to become Jesus' main disciple and John's disciples were to become Jesus' disciples. Unfortunately John didn't follow Jesus and continued his own way of baptizing people. Moreover, John also denied that he was Elijah when queried by several Jewish leaders {{bibleverse||John|1:21|NKJV}} contradicting Jesus who stated John is Elijah who was to come, {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:14|NKJV}}. Many Jews therefore, could not accept Jesus as the Messiah because John denied being Elijah, as the prophet's appearance was a prerequisite for the Messiah's arrival as stated in {{bibleverse||Malachi|4:5|NKJV}}. According to the Unification Church, \"John the Baptist was in the position of representing Elijah's physical body, making himself identical with Elijah from the standpoint of their mission.\"\n\nJesus stated in {{bibleverse||Matthew|11:11|NKJV}}, \"there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist,\" however, in referring to John's blocking the way of the Jews' understanding of himself as the Messiah, said \"yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.\" John's failure to follow Jesus became the chief obstacle to the fulfillment of Jesus' mission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unification.net/dp96/dp96-1-4.html |title=Exposition of the Divine Principle, 1996 Translation, Chapter 4|publisher=unification.net |accessdate=July 1, 2018 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.unification.net/dp73/dp73-1-4.html#1 Divine Principle, Part I Chapter 4; Advent of the Messiah]</ref><ref>5.

After John's death, Jesus' followers had to differentiate him from the executed prophet, \"countering the prevalent idea that Jesus was actually John raised from the dead.\" Moss also references the incident in Matthew 16 where  disciples present before Jesus indicated some people believed he was John the Baptist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/were-jesus-and-john-the-baptist-competitors-finding-jesus-professor-describes-their-relationship.html|title=Were Jesus and John the Baptist Competitors?

Crosby, PhD, Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, CA; Capuchin friar and priest; in his paper \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?,\" stated there was \"no biblical evidence indicating that John the Baptist ever became a disciple of Jesus.\" He conveys that John's concept of what a messiah should be, was in contrast to how Jesus presented himself, and kept him from becoming a disciple of Jesus. Crosby identifies twenty-five points in the Gospel accounts that lead to the conclusion that John's effectiveness as a \"precursor\" in encouraging others to follow Jesus was very minimal, since the scriptures record only two of his own followers having become Jesus\u2019 disciples. Crosby noted that while many others believed Jesus' miracles, there is no record of these \"signs\" convincing John, who continued a separate baptismal ministry, creating disciples resulting in a community that still exists in parts of the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/12/disciples-st-john-baptist-under-attack-2013121593050127653.html|title=Disciples of St John the Baptist under attack|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref>\n\nCrosby stated \"an unbiased reading about John the Baptist \"leaves us with the figure of John the Baptist as a reformist Jew who also may have wanted desperately to become a believer but was unable to become convinced of Jesus\u2019 messiahship.\"<ref>Crosby, Michael H.   \"Why Didn't John the Baptist Commit Himself to Jesus as a Disciple?\"; Biblical Theology Bulletin, Volume 38 Nov, 2008; p158 -162 [http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181120111755/http://michaelcrosby.net/images/uploads/documents/BTBNov08JohnTheBaptist.pdf |date=2018-11-20 }}</ref>\n\nRobert L. Deffinbaugh, graduate from Dallas Theological Seminary pastor/teacher and elder at Community Bible Chapel in Richardson, Texas, wrote a paper \"John's Problem with Jesus ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:18\u201335|NET}}).\" Deffinbaugh comments of the difficulty of a more through examination of John because of the inclination to think of him in only positive terms.  He notes his  past piety, humility and encouraging some of his disciples to follow Jesus instead. While he was \"a great man,\" Deffinbaugh also writes John \"is not a perfect man,\" and discusses what he calls \"the worst moment of John\u2019s life, so far as the biblical record is concerned.\" He examines the incident where an imprisoned John the Baptist, after receiving news about Jesus, sends two of his disciples asking Jesus if he were the Messiah or another should be sought.\n\nJohn is not asking an incidental question, writes Deffinbaugh, but instead is issuing a public challenge precipitating a crises since the message was presented to Jesus while he was with a gathered crowd. The implication was, if Jesus failed to answer the question satisfactorily \"we will look for someone else to be the Messiah.\" Deffinbaugh conveys John might have been looking for inauguration of the kingdom of God in a more dramatic way than what Jesus was implementing, as John had previously warned that \"Messiah would come with fire.\" Jesus answered the question by evidence of his miracle works and teachings which themselves gave evidence of his identity, \"The blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the good news is preached to the poor.\" ({{bibleref2|Luke|7:22|NET}}).<ref>https://bible.org/seriespage/22-johns-problem-jesus-luke-718-35  June 22, 2004</ref>\n\n==In art==\n\n[[File:Puvis de Chavannes, Pierre-C\u00e9cile - The Beheading of St John the Baptist - c. 1869.jpg|thumb|left|[[Puvis de Chavannes]], ''The Beheading of St John the Baptist'', c. 1869]]\n[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]], 1849\u201350]]\n[[File:Baptism-christ.jpg|thumb|left|''The Baptism of Jesus Christ'', by Piero della Francesca, 1449]]\n[[File:Fondazione Querini Stampalia - San Giovanni Battista (1674-81) - Michele Fabris.jpg|thumb|left|''John the Baptist'' by  Michele Fabris<br>[[Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia]]]]\n[[File:San juan Wood Sculture By Santiago Martinez.jpg|thumb|right|Wood sculpture of John the Baptist's head by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]], 1942]]\n[[File:Allori C San Giovanni.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cristofano Allori]]'s ''John the Baptist in the desert'']]\n\nThe [[beheading of Saint John the Baptist]] is a standard theme in Christian art,<ref name=\"World History\">Wetterau, Bruce.

Only he and Jesus are consistently shown with long hair from Early Christian times, when the apostles generally have trim classical cuts; in fact John is more consistently depicted in this way than Jesus. In [[Byzantine art]] the composition of the ''[[Deesis]]'' came to be included in every [[Eastern Orthodox]] church, as remains the case to this day. Here John and the [[Theotokos]] (Mary) flank a [[Christ Pantocrator]] and intercede for humanity; in many ways this is the equivalent of Western [[Crucifixion]]s on [[rood]]s and elsewhere, where [[John the Evangelist]] takes the place of John the Baptist (except in the idiosyncratic ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]''). John the Baptist is very often shown on altarpieces designed for churches dedicated to him, or where the donor patron was named for him or there was some other connection of patronage \u2013 John was the patron saint of [[Florence]], among many other cities, which means he features among the supporting saints in many important works.\n\nA number of narrative scenes from his life were often shown on the [[predella]] of altarpieces dedicated to John, and other settings, notably the large series in [[grisaille]] [[fresco]] in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Chiostro dello Scalzo|it}}, which was [[Andrea del Sarto]]'s largest work, and the frescoed ''Life'' by [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] in the [[Tornabuoni Chapel]], both in Florence. There is another important fresco cycle by [[Filippo Lippi]] in [[Prato Cathedral]]. These include the typical scenes:<ref>See [[Tornabuoni Chapel]] for further information on these scenes</ref> the ''Annunciation to [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]]'', John's birth, his naming by his father, the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'', John's departure for the desert, his preaching in the desert, the ''Baptism of Christ'', John before Herod, the dance of [[Salome]], and his beheading.\n\n[[File:'De Gray' Hours (f.24.v) St John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|left|St John the Baptist, from a medieval [[book of hours]]]]\n[[File:Leonardo da Vinci - St John the Baptist - WGA12723.jpg|thumb|''[[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|St. John the Baptist]]'' (c.{{nbsp}}1513\u20131516), [[Leonardo da Vinci]]]]\n\nHis birth, which unlike the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]] allowed a relatively wealthy domestic interior to be shown, became increasingly popular as a subject in the late [[Middle Ages]], with depictions by [[Jan van Eyck]] in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] and Ghirlandaio in the Tornabuoni Chapel being among the best known. His execution, a church feast-day, was often shown, and by the 15th-century scenes such as the dance of Salome became popular, sometimes, as in an [[engraving]] by [[Israhel van Meckenem]], the interest of the artist is clearly in showing the life of Herod's court, given contemporary dress, as much as the martyrdom of the saint.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|title=Engraving by Israhel van Meckenem|publisher=Artsmia.org|accessdate=February 14, 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111185904/http://artsmia.org/directories/art-finder/art-detail.cfm?directory=0&artist=10346&id=47973&class_2=Israhel%20van%20Meckenem&class_1=Artists|archivedate=January 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Salome bearing John's head on a platter equally became a subject for the Northern Renaissance taste for images of glamorous but dangerous women ([[Delilah]], [[Judith]] and others),<ref>On this see Chapter V, \"The Power of Women\", in H Diane Russell;''Eva/Ave; Women in Renaissance and Baroque Prints; National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1990; {{ISBN|1-55861-039-1}}</ref> and was often painted by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and engraved by the [[Little Masters]]. These images remained popular into the Baroque, with [[Carlo Dolci]] painting at least three versions. John preaching, in a landscape setting, was a popular subject in Dutch art from [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] and his successors.\n\nAs a child (of varying age), he is sometimes shown from the 15th century in family scenes from the life of Christ such as the ''[[Presentation of Christ]]'', the ''[[Marriage of the Virgin]]'' and the ''[[Holy Kinship]]''. [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s versions of the ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' were influential in establishing a Renaissance fashion for variations on the [[Madonna and Child]] that included John. [[Raphael]] in particular painted many compositions of the subject, such as the ''[[Alba Madonna]]'', ''[[La belle jardini\u00e8re]]'', ''[[Aldobrandini Madonna]]'', ''[[Madonna della seggiola]]'', [[Madonna dell'Impannata (Raphael)|''Madonna dell'Impannata'']], which were among his best-known works. John was also often shown by himself as an older child or adolescent, usually already wearing his distinctive dress and carrying a long thin wooden cross \u2013 another theme [[St. John the Baptist (Leonardo)|influenced by Leonardo]], whose equivocal composition, reintroducing the camel-skin dress, was developed by Raphael [[Titian]] and [[Guido Reni]] among many others. Often he is accompanied by a lamb, especially in the many [[Early Netherlandish painting]]s which needed this attribute as he wore normal clothes. [[Caravaggio]] painted an especially large number of works including John, from [[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|at least five largely nude youths]] attributed to him, to three late works on his death \u2013 the great ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|Execution]]'' in Malta, and two sombre Salomes with his head, [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|one in Madrid]], and [[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio, London)|one in London]].\n\n[[File:St John the Baptist Titular Statue of Xewkija Gozo, Malta.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St John carved out of a blackberry tree by [[Pietro Paolo Azzopardi]] \u2013 1845. [[Xewkija]]]]\n\nAmiens cathedral, which holds one of the alleged heads of the Baptist, has a biographical sequence in polychrome relief, dating from the 16th century. This stresses the execution and the disposal of the saint's remains.\n\nA remarkable Pre-Raphaelite portrayal is ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' by [[John Everett Millais]]. Here the Baptist is shown as a child, wearing a loin covering of animal skins, hurrying into [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s carpenter shop with a bowl of water to join [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]], Joseph, and Mary's mother [[Saint Anne|Anne]] in soothing the injured hand of Jesus. Artistic interest enjoyed a considerable revival at the end of the 19th century with [[Symbolist]] painters such as [[Gustave Moreau]] and [[Puvis de Chavannes]] ([[National Gallery, London]]).

In 1521, the island was given its formal name, \"''San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico''\", following the custom of christening a town with its formal name and the name which [[Christopher Columbus]] had originally given the island. The names \"''San Juan Bautista''\" and \"''Puerto Rico''\" were eventually used in reference to both city and island, leading to a reversal in terminology by most inhabitants largely due to a [[Cartography|cartographic]] error. By 1746, the city's name (\"''Puerto Rico''\") had become that of the entire island, while the name for the island (\"''San Juan Bautista''\") had become that of the city. The [[List of U.S. state mottos|official motto]] of Puerto Rico also references the saint: ''Joannes Est Nomen Eius'' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for \"his name is John\", from Luke 1:63).\n\nHe is also a patron saint of [[French Canada]] and [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The Canadian cities of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] (1497), [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] (1604) and [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Qu\u00e9bec]] were all named in his honor. His feast day of June 24, celebrated officially in [[Quebec]] as the ''[[F\u00eate Nationale du Qu\u00e9bec]]'', and in Newfoundland as [[Discovery Day]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Saint John is the patron of [[Penzance]], [[Cornwall]]. In [[Scotland]], he is the patron saint of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], which used to be known as St. John's Toun of Perth. The main church in the city is still the medieval Kirk of St. John the Baptist and the city's [[Professional sports|professional]] [[football club]] is called [[St Johnstone F.C.]]\n\nAlso, on the night of June 23 on to the 24th, Saint John is celebrated as the patron saint of [[Porto]], the second largest city in [[Portugal]]. An article from June 2004 in ''[[The Guardian]]'' remarked that \"Porto's [[Festa de S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o]] is one of Europe's liveliest street festivals, yet it is relatively unknown outside the country\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Matthew Hancock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2004/jun/12/portugal.guardiansaturdaytravelsection|title=There's only one S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o|work=The Guardian|date=June 12, 2004|accessdate=February 14, 2010|location=London}}</ref>\n\nHe is also patron of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] of Jerusalem, [[Malta]], [[Florence]], and [[Genoa]], Italy. John is patron saint of [[Xewkija]], [[Gozo]], Malta, which remember him with a great feast on the Sunday nearest to June 24.\n\n[[Calamba City, Laguna]], [[Calumpit, Bulacan]], [[Balayan, Batangas|Balayan]] and [[Lian, Batangas|Lian]] in [[Batangas (province)|Batangas]], [[Sipocot]] and [[San Fernando, Camarines Sur]], [[Daet, Camarines Norte]] and [[San Juan, Metro Manila]] are among several places in the [[Philippines]] that venerate John as the town or city patron. A common practise of many [[Culture of the Philippines|Filipino fiestas]] in his honour is bathing and the dousing of people in memory of John's iconic act. The custom is similar in form to [[Songkran]] and [[Holi]], and serves as a playful respite from the intense tropical heat. While famed for the [[Black Nazarene]] it enshrines, [[Quiapo Church]] in [[Manila]] is actually dedicated to Saint John.\n\nHe is also patron of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston]], which covers the whole of [[South Carolina]] in the [[United States]].\n\nThe [[Baptistines (disambiguation)|Baptistines]] are the name given to a number of [[religious orders]] dedicated to the memory of John the Baptist.\n\nAlong with [[John the Evangelist]], John the Baptist is claimed as a patron saint by the fraternal society of [[Freemasonry|Free and Accepted Masons]] (better known as the Freemasons).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/ward.html|title=Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry|publisher=Freemasons-freemasonry.com|accessdate=February 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn many Mediterranean countries, the [[summer solstice]] is dedicated to St. John.
