{"title_page": "Adverb", "text_new": "{{English grammar}}\n\nAn '''adverb''' is a word or an expression that [[modifier (grammar)|modifies]] a [[verb]], [[adjective]], [[determiner]], [[clause]], [[preposition]], or [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as ''how?'', ''in what way?'', ''when?'', ''where?'', and ''to what extent?''. This is called the [[adverbial]] function, and may be realized by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word expressions ([[adverbial phrase]]s and [[adverbial clause]]s).\n\nAdverbs are traditionally regarded as one of the [[parts of speech]]. However, modern linguists note that the term \"adverb\" has come to be used as a kind of \"catch-all\" category, used to classify words with various different types of [[syntax|syntactic]] behavior, not necessarily having much in common except that they do not fit into any of the other available categories (noun, adjective, preposition, etc.)\n\n==Functions==\nThe English word ''adverb'' derives (through French) from Latin ''bium'', from ''ad-'' (\"to\"), 'bum'' (\"word\", \"verb\"), and the nominal suffix ''-ium''. The term implies that the principal function of adverbs is to act as [[modifier (grammar)|modifier]]s of [[verb]]s or [[verb phrase]]s.<ref name=\"stud\">Rodney D. Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Puum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'', CUP 2005, p. 122ff.</ref> An adverb used in this way may provide information about the manner, place, time, frequency, certainty, or other circumstances of the activity denoted by the verb or verb phrase. Some examples:\n*She sang '''loud''' (''loudly'' modifies the verb ''sang'', indicating the manner of singing)\n*We left it '''here''' (''here'' modifies the verb phrase ''left it'', indicating place)\n*I worked '''yesterday''' (''yesterday'' modifies the verb ''worked'', indicating time)\n*You '''often''' make mistakes (''often'' modifies the verb phrase ''make mistakes'', indicating frequency)\n*He '''undoubtedly''' did it (''undoubtedly'' modifies the verb phrase ''did it'', indicating certainty)\n\nAdverbs can also be used as modifiers of [[adjective]]s, and of other adverbs, often to indicate degree. Examples:\n* You are '''quite''' right (the adverb ''quite'' modifies the adjective ''right'')\n* She sang '''very''' loudly (the adverb ''very'' modifies another adverb \u2013 ''loudly'')\n\nThey can also modify [[determiner]]s, [[prepositional phrase]]s,<ref name=\"stud\"/> or whole [[clause]]s or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, as in the following examples:\n* I bought '''practically''' the only fruit (''practically'' modifies the determiner ''the '' in the [[noun phrase]], \"the only fruit\" wherein \"only\" is an [[adjective]])\n* She drove us '''almost''' to the station (''almost'' modifies the prepositional phrase ''to the station'')\n* '''Certainly''' we need to act (''certainly'' modifies the sentence as a whole)\nAdverbs thus perform a wide range of modifying functions. The major exception is the function of modifier of [[noun]]s, which is performed instead by adjectives (compare ''she sang loudly'' with ''her loud singing disturbed me''; here the verb ''sang'' is modified by the adverb ''loudly'', whereas the noun ''singing'' is modified by the adjective ''loud''). However, because some adverbs and adjectives are [[homonym]]s, their respective functions are sometimes conflated:\n*'''Even''' numbers are divisible by two\n*The camel '''even''' drank.\nThe word \"even\" in the first sentence is an adjective, since it is a [[prepositive]] modifier that modifies the noun \"numbers\". The word \"even\" in the second sentence is a prepositive adverb that modifies the verb \"drank.\"\n\nAlthough it is possible for an adverb to precede or to follow a noun or a noun phrase, the adverb nonetheless does ''not'' modify either in such cases, as in:\n*'''Internationally''' there is a shortage of protein for animal feeds\n*There is a shortage '''internationally''' of protein for animal feeds\n*There is an '''international''' shortage of protein for animal feeds\nIn the first sentence, \"Internationally\" is a prepositive adverb that modifies the clause, \"there is\u2026\" In the second sentence, \"internationally\" is a postpositive adverb that modifies the clause, \"There is\u2026\" By contrast, the third sentence contains \"international\" as a prepositive adjective that modifies the noun, \"shortage.\" \n\nAdverbs can sometimes be used as [[predicative expression]]s; in English, this applies especially to adverbs of location:\n*Your seat is '''there'''.\n\nWhen the function of an adverb is performed by an expression consisting of more than one word, it is called an [[adverbial phrase]] or [[adverbial clause]], or simply an [[adverbial]].\n\n==Formation and comparison==\nIn [[English language|English]], adverbs of manner (answering the question ''how?'') are often formed by adding ''-ly'' to adjectives. Other languages often have similar methods for deriving adverbs from adjectives ([[French language|French]], for example, uses the suffix ''-ment''), or else use the same form for both adjectives and adverbs, as in German and Dutch where for example ''schnell'' or ''snel'', respectively, can mean either \"quick\" or \"quickly\", depending on the context. Many other adverbs, however, are not related to adjectives in this way; they may be derived from other words or phrases, or may be single [[morpheme]]s. Examples of such adverbs in English include ''here, there, together, yesterday, aboard, very, almost'', etc.\n\nWhere the meaning permits, adverbs may undergo [[comparison (grammar)|comparison]], taking [[comparative]] and [[superlative]] forms. In English this is usually done by adding ''more'' and ''most'' before the adverb (''more slowly, most slowly''), although there are a few adverbs that take [[inflection|inflected]] forms, such as ''well'', for which ''better'' and ''best'' are used.\n\nFor more information about the formation and use of adverbs in English, see {{slink|English grammar|Adverbs}}. For other languages, see {{slink||In specific languages}} below, and the articles on individual languages and their grammars.\n\n== Adverbs as a \"catch-all\" category ==\nAdverbs are considered a [[part of speech]] in traditional English grammar, and are still included as a part of speech in grammar taught in schools and used in dictionaries. However, modern grammarians recognize that words traditionally grouped together as adverbs serve a number of different functions. Some describe adverbs a \"catch-all\" category that includes all words that do not belong to one of the other parts of speech.<ref>For example: Thomas Edward Payne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Describing Morphosyntax: A Guide for Field Linguists]'', CUP 1997, p. 69.</ref>\n\nA logical approach to dividing words into classes relies on recognizing which words can be used in a certain context.  For example, the only type of word that can be inserted in the following template to form a grammatical sentence is a [[noun]]:\n:The _____ is red. (For example, \"The hat is red\".)\nWhen this approach is taken, it is seen that adverbs fall into a number of different categories. For example, some adverbs can be used to modify an entire sentence, whereas others cannot. Even when a sentential adverb has other functions, the meaning is often not the same. For example, in the sentences ''She gave birth naturally'' and ''Naturally, she gave birth'', the word ''naturally'' has different meanings: in the first sentence, as a verb-modifying adverb, it means \"in a natural manner\", while in the second sentence, as a sentential adverb, it means something like \"of course\".\n\nWords like ''very'' afford another example. We can say ''Perry is very fast'', but not ''Perry very won the race''. These words can modify adjectives but not verbs. On the other hand, there are words like ''here'' and ''there'' that cannot modify adjectives. We can say ''The sock looks good there'' but not ''It is a there beautiful sock''. The fact that many adverbs can be used in more than one of these functions can confuse the issue, and it may seem like splitting hairs to say that a single adverb is really two or more words that serve different functions. However, this distinction can be useful, especially when considering adverbs like ''naturally'' that have different meanings in their different functions. [[Rodney Huddleston]] distinguishes between a ''word'' and a ''lexicogrammatical-word''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Huddleston\n  | first = Rodney\n  | authorlink = Rodney Huddleston\n  | title = English Grammar: An Outline\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | location = Cambridge\n  | year = 1988\n  | page = 7\n  | doi = 10.2277/0521311527\n  | isbn = 0-521-32311-8 }}</ref>\n\nGrammarians find difficulty categorizing [[Affirmative and negative|negating words]], such as the English ''not''. Although traditionally listed as an adverb, this word does not behave grammatically like any other, and it probably should be placed in a class of its own.<ref>[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque, Guglielmo]].  1999. ''Adverbs and functional heads\u2014a cross linguistic perspective''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Haegeman, Liliane. 1995. ''The syntax of negation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==In specific languages==\n* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] adverbs have the basic form of their corresponding [[adjective]]s and are not inflected (though they sometimes can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]).\n* In [[German language|German]] the term ''Adverb'' is differently defined than in the English language. German adverbs form a group of noninflectable words (though a few can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]). An English ''adverb'' which is derived from an adjective is arranged in German under the adjectives with ''adverbial use'' in the sentence. The others are also called adverbs in the German language.\n* In [[Scandinavian languages]], adverbs are typically derived from adjectives by adding the suffix '-t', which makes it identical to the adjective's neuter form. Scandinavian adjectives, like English ones, are inflected in terms of comparison by adding '-ere'/'-are' (comparative) or '-est'/'-ast' (superlative). In inflected forms of adjectives, the '-t' is absent. [[Periphrastic]] comparison is also possible.\n* In [[Romance languages]], many adverbs are formed from adjectives (often the feminine form) by adding '-mente' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Italian language|Italian]]) or '-ment' ([[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) (from [[Latin]] ''mens, mentis'': mind, intelligence, or [[suffix]] ''-mentum'', result or way of action). Other adverbs are single forms which are invariable.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], almost all adverbs are simply the masculine singular form of the corresponding adjective, one notable exception being ''bine'' (\"well\") / ''bun'' (\"good\"). However, there are some Romanian adverbs built from certain masculine singular nouns using the suffix ''\"-e\u0219te\"'', such as the following ones: ''b\u0103ie\u021b-e\u0219te'' (boyishly), ''tiner-e\u0219te'' (youthfully), ''b\u0103rb\u0103t-e\u0219te'' (manly), ''fr\u0103\u021b-e\u0219te'' (brotherly), etc.\n* [[Interlingua]] also forms adverbs by adding '-mente' to the adjective. If an adjective ends in ''c'', the adverbial ending is '-amente'. A few short, invariable adverbs, such as ''ben'', \"well\", and ''mal'', \"badly\", are available and widely used.\n* In [[Esperanto]], adverbs are not formed from adjectives but are made by adding '-e' directly to the word root. Thus, from ''bon'' are derived ''bone'', \"well\", and ''bona'', \"good\". See also: [[special Esperanto adverbs]].\n* In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] adverbs are formed from adjectives of any degree through the suffixes ''-ul/\u00fcl'' and ''-an/en'' depending on the adjective: ''sz\u00e9p'' (beautiful) \u2192 ''sz\u00e9pen'' (beautifully) or the comparative ''szebb'' (more beautiful) \u2192 ''szebben'' (more beautifully)\n* [[Modern Standard Arabic]] forms adverbs by adding the indefinite accusative ending '-an' to the root: ''kathiir-'', \"many\", becomes ''kathiiran'' \"much\".  However, Arabic often avoids adverbs by using a [[cognate accusative]] followed by an adjective.\n* [[Austronesian languages]] generally form [[comparative]] adverbs by repeating the root (as in [[Wiki|WikiWiki]]) like the plural noun.\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] forms adverbs from verbal adjectives by adding  /ku/ (\u304f) to the stem (haya- \"rapid\" hayai \"quick/early\", hayakatta \"was quick\", hayaku \"quickly\") and from [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] adjectives by placing /ni/ (\u306b) after the adjective instead of the copula /na/ (\u306a) or /no/ (\u306e) (rippa \"splendid\", rippa ni \"splendidly\"). The derivations are quite productive, but from a few adjectives, adverbs may not be derived.\n* In the [[Celtic languages]], an adverbial form is often made by preceding the adjective with a preposition: ''go'' in [[Irish language|Irish]] or ''gu'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], meaning 'until'. In [[Cornish language|Cornish]], ''yn'' is used, meaning 'in'.\n* In [[Modern Greek]], an adverb is most commonly made by adding the endings <-\u03b1> or <-\u03c9\u03c2> to the root of an adjective. Often, the adverbs formed from a common root using each of these endings have slightly different meanings. So, <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2> (<t\u00e9leios>, meaning \"perfect\" and \"complete\") yields <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1> (<t\u00e9leia>, \"perfectly\") and <\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c2> (<tele\u00edos>, \"completely\"). Not all adjectives can be transformed into adverbs by using both endings. <\u0393\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2> (<gr\u00edgoros>, \"rapid\") becomes <\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1> (<gr\u00edgora>, \"rapidly\"), but not normally *<\u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2> (*<grig\u00f3ros>). When the <-\u03c9\u03c2> ending is used to transform an adjective whose tonal accent is on the third syllable from the end, such as <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2> (<ep\u00edsimos>, \"official\"), the corresponding adjective is accented on the second syllable from the end; compare <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1> (<ep\u00edsima>) and <\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ae\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2> (<epis\u00edmos>), which both mean \"officially\". There are also other endings with particular and restricted use as <-\u03af>, <-\u03b5\u03af>, <-\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af>, etc. For example, <\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<atimorit\u00ed>, \"with impunity\") and <\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03b6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<asyzitit\u00ed>, \"indisputably\"); <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03af> (<autolexe\u00ed> \"word for word\") and <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b5\u03af> (<autostigme\u00ed>, \"in no time\"); <\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> [<anglist\u00ed> \"in English (language)\"] and <\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> (<papagalist\u00ed>, \"by rote\"); etc.\n* In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], an adverb is formed from an adjective by changing the masculine or feminine adjective endings -s and -a to -i. \"Labs\", meaning \"good\", becomes \"labi\" for \"well\". Latvian adverbs have a particular use in expressions meaning \"to speak\" or \"to understand\" a language. Rather than use the noun meaning \"Latvian/English/Russian\", the adverb formed form these words is used. \"Es run\u0101ju latviski/angliski/krieviski\" means \"I speak Latvian/English/Russian\" or, literally, \"I speak Latvianly/Englishly/Russianly\". If a noun is required, the expression used means literally \"language of the Latvians/English/Russians\", \"latvie\u0161u/ang\u013cu/krievu valoda\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], and analogously in [[Ukrainian Language|Ukrainian]]  and some other [[Slavic languages]], most adverbs are formed by removing the adjectival suffices \"-\u0438\u0439\" \"-\u0430\" or \"-\u0435\" from an adjective, and replacing them with the adverbial \"-\u043e\". For example, in Ukrainian, \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\" (fast, nice, tasty) become \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u043e\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, nicely, tastefully), while in Russian, \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0439\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439\" and \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439\" (quick, good, wonderful) become \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\", \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, well, wonderfully). Another wide group of adverbs are formed by gluing a [[preposition]] to an oblique case form. In Ukrainian, for example, ('''\u0434\u043e''' ''onto'')  +  ('''\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''bottom'') \u2192 ('''\u0434\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''downwards''); ('''\u0437''' ''off'') + ('''\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443''' ''afar'') \u2192 ('''\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443'''  ''afar-off'') . As well, note that adverbs are mostly placed before the verbs they modify: \"\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0430\u0454.\" (A good son sings nicely/well). There is no specific word order in East Slavic languages.\n* In [[Korean language|Korean]], adverbs are commonly formed by replacing the -\ub2e4 ending of the dictionary form of a descriptive verb with \uac8c. So, \uc27d\ub2e4 (easy) becomes \uc27d\uac8c (easily). They are also formed by replacing the \ud558\ub2e4 of some compound verbs with \ud788, e.g. \uc548\ub155\ud558\ub2e4 (peaceful) > \uc548\ub155\ud788 (peacefully).\n* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the same word usually serves as adjective and adverb: ''iyi bir k\u0131z'' (\"a good girl\"), ''iyi anlamak'' (\"to understand well'').\n* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], adverbs end in the word \"\u5730\uff08\u7684\uff09\".\n* In [[Persian language|Persian]], many adjectives and adverbs have the same form such as \"\u062e\u0648\u0628\", \"\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0639\", \"\u062a\u0646\u062f\" so there is no obvious way to recognise them out of context. The only exceptions are Arabic adverbs with a \"\u0627\u064b\" suffix such as \"\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0627\u064b\" and \"\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627\u064b\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Adverbs by type]]\n* [[Prepositional adverb]]\n* [[Pronominal adverb]]\n* [[Grammatical conjunction]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ernst, Thomas. 2002.

Some describe adverbs a \"catch-all\" category that includes all words that do not belong to one of the other parts of speech.<ref>For example: Thomas Edward Payne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LC3DfjWfCiwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Describing Morphosyntax: A Guide for Field Linguists]'', CUP 1997, p. 69.</ref>\n\nA logical approach to dividing words into classes relies on recognizing which words can be used in a certain context.  For example, the only type of word that can be inserted in the following template to form a grammatical sentence is a [[noun]]:\n:The _____ is red. (For example, \"The hat is red\".)\nWhen this approach is taken, it is seen that adverbs fall into a number of different categories. For example, some adverbs can be used to modify an entire sentence, whereas others cannot. Even when a sentential adverb has other functions, the meaning is often not the same. For example, in the sentences ''She gave birth naturally'' and ''Naturally, she gave birth'', the word ''naturally'' has different meanings: in the first sentence, as a verb-modifying adverb, it means \"in a natural manner\", while in the second sentence, as a sentential adverb, it means something like \"of course\".\n\nWords like ''very'' afford another example. We can say ''Perry is very fast'', but not ''Perry very won the race''. These words can modify adjectives but not verbs. On the other hand, there are words like ''here'' and ''there'' that cannot modify adjectives. We can say ''The sock looks good there'' but not ''It is a there beautiful sock''. The fact that many adverbs can be used in more than one of these functions can confuse the issue, and it may seem like splitting hairs to say that a single adverb is really two or more words that serve different functions. However, this distinction can be useful, especially when considering adverbs like ''naturally'' that have different meanings in their different functions. [[Rodney Huddleston]] distinguishes between a ''word'' and a ''lexicogrammatical-word''.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Huddleston\n  | first = Rodney\n  | authorlink = Rodney Huddleston\n  | title = English Grammar: An Outline\n  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]\n  | location = Cambridge\n  | year = 1988\n  | page = 7\n  | doi = 10.2277/0521311527\n  | isbn = 0-521-32311-8 }}</ref>\n\nGrammarians find difficulty categorizing [[Affirmative and negative|negating words]], such as the English ''not''. Although traditionally listed as an adverb, this word does not behave grammatically like any other, and it probably should be placed in a class of its own.<ref>[[Guglielmo Cinque|Cinque, Guglielmo]].  1999. ''Adverbs and functional heads\u2014a cross linguistic perspective''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref><ref>Haegeman, Liliane. 1995. ''The syntax of negation''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\n==In specific languages==\n* In [[Dutch language|Dutch]] adverbs have the basic form of their corresponding [[adjective]]s and are not inflected (though they sometimes can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]).\n* In [[German language|German]] the term ''Adverb'' is differently defined than in the English language. German adverbs form a group of noninflectable words (though a few can be [[Comparison (grammar)|compared]]). An English ''adverb'' which is derived from an adjective is arranged in German under the adjectives with ''adverbial use'' in the sentence. The others are also called adverbs in the German language.\n* In [[Scandinavian languages]], adverbs are typically derived from adjectives by adding the suffix '-t', which makes it identical to the adjective's neuter form. Scandinavian adjectives, like English ones, are inflected in terms of comparison by adding '-ere'/'-are' (comparative) or '-est'/'-ast' (superlative). In inflected forms of adjectives, the '-t' is absent. [[Periphrastic]] comparison is also possible.\n* In [[Romance languages]], many adverbs are formed from adjectives (often the feminine form) by adding '-mente' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Italian language|Italian]]) or '-ment' ([[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]]) (from [[Latin]] ''mens, mentis'': mind, intelligence, or [[suffix]] ''-mentum'', result or way of action). Other adverbs are single forms which are invariable.\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], almost all adverbs are simply the masculine singular form of the corresponding adjective, one notable exception being ''bine'' (\"well\") / ''bun'' (\"good\"). However, there are some Romanian adverbs built from certain masculine singular nouns using the suffix ''\"-e\u0219te\"'', such as the following ones: ''b\u0103ie\u021b-e\u0219te'' (boyishly), ''tiner-e\u0219te'' (youthfully), ''b\u0103rb\u0103t-e\u0219te'' (manly), ''fr\u0103\u021b-e\u0219te'' (brotherly), etc.\n* [[Interlingua]] also forms adverbs by adding '-mente' to the adjective. If an adjective ends in ''c'', the adverbial ending is '-amente'. A few short, invariable adverbs, such as ''ben'', \"well\", and ''mal'', \"badly\", are available and widely used.\n* In [[Esperanto]], adverbs are not formed from adjectives but are made by adding '-e' directly to the word root. Thus, from ''bon'' are derived ''bone'', \"well\", and ''bona'', \"good\". See also: [[special Esperanto adverbs]].\n* In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] adverbs are formed from adjectives of any degree through the suffixes ''-ul/\u00fcl'' and ''-an/en'' depending on the adjective: ''sz\u00e9p'' (beautiful) \u2192 ''sz\u00e9pen'' (beautifully) or the comparative ''szebb'' (more beautiful) \u2192 ''szebben'' (more beautifully)\n* [[Modern Standard Arabic]] forms adverbs by adding the indefinite accusative ending '-an' to the root: ''kathiir-'', \"many\", becomes ''kathiiran'' \"much\".  However, Arabic often avoids adverbs by using a [[cognate accusative]] followed by an adjective.\n* [[Austronesian languages]] generally form [[comparative]] adverbs by repeating the root (as in [[Wiki|WikiWiki]]) like the plural noun.\n* [[Japanese language|Japanese]] forms adverbs from verbal adjectives by adding  /ku/ (\u304f) to the stem (haya- \"rapid\" hayai \"quick/early\", hayakatta \"was quick\", hayaku \"quickly\") and from [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] adjectives by placing /ni/ (\u306b) after the adjective instead of the copula /na/ (\u306a) or /no/ (\u306e) (rippa \"splendid\", rippa ni \"splendidly\"). The derivations are quite productive, but from a few adjectives, adverbs may not be derived.\n* In the [[Celtic languages]], an adverbial form is often made by preceding the adjective with a preposition: ''go'' in [[Irish language|Irish]] or ''gu'' in [[Scottish Gaelic]], meaning 'until'. In [[Cornish language|Cornish]], ''yn'' is used, meaning 'in'.\n* In [[Modern Greek]], an adverb is most commonly made by adding the endings <-\u03b1> or <-\u03c9\u03c2> to the root of an adjective. Often, the adverbs formed from a common root using each of these endings have slightly different meanings. So, <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2> (<t\u00e9leios>, meaning \"perfect\" and \"complete\") yields <\u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1> (<t\u00e9leia>, \"perfectly\") and <\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c9\u03c2> (<tele\u00edos>, \"completely\"). Not all adjectives can be transformed into adverbs by using both endings. <\u0393\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2> (<gr\u00edgoros>, \"rapid\") becomes <\u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b1> (<gr\u00edgora>, \"rapidly\"), but not normally *<\u03b3\u03c1\u03b7\u03b3\u03cc\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2> (*<grig\u00f3ros>). When the <-\u03c9\u03c2> ending is used to transform an adjective whose tonal accent is on the third syllable from the end, such as <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2> (<ep\u00edsimos>, \"official\"), the corresponding adjective is accented on the second syllable from the end; compare <\u03b5\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1> (<ep\u00edsima>) and <\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03ae\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2> (<epis\u00edmos>), which both mean \"officially\". There are also other endings with particular and restricted use as <-\u03af>, <-\u03b5\u03af>, <-\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af>, etc. For example, <\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<atimorit\u00ed>, \"with impunity\") and <\u03b1\u03c3\u03c5\u03b6\u03b7\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03af> (<asyzitit\u00ed>, \"indisputably\"); <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b5\u03af> (<autolexe\u00ed> \"word for word\") and <\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03b5\u03af> (<autostigme\u00ed>, \"in no time\"); <\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> [<anglist\u00ed> \"in English (language)\"] and <\u03c0\u03b1\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03af> (<papagalist\u00ed>, \"by rote\"); etc.\n* In [[Latvian language|Latvian]], an adverb is formed from an adjective by changing the masculine or feminine adjective endings -s and -a to -i. \"Labs\", meaning \"good\", becomes \"labi\" for \"well\". Latvian adverbs have a particular use in expressions meaning \"to speak\" or \"to understand\" a language. Rather than use the noun meaning \"Latvian/English/Russian\", the adverb formed form these words is used. \"Es run\u0101ju latviski/angliski/krieviski\" means \"I speak Latvian/English/Russian\" or, literally, \"I speak Latvianly/Englishly/Russianly\". If a noun is required, the expression used means literally \"language of the Latvians/English/Russians\", \"latvie\u0161u/ang\u013cu/krievu valoda\".\n*In [[Russian language|Russian]], and analogously in [[Ukrainian Language|Ukrainian]]  and some other [[Slavic languages]], most adverbs are formed by removing the adjectival suffices \"-\u0438\u0439\" \"-\u0430\" or \"-\u0435\" from an adjective, and replacing them with the adverbial \"-\u043e\". For example, in Ukrainian, \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u0438\u0439\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0430\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u0435\" (fast, nice, tasty) become \"\u0448\u0432\u0438\u0434\u043a\u043e\", \"\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e\", and \"\u0441\u043c\u0430\u0447\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, nicely, tastefully), while in Russian, \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u044b\u0439\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0439\" and \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439\" (quick, good, wonderful) become \"\u0431\u044b\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\", \"\u0445\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0448\u043e\", \"\u043f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\" (quickly, well, wonderfully). Another wide group of adverbs are formed by gluing a [[preposition]] to an oblique case form. In Ukrainian, for example, ('''\u0434\u043e''' ''onto'')  +  ('''\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''bottom'') \u2192 ('''\u0434\u043e\u0434\u043e\u043b\u0443''' ''downwards''); ('''\u0437''' ''off'') + ('''\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443''' ''afar'') \u2192 ('''\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0443'''  ''afar-off'') . As well, note that adverbs are mostly placed before the verbs they modify: \"\u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0438\u043d \u0433\u0430\u0440\u043d\u043e \u0441\u043f\u0456\u0432\u0430\u0454.\" (A good son sings nicely/well). There is no specific word order in East Slavic languages.\n* In [[Korean language|Korean]], adverbs are commonly formed by replacing the -\ub2e4 ending of the dictionary form of a descriptive verb with \uac8c. So, \uc27d\ub2e4 (easy) becomes \uc27d\uac8c (easily). They are also formed by replacing the \ud558\ub2e4 of some compound verbs with \ud788, e.g. \uc548\ub155\ud558\ub2e4 (peaceful) > \uc548\ub155\ud788 (peacefully).\n* In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the same word usually serves as adjective and adverb: ''iyi bir k\u0131z'' (\"a good girl\"), ''iyi anlamak'' (\"to understand well'').\n* In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], adverbs end in the word \"\u5730\uff08\u7684\uff09\".\n* In [[Persian language|Persian]], many adjectives and adverbs have the same form such as \"\u062e\u0648\u0628\", \"\u0633\u0631\u06cc\u0639\", \"\u062a\u0646\u062f\" so there is no obvious way to recognise them out of context. The only exceptions are Arabic adverbs with a \"\u0627\u064b\" suffix such as \"\u0638\u0627\u0647\u0631\u0627\u064b\" and \"\u0648\u0627\u0642\u0639\u0627\u064b\".\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Adverbs by type]]\n* [[Prepositional adverb]]\n* [[Pronominal adverb]]\n* [[Grammatical conjunction]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ernst, Thomas. 2002.

Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].<ref name=\"Arnaz\"/>\n\nArnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'',  starring Robert Taylor (1943). Many consider his portrayal of the jive-loving California National Guardsman Felix Ramirez to be his best early role. He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (USO) programs at the [[Birmingham General Army Hospital]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army on November 16, 1945, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.<ref>Who's Who In Hollywood! By Terry Rowan, Desi Arnaz, page 15</ref> He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra.

His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. [[CBS]] wanted Ball's ''Husband'' co-star [[Richard Denning]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Denning |url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/richard-denning-1117882474/ |website=Variety |accessdate=2 March 2019 |language=en |date=21 October 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The character name \"Larry Lopez\" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with \"Ricky Ricardo\".

Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.  During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV's most successful entrepreneurs.\n\n=== Desilu Productions ===\n{{Main|Desilu Productions}}\n[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|left|Lucille Ball and Arnaz in Los Angeles, 1953]]\nWith Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts.  In return they retained the rights to the films.  This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue). <ref>{{Cite web|date = 26 September 2016|first = Jeff |last = Saporito |url= http://screenprism.com/insights/article/how-did-i-love-lucy-invent-the-rerun|title=How did I Love Lucy invent the rerun and syndication? |website= ScreenPrism}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]), and was involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''Sheriff of Cochise'' / ''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]]. Ror-Vic produced ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was filmed mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110\u201312</ref>\n\nThe original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. [[Desilu, Too]] and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA60&dq=%22she+set+up+lucille+ball+productions%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90uOE1InRAhWGRCYKHSPjBrYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22she%20set%20up%20lucille%20ball%20productions%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=60|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nArnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\nArnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\n=== Marriages ===\n[[File:Lucille_Ball_and_Desi_Arnaz_1955.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ball and Arnaz in 1955]]\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (born 1953).\n\nArnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and also because of [[Promiscuity|womanizing]]. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA16&dq=%22he+sold+his+share+of+desilu%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix-pPG1YnRAhVGeSYKHZ1UAjgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22he%20sold%20his%20share%20of%20desilu%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=16|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nArnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (n\u00e9e McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''The Mothers-in-Law'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Bullfighter|matador]], Se\u00f1or Delgado. Edith died in 1985, aged 67, from cancer.\n\nAlthough Arnaz and Ball both married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends and grew closer in his final decade. \"''I Love Lucy'' was never just a title\", wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life.<ref>Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz {{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref> Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Desi arnaz sr and jr 1974.JPG|thumb|left|Arnaz appeared with his son in the 1974 television special, ''California, My Way''.]]\nIn the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer [[Mike Douglas]].

After ''I Love Lucy'' ended, Arnaz went on to produce several other television series, at first with Desilu Productions, and later independently, including ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]''. He was also renowned for leading his Latin music band, the Desi Arnaz Orchestra.\n\n==Early life==\nArnaz was born Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Acha, III, in [[Santiago de Cuba]], Cuba,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> to [[Desiderio Alberto Arnaz II|Desiderio Alberto Arnaz y de Alberni II]] (March 8, 1894 \u2013 May 31, 1973) and his wife Dolores de Acha (April 2, 1896 \u2013 October 24, 1988). His father was Santiago's youngest mayor and also served in the Cuban House of Representatives. His maternal grandfather was Alberto de Acha, an executive at rum producer [[Bacardi|Bacardi & Co.]]<ref name=\"Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122\">Gjelten, Tom.

Following the [[Cuban Revolution of 1933]], led by [[Fulgencio Batista]], which overthrew President [[Gerardo Machado]], Alberto Arnaz was jailed and all of his property was confiscated. He was released after six months when his brother-in-law Alberto de Acha intervened on his behalf.<ref name=\"Gjelten, Tom 2008, p. 122\"/> The family then fled to [[Miami]], where Desi attended [[St. Patrick Catholic School (Miami Beach, Florida)|St. Patrick Catholic High School]]. In the summer of 1934, he attended [[Saint Leo University|Saint Leo Prep]]<ref>Horgan, James J. (1990).

Saint Leo College Press. p. 463.</ref> (near [[Tampa]]) to help improve his English.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n=== Acting career ===\nWhen he moved to the United States, Desi Arnaz turned to show business to support himself. In 1939, he starred on Broadway in the musical ''[[Too Many Girls (musical)|Too Many Girls]]''. He went to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]] the next year to appear in the show's movie version at [[RKO Pictures|RKO]], which starred [[Lucille Ball]]. Arnaz and Ball eloped on November 30, 1940. Arnaz also played guitar for [[Xavier Cugat]].<ref name=\"Arnaz\"/>\n\nArnaz appeared in several movies in the 1940s such as ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'',  starring Robert Taylor (1943). Many consider his portrayal of the jive-loving California National Guardsman Felix Ramirez to be his best early role. He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice, but before reporting, he injured his knee. He completed his recruit training, but was classified for limited service in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War II]]. He was assigned to direct [[United Service Organization]] (USO) programs at the [[Birmingham General Army Hospital]] in the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Discovering the first thing the wounded soldiers requested was a glass of cold milk, he arranged for movie starlets to meet them and pour the milk for them. Following his discharge from the Army on November 16, 1945, he formed another orchestra, which was successful in live appearances and recordings.<ref>Who's Who In Hollywood! By Terry Rowan, Desi Arnaz, page 15</ref> He sang for troops in Birmingham Hospital with John Macchia and hired his childhood friend [[Marco Rizo]] to play piano and arrange for the orchestra. When he became successful in television, he kept the orchestra on his payroll, and Rizo arranged and orchestrated the music for ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Queens of Comedy: Lucille Ball, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Joan Rivers, and the New Generation of Funny Women|last=Horowitz|first=Susan|publisher=Taylor & Francis|year=1997|isbn=9782884492447|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>[[File:Lucy desi 1957.JPG|thumb|upright|Lucille Ball and Arnaz, 1957]]\nOn October 15, 1951, Arnaz co-starred in the premiere of ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', in which he played a fictionalized version of himself, Cuban orchestra leader Enrique \"Ricky\" Ricardo. His co-star was his real-life wife, Lucille Ball, who played Ricky's wife, Lucy. Television executives had been pursuing Ball to adapt her very popular radio series ''[[My Favorite Husband]]'' for television. Ball insisted on Arnaz playing her on-air spouse so the two would be able to spend more time together. [[CBS]] wanted Ball's ''Husband'' co-star [[Richard Denning]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Richard Denning |url=https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/richard-denning-1117882474/ |website=Variety |accessdate=2 March 2019 |language=en |date=21 October 1998}}</ref>\n\nThe original premise was for the couple to portray Lucy and Larry Lopez, a successful show business couple whose glamorous careers interfered with their efforts to maintain a normal marriage. Market research indicated, however, that this scenario would not be popular, so [[Jess Oppenheimer]] changed it to make Ricky Ricardo a struggling young orchestra leader and Lucy an ordinary housewife who had show business fantasies but no talent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} The character name \"Larry Lopez\" was dropped because of a real-life bandleader named Vincent Lopez, and was replaced with \"Ricky Ricardo\". Ricky often appeared at, and later owned, the Tropicana Club, which under his ownership he renamed Club Babalu.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nInitially, the idea of having Ball and the distinctly Latin American Arnaz portray a married couple encountered resistance as they were told that Desi's Cuban accent and Latin style would not be agreeable to American viewers.<ref name=\"title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do\">{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allison-silver/sotomayer-more-splainin-t_b_236347.html|title=Sotomayor: More 'Splainin' to Do|accessdate=June 18, 2010|work=The Huffington Post|quote=CBS executives originally did not want Ball, a sassy redhead, married to a Latino on the program|first=Allison|last=Silver|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> The couple overcame these objections, however, by touring together, during the summer of 1950, in a live [[vaudeville]] act they developed with the help of Spanish clown Pepito P\u00e9rez, together with Ball's radio show writers. Much of the material from their vaudeville act, including Lucy's memorable seal routine, was used in the pilot episode of ''I Love Lucy''. Segments of the pilot were recreated in the sixth episode of the show's first season.  During his time on the show, Arnaz and Ball became TV's most successful entrepreneurs.\n\n=== Desilu Productions ===\n{{Main|Desilu Productions}}\n[[File:Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.jpg|thumb|left|Lucille Ball and Arnaz in Los Angeles, 1953]]\nWith Ball, Arnaz founded [[Desilu Productions]]. At that time, most television programs were broadcast live, and as the largest markets were in New York, the rest of the country received only [[kinescope]] images. [[Karl Freund]], Arnaz's cameraman, and even Arnaz himself have been credited with the development of the [[multiple-camera setup]] production style using adjacent sets in front of a live audience that became the standard for subsequent [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. The use of film enabled every station around the country to broadcast high-quality images of the show. Arnaz was told that it would be impossible to allow an audience onto a [[sound stage]], but he worked with Freund to design a set that would accommodate an audience, allow filming, and adhere to fire and safety codes.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.  Due to the expense of 35mm film, Arnaz and Ball agreed to salary cuts.  In return they retained the rights to the films.  This was the basis for their invention of re-runs and syndicating TV shows (a huge source of new revenue). <ref>{{Cite web|date = 26 September 2016|first = Jeff |last = Saporito |url= http://screenprism.com/insights/article/how-did-i-love-lucy-invent-the-rerun|title=How did I Love Lucy invent the rerun and syndication? |website= ScreenPrism}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to ''I Love Lucy'', he executive produced ''[[The Ann Sothern Show]]'' and ''[[Those Whiting Girls]]'' (starring [[Margaret Whiting]] and [[Barbara Whiting Smith]]), and was involved in several other series such as ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'', ''[[Whirlybirds]]'', and ''Sheriff of Cochise'' / ''United States Marshal''. He also produced the feature film ''[[Forever, Darling]]'' (1956), in which he and Ball starred. In the late 1950s, Arnaz proposed a [[Western (genre)|Western]] television series to his then neighbor, [[Victor Orsatti]], who formed a production company, Ror-Vic, in partnership with actor [[Rory Calhoun]]. Ror-Vic produced ''[[The Texan (TV series)|The Texan]]'', which aired on Monday evenings on CBS from 1958 to 1960. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two [[black-and-white]] segments filmed weekly through [[Desilu Studios]]. Despite the name, the series was filmed mostly in Pearl Flats in the [[Mojave Desert]] of [[Southern California]]. The program could have been renewed for a third season had Calhoun not desired to return to films.<ref>Billy Hathorn, \"Roy Bean, Temple Houston, Bill Longley, Ranald Mackenzie, Buffalo Bill, Jr., and the Texas Rangers: Depictions of West Texans in Series Television, 1955 to 1967\", ''[[West Texas Historical Association|West Texas Historical Review]]'', Vol. 89 (2013), pp. 110\u201312</ref>\n\nThe original Desilu company continued long after Arnaz's divorce from Ball and her subsequent marriage to [[Gary Morton]]. Desilu produced its own programs and provided facilities to other producers. Desilu produced ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''. When Ball sold her share of Desilu to what became [[Paramount Television]], Arnaz went on to form his own production company from his share of Desilu. With the newly formed Desi Arnaz Productions, he made ''[[The Mothers-In-Law]]'' (at Desilu) for [[United Artists Television]] and [[NBC]]. This sitcom ran for two seasons from 1967 to 1969. Arnaz's company was succeeded-in-interest by the company now known as Desilu, Too. [[Desilu, Too]] and Lucille Ball Productions work hand-in-hand with [[MPI Home Video]] in the home video reissues of the Ball/Arnaz material not currently owned by CBS (successor-in-interest to Paramount Television, which in turn succeeded the original Desilu company). This material includes ''[[Here's Lucy]]'' and ''The Mothers-In-Law'', as well as many programs and specials Ball and Arnaz made independently of each other.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA60&dq=%22she+set+up+lucille+ball+productions%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi90uOE1InRAhWGRCYKHSPjBrYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22she%20set%20up%20lucille%20ball%20productions%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=60|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n\n=== Beliefs ===\nArnaz and Ball decided that the show would maintain what Arnaz termed \"basic good taste\" and were therefore determined to avoid [[ethnic joke]]s, as well as humor based on physical handicaps or mental disabilities. Arnaz recalled that the only exception consisted of making fun of Ricky Ricardo's accent; even these jokes worked only when Lucy, as his wife, did the mimicking.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\nArnaz was deeply patriotic about the United States. In his memoirs, he wrote that he knew of no other country in the world where \"a sixteen-year-old kid, broke and unable to speak the language\" could achieve the successes that he had.<ref name=\"Arnaz\" />\n\n=== Marriages ===\n[[File:Lucille_Ball_and_Desi_Arnaz_1955.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ball and Arnaz in 1955]]\nArnaz and Lucille Ball were married on November 30, 1940. Their marriage was turbulent. Convinced that Arnaz was being unfaithful to her and also because he came home drunk several times, Ball filed for divorce in September 1944, but returned to him before the [[interlocutory]] decree became final.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz and Ball subsequently had two children, actors [[Lucie Arnaz]] (born 1951) and [[Desi Arnaz Jr.]] (born 1953).\n\nArnaz's marriage with Ball began to collapse under the strain of his growing problems with alcohol and also because of [[Promiscuity|womanizing]]. According to his memoir, the combined pressures of managing the production company, as well as supervising its day-to-day operations, had greatly worsened as it grew much larger, and he felt compelled to seek outlets to alleviate the stress.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} Arnaz was also suffering from [[diverticulitis]]. Ball divorced him in 1960. When Ball returned to weekly television, she and Arnaz worked out an agreement regarding Desilu, wherein she bought him out.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KoABABSnX7oC&pg=PA16&dq=%22he+sold+his+share+of+desilu%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwix-pPG1YnRAhVGeSYKHZ1UAjgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22he%20sold%20his%20share%20of%20desilu%22&f=false|title=Lucy A to Z: The Lucille Ball Encyclopedia|page=16|author=Karol, Michael|publisher=iUniverse|year=2008|accessdate=23 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nArnaz married his second wife, Edith Eyre Hirsch (n\u00e9e McSkimming), on March 2, 1963, and greatly reduced his show business activities. He served as executive producer of ''The Mothers-in-Law'', and during its two-year run, made four guest appearances as a Spanish [[Bullfighter|matador]], Se\u00f1or Delgado. Edith died in 1985, aged 67, from cancer.\n\nAlthough Arnaz and Ball both married other spouses after their divorce in 1960, they remained friends and grew closer in his final decade. \"''I Love Lucy'' was never just a title\", wrote Arnaz in the last years of his life.<ref>Desilu: The Story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz {{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}</ref> Family home video later aired on television showed Ball and Arnaz playing together with their grandson Simon shortly before Arnaz's death.\n\n==Later life==\n[[File:Desi arnaz sr and jr 1974.JPG|thumb|left|Arnaz appeared with his son in the 1974 television special, ''California, My Way''.]]\nIn the 1970s, Arnaz co-hosted a week of shows with daytime host and producer [[Mike Douglas]].

Barnsley's culture is rooted in its [[industrial heritage]] and it has a tradition of [[brass band]]s, originally created as social clubs by its mining communities. It is also home of the [[Barnsley chop]].\n\nThe town is accessed from junctions 36, 37 and 38 of the [[M1 motorway]] and has [[Barnsley Interchange|a railway station]] on the [[Hallam Line|Hallam]] and [[Penistone Line|Penistone]] Lines. [[Barnsley F.C.]] is the local [[Association football|football]] club, which has competed in the second tier of British football for most of its history.

The monks built a town where three roads met: the [[Sheffield]] to [[Wakefield]], [[Rotherham]] to [[Huddersfield]] and [[Cheshire]] to [[Doncaster]] routes. The Domesday village became known as Old Barnsley, and a town grew up on the new site.<ref name=\"hey\">David Hey, ''Medieval South Yorkshire'' {{full|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe monks erected a [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]], which survived until 1820 {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, and established a [[market (place)|market]].

The town was the centre of the [[Staincross (wapentake)|Staincross]] [[hundred (county division)|wapentake]], but in the mid-16th century had only 600 inhabitants.<ref name=\"hey\" />\n\nFrom the 17th century, Barnsley developed into a stop-off point on the route between Leeds, Wakefield, Sheffield and London. The traffic generated as a result of its location fuelled trade, with hostelries and related services prospering. A principal centre for linen weaving during the 18th and 19th century, Barnsley grew into an important manufacturing town.\n\nThe first passenger station to serve Barnsley was opened by the [[North Midland Railway]] in 1840. Barnsley station (latter called [[Cudworth railway station]]) was located some 2\u00bd miles away at Cudworth. On 1 January 1850 the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] opened [[Barnsley Interchange|Barnsley Exchange]] station, close to the town centre. On 1 May 1870 the [[Midland Railway]] opened Regent Street station, a temporary structure. A new station was opened by the MR on the Regent Street site on 23 August 1873. As it incorporated the old court house in its construction Regent Street station was renamed [[Barnsley Court House railway station|Barnsley Court House station]].\n\nBarnsley became a [[municipal borough]] in 1869, and a [[county borough]] in 1913.  The town's boundaries were extended to absorb [[Ardsley, South Yorkshire|Ardsley]] and [[Monk Bretton]] in 1921 and [[Carlton, South Yorkshire|Carlton]] in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10397110/relationships|title=Vision of Britain website|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Barnsley - geograph.org.uk - 1492811.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Church (Church of England)]]\nBarnsley was the site of a [[human crush]] that resulted in [[Barnsley Public Hall disaster|the deaths of 16 children in 1908]], at a public hall now known as ''The Civic'', when children were rushing to watch a film in the building.\n\nBarnsley has a long tradition of glass-making,<ref name=\"BarnsleyLife\" /> however Barnsley is most famous for its coal mines.

He arrived in the town on 11 March 1936 and spent a number of days in the town living in the houses of the working class miners while researching for the book. He wrote very critically of the council's expenditure on the construction of [[Barnsley Town Hall]] and claimed that the money should have been spent on improving the housing and living conditions of the local miners.\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:Barnsley Town Hall (1).jpg|alt=Barnsley Town Hall on a fine day.

The monks built a town where three roads met: the [[Sheffield]] to [[Wakefield]], [[Rotherham]] to [[Huddersfield]] and [[Cheshire]] to [[Doncaster]] routes. The Domesday village became known as Old Barnsley, and a town grew up on the new site.<ref name=\"hey\">David Hey, ''Medieval South Yorkshire'' {{full|date=December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe monks erected a [[chapel of ease]] dedicated to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Saint Mary]], which survived until 1820 {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, and established a [[market (place)|market]].

The traffic generated as a result of its location fuelled trade, with hostelries and related services prospering. A principal centre for linen weaving during the 18th and 19th century, Barnsley grew into an important manufacturing town.\n\nThe first passenger station to serve Barnsley was opened by the [[North Midland Railway]] in 1840. Barnsley station (latter called [[Cudworth railway station]]) was located some 2\u00bd miles away at Cudworth. On 1 January 1850 the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] opened [[Barnsley Interchange|Barnsley Exchange]] station, close to the town centre. On 1 May 1870 the [[Midland Railway]] opened Regent Street station, a temporary structure. A new station was opened by the MR on the Regent Street site on 23 August 1873. As it incorporated the old court house in its construction Regent Street station was renamed [[Barnsley Court House railway station|Barnsley Court House station]].\n\nBarnsley became a [[municipal borough]] in 1869, and a [[county borough]] in 1913.  The town's boundaries were extended to absorb [[Ardsley, South Yorkshire|Ardsley]] and [[Monk Bretton]] in 1921 and [[Carlton, South Yorkshire|Carlton]] in 1938.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10397110/relationships|title=Vision of Britain website|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:St Mary's Church, Barnsley - geograph.org.uk - 1492811.jpg|thumb|St Mary's Church (Church of England)]]\nBarnsley was the site of a [[human crush]] that resulted in [[Barnsley Public Hall disaster|the deaths of 16 children in 1908]], at a public hall now known as ''The Civic'', when children were rushing to watch a film in the building.\n\nBarnsley has a long tradition of glass-making,<ref name=\"BarnsleyLife\" /> however Barnsley is most famous for its coal mines.

The modal average farm size is a smallish 154 acres.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Ag_Overview/stateOverview.php?state=WEST%20VIRGINIA | title=2018 STATE AGRICULTURE OVERVIEW: West Virginia | publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref> Family and single-owner operation worked 92.7% of the farms, and an astounding 96.9% were totally or partly owned by the operator. On the other hand, only 50.5% of the state's farmers considered farming to be their primary occupation, with a significant number of hours worked elsewhere each year. The rural poverty rate in West Virginia is 20.4%, five points higher than the urban poverty rate.\n\nThis description of farming portrays an independent and self-sufficient base of small land owners, but also a significant amount of rural [[poverty]].\n\nAs can be expected in a rugged terrain, raising animals was far more important than growing vegetative crops. Income from animals exceeded income from plants by about 7 to 1, with much of the non-animal income derived from sales of fodder. The chief animals raised were cattle and chickens.\n\nIn the ridge and valley area along the eastern border near [[Virginia]]'s [[Shenandoah Valley]], subsidiary valleys are wide and there are some belts of rich [[soil]] which are extensively [[farm]]ed. In 2002, all of the top five counties by agricultural dollar value were located near the eastern Virginia border.\n\nIn traditional frontier [[agriculture]] there was much gathering of wild \"greens\" and other vegetation to supplement the diet. One area where this practice is still significant is the gathering of wild North American [[ginseng]], often for the Asian market. Wild gathered ginseng contributed about $2 million in 2000 to the West Virginia economy, a figure larger than many conventional cultivated vegetable and fruit crops. Other wild greens, such as sour dock, lambs quarters, and [[Allium tricoccum|wild leek]] (or \"ramps\") are also still gathered by many for table use, although today more on the basis of [[avocation]] or keeping up traditions than out of necessity.\n\nAlong the western edges of the state the large rivers of the mid-continent erode a distance into the hills and it is here, in the west, that some dense pockets of heavy industry appear. In the [[Kanawha River]] Valley near [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] and along the southern [[Ohio River]] Valley near [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] chemicals predominate, attracted by a readily available labor force and access by [[barge]] carriers. Metallurgy, especially [[steel]], has been predominant in the [[Northern Panhandle]] due to a spill-over effect from the traditional center of the US steel industry in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\n===Banking===\nDue to the rural demographics in West Virginia, the state isn't dominated by any major [[Banking in the United States|U.S. banks]]. In fact, the only [[Big Four (banks)#United States|Big Four bank]] with any [[retail banking]] presence in the state is [[Chase Bank]], and only in the [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] area. [[Wesbanco]] is the largest bank in the state,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ibanknet.com/scripts/callreports/fiList.aspx?type=statebank&state=54 |title=West Virginia - Banks | publisher=iBankNet}}</ref> and the only major bank with a presence throughout the state. City National Bank (West Virginia) also has a significant presence in several areas in West Virginia.

The Appalachian region as defined by the Commission includes 420 counties in 13 states, including all 55 counties in West Virginia, the only state whose entire territory is covered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Commission gives each county one of five possible economic designations - distressed, at-risk, transitional, competitive, or attainment - with \"distressed\" counties being the most economically endangered and \"attainment\" counties being the most economically prosperous. These designations are based primarily on three indicators - three-year average unemployment rate, market income per capita, and poverty rate.<ref name=arcdata>{{cite web | url=https://www.arc.gov/ | title=Resource Center| publisher=[[Appalachian Regional Commission]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, West Virginia had a three-year average unemployment rate of 5.7%, compared with 5.5% nationwide. In 2002, West Virginia had a per capita market income of $17,856, compared with $26,420 nationwide. In 2000, West Virginia had a poverty rate of 17.9%, compared to 12.4% nationwide. Fifteen counties in West Virginia were designated \"distressed,\" and sixteen counties were designated \"at-risk.\" No county received the \"attainment\" designation, and only two - Jefferson and Putnam - were designated \"competitive.\" Nineteen counties were designated \"transitional,\" meaning they lagged behind the national average on one of the three key indicators. McDowell County had West Virginia's highest poverty rating (and the third highest in the entire Appalachian region), with 37.7% of its residents living below the poverty line. Kanawha County had West Virginia's highest per capita income at $25,170, and Monongalia had West Virginia's lowest unemployment rate at 2.7%.<ref name=arcdata />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{West Virginia}}\n{{Economy of the United States by jurisdiction}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of West Virginia| ]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:The Village at Snowshoe.jpg|thumb|right|325px|The Village at [[Snowshoe Mountain]] in [[Pocahontas County, West Virginia|Pocahontas County]].

Major tourist attractions include state's premier skiing destinations such as [[Snowshoe Mountain]], [[Canaan Valley]], [[Winterplace Ski Resort]], [[Oglebay Park|Oblebay Resort]], Elk River Touring Center, and [[White Grass Ski Touring Center]].

The modal average farm size is a smallish 154 acres.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats/Ag_Overview/stateOverview.php?state=WEST%20VIRGINIA | title=2018 STATE AGRICULTURE OVERVIEW: West Virginia | publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]}}</ref> Family and single-owner operation worked 92.7% of the farms, and an astounding 96.9% were totally or partly owned by the operator. On the other hand, only 50.5% of the state's farmers considered farming to be their primary occupation, with a significant number of hours worked elsewhere each year. The rural poverty rate in West Virginia is 20.4%, five points higher than the urban poverty rate.\n\nThis description of farming portrays an independent and self-sufficient base of small land owners, but also a significant amount of rural [[poverty]].\n\nAs can be expected in a rugged terrain, raising animals was far more important than growing vegetative crops. Income from animals exceeded income from plants by about 7 to 1, with much of the non-animal income derived from sales of fodder. The chief animals raised were cattle and chickens.\n\nIn the ridge and valley area along the eastern border near [[Virginia]]'s [[Shenandoah Valley]], subsidiary valleys are wide and there are some belts of rich [[soil]] which are extensively [[farm]]ed. In 2002, all of the top five counties by agricultural dollar value were located near the eastern Virginia border.\n\nIn traditional frontier [[agriculture]] there was much gathering of wild \"greens\" and other vegetation to supplement the diet. One area where this practice is still significant is the gathering of wild North American [[ginseng]], often for the Asian market. Wild gathered ginseng contributed about $2 million in 2000 to the West Virginia economy, a figure larger than many conventional cultivated vegetable and fruit crops. Other wild greens, such as sour dock, lambs quarters, and [[Allium tricoccum|wild leek]] (or \"ramps\") are also still gathered by many for table use, although today more on the basis of [[avocation]] or keeping up traditions than out of necessity.\n\nAlong the western edges of the state the large rivers of the mid-continent erode a distance into the hills and it is here, in the west, that some dense pockets of heavy industry appear. In the [[Kanawha River]] Valley near [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] and along the southern [[Ohio River]] Valley near [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] chemicals predominate, attracted by a readily available labor force and access by [[barge]] carriers. Metallurgy, especially [[steel]], has been predominant in the [[Northern Panhandle]] due to a spill-over effect from the traditional center of the US steel industry in [[Pittsburgh]].\n\n===Banking===\nDue to the rural demographics in West Virginia, the state isn't dominated by any major [[Banking in the United States|U.S. banks]]. In fact, the only [[Big Four (banks)#United States|Big Four bank]] with any [[retail banking]] presence in the state is [[Chase Bank]], and only in the [[Charleston, West Virginia|Charleston]] area. [[Wesbanco]] is the largest bank in the state,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.ibanknet.com/scripts/callreports/fiList.aspx?type=statebank&state=54 |title=West Virginia - Banks | publisher=iBankNet}}</ref> and the only major bank with a presence throughout the state. City National Bank (West Virginia) also has a significant presence in several areas in West Virginia. Other major banks in the state, but only in certain areas, include Chase, [[Fifth Third Bank]] in Charleston and [[PNC Financial Services]] in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]].\n\n==Appalachian Regional Commission==\n[[Image:West-virginia-arc-designations-2003.png|right|thumb|175px|Map showing 2003 ARC economic designations for counties in West Virginia.]]\n{{see also|List of Appalachian Regional Commission counties#West_Virginia}}\n\nThe [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] was formed in 1965 to aide economic development in the Appalachian region, which was lagging far behind the rest of the nation on most economic indicators. The Appalachian region as defined by the Commission includes 420 counties in 13 states, including all 55 counties in West Virginia, the only state whose entire territory is covered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. The Commission gives each county one of five possible economic designations - distressed, at-risk, transitional, competitive, or attainment - with \"distressed\" counties being the most economically endangered and \"attainment\" counties being the most economically prosperous. These designations are based primarily on three indicators - three-year average unemployment rate, market income per capita, and poverty rate.<ref name=arcdata>{{cite web | url=https://www.arc.gov/ | title=Resource Center| publisher=[[Appalachian Regional Commission]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003, West Virginia had a three-year average unemployment rate of 5.7%, compared with 5.5% nationwide. In 2002, West Virginia had a per capita market income of $17,856, compared with $26,420 nationwide. In 2000, West Virginia had a poverty rate of 17.9%, compared to 12.4% nationwide. Fifteen counties in West Virginia were designated \"distressed,\" and sixteen counties were designated \"at-risk.\" No county received the \"attainment\" designation, and only two - Jefferson and Putnam - were designated \"competitive.\" Nineteen counties were designated \"transitional,\" meaning they lagged behind the national average on one of the three key indicators. McDowell County had West Virginia's highest poverty rating (and the third highest in the entire Appalachian region), with 37.7% of its residents living below the poverty line. Kanawha County had West Virginia's highest per capita income at $25,170, and Monongalia had West Virginia's lowest unemployment rate at 2.7%.<ref name=arcdata />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{West Virginia}}\n{{Economy of the United States by jurisdiction}}\n\n[[Category:Economy of West Virginia| ]]\n", "name_user": "2601:200:3:829d:ccdf:da63:5bb8:7a1b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eOverview)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_West_Virginia"}

Alvarado recruited a company of Tennessean riflemen, many of them former trappers who had settled in the Monterey Bay area. The company was led by another American, [[Isaac Graham]]. When the Americans refused to fight against fellow Americans, Alvarado was forced to negotiate a settlement.\n\n=== Ethnic variety ===\nCalifornios included the descendants of agricultural settlers and retired escort soldiers deployed from what is modern-day Mexico. Most were of mixed ethnicities, usually ''[[Mestizo]]'' (Spanish and Native American) or mixed African and Amerindian backgrounds. Despite the depictions of the popular shows like ''[[Zorro]]'', few ''Californios'' were of \"pure\" Spanish ([[Peninsulares|Peninsular]] or [[Criollo people|Criollo]]) ancestry.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Intimate Frontiers: Sex, Gender, and Culture in Old California|last = Hurtado|first = Albert L.|publisher = University of New Mexico Press|year = 2016|isbn = 978-0-8263-5646-8|location = New Mexico |chapter=Introduction:The Intimate Challenges of a Multicultural Frontier  |pages = |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSe9DAAAQBAJ&q=%27most+of+the+first+pobladores+%28settlers%29+were+born+in+Mexico+of+mixed+parentage%27+%22most+californios+were+of+mixed+origin%22#v=snippet&q='most%20of%20the%20first%20pobladores%20(settlers)%20were%20born%20in%20Mexico%20of%20mixed%20parentage'%20%22most%20californios%20were%20of%20mixed%20origin%22&f=false}}</ref> Most with unmixed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry were [[Franciscan]] priests, along with career government officials and military officers who did not remain in California.<ref>Mason, ''The Census of 1790''; Gostin, ''Southern California Vital Records''; Haas, ''Conquests and Historical Identities in California''; and {{cite book|author=Leonard Pitt|title=The Decline of the Californios: A Social History of the Spanish-speaking Californians, 1846\u20131890|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rT6cs89EmGgC|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01637-8}}; and [http://www.sfgenealogy.org/spanish/calfam.htm California Spanish Genealogy \u2013 California Census 1790].</ref>\n\nAccording to mission records (marriage, baptisms, and burials) as well as Presidio roster listings, several \"leather-jacket\" soldiers (''soldados de cuero'') operating as escorts, mission guards, and other military duty personnel were described as ''europeo'' (i.e., born in Europe), while most of the civilian settlers were of mixed origins (coyote, mulatto, etc.). The term ''mestizo'' was rarely if ever used in mission records, the more common terms being ''indio'', ''europeo'', ''mulato'', ''coyote'', ''castizo'' and other caste terms. An example of the number of European-born soldiers is the twenty-five from Lieutenant [[Pedro Fages]] detachment of [[Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia|Catalan Volunteers]]. Most of the soldiers on the [[Portola expedition|Portola-Serra expedition]] of 1769 and the [[Juan Bautista de Anza|de Anza]] expeditions of 1774 and 1775 were recruited from the Spanish Army infantry regiments then stationed in Mexico. Many of them were assigned to garrison the presidios, then retired at the end of their ten-year enlistments, and remaining in California. Because there were many more men than women among the Spanish soldiers and settlers, some men who stayed in California married native Californian women who had converted to Christianity at the missions.\n\n=== Family and education ===\nThe family was characteristically patriarchal, with the son regardless of age, deferring to his father's wishes.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> Women had full rights of property ownership and control unless she was married or had a father\u2014the males had almost complete control of all family members.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia mexican\" /> A formal education system in California had yet to be created so it fell to the individual families to educate their children among them, traditionally done by the priests or hired private tutors; few early immigrants knew how to read or write, so only a few hundred inhabitants could.<ref name=\"California Conquered\">Harrow, Neal; ''California Conquered: The Annexation of a Mexican Province, 1846\u20131850''; pp. 14\u201330; University of California Press; 1989; {{ISBN|978-0-520-06605-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Women in Californio society ===\nThe social life of Californio society was extremely important in both politics and business, and women played an important part in these interactions. They helped facilitate these interactions for their husbands, and therefore themselves, to move up in the social and power rankings of Californio society. This ability to shape social situations was a sought after trait when looking for a spouse, as prominent men knew the power their new wife would have in their future dealings<ref name=\"Sanchez\">{{Cite book|title = Telling Identities: The Californio testimonios|last = S\u00e1nchez|first = Rosaura|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1995|isbn = 0-8166-2559-X|location = |pages = [https://archive.org/details/tellingidentitie0000sanc/page/210 210\u2013220]|url = https://archive.org/details/tellingidentitie0000sanc/page/210}}</ref>\n\nIn movies and television, women from this era are often heavily romanticized and  commonly characterized by their beauty and fun loving nature, while also being very sheltered and protected.<ref>Langum, David J. \"Californio Women and the Image of Virtue\". ''Southern California Quarterly'' 59.3 (1977): 245\u2013250.</ref>  \n\nAs women played a key role in the development of Alta California and its social interactions they continued this role into its transition from a Mexican territory to an American possession. As foreign non-Spanish speaking men moved into California, who wished to insert themselves into the upper echelons of already established social hierarchy, they began to use marriage with the women of established Californio families as a way to join this hierarchy.<ref name=\"Sanchez\" /> Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners was common during the time of Mexican rule and quickly became even more common after the American annexation and [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush in California]]. These intermarriages worked to combine the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. These marriages though were not enough to prevent the descent into irrelevance of Californio power in California or the racism and attacks on the people of Mexican heritage later.\n\n=== Repopulation ===\nThe [[New Spain|Spanish colonial]] government, and later, [[History of Mexico|Mexican]] officials encouraged through recruitment civilians from the northern and western provinces of Mexico such as [[Sonora]]. This was not well received by Californios, and was one of the factors leading to revolt against Mexican rule. Sonorans came to California despite the area's isolation and the lack of central government support. Many of the soldier's wives considered California to be a cultural wasteland and a hardship assignment. An incentive for the soldiers that remained in California after service was the opportunity to receive a land grant that probably was not possible elsewhere. This made most of California's early settlers military retirees with a few civilian settlers from Mexico. Since it was a frontier society, the initial rancho housing was characterized as ''rude and crude''\u2014little more than mud huts with thatched roofs. As the rancho owners prospered these residences could be upgraded to more substantial [[adobe]] structures with tiled roofs. Some buildings took advantage of local tar pits (La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles) in an attempt to waterproof roofs. Restoration of these Today, often suffer from a perception that results in a grander representation than if they had been constructed during the Californio period.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\">Hoffman, Lola B.; ''California Beginnings''; California State Department of Education; 1848; p. 151</ref>\n\n=== The concession of land ===\nBefore Mexican independence in 1821, 20 \"Spanish\" land grants had been issued (at little or no cost) in all of [[Alta California]];<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> many to \"a few friends and family of the Alta California governors\". The 1824 Mexican [[General Colonization Law]] established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Catholic Franciscan missions and possibly entice increased Mexican settlement. When the missions were secularized in 1834\u20131836 mission property and livestock were supposed to be mostly allocated to the [[Mission Indians]].<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" /> Historical research shows that the majority of rancho grants were given to retired non-commissioned soldiers. The largest grants to Nieto, Sepulveda, Dominguez, Yorba, Avila, Grijalva, and other founding families were examples of this practice.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" />\n\nMany of the foreign residents also became rancho grantees. Some were \"Californios by marriage\" like Stearns (who was naturalized in Mexico before moving north) and the Englishman [[William Edward Petty Hartnell|William Hartnell]]. Others married Californios but never became Mexican citizens. Rancho ownership was possible for these men because, under Spanish/Mexican law, married women could independently hold title to property. In the [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] area, three Californio daughters of the ''inv\u00e1lido'' Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Castro (1768\u20131838) married foreigners yet still received grants to [[Rancho Soquel]], [[Rancho San Agustin]] and [[Rancho Refugio]].\n\n=== Ranchos ===\nIn practice nearly all mission property and livestock became about 455 large [[Ranchos of California]] granted by the Californio authorities. The Californio rancho owners claimed about {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}} averaging about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each. This land was nearly all originally mission land within about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast. The Mexican-era land grants by law were provisional for five years in order for the terms of the law to reasonably be fulfilled. The boundaries of these ranchos were not established as they came to be in later times predominately based on what could be understood as figurative boundaries. They were based on just where another granted owner considered the end of their land, lands or vegetation landmarks.<ref>Walton Bean, ''California: An Interpretive History'', Second Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 152.</ref> Conflict was bound to occur when these land grants were reviewed under United States control. Title to some grants under United States control were rejected<ref>Howard Lamar, editor. ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West'', (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 633.</ref> based on questionable documents especially when with predated documents, that could have been created post-United States occupancy in January 1847.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" /><ref>Walton Bean, ''California: An Interpretive History'', Second Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 159.</ref>\n\n=== Rancho culture ===\nAfter agriculture, cattle, sheep and horses were established by the [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]], [[Friar]]s, soldiers and [[Mission Indians]], the [[List of Ranchos of California|Rancho]] owners dismissed the Friars and the soldiers and took over the Mission land and livestock starting in 1834\u2014the [[Mission Indians]] were left to survive however they could. The rancho owners tried to live in a grand style they perceived of the wealthy [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgos]] in [[History of Spain|Spain]]. They expected the non-rancho owning population to support this lifestyle.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> Nearly all males rode to where ever they were going at nearly all times making them excellent riders. They indulged in many [[Festival|fiestas]], [[fandango]]s, [[rodeo]]s and [[Muster (livestock)|roundups]] as the rancho owners often went from rancho to rancho on a large horse bound party circuit. Weddings, christenings, and funerals were all \"celebrated\" with large gatherings.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" />\n\n=== Taxes ===\nSince the government depended on import [[tariff]]s (also called Custom duties and ad-valorem taxes) for its income there was virtually no property tax. Under Spanish/Mexican rule, all landowners were expected to the [[Diezmo]], a compulsory [[tithe]] to the Catholic Church of one tenth of the fruits of agriculture and animal husbandry, business profits or salaries. [[Spanish missions of California|Priest salaries and mission expenses]] were paid out of this money and/or collected goods.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" />\n\nThe mandatory Diezmo ended with the secularization of the missions, greatly reducing rancho taxes until the U.S. takeover. Today's state property tax system makes large self-supporting cattle ranches uneconomical in most cases.\n\n=== Frequency of use of horses ===\nHorses were plentiful and often left, after being broken in, to wander around with a rope around their neck for easy capture. It was not unusual for a rider to use one horse until it was exhausted, before switching its bridle to another horse\u2014letting the first horse free to wander. Horse ownership for all except a few exceptional animals were almost community property. Horses were so common and of so little use that they were often destroyed to keep them from eating the grass needed by the cattle. California Indians later developed a taste for horse flesh as food and helped keep the number of horses under control.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" /> An unusual use for horses was found in [[Chaff|shucking]] wheat or barley. The wheat and its stems were cut from the gain fields by Indians bearing [[sickle]]s. The grain with its stems still attached was transported to the harvesting area by solid wheeled ox-cart<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Transport and Travel |publisher=History World |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab79 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> (about the only wheeled transport in California) and put into a circular packed earth corral. A herd of horses were then driven into the same corral or \"threshing field\". By keeping the horses moving around the corral their hoofs would, in time, separate the [[wheat]] or [[barley]] from the [[chaff]]. Later the horses would be allowed to escape and the wheat and [[chaff]] were collected and then separated by tossing it into the air on a windy day so as to let the wind carry the [[chaff]] away. Presumably the wheat was washed before use to remove some of the dirt.<ref>Hoffman, Lola B.; ''California Beginnings''; California State Department of Education; 1948; p. 195</ref>\n\n=== The Indian work force ===\nFor these very few [[List of Ranchos of California|rancho]] owners and their families, this was the Californio's Golden Age, although for all the others much different.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> Much of the agriculture, vineyards and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining mission Indian population went from over 80,000 in 1800 to only a few thousand by 1846. Fewer Indians meant less food was required and the [[Franciscan]] Friars and soldiers supporting the missions disappeared after 1834 when the missions were abolished (secularized). After the Friars and soldiers disappeared, many of the Indians deserted the missions and returned to their tribes or found work elsewhere. The new ranchos often gave work to some of the former mission Indians. The \"Savage tribes\" worked for room, board and clothing (and no pay).<ref>{{cite book |author=Eric Foner |title=Give Me Liberty!

The exceptions were the cattle and horses growing wild on unfenced range land. Originally owned by the missions they were killed for their hides and tallow.<ref name=\"San Francisco History\">{{cite web |title=Seventy-five Years in San Francisco: Appendix N.

This stiff leather jacket was sufficient to stop most Indian arrows and worked well when fighting the Indians. Beef was a common constituent of most Californio meals and since it couldn't be kept long in the days before refrigeration, beef was often slaughtered to get a few [[steak]]s or cuts of meat. The property and yards around the ranchos were marked by the large number of dead cow heads, horns or other animal parts. Cow hides were kept later for trading purposes with Yankee or British traders who started showing up once or twice a year after 1825.<ref>Howard Lamar, editor. ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West'', (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 149.</ref> Beef, [[wheat]] bread products, [[corn]] (maize), several types of [[bean]]s, [[peas]] and several types of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were common meal items with [[wine]] and [[olive oil]] used when they could be found. The [[mestizo]] population probably subsisted mostly on what they were used to: corn or maize, beans, and squash with some beef donated by the rancho owners. What the average [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] ate is unknown since they were in transition from a [[hunter gatherer]] society to agriculturalists. Formerly, many lived at least part of the year on ground acorns, fish, seeds, wild game, etc. It is known that many of the ranchers complained about Indians stealing their cattle and horses to eat.<ref name=\"San Francisco History\" />\n\n=== Trade ===\nFrom about 1769 to 1824 California averaged about 2.5 [[sailing ship|ships]] per year with 13 years showing no ships coming to California. These ships brought a few new settlers and supplies for the pueblos and Missions. Under the [[New Spain|Spanish colonial]] government rules, trade was actively discouraged with non-Spanish ships. The few non-Indian people living in California had almost nothing to trade\u2014the missions and pueblos were subsidized by the Spanish government. The occasional Spanish ships that did show up were usually requested by Californios and had Royal permission to go to California\u2014bureaucracy in action. Prior to 1824, when the newly independent [[History of Mexico|Mexico]] liberalized the trade rules<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> and allowed trade with non-Mexican ships, the occasional trading ship or U.S. [[Whaling in the United States|whaler]] that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh meat and [[vegetable]]s became more common. The average number of ships from 1825 to 1845 jumped to twenty-five ships per year versus the 2.5 ships per year common for the prior fifty years.<ref name=\"San Francisco History\" />\n\nThe [[Ranchos of California|rancho]] society had few resources except large herds of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn cattle]] which grew well in California. The ranchos produced the largest [[cowhide]] (called California Greenbacks) and [[tallow]] business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off the fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s that were common in California. With something to trade, and needing everything from nails, needles and almost anything made of metal to fancy thread and cloth that could be [[sew]]n into fancy cloaks or ladies' dresses, etc., they started trading with merchant ships from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Britain and other trading ports in Europe and the [[East Coast of the United States]]. The trip from [[History of Boston|Boston]], [[History of New York City (1784\u20131854)|New York City]] or [[Liverpool]] England averaged over 200 days one way. Trading ships and the occasional whaler put into [[San Diego]], [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]], [[Ventura, California|San Buenaventura]] (Ventura), [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (San Francisco) after stopping and paying the [[import tariff]] of 50\u2013100% at the entry port of Monterey, California. These tariffs or custom fees paid for the Alta California government. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (originally published 1840) by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] gives a good first-hand account of a two-year [[sailing ship]] [[sea]] trading voyage to Alta California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California longhorn]] horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items during this period. \n\nCalifornia was not alone in using the import duty to pay for its government as the [[Tariffs in United States history|U.S. import tariffs]] at this time were also the way the United States paid for most of its Federal Government. A U.S. average tariff (also called custom duties and [[ad valorem tax]]es) of about 25% raised about 89% of all Federal income in 1850.<ref>Federal Income 1850 [http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/#usgs302a Federal State Local Government Revenue in United States 2011 \u2013 Charts Tables] Accessed April 2, 2011</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early colonization ===\nIn 1769, [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] and less than two hundred men, on expedition founded the [[Presidio of San Diego]] (military post). On July 16, [[Franciscan]] friars [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], Juan Viscaino and Fernando Parron raised and 'blessed a cross', establishing the first mission in upper [[The Californias|Las Californias]], [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1]].<ref>Leffingwell, Randy (2005), ''California Missions and Presidios: The History & Beauty of the Spanish Missions''. Voyageur Press, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota. {{ISBN|0-89658-492-5}}, p. 17</ref> Colonists began arriving in 1774.\n\n[[Monterey, California]] was established in 1770 by Father Jun\u00edpero Serra and [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] (first governor of [[The Californias|Las Californias]] province (1767\u20131770), explorer and founder of San Diego and Monterey). Monterey was settled with two friars and about 40 men and served as the capital of California from 1777 to 1849. The nearby [[Carmel Mission]], in [[Carmel, California]] was moved there after a year in Monterey to keep the [[Spanish missions of California|mission]] and its [[Mission Indians]] away from the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Monterey Presidio]] soldiers. It was the headquarters of the original Alta California province missions headed by Father-President Jun\u00edpero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784\u2014he is buried there. Monterey was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. All ships were supposed to clear through Monterey and pay the roughly 42% [[tariff]] (customs duties on imported goods before trading anywhere else in Alta California. The oldest governmental building in the state is the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Monterey Custom House]] and California's Historic Landmark Number One.<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=954 California State Parks: Custom House]</ref> [[The Californian (1840s newspaper)|The ''Californian'']], California's oldest newspaper, was first published in Monterey on August 15, 1846, after the city's occupation by the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]] on July 7, 1846.<ref>Library of Congress.

Anza led 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They started out with 695 horses and mules and 385 [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] bulls and cows\u2014starting the cattle and horse industry in California. About 600 horses and mules and 300 cattle survived the trip. In 1776 about 200 leather-jacketed soldiers, Friars, and colonists with their families moved to what was called [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now San Francisco) to start building a mission and a presidio there. The leather jackets the soldiers wore consisted of several layers of hardened leather and were strong enough body [[armor]] to usually stop an Indian arrow. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years and essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals\u2014doubling roughly every two years. They partially displaced the [[Tule Elk]] and [[pronghorn]] antelope who had lived there in large herds previously.\n\nAnza selected the sites of the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] in what is now San Francisco; on his way back to Monterey, he sited [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] and the pueblo [[History of San Jose, California|San Jose]] in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] but did not initially leave settlers to settle them. [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (or Mission Dolores), the sixth Spanish mission, was founded on June 29, 1776, by Lieutenant [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquin Moraga]] and Father [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] (a companion of Jun\u00edpero Serra).\n\nOn November 29, 1777, [[History of San Jose, California|El Pueblo de San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe]] (The Town of [[Saint Joseph]] of Guadalupe now called simply San Jose) was founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Moraga]] on the first ''[[pueblo]]''-town not associated with a [[Spanish Missions of California|mission]] or a military post (''presidio'') in Alta California. The original San Jose settlers were part of the original group of 200 settlers and soldiers that had originally settled in Yerba Buena (San Francisco). [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds|Mission Santa Clara]], founded in 1777, was the eighth mission founded and closest mission to San Jose. Mission Santa Clara was {{convert|3|mi|sigfig=1}} from the original San Jose pueblo site in neighboring [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] was not founded until 1797, about {{convert|20|mi|sigfig=1}} north of San Jose in what is now [[Fremont, California|Fremont]].\n\nThe [[Los Angeles Pobladores]] (\"villagers\") is the name given to the 44 original Sonorans\u201422 adults and 22 children\u2014who settled the Pueblo of [[History of Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1781. The ''pobladores'' were agricultural families from [[Sonora]], Mexico. They were the last settlers to use the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|Anza trail]] as the [[Quechan]]s (Yumas) closed the trail for the next 40 years shortly after they had passed over it. Almost none of the settlers were ''espa\u00f1oles'' (Spanish); the rest had ''[[casta]]'' (caste) designations such as ''[[mestizo]]'', ''indio'', and ''negro''. Some classifications were changed in the California Census of 1790, as often happened in colonial Spanish America.<ref>[http://www.sfgenealogy.org/spanish/calfam.htm \"The Census of 1790, California\"], California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-04. Compiled from William Marvin Mason, ''The Census of 1790: A Demographic History of California'', Menlo Park: Ballena Press, 1998, pp. 75\u2013105. Information in parentheses () is from church records.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and escort soldiers who founded the towns of [[History of San Jose, California|San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe]], Yerba Buena (San Francisco), Monterey, San Diego and [[Pueblo de Los Angeles|La Reina de Los \u00c1ngeles]] were primarily mestizo and of mixed [[Negro]] and Indian ancestry from the province of [[Sonora y Sinaloa]] in Mexico. Recruiters in Mexico of the [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]] expedition and other expeditions later, who were charged with founding an agricultural community in Alta California, had a difficult time persuading people to emigrate to such an isolated outpost with no agriculture, no towns, no stores or developments of almost any kind. The majority of settlers were recruited from the northwestern parts of Mexico. The only tentative link with Mexico was via ship after the Quechans (Yumas) closed the [[Colorado River]]'s [[Yuma Crossing]] in 1781. For the next 40 years, an average of only 2.5 ships per year visited California with 13 years showing no recorded ships arriving.\n\nIn Californio society, ''casta'' ([[caste]]) designations carried more weight than they did in older communities of central Mexico. One similar concept was the ''[[gente de raz\u00f3n]]'', a term literally meaning \"people of reason\". It designated peoples who were culturally Hispanic (that is, they were not living in traditional Indian communities) and had adopted [[Christianity]]. This served to distinguish the Mexican ''Indio'' settlers and converted Californian ''Indios'' from the ''barbaro'' (barbarian) Californian Indians, who had not converted or become part of the Hispanic towns.<ref>Rios-Bustamante, Antonio. ''Mexican Los \u00c1ngeles'', 43.</ref> California's Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] was criticized for his alleged descent from mestizo and ''mulato'' ([[mulatto]]) settlers.\n\n=== The end of Mexican rule ===\nIn the 1830s the newly formed Mexican government was experiencing difficulties having gone through several revolts, wars, and internal conflicts and a seemingly never ending string of Mexican [[List of heads of state of Mexico|Presidents]]. One of the problems in Mexico was the large amount of land controlled by the [[Catholic Church]] (estimated then at about one-third of all settled property) who were continually granted property by many land owners when they died or controlled property supposedly held in trust for the Indians. This land, as it gradually accumulated, was seldom sold as it cost nothing to keep, but could be rented out to gain additional income for the Catholic Church to pay its [[priest]]s, [[Friar]]s, Bishops etc. and other expenses. The [[Catholic Church]] was the largest and richest land owner in Mexico and its provinces. In California the situation was even more pronounced as the [[Franciscan]] Friars held over 90% of all settled property supposedly in trust for the [[Mission Indians]].\n\nIn 1834 secularization laws <ref>[http://www.mchsmuseum.com/secularization.html secularization laws] accessed July 7, 2011</ref> were enacted that voided the mission control of lands in the northern settlements under Mexican rule. The missions controlled over 90% of the settled land in California as well as directing thousands of Indians in herding livestock, growing crops and orchards, weaving cloth, etc. for the missions and the [[presidio]]s and pueblo (town) dwellers. The mission lands and herds formerly controlled by the [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] were usually distributed to the settlers around each mission. Since most had almost no money the land was distributed or granted free or at very little cost to friends and families (or those who paid the highest bribes) of the government officials.\n\nThe Californio [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], for example, was reputed to be the richest man in California before the [[California Gold Rush]]. Vallejo oversaw the secularization of [[Mission San Francisco Solano]] and the distributions of its roughly {{convert|1000000|acres|km2}}. He founded the towns of [[Sonoma, California]] and [[Petaluma, California]], owned [[Mare Island]] and the future town site of [[Benicia, California]] and was granted the {{convert|66622|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Petaluma]], the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] and other properties by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa]] in 1834 and later. Vallejo's younger brother, Jose Manuel Salvador Vallejo (1813\u20131876), was granted the {{convert|22718|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Napa]] and other additional grants known as Salvador's Ranch.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |author2=Hero Rensch |author3=Ethel Rensch |author4=William N. Abeloe |title=Historic Spots in California |year=1966 |publisher=Stanford University Press |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/historicspotsinc0000unse |isbn=978-0-8047-4482-9 |url-access=registration }}</ref> Over the hills of Mariano Vallejo's princely estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to six thousand horses, and many thousands of sheep. He occupied a baronial castle on the plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with most royal hospitality and few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had a great ranch house called La Hacienda and on his home farm called Lachryma Montis (Tear of the Mountain), he built, about 1849, a modern frame house where he spent the later years of his life.\n\nVallejo tried to get the California State Capital moved permanently to [[Benicia, California]] on land he sold to the state government in December 1851. It was named Benicia for the General's wife, Francisca Benicia Carillo de Vallejo. The General intended that the prospective city be named \"Francisca\" after his wife, but this name was dropped when the former city of \"[[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]]\" changed its name to \"San Francisco\" on January 30, 1847. Benicia was the third site selected to serve as the California state capital, and its newly constructed city hall was California's capitol from February 11, 1853 to February 25, 1854. Vallejo gave the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] to his oldest daughter, Epifania Guadalupe Vallejo, April 3, 1851, as a wedding present, when she married U.S. Army General John H. Frisbie. It is unknown what he gave as a wedding present when his two daughters Natalia and Jovita married the brothers [[Attila Haraszthy]] and [[Agoston Haraszthy]] on the same day\u2014June 1, 1863.\n\nIn some cases particular mission land and livestock were split into parcels and then distributed by drawing lots. In nearly all cases the Indians got very little of the mission land or livestock. Whether any of the proceeds of these sales made its way back to Mexico City is unknown. These lands had been worked by settlers and the much larger settlements of local Native American [[Kumeyaay]] peoples on the [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] for in some cases several generations. When the missions were secularized or dismantled and the Indians did not have to live under continued Friar and military control they were left essentially to survive on their own. Many of the Native Americans reverted to their former tribal existence and left the missions while others found they could get room and board and some clothing by working for the large ranches that took over the former mission lands and livestock. Many natives who had learned to ride horses and had a smattering of Spanish were recruited to be become [[vaquero]]s ([[cowboy]]s or cattle herders) that worked the cattle and horses on the large [[List of Ranchos of California|ranchos]] and did other work. Some of these rancho owners and their hired hands would make up the bulk of the few hundred Californios fighting in the brief Mexican\u2013American War conflicts in California. Some of the Californios and [[Indigenous peoples of California|California Indians]] would fight on the side of the U.S. settlers during the conflict with some even joining the [[California Battalion]].\n\n=== Mexican Governors of California ===\nThe Californios had a succession of Mexican appointed governors who nearly all either died in office or were driven from office. Many of governors appointed by Mexico proved to be mediocre, autocratic and indifferent to Californio concerns or needs and were driven from office. The native Californio governors were usually self-appointed and acted as governor ''pro tempore'' until Mexico heard about the previous Governor's death or ouster and they could appoint a new governor or approve the existing governor\u2014often a slow process. The Californios had such poor luck with Mexican troops (often unpaid convicts) and Mexican appointed governors that many resented Mexican interference in what they considered their internal affairs.\n* List of Governors\n* 1822\u20131825: [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello]], born in San Francisco; the first native\u2013born Californio to govern Alta California\n* 1825\u20131831: [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda]], Mexico appointed; first of two terms\n* 1831\u20131832: [[Manuel Victoria]], Mexico appointed; forced from office after one year\n* 1832: [[P\u00edo Pico]], native-born Californio, native of San Diego and favored British acquisition of California; moved capital from Monterey to Los Angeles\n* 1832\u20131833: [[Agust\u00edn V.

[[P\u00edo Pico]], a Californio, was the governor of California during the conflict.\n\n[[File:USS Cyane.jpg|right|thumb|{{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} taking San Diego 1846]]\n\nThe [[Pacific Squadron]], the United States Naval force stationed in the Pacific was instrumental in the capture of [[Alta California]] after war was declared on April 24, 1846. The American navy with its force of 350\u2013400 [[U.S. Marines]] and \"bluejacket\" sailors on board several U.S. Naval ships near California were essentially the only significant United States military force on the Pacific Coast in the early months of the Mexican\u2013American War. The [[Royal Navy|British navy]] [[Pacific Station]] ships in the Pacific had more men and were more heavily armed than the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron, but did not have orders to help or hinder the occupation of California. New orders would have taken almost two years to get back to the British ships. The Marines were stationed aboard each [[sailing ship|ship]] to assist in ship-to-ship combat, as snipers in the rigging, and to defend against boarders. They could also be detached for use as armed [[infantry]]. In addition, there were some \"bluejacket\" sailors on each ship that could be detached for shore duty as [[artillery]] crews and infantry, leaving the ship functional though short handed. The artillery used were often small naval [[cannon]] converted to land use. The Pacific Squadron had orders, in the event of war with Mexico, to seize the ports in Mexican California and elsewhere along the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe only other United States military force in California at the time was a small exploratory expedition led by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], made up of 30 topographical, surveying, etc. army troops and about 25 men hired as guides and hunters. The [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont#Third expedition|Fr\u00e9mont expedition]] had been dispatched to California, in 1845, from the [[United States Army]] [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].\n\n[[File:Flag-of-California.jpg|right|thumb|The [[flag of California|California state flag]] flying at [[San Francisco City Hall]]]]\nRumors that the Californio government in California was planning to arrest and deport many of the new residents as they had in 1844 led to a degree of uncertainty. On June 14, 1846, thirty-three settlers in Sonoma Valley took preemptive action and captured the small Californio garrison of [[Sonoma, California]] without firing a shot and raised a homemade flag with a bear and star (the \"[[flag of California|Bear Flag]]\") to symbolize their taking control. The words \"California Republic\" appeared on the flag but were never officially adopted by the insurgents. The present [[Flag of California]] is based on the original \"Bear Flag\".\n\nTheir capture of the small garrison in Sonoma was later called the \"[[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]]\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The men of the California Bear Flag Revolt and their heritage |author=Sonoma Valley Historical Society |year=1996 |publisher=Arthur H. Clark Pub. Co. |isbn=978-0-87062-261-8}}</ref> The Republic's only commander-in-chief was [[William B. Ide]],<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458 William B. Ide Adobe State Historic Park], California State Parks.</ref> whose command lasted 25 days. On June 23, 1846, Fr\u00e9mont arrived from the future state of [[Oregon]]'s border with about 30 soldiers and 30 scouts and hunters and took command of the \"Republic\" in the name of the United States. Fr\u00e9mont began to recruit a militia from among the new settlers living around [[Sutters Fort]] to join with his forces. Many of these settlers had just arrived over the [[California Trail]] and many more would continue to arrive after July 1846 when they got to California. The [[Donner Party]] were the last travelers on the trail in late 1846 when they were caught by early snow while they were trying to get across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]].\n\nUnder orders from [[John D. Sloat]], Commodore of the [[Pacific Squadron]], the [[U.S. Marines]] and some of the bluejacket sailors from the [[U.S. Navy]] [[sailing ship]]s {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}} with the {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} and {{USS|Levant|1837|2}} captured the Alta California capital city of [[Monterey, California]] on July 7, 1846. The only shots fired were salutes by the [[U.S. Navy]] ships in the harbor to the [[U.S. flag]] now flying over Monterey. Two days later on July 9, {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}, under Captain John S. Montgomery, landed 70 Marines and bluejacket sailors at Clark's Point in [[San Francisco Bay]] and captured [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now named [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]]) without firing a shot.\n\nOn July 11 the British Royal Navy sloop {{HMS|Juno|1844|6}} entered San Francisco Bay, causing Montgomery to man his defenses. The large British ship, 2,600 tons with a crew of 600, [[man-of-war]] {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}}, flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, also arrived at about this time outside Monterey Harbor. Both British ships observed, but did not enter the conflict.<ref>Marley, David; ''Wars of the Americas: a chronology of armed conflict in the New World, 1492 to present'' [1998); p. 504</ref>\n\nShortly after July 9, when it became clear the US Navy was taking action, the short-lived [[California Republic|Bear Flag Republic]] was converted into a United States military occupation and the [[Bear Flag]] was replaced by the U.S. flag. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] took over as the senior U.S. military commander in California in late July 1846 and asked Fr\u00e9mont's force of California militia and his 60 men to form the [[California Battalion]] with [[U.S. Army]] pay and ranks with Fremont in command. The California \"Republic\" disbanded and William Ide enlisted in the [[California Battalion]], when it was established in late July 1846, as a private.\n\nThe first job given to the California Battalion and was to assist in the capture of [[San Diego]] and [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]]. On July 26, 1846, Lt. Col. J. C. Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion of about 160 boarded the sloop {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}}, under the command of Captain [[Samuel Francis Du Pont]], and sailed for San Diego. They landed July 29, 1846, and a detachment of Marines and blue-jackets, followed shortly by Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion from ''Cyane'', landed and took possession of the town without firing a shot. Leaving about 40 men to garrison San Diego, Fremont continued on to Los Angeles where on August 13, with the Navy band playing and colors flying, the combined forces of Stockton and Fr\u00e9mont entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, without a man killed nor shot fired. [[U.S. Marine]] Lieutenant [[Archibald Gillespie]], Fr\u00e9mont's second in command, was appointed military commander of Los Angeles with an inadequate force from 30 to 50 California Battalion troops stationed there to keep the peace.\n\nIn [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]], the largest city in California with about 3,000 residents, things might have remained peaceful, except that Major Gillespie placed the town under martial law, greatly angering some of the Californios. On September 23, 1846, about 200 Californios under Californio Gen. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]] staged a revolt, the [[Siege of Los Angeles]], and exchanged shots with the Americans in their quarters at the Government House. Gillespie and his men withdrew from their headquarters in town to Fort Hill which, unfortunately, had no water. Gillespie was caught in a trap, badly outnumbered by the besiegers. John Brown, an American, called by the Californios Juan Flaco,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrgaf.org/journeys/flaco.htm |title=Juan Flaco \u2013 California's Paul Revere |publisher=The Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation |accessdate=March 17, 2009}}</ref> meaning \"Lean John\", succeeded in breaking through the Californio lines and riding by horseback to [[San Francisco Bay]] (a distance of almost {{convert|400|mi|km}}) in an amazing 52 hours where he delivered to Stockton a dispatch from Gillespie notifying him of the situation. Gillespie, on September 30, finally accepted the Californio terms and departed for [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] with his forces, weapons, flags and two cannon (the others were spiked and left behind). Gillespie's men were accompanied by the exchanged American prisoners and several non-Californio residents.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mark J.

The main Californio military force, known as the Californio [[lancer]]s, was disbanded. On January 16, 1847, Commodore Stockton appointed Fr\u00e9mont military governor of U.S. territorial California.\n\nSome Californios fought on both sides of the conflict (U.S. and Mexico). The battlefield memorials attest to the heroic fight and loss on both sides.\n\n=== Californio battles ===\nMost towns in California surrendered without a shot being fired on either side.

She advised him that a generous peace would be to his political advantage.

California Senator [[William M. Gwin]] presented a bill that, when approved by the Senate and the House, became the Act of March 3, 1851.<ref>Robinson, p. 100</ref> It stated that unless grantees presented evidence supporting their title within two years, the property would automatically pass back into the [[public domain]].<ref>House Executive Document 46, pp. 1116\u20131117</ref>\n\nRancho owners cited the articles VIII and X of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], wherein it guaranteed full protection of all property rights for Mexican citizens\u2014with an unspecified time limit.<ref>[http://www.southwestbooks.org/treaty.htm#articleviii Article VIII, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo], Center For Land Grant Studies.</ref><ref>[http://www.southwestbooks.org/treaty.htm#articlex Article X, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo], Center For Land Grant Studies.</ref>\n\nMany ranch owners with their thousands of acres and large herds of cattle, sheep and horses went on to live prosperous lives under U.S. rule. Former commander of the California Lancers [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]] became a U.S. citizen after his return to California and acquired the [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]] ranch which makes up large part of what is present day Los Angeles. He went on to become a California State Assemblyman and later a California State Senator. His brother former governor of [[Alta California]] (under Mexican rule) [[P\u00edo Pico]] also became a U.S. citizen and a prominent ranch owner/businessman in California after the war. Many others were not so fortunate as droughts decimated their herds in the early 1860s and they could not pay back the high cost mortgages (poorly understood by the mostly illiterate ranchers) they had taken out to improve their lifestyle and subsequently lost much or all of their property when they could not be repaid.\n\nCalifornios did not disappear. Some people in the area still have strong identities as Californios. Thousands of people who are descended from the Californios have well-documented genealogies of their families.\n\nMexican activists claim there was an integrated society of Mexicans, Indians, Mestizos and American immigrants, which had evolved over 77 years beginning with the founding of [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Misi\u00f3n San Diego]] in the Alta California territory in 1769.\n\nThe developing agricultural economy of California allowed many Californios to continue living in [[pueblos]] alongside Native peoples and Mexicanos well into the 20th century. These settlements grew into modern California cities, including [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[San Diego]], [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]], [[San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Arvin, California|Arvin]], [[Mariposa, California|Mariposa]], [[Hemet, California|Hemet]] and [[Indio, California|Indio]].\n\nFrom the 1850s until the 1960s, the Hispanics (of Spanish, Mexican and regional Native American origins) lived in relative autonomy. They practiced a degree of social [[racial segregation]] by custom, while maintaining Spanish-language newspapers, entertainment, schools, bars, and clubs. Cultural practices were often tied to local churches and mutual aid societies. At some point in the early 20th century, the official recordkeepers (census takers, city records, etc.) began grouping together all Californios, Mexicanos, and Native (''Indio'') peoples with Spanish surnames under the terms \"Spanish\", \"Mexican\", and sometimes, \"colored\"; some Californios even intermarried with [[Mexican American]]s (those whose ancestors were refugees escaping the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910).\n\nAlexander V.

In early 1849, approximately 6,000 Mexicans, many of whom were Californios who remained after the United States had annexed the territory, were prospecting for gold in the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = American Experience {{!}} The Gold Rush {{!}} People & Events {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_mexicans.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}</ref> Although the territory they were in had up until recently been Mexican land, Californios and other Mexicans very quickly became the minorities and were seen as the foreigners. Once the Gold Rush had truly started in 1849, the campsites were segregated by nationality, further establishing the fact that \"Americans\" had taken the title as the majority ethnicity in Northern California.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because the Californio \"foreigners\" so quickly became a minority, their claims to land protected under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were ignored when miners overran their land and squatted.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Calisphere \u2013 California Cultures \u2013 1848\u20131865: Gold Rush, Statehood, and the Western Movement|url = http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/calcultures/eras/era4.html|website = www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}</ref> Any protests by Californios were quickly put down by hastily formed Euro-American militias, so any legal protection provided by the new California legislature was ineffective when the threat of violence and lynchings loomed.<ref name=\":2\" /> Even if Californios were able to win their land back in court, often lawyer's fees cost large sums of land that left them with a fraction of their former wealth.\n\n==== Working conditions ====\nMany Latino miners were experienced due to learning a \"dry-digging\" technique in the Mexican mining state of [[Sonora]].<ref name=\":1\">Adrianna Thomas, Raymond Arthur Smith, 2009, Latino and Asian Americans in the California Gold Rush, Columbia University Academic Commons,<nowiki>http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8417</nowiki>.</ref> Their early success due praise and respect from [[European Americans|Euro-American]] miners, they eventually became jealous and used threats and violence to force Mexican workers out of their plots and into less lucrative ones.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition to these informal forms of discrimination, Anglo miners also worked to establish [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]-like laws to prevent Latinos from mining altogether.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1851, mob violence as well as the Foreign Miners' Tax discussed below forced between five thousand and fifteen thousand foreigners out of work in just a few months.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to Antonio F. Coronel's accounts, there was systematic race-influenced violence conducted by Americans to force out Californios and other Latinos. One account tells of a Frenchman and \"un espa\u00f1ol\" being lynched for supposed theft in 1848. Despite offers by Californios to replace the reported amount of gold stolen, they were still hanged.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, later in the Gold Rush, Coronel and his group found a rich vein of gold on the American River. When Euro-Americans caught wind of this, the invaded the claim armed and insisted it was their plot, forcing out Colonel and ending his mining career.<ref name=\":0\" /> Accounts like these show the harsh and violent living and working conditions that Californios were faced with during the Gold Rush. Discriminatory and racist treatment and laws as well as being so vastly outnumbered forced them out of their native lands despite assurances by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that they could remain.\n\n==== Foreign Miners' Tax ====\nIn response to the Mexican resistance to the American population, white miners called for something to be done about the \"Sonoran\" miner \"problem\". In response, in 1850, the Californian government introduced a tax on foreign miners who were working plots, called the Foreign Miners' Tax Law. The claimed purpose of the tax was to fund the government's efforts to protect the foreign workers. There are conflicting reports on the amount of the tax ranging from $20 to $30 per month.<ref name=\":0\" /> This extremely high tax forced all but the most successful Latinos to stop mining as they were unable to obtain enough gold to make mining profitable. This left only the most successful of the Mexican prospectors, who ironically were the ones who drew the most ire from the Euro-American miners initially. By 1851, when the tax law was repealed, approximately two-thirds of the Latinos and Californios that had been living and working in mining areas had been driven out by the tax.<ref>Mora, Anthony. \"Introduction to Latino Studies\". Tisch Hall, Ann Arbor. 9-28-2015. Lecture.</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2016|reason=If there is a recording or transcript of the lecture, a link is required; otherwise it doesn't really exist at all}} After repealing the $20 or $30 per month tax, the California legislature instituted a much more reasonable $3 per month tax in 1852.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, at this point, many of the Californios had already been driven out of their homes and mining plots, making it somewhat of a moot point. These taxes were for the most part only enforced against Latinos, including Californios, and the Chinese, but not any other foreign, but white Europeans, showing systematic racism on the part of the newly formed California Legislature.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group    = Californios\n|image    ={{image array|perrow=3|width=100|height=150\n| image1 = Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (cropped).jpg| caption1 = [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]\n| image2 = Juan Bandini portrait4x3.jpg| caption2 = [[Juan Bandini]]\n| image3 = Andres Pico.jpg| caption3 = [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]]\n| image4 = Romualdo Pacheco - Brady-Handy.jpg| caption4 = [[Romualdo Pacheco]]\n| image5 =Eulalia Perez (1765-1878).jpg |caption5 = [[Eulalia P\u00e9rez de Guill\u00e9n Marin\u00e9]]\n| image6 = Portret Antonio Coronela.jpg | caption6=[[Antonio F.

''The Squatter and the Don'' (2nd ed.). Houston: Arte Publico Press</ref> The novel was based on the legal struggles of General [[Mariano G. Vallejo]], a friend of the author. The novel depicts the legal process by which Californios were often \"relieved\" of their land. This process was long (most Californios spent up to 15 years defending their grants before the courts), and the legal fees were enough to make many Californios landless. Californios resented having to pay land taxes to United States officials, because the principle of paying taxes for land ownership did not exist in Mexican law. In some cases Californios had little available capital, because their economy had operated on a barter system; they often lost land because of the inability to pay the taxes.<ref>Pitt, ''Decline of the Californios'', pp. 83\u2013102</ref> They could not compete economically with the European and Anglo-American immigrants who arrived in the region with large amounts of cash.\n\nA portrayal of Californio culture is depicted in the novel ''[[Ramona]]'' (1884), written by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]].\n\nThe fictional character of [[Zorro]] has become the most identifiable Californio due to [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[film|motion pictures]] and the 1950s television series.

The costs of the minimum Alta California government were mainly paid by means of a roughly 40\u2013100% import tariff collected at the entry port of [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Monterey]].\n\nThe other center of Spanish power in Alta California was the [[Franciscan]] friars who, as heads of the 21 missions, often resisted the powers of the governors.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia mexican\">Werner, Michael S., Editor; ''Concise Encyclopedia of Mexico''; ''Women's Status and Occupation\". pp. 886\u2013898; Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers; {{ISBN|1-57958-337-7}}</ref> None of the Franciscan friars were Californios, however, and their influence rapidly waned after the secularization of the missions in the 1830s.\n[[File:Lone Star of California.jpeg|250px|thumbnail|The [[Flag of California|Red Lone Star Flag of California]] was a symbol of the Californio Revolt of 1836, led by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]].]]\nThe instability of the Mexican government (especially in its early years), Alta California's geographic isolation, the growing ability of the Alta California's inhabitants to generally make a success of immigrating and an increase in the Californio population created a schism with the national government. As Spanish and Mexican period immigrants were succeeded in number by those that increasing lost an affinity with the national government, an environment developed that did not suppress disagreement with the central government. Governors had little material support from far-away Mexico to deal with Alta Californians, who were left to resolve situations themselves. Mexico-born governor [[Manuel Victoria]] was forced to flee in 1831, after losing a fight against a local uprising at the [[Battle of Cahuenga Pass]].\n\nAs Californios matured to adulthood and increasingly assumed positions of power in the Alta California government (including that of governor), rivalries emerged between northern and southern regions. Several times, Californio leaders attempted to break away from Mexico, most notably [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] in 1836. Southern regional leaders, led by [[Pio Pico]], made several attempts to relocate the capital from Monterey to the more populated [[Pueblo of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]].<ref>Howard Lamar, editor.

Alvarado recruited a company of Tennessean riflemen, many of them former trappers who had settled in the Monterey Bay area. The company was led by another American, [[Isaac Graham]]. When the Americans refused to fight against fellow Americans, Alvarado was forced to negotiate a settlement.\n\n=== Ethnic variety ===\nCalifornios included the descendants of agricultural settlers and retired escort soldiers deployed from what is modern-day Mexico. Most were of mixed ethnicities, usually ''[[Mestizo]]'' (Spanish and Native American) or mixed African and Amerindian backgrounds. Despite the depictions of the popular shows like ''[[Zorro]]'', few ''Californios'' were of \"pure\" Spanish ([[Peninsulares|Peninsular]] or [[Criollo people|Criollo]]) ancestry.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Intimate Frontiers: Sex, Gender, and Culture in Old California|last = Hurtado|first = Albert L.|publisher = University of New Mexico Press|year = 2016|isbn = 978-0-8263-5646-8|location = New Mexico |chapter=Introduction:The Intimate Challenges of a Multicultural Frontier  |pages = |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSe9DAAAQBAJ&q=%27most+of+the+first+pobladores+%28settlers%29+were+born+in+Mexico+of+mixed+parentage%27+%22most+californios+were+of+mixed+origin%22#v=snippet&q='most%20of%20the%20first%20pobladores%20(settlers)%20were%20born%20in%20Mexico%20of%20mixed%20parentage'%20%22most%20californios%20were%20of%20mixed%20origin%22&f=false}}</ref> Most with unmixed [[Spanish people|Spanish]] ancestry were [[Franciscan]] priests, along with career government officials and military officers who did not remain in California.<ref>Mason, ''The Census of 1790''; Gostin, ''Southern California Vital Records''; Haas, ''Conquests and Historical Identities in California''; and {{cite book|author=Leonard Pitt|title=The Decline of the Californios: A Social History of the Spanish-speaking Californians, 1846\u20131890|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rT6cs89EmGgC|year=1970|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-01637-8}}; and [http://www.sfgenealogy.org/spanish/calfam.htm California Spanish Genealogy \u2013 California Census 1790].</ref>\n\nAccording to mission records (marriage, baptisms, and burials) as well as Presidio roster listings, several \"leather-jacket\" soldiers (''soldados de cuero'') operating as escorts, mission guards, and other military duty personnel were described as ''europeo'' (i.e., born in Europe), while most of the civilian settlers were of mixed origins (coyote, mulatto, etc.). The term ''mestizo'' was rarely if ever used in mission records, the more common terms being ''indio'', ''europeo'', ''mulato'', ''coyote'', ''castizo'' and other caste terms. An example of the number of European-born soldiers is the twenty-five from Lieutenant [[Pedro Fages]] detachment of [[Free Company of Volunteers of Catalonia|Catalan Volunteers]]. Most of the soldiers on the [[Portola expedition|Portola-Serra expedition]] of 1769 and the [[Juan Bautista de Anza|de Anza]] expeditions of 1774 and 1775 were recruited from the Spanish Army infantry regiments then stationed in Mexico. Many of them were assigned to garrison the presidios, then retired at the end of their ten-year enlistments, and remaining in California. Because there were many more men than women among the Spanish soldiers and settlers, some men who stayed in California married native Californian women who had converted to Christianity at the missions.\n\n=== Family and education ===\nThe family was characteristically patriarchal, with the son regardless of age, deferring to his father's wishes.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> Women had full rights of property ownership and control unless she was married or had a father\u2014the males had almost complete control of all family members.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia mexican\" /> A formal education system in California had yet to be created so it fell to the individual families to educate their children among them, traditionally done by the priests or hired private tutors; few early immigrants knew how to read or write, so only a few hundred inhabitants could.<ref name=\"California Conquered\">Harrow, Neal; ''California Conquered: The Annexation of a Mexican Province, 1846\u20131850''; pp. 14\u201330; University of California Press; 1989; {{ISBN|978-0-520-06605-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Women in Californio society ===\nThe social life of Californio society was extremely important in both politics and business, and women played an important part in these interactions. They helped facilitate these interactions for their husbands, and therefore themselves, to move up in the social and power rankings of Californio society. This ability to shape social situations was a sought after trait when looking for a spouse, as prominent men knew the power their new wife would have in their future dealings<ref name=\"Sanchez\">{{Cite book|title = Telling Identities: The Californio testimonios|last = S\u00e1nchez|first = Rosaura|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1995|isbn = 0-8166-2559-X|location = |pages = [https://archive.org/details/tellingidentitie0000sanc/page/210 210\u2013220]|url = https://archive.org/details/tellingidentitie0000sanc/page/210}}</ref>\n\nIn movies and television, women from this era are often heavily romanticized and  commonly characterized by their beauty and fun loving nature, while also being very sheltered and protected.<ref>Langum, David J. \"Californio Women and the Image of Virtue\". ''Southern California Quarterly'' 59.3 (1977): 245\u2013250.</ref>  \n\nAs women played a key role in the development of Alta California and its social interactions they continued this role into its transition from a Mexican territory to an American possession. As foreign non-Spanish speaking men moved into California, who wished to insert themselves into the upper echelons of already established social hierarchy, they began to use marriage with the women of established Californio families as a way to join this hierarchy.<ref name=\"Sanchez\" /> Intermarriages between Californios and foreigners was common during the time of Mexican rule and quickly became even more common after the American annexation and [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush in California]]. These intermarriages worked to combine the cultures of American settlers and merchants with that of the declining Californio society. These marriages though were not enough to prevent the descent into irrelevance of Californio power in California or the racism and attacks on the people of Mexican heritage later.\n\n=== Repopulation ===\nThe [[New Spain|Spanish colonial]] government, and later, [[History of Mexico|Mexican]] officials encouraged through recruitment civilians from the northern and western provinces of Mexico such as [[Sonora]]. This was not well received by Californios, and was one of the factors leading to revolt against Mexican rule. Sonorans came to California despite the area's isolation and the lack of central government support. Many of the soldier's wives considered California to be a cultural wasteland and a hardship assignment. An incentive for the soldiers that remained in California after service was the opportunity to receive a land grant that probably was not possible elsewhere. This made most of California's early settlers military retirees with a few civilian settlers from Mexico. Since it was a frontier society, the initial rancho housing was characterized as ''rude and crude''\u2014little more than mud huts with thatched roofs. As the rancho owners prospered these residences could be upgraded to more substantial [[adobe]] structures with tiled roofs. Some buildings took advantage of local tar pits (La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles) in an attempt to waterproof roofs. Restoration of these Today, often suffer from a perception that results in a grander representation than if they had been constructed during the Californio period.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\">Hoffman, Lola B.; ''California Beginnings''; California State Department of Education; 1848; p. 151</ref>\n\n=== The concession of land ===\nBefore Mexican independence in 1821, 20 \"Spanish\" land grants had been issued (at little or no cost) in all of [[Alta California]];<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> many to \"a few friends and family of the Alta California governors\". The 1824 Mexican [[General Colonization Law]] established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Catholic Franciscan missions and possibly entice increased Mexican settlement. When the missions were secularized in 1834\u20131836 mission property and livestock were supposed to be mostly allocated to the [[Mission Indians]].<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" /> Historical research shows that the majority of rancho grants were given to retired non-commissioned soldiers. The largest grants to Nieto, Sepulveda, Dominguez, Yorba, Avila, Grijalva, and other founding families were examples of this practice.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" />\n\nMany of the foreign residents also became rancho grantees. Some were \"Californios by marriage\" like Stearns (who was naturalized in Mexico before moving north) and the Englishman [[William Edward Petty Hartnell|William Hartnell]]. Others married Californios but never became Mexican citizens. Rancho ownership was possible for these men because, under Spanish/Mexican law, married women could independently hold title to property. In the [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz]] area, three Californio daughters of the ''inv\u00e1lido'' Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Castro (1768\u20131838) married foreigners yet still received grants to [[Rancho Soquel]], [[Rancho San Agustin]] and [[Rancho Refugio]].\n\n=== Ranchos ===\nIn practice nearly all mission property and livestock became about 455 large [[Ranchos of California]] granted by the Californio authorities. The Californio rancho owners claimed about {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}} averaging about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each. This land was nearly all originally mission land within about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast. The Mexican-era land grants by law were provisional for five years in order for the terms of the law to reasonably be fulfilled. The boundaries of these ranchos were not established as they came to be in later times predominately based on what could be understood as figurative boundaries. They were based on just where another granted owner considered the end of their land, lands or vegetation landmarks.<ref>Walton Bean, ''California: An Interpretive History'', Second Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 152.</ref> Conflict was bound to occur when these land grants were reviewed under United States control. Title to some grants under United States control were rejected<ref>Howard Lamar, editor. ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West'', (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 633.</ref> based on questionable documents especially when with predated documents, that could have been created post-United States occupancy in January 1847.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" /><ref>Walton Bean, ''California: An Interpretive History'', Second Ed., McGraw-Hill Book Company, New York, p. 159.</ref>\n\n=== Rancho culture ===\nAfter agriculture, cattle, sheep and horses were established by the [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]], [[Friar]]s, soldiers and [[Mission Indians]], the [[List of Ranchos of California|Rancho]] owners dismissed the Friars and the soldiers and took over the Mission land and livestock starting in 1834\u2014the [[Mission Indians]] were left to survive however they could. The rancho owners tried to live in a grand style they perceived of the wealthy [[Hidalgo (Spanish nobility)|hidalgos]] in [[History of Spain|Spain]]. They expected the non-rancho owning population to support this lifestyle.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> Nearly all males rode to where ever they were going at nearly all times making them excellent riders. They indulged in many [[Festival|fiestas]], [[fandango]]s, [[rodeo]]s and [[Muster (livestock)|roundups]] as the rancho owners often went from rancho to rancho on a large horse bound party circuit. Weddings, christenings, and funerals were all \"celebrated\" with large gatherings.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" />\n\n=== Taxes ===\nSince the government depended on import [[tariff]]s (also called Custom duties and ad-valorem taxes) for its income there was virtually no property tax. Under Spanish/Mexican rule, all landowners were expected to the [[Diezmo]], a compulsory [[tithe]] to the Catholic Church of one tenth of the fruits of agriculture and animal husbandry, business profits or salaries. [[Spanish missions of California|Priest salaries and mission expenses]] were paid out of this money and/or collected goods.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" />\n\nThe mandatory Diezmo ended with the secularization of the missions, greatly reducing rancho taxes until the U.S. takeover. Today's state property tax system makes large self-supporting cattle ranches uneconomical in most cases.\n\n=== Frequency of use of horses ===\nHorses were plentiful and often left, after being broken in, to wander around with a rope around their neck for easy capture. It was not unusual for a rider to use one horse until it was exhausted, before switching its bridle to another horse\u2014letting the first horse free to wander. Horse ownership for all except a few exceptional animals were almost community property. Horses were so common and of so little use that they were often destroyed to keep them from eating the grass needed by the cattle. California Indians later developed a taste for horse flesh as food and helped keep the number of horses under control.<ref name=\"California Beginnings\" /> An unusual use for horses was found in [[Chaff|shucking]] wheat or barley. The wheat and its stems were cut from the gain fields by Indians bearing [[sickle]]s. The grain with its stems still attached was transported to the harvesting area by solid wheeled ox-cart<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Transport and Travel |publisher=History World |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab79 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> (about the only wheeled transport in California) and put into a circular packed earth corral. A herd of horses were then driven into the same corral or \"threshing field\". By keeping the horses moving around the corral their hoofs would, in time, separate the [[wheat]] or [[barley]] from the [[chaff]]. Later the horses would be allowed to escape and the wheat and [[chaff]] were collected and then separated by tossing it into the air on a windy day so as to let the wind carry the [[chaff]] away. Presumably the wheat was washed before use to remove some of the dirt.<ref>Hoffman, Lola B.; ''California Beginnings''; California State Department of Education; 1948; p. 195</ref>\n\n=== The Indian work force ===\nFor these very few [[List of Ranchos of California|rancho]] owners and their families, this was the Californio's Golden Age, although for all the others much different.<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> Much of the agriculture, vineyards and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining mission Indian population went from over 80,000 in 1800 to only a few thousand by 1846. Fewer Indians meant less food was required and the [[Franciscan]] Friars and soldiers supporting the missions disappeared after 1834 when the missions were abolished (secularized). After the Friars and soldiers disappeared, many of the Indians deserted the missions and returned to their tribes or found work elsewhere. The new ranchos often gave work to some of the former mission Indians. The \"Savage tribes\" worked for room, board and clothing (and no pay).<ref>{{cite book |author=Eric Foner |title=Give Me Liberty!

The exceptions were the cattle and horses growing wild on unfenced range land. Originally owned by the missions they were killed for their hides and tallow.<ref name=\"San Francisco History\">{{cite web |title=Seventy-five Years in San Francisco: Appendix N.

This stiff leather jacket was sufficient to stop most Indian arrows and worked well when fighting the Indians. Beef was a common constituent of most Californio meals and since it couldn't be kept long in the days before refrigeration, beef was often slaughtered to get a few [[steak]]s or cuts of meat. The property and yards around the ranchos were marked by the large number of dead cow heads, horns or other animal parts. Cow hides were kept later for trading purposes with Yankee or British traders who started showing up once or twice a year after 1825.<ref>Howard Lamar, editor. ''The Reader's Encyclopedia of the American West'', (1977). Harper & Row, New York, p. 149.</ref> Beef, [[wheat]] bread products, [[corn]] (maize), several types of [[bean]]s, [[peas]] and several types of [[Squash (plant)|squash]] were common meal items with [[wine]] and [[olive oil]] used when they could be found. The [[mestizo]] population probably subsisted mostly on what they were used to: corn or maize, beans, and squash with some beef donated by the rancho owners. What the average [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] ate is unknown since they were in transition from a [[hunter gatherer]] society to agriculturalists. Formerly, many lived at least part of the year on ground acorns, fish, seeds, wild game, etc. It is known that many of the ranchers complained about Indians stealing their cattle and horses to eat.<ref name=\"San Francisco History\" />\n\n=== Trade ===\nFrom about 1769 to 1824 California averaged about 2.5 [[sailing ship|ships]] per year with 13 years showing no ships coming to California. These ships brought a few new settlers and supplies for the pueblos and Missions. Under the [[New Spain|Spanish colonial]] government rules, trade was actively discouraged with non-Spanish ships. The few non-Indian people living in California had almost nothing to trade\u2014the missions and pueblos were subsidized by the Spanish government. The occasional Spanish ships that did show up were usually requested by Californios and had Royal permission to go to California\u2014bureaucracy in action. Prior to 1824, when the newly independent [[History of Mexico|Mexico]] liberalized the trade rules<ref name=\"Howard Lamar 1977 p. 154\" /> and allowed trade with non-Mexican ships, the occasional trading ship or U.S. [[Whaling in the United States|whaler]] that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh meat and [[vegetable]]s became more common. The average number of ships from 1825 to 1845 jumped to twenty-five ships per year versus the 2.5 ships per year common for the prior fifty years.<ref name=\"San Francisco History\" />\n\nThe [[Ranchos of California|rancho]] society had few resources except large herds of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn cattle]] which grew well in California. The ranchos produced the largest [[cowhide]] (called California Greenbacks) and [[tallow]] business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off the fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s that were common in California. With something to trade, and needing everything from nails, needles and almost anything made of metal to fancy thread and cloth that could be [[sew]]n into fancy cloaks or ladies' dresses, etc., they started trading with merchant ships from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], Britain and other trading ports in Europe and the [[East Coast of the United States]]. The trip from [[History of Boston|Boston]], [[History of New York City (1784\u20131854)|New York City]] or [[Liverpool]] England averaged over 200 days one way. Trading ships and the occasional whaler put into [[San Diego]], [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]], [[Ventura, California|San Buenaventura]] (Ventura), [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (San Francisco) after stopping and paying the [[import tariff]] of 50\u2013100% at the entry port of Monterey, California. These tariffs or custom fees paid for the Alta California government. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (originally published 1840) by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] gives a good first-hand account of a two-year [[sailing ship]] [[sea]] trading voyage to Alta California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California longhorn]] horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items during this period. \n\nCalifornia was not alone in using the import duty to pay for its government as the [[Tariffs in United States history|U.S. import tariffs]] at this time were also the way the United States paid for most of its Federal Government. A U.S. average tariff (also called custom duties and [[ad valorem tax]]es) of about 25% raised about 89% of all Federal income in 1850.<ref>Federal Income 1850 [http://www.usgovernmentrevenue.com/#usgs302a Federal State Local Government Revenue in United States 2011 \u2013 Charts Tables] Accessed April 2, 2011</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early colonization ===\nIn 1769, [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] and less than two hundred men, on expedition founded the [[Presidio of San Diego]] (military post).

Monterey was settled with two friars and about 40 men and served as the capital of California from 1777 to 1849. The nearby [[Carmel Mission]], in [[Carmel, California]] was moved there after a year in Monterey to keep the [[Spanish missions of California|mission]] and its [[Mission Indians]] away from the [[Presidio of Monterey, California|Monterey Presidio]] soldiers. It was the headquarters of the original Alta California province missions headed by Father-President Jun\u00edpero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784\u2014he is buried there. Monterey was originally the only port of entry for all taxable goods in California. All ships were supposed to clear through Monterey and pay the roughly 42% [[tariff]] (customs duties on imported goods before trading anywhere else in Alta California. The oldest governmental building in the state is the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Monterey Custom House]] and California's Historic Landmark Number One.<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=954 California State Parks: Custom House]</ref> [[The Californian (1840s newspaper)|The ''Californian'']], California's oldest newspaper, was first published in Monterey on August 15, 1846, after the city's occupation by the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]] on July 7, 1846.<ref>Library of Congress.

Anza led 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They started out with 695 horses and mules and 385 [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] bulls and cows\u2014starting the cattle and horse industry in California. About 600 horses and mules and 300 cattle survived the trip. In 1776 about 200 leather-jacketed soldiers, Friars, and colonists with their families moved to what was called [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now San Francisco) to start building a mission and a presidio there. The leather jackets the soldiers wore consisted of several layers of hardened leather and were strong enough body [[armor]] to usually stop an Indian arrow. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years and essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals\u2014doubling roughly every two years. They partially displaced the [[Tule Elk]] and [[pronghorn]] antelope who had lived there in large herds previously.\n\nAnza selected the sites of the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] in what is now San Francisco; on his way back to Monterey, he sited [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds]] and the pueblo [[History of San Jose, California|San Jose]] in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] but did not initially leave settlers to settle them. [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (or Mission Dolores), the sixth Spanish mission, was founded on June 29, 1776, by Lieutenant [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquin Moraga]] and Father [[Francisco Pal\u00f3u]] (a companion of Jun\u00edpero Serra).\n\nOn November 29, 1777, [[History of San Jose, California|El Pueblo de San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe]] (The Town of [[Saint Joseph]] of Guadalupe now called simply San Jose) was founded by [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Moraga]] on the first ''[[pueblo]]''-town not associated with a [[Spanish Missions of California|mission]] or a military post (''presidio'') in Alta California. The original San Jose settlers were part of the original group of 200 settlers and soldiers that had originally settled in Yerba Buena (San Francisco). [[Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds|Mission Santa Clara]], founded in 1777, was the eighth mission founded and closest mission to San Jose. Mission Santa Clara was {{convert|3|mi|sigfig=1}} from the original San Jose pueblo site in neighboring [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jos\u00e9]] was not founded until 1797, about {{convert|20|mi|sigfig=1}} north of San Jose in what is now [[Fremont, California|Fremont]].\n\nThe [[Los Angeles Pobladores]] (\"villagers\") is the name given to the 44 original Sonorans\u201422 adults and 22 children\u2014who settled the Pueblo of [[History of Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in 1781. The ''pobladores'' were agricultural families from [[Sonora]], Mexico. They were the last settlers to use the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|Anza trail]] as the [[Quechan]]s (Yumas) closed the trail for the next 40 years shortly after they had passed over it. Almost none of the settlers were ''espa\u00f1oles'' (Spanish); the rest had ''[[casta]]'' (caste) designations such as ''[[mestizo]]'', ''indio'', and ''negro''. Some classifications were changed in the California Census of 1790, as often happened in colonial Spanish America.<ref>[http://www.sfgenealogy.org/spanish/calfam.htm \"The Census of 1790, California\"], California Spanish Genealogy. Retrieved on 2008-08-04. Compiled from William Marvin Mason, ''The Census of 1790: A Demographic History of California'', Menlo Park: Ballena Press, 1998, pp. 75\u2013105. Information in parentheses () is from church records.</ref>\n\nThe settlers and escort soldiers who founded the towns of [[History of San Jose, California|San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe]], Yerba Buena (San Francisco), Monterey, San Diego and [[Pueblo de Los Angeles|La Reina de Los \u00c1ngeles]] were primarily mestizo and of mixed [[Negro]] and Indian ancestry from the province of [[Sonora y Sinaloa]] in Mexico. Recruiters in Mexico of the [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]] expedition and other expeditions later, who were charged with founding an agricultural community in Alta California, had a difficult time persuading people to emigrate to such an isolated outpost with no agriculture, no towns, no stores or developments of almost any kind. The majority of settlers were recruited from the northwestern parts of Mexico. The only tentative link with Mexico was via ship after the Quechans (Yumas) closed the [[Colorado River]]'s [[Yuma Crossing]] in 1781. For the next 40 years, an average of only 2.5 ships per year visited California with 13 years showing no recorded ships arriving.\n\nIn Californio society, ''casta'' ([[caste]]) designations carried more weight than they did in older communities of central Mexico. One similar concept was the ''[[gente de raz\u00f3n]]'', a term literally meaning \"people of reason\". It designated peoples who were culturally Hispanic (that is, they were not living in traditional Indian communities) and had adopted [[Christianity]]. This served to distinguish the Mexican ''Indio'' settlers and converted Californian ''Indios'' from the ''barbaro'' (barbarian) Californian Indians, who had not converted or become part of the Hispanic towns.<ref>Rios-Bustamante, Antonio. ''Mexican Los \u00c1ngeles'', 43.</ref> California's Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] was criticized for his alleged descent from mestizo and ''mulato'' ([[mulatto]]) settlers.\n\n=== The end of Mexican rule ===\nIn the 1830s the newly formed Mexican government was experiencing difficulties having gone through several revolts, wars, and internal conflicts and a seemingly never ending string of Mexican [[List of heads of state of Mexico|Presidents]]. One of the problems in Mexico was the large amount of land controlled by the [[Catholic Church]] (estimated then at about one-third of all settled property) who were continually granted property by many land owners when they died or controlled property supposedly held in trust for the Indians. This land, as it gradually accumulated, was seldom sold as it cost nothing to keep, but could be rented out to gain additional income for the Catholic Church to pay its [[priest]]s, [[Friar]]s, Bishops etc. and other expenses. The [[Catholic Church]] was the largest and richest land owner in Mexico and its provinces. In California the situation was even more pronounced as the [[Franciscan]] Friars held over 90% of all settled property supposedly in trust for the [[Mission Indians]].\n\nIn 1834 secularization laws <ref>[http://www.mchsmuseum.com/secularization.html secularization laws] accessed July 7, 2011</ref> were enacted that voided the mission control of lands in the northern settlements under Mexican rule. The missions controlled over 90% of the settled land in California as well as directing thousands of Indians in herding livestock, growing crops and orchards, weaving cloth, etc. for the missions and the [[presidio]]s and pueblo (town) dwellers. The mission lands and herds formerly controlled by the [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] were usually distributed to the settlers around each mission. Since most had almost no money the land was distributed or granted free or at very little cost to friends and families (or those who paid the highest bribes) of the government officials.\n\nThe Californio [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]], for example, was reputed to be the richest man in California before the [[California Gold Rush]]. Vallejo oversaw the secularization of [[Mission San Francisco Solano]] and the distributions of its roughly {{convert|1000000|acres|km2}}. He founded the towns of [[Sonoma, California]] and [[Petaluma, California]], owned [[Mare Island]] and the future town site of [[Benicia, California]] and was granted the {{convert|66622|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Petaluma]], the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] and other properties by Governor [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa]] in 1834 and later. Vallejo's younger brother, Jose Manuel Salvador Vallejo (1813\u20131876), was granted the {{convert|22718|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Napa]] and other additional grants known as Salvador's Ranch.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hoover |first=Mildred B. |authorlink= |author2=Hero Rensch |author3=Ethel Rensch |author4=William N. Abeloe |title=Historic Spots in California |year=1966 |publisher=Stanford University Press |quote= |url=https://archive.org/details/historicspotsinc0000unse |isbn=978-0-8047-4482-9 |url-access=registration }}</ref> Over the hills of Mariano Vallejo's princely estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to six thousand horses, and many thousands of sheep. He occupied a baronial castle on the plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with most royal hospitality and few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had a great ranch house called La Hacienda and on his home farm called Lachryma Montis (Tear of the Mountain), he built, about 1849, a modern frame house where he spent the later years of his life.\n\nVallejo tried to get the California State Capital moved permanently to [[Benicia, California]] on land he sold to the state government in December 1851. It was named Benicia for the General's wife, Francisca Benicia Carillo de Vallejo. The General intended that the prospective city be named \"Francisca\" after his wife, but this name was dropped when the former city of \"[[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]]\" changed its name to \"San Francisco\" on January 30, 1847. Benicia was the third site selected to serve as the California state capital, and its newly constructed city hall was California's capitol from February 11, 1853 to February 25, 1854. Vallejo gave the {{convert|84000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Suscol]] to his oldest daughter, Epifania Guadalupe Vallejo, April 3, 1851, as a wedding present, when she married U.S. Army General John H. Frisbie. It is unknown what he gave as a wedding present when his two daughters Natalia and Jovita married the brothers [[Attila Haraszthy]] and [[Agoston Haraszthy]] on the same day\u2014June 1, 1863.\n\nIn some cases particular mission land and livestock were split into parcels and then distributed by drawing lots. In nearly all cases the Indians got very little of the mission land or livestock. Whether any of the proceeds of these sales made its way back to Mexico City is unknown. These lands had been worked by settlers and the much larger settlements of local Native American [[Kumeyaay]] peoples on the [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] for in some cases several generations. When the missions were secularized or dismantled and the Indians did not have to live under continued Friar and military control they were left essentially to survive on their own. Many of the Native Americans reverted to their former tribal existence and left the missions while others found they could get room and board and some clothing by working for the large ranches that took over the former mission lands and livestock. Many natives who had learned to ride horses and had a smattering of Spanish were recruited to be become [[vaquero]]s ([[cowboy]]s or cattle herders) that worked the cattle and horses on the large [[List of Ranchos of California|ranchos]] and did other work. Some of these rancho owners and their hired hands would make up the bulk of the few hundred Californios fighting in the brief Mexican\u2013American War conflicts in California. Some of the Californios and [[Indigenous peoples of California|California Indians]] would fight on the side of the U.S. settlers during the conflict with some even joining the [[California Battalion]].\n\n=== Mexican Governors of California ===\nThe Californios had a succession of Mexican appointed governors who nearly all either died in office or were driven from office. Many of governors appointed by Mexico proved to be mediocre, autocratic and indifferent to Californio concerns or needs and were driven from office. The native Californio governors were usually self-appointed and acted as governor ''pro tempore'' until Mexico heard about the previous Governor's death or ouster and they could appoint a new governor or approve the existing governor\u2014often a slow process. The Californios had such poor luck with Mexican troops (often unpaid convicts) and Mexican appointed governors that many resented Mexican interference in what they considered their internal affairs.\n* List of Governors\n* 1822\u20131825: [[Luis Antonio Arg\u00fcello]], born in San Francisco; the first native\u2013born Californio to govern Alta California\n* 1825\u20131831: [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda]], Mexico appointed; first of two terms\n* 1831\u20131832: [[Manuel Victoria]], Mexico appointed; forced from office after one year\n* 1832: [[P\u00edo Pico]], native-born Californio, native of San Diego and favored British acquisition of California; moved capital from Monterey to Los Angeles\n* 1832\u20131833: [[Agust\u00edn V.

[[P\u00edo Pico]], a Californio, was the governor of California during the conflict.\n\n[[File:USS Cyane.jpg|right|thumb|{{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} taking San Diego 1846]]\n\nThe [[Pacific Squadron]], the United States Naval force stationed in the Pacific was instrumental in the capture of [[Alta California]] after war was declared on April 24, 1846. The American navy with its force of 350\u2013400 [[U.S. Marines]] and \"bluejacket\" sailors on board several U.S. Naval ships near California were essentially the only significant United States military force on the Pacific Coast in the early months of the Mexican\u2013American War. The [[Royal Navy|British navy]] [[Pacific Station]] ships in the Pacific had more men and were more heavily armed than the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron, but did not have orders to help or hinder the occupation of California. New orders would have taken almost two years to get back to the British ships. The Marines were stationed aboard each [[sailing ship|ship]] to assist in ship-to-ship combat, as snipers in the rigging, and to defend against boarders. They could also be detached for use as armed [[infantry]]. In addition, there were some \"bluejacket\" sailors on each ship that could be detached for shore duty as [[artillery]] crews and infantry, leaving the ship functional though short handed. The artillery used were often small naval [[cannon]] converted to land use. The Pacific Squadron had orders, in the event of war with Mexico, to seize the ports in Mexican California and elsewhere along the Pacific Coast.\n\nThe only other United States military force in California at the time was a small exploratory expedition led by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]], made up of 30 topographical, surveying, etc. army troops and about 25 men hired as guides and hunters. The [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont#Third expedition|Fr\u00e9mont expedition]] had been dispatched to California, in 1845, from the [[United States Army]] [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]].\n\n[[File:Flag-of-California.jpg|right|thumb|The [[flag of California|California state flag]] flying at [[San Francisco City Hall]]]]\nRumors that the Californio government in California was planning to arrest and deport many of the new residents as they had in 1844 led to a degree of uncertainty. On June 14, 1846, thirty-three settlers in Sonoma Valley took preemptive action and captured the small Californio garrison of [[Sonoma, California]] without firing a shot and raised a homemade flag with a bear and star (the \"[[flag of California|Bear Flag]]\") to symbolize their taking control. The words \"California Republic\" appeared on the flag but were never officially adopted by the insurgents. The present [[Flag of California]] is based on the original \"Bear Flag\".\n\nTheir capture of the small garrison in Sonoma was later called the \"[[California Republic|Bear Flag Revolt]]\".<ref>{{cite book |title=The men of the California Bear Flag Revolt and their heritage |author=Sonoma Valley Historical Society |year=1996 |publisher=Arthur H. Clark Pub. Co. |isbn=978-0-87062-261-8}}</ref> The Republic's only commander-in-chief was [[William B. Ide]],<ref>[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=458 William B. Ide Adobe State Historic Park], California State Parks.</ref> whose command lasted 25 days. On June 23, 1846, Fr\u00e9mont arrived from the future state of [[Oregon]]'s border with about 30 soldiers and 30 scouts and hunters and took command of the \"Republic\" in the name of the United States. Fr\u00e9mont began to recruit a militia from among the new settlers living around [[Sutters Fort]] to join with his forces. Many of these settlers had just arrived over the [[California Trail]] and many more would continue to arrive after July 1846 when they got to California. The [[Donner Party]] were the last travelers on the trail in late 1846 when they were caught by early snow while they were trying to get across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]].\n\nUnder orders from [[John D. Sloat]], Commodore of the [[Pacific Squadron]], the [[U.S. Marines]] and some of the bluejacket sailors from the [[U.S. Navy]] [[sailing ship]]s {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}} with the {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} and {{USS|Levant|1837|2}} captured the Alta California capital city of [[Monterey, California]] on July 7, 1846. The only shots fired were salutes by the [[U.S. Navy]] ships in the harbor to the [[U.S. flag]] now flying over Monterey. Two days later on July 9, {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}, under Captain John S. Montgomery, landed 70 Marines and bluejacket sailors at Clark's Point in [[San Francisco Bay]] and captured [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (now named [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]]) without firing a shot.\n\nOn July 11 the British Royal Navy sloop {{HMS|Juno|1844|6}} entered San Francisco Bay, causing Montgomery to man his defenses. The large British ship, 2,600 tons with a crew of 600, [[man-of-war]] {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}}, flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, also arrived at about this time outside Monterey Harbor. Both British ships observed, but did not enter the conflict.<ref>Marley, David; ''Wars of the Americas: a chronology of armed conflict in the New World, 1492 to present'' [1998); p. 504</ref>\n\nShortly after July 9, when it became clear the US Navy was taking action, the short-lived [[California Republic|Bear Flag Republic]] was converted into a United States military occupation and the [[Bear Flag]] was replaced by the U.S. flag. Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] took over as the senior U.S. military commander in California in late July 1846 and asked Fr\u00e9mont's force of California militia and his 60 men to form the [[California Battalion]] with [[U.S. Army]] pay and ranks with Fremont in command. The California \"Republic\" disbanded and William Ide enlisted in the [[California Battalion]], when it was established in late July 1846, as a private.\n\nThe first job given to the California Battalion and was to assist in the capture of [[San Diego]] and [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]]. On July 26, 1846, Lt. Col. J. C. Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion of about 160 boarded the sloop {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}}, under the command of Captain [[Samuel Francis Du Pont]], and sailed for San Diego. They landed July 29, 1846, and a detachment of Marines and blue-jackets, followed shortly by Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion from ''Cyane'', landed and took possession of the town without firing a shot. Leaving about 40 men to garrison San Diego, Fremont continued on to Los Angeles where on August 13, with the Navy band playing and colors flying, the combined forces of Stockton and Fr\u00e9mont entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, without a man killed nor shot fired. [[U.S. Marine]] Lieutenant [[Archibald Gillespie]], Fr\u00e9mont's second in command, was appointed military commander of Los Angeles with an inadequate force from 30 to 50 California Battalion troops stationed there to keep the peace.\n\nIn [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]], the largest city in California with about 3,000 residents, things might have remained peaceful, except that Major Gillespie placed the town under martial law, greatly angering some of the Californios. On September 23, 1846, about 200 Californios under Californio Gen. [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]] staged a revolt, the [[Siege of Los Angeles]], and exchanged shots with the Americans in their quarters at the Government House. Gillespie and his men withdrew from their headquarters in town to Fort Hill which, unfortunately, had no water. Gillespie was caught in a trap, badly outnumbered by the besiegers. John Brown, an American, called by the Californios Juan Flaco,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrgaf.org/journeys/flaco.htm |title=Juan Flaco \u2013 California's Paul Revere |publisher=The Long Riders Guild Academic Foundation |accessdate=March 17, 2009}}</ref> meaning \"Lean John\", succeeded in breaking through the Californio lines and riding by horseback to [[San Francisco Bay]] (a distance of almost {{convert|400|mi|km}}) in an amazing 52 hours where he delivered to Stockton a dispatch from Gillespie notifying him of the situation. Gillespie, on September 30, finally accepted the Californio terms and departed for [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]] with his forces, weapons, flags and two cannon (the others were spiked and left behind). Gillespie's men were accompanied by the exchanged American prisoners and several non-Californio residents.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mark J.

The main Californio military force, known as the Californio [[lancer]]s, was disbanded. On January 16, 1847, Commodore Stockton appointed Fr\u00e9mont military governor of U.S. territorial California.\n\nSome Californios fought on both sides of the conflict (U.S. and Mexico). The battlefield memorials attest to the heroic fight and loss on both sides.\n\n=== Californio battles ===\nMost towns in California surrendered without a shot being fired on either side.

California Senator [[William M. Gwin]] presented a bill that, when approved by the Senate and the House, became the Act of March 3, 1851.<ref>Robinson, p. 100</ref> It stated that unless grantees presented evidence supporting their title within two years, the property would automatically pass back into the [[public domain]].<ref>House Executive Document 46, pp. 1116\u20131117</ref>\n\nRancho owners cited the articles VIII and X of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], wherein it guaranteed full protection of all property rights for Mexican citizens\u2014with an unspecified time limit.<ref>[http://www.southwestbooks.org/treaty.htm#articleviii Article VIII, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo], Center For Land Grant Studies.</ref><ref>[http://www.southwestbooks.org/treaty.htm#articlex Article X, Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo], Center For Land Grant Studies.</ref>\n\nMany ranch owners with their thousands of acres and large herds of cattle, sheep and horses went on to live prosperous lives under U.S. rule. Former commander of the California Lancers [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]] became a U.S. citizen after his return to California and acquired the [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando]] ranch which makes up large part of what is present day Los Angeles. He went on to become a California State Assemblyman and later a California State Senator. His brother former governor of [[Alta California]] (under Mexican rule) [[P\u00edo Pico]] also became a U.S. citizen and a prominent ranch owner/businessman in California after the war. Many others were not so fortunate as droughts decimated their herds in the early 1860s and they could not pay back the high cost mortgages (poorly understood by the mostly illiterate ranchers) they had taken out to improve their lifestyle and subsequently lost much or all of their property when they could not be repaid.\n\nCalifornios did not disappear. Some people in the area still have strong identities as Californios. Thousands of people who are descended from the Californios have well-documented genealogies of their families.\n\nMexican activists claim there was an integrated society of Mexicans, Indians, Mestizos and American immigrants, which had evolved over 77 years beginning with the founding of [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Misi\u00f3n San Diego]] in the Alta California territory in 1769.\n\nThe developing agricultural economy of California allowed many Californios to continue living in [[pueblos]] alongside Native peoples and Mexicanos well into the 20th century. These settlements grew into modern California cities, including [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[San Diego]], [[San Fernando, California|San Fernando]], [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]], [[San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Arvin, California|Arvin]], [[Mariposa, California|Mariposa]], [[Hemet, California|Hemet]] and [[Indio, California|Indio]].\n\nFrom the 1850s until the 1960s, the Hispanics (of Spanish, Mexican and regional Native American origins) lived in relative autonomy. They practiced a degree of social [[racial segregation]] by custom, while maintaining Spanish-language newspapers, entertainment, schools, bars, and clubs. Cultural practices were often tied to local churches and mutual aid societies. At some point in the early 20th century, the official recordkeepers (census takers, city records, etc.) began grouping together all Californios, Mexicanos, and Native (''Indio'') peoples with Spanish surnames under the terms \"Spanish\", \"Mexican\", and sometimes, \"colored\"; some Californios even intermarried with [[Mexican American]]s (those whose ancestors were refugees escaping the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910).\n\nAlexander V. King has estimated that there were between 300,000 and 500,000 descendants of Californios in 2004.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy\" />\n\n=== Californios in the California Gold Rush ===\nIn 1848, [[gold]] is discovered at [[Sutter's Mill|Sutter\u2019s Mill]], near [[Coloma, California|Coloma]], California.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Telling Identities: The Californio testimonios|last = S\u00e1nchez|first = Rosaura|publisher = University of Minnesota Press|year = 1995|isbn = 0-8166-2559-X|location = |pages = [https://archive.org/details/tellingidentitie0000sanc/page/286 286\u2013290]|url = https://archive.org/details/tellingidentitie0000sanc/page/286}}</ref> This discovery was made only nine days before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, which turned over California to the United States as a result of the Mexican\u2013American War.<ref>{{Cite book|title = A Theory of Property Rights with Application to the California Gold Rush|last = Umbeck|first = John|publisher = The Iowa State University Press|year = 1981|isbn = |location = |pages = 208\u2013209}}</ref>\n\nA group of Californio prospectors led by [[Antonio F. Coronel]] set out from Los Angeles to prospect for gold in [[Campo Seco, California|Campo Seco]].<ref name=\":0\" /> After a change of plans, the group spent a few months in campo de Estanilo mining alongside mostly Californios. After this, they left to head north into Sonoma, where one of the group members is ambushed and violently attacked, left for dead with only Colonel to tend to him.<ref name=\":0\" /> This ambush and lack of response by any authorities or other White Americans shows how Californios were tragically the victims of Euro-American vigilante violence and often forced to leave their native land.\n\n==== Large influx of foreigners diluting Californio population ====\nFrom the end of 1849 to the end of 1852, the population in California increased from 107,000 to 264,000 due to the [[California Gold Rush]]. In early 1849, approximately 6,000 Mexicans, many of whom were Californios who remained after the United States had annexed the territory, were prospecting for gold in the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = American Experience {{!}} The Gold Rush {{!}} People & Events {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_mexicans.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}</ref> Although the territory they were in had up until recently been Mexican land, Californios and other Mexicans very quickly became the minorities and were seen as the foreigners. Once the Gold Rush had truly started in 1849, the campsites were segregated by nationality, further establishing the fact that \"Americans\" had taken the title as the majority ethnicity in Northern California.<ref name=\":0\" /> Because the Californio \"foreigners\" so quickly became a minority, their claims to land protected under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo were ignored when miners overran their land and squatted.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Calisphere \u2013 California Cultures \u2013 1848\u20131865: Gold Rush, Statehood, and the Western Movement|url = http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/calcultures/eras/era4.html|website = www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}</ref> Any protests by Californios were quickly put down by hastily formed Euro-American militias, so any legal protection provided by the new California legislature was ineffective when the threat of violence and lynchings loomed.<ref name=\":2\" /> Even if Californios were able to win their land back in court, often lawyer's fees cost large sums of land that left them with a fraction of their former wealth.\n\n==== Working conditions ====\nMany Latino miners were experienced due to learning a \"dry-digging\" technique in the Mexican mining state of [[Sonora]].<ref name=\":1\">Adrianna Thomas, Raymond Arthur Smith, 2009, Latino and Asian Americans in the California Gold Rush, Columbia University Academic Commons,<nowiki>http://hdl.handle.net/10022/AC:P:8417</nowiki>.</ref> Their early success due praise and respect from [[European Americans|Euro-American]] miners, they eventually became jealous and used threats and violence to force Mexican workers out of their plots and into less lucrative ones.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition to these informal forms of discrimination, Anglo miners also worked to establish [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]-like laws to prevent Latinos from mining altogether.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1851, mob violence as well as the Foreign Miners' Tax discussed below forced between five thousand and fifteen thousand foreigners out of work in just a few months.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAccording to Antonio F. Coronel's accounts, there was systematic race-influenced violence conducted by Americans to force out Californios and other Latinos. One account tells of a Frenchman and \"un espa\u00f1ol\" being lynched for supposed theft in 1848. Despite offers by Californios to replace the reported amount of gold stolen, they were still hanged.<ref name=\":0\" /> In addition, later in the Gold Rush, Coronel and his group found a rich vein of gold on the American River. When Euro-Americans caught wind of this, the invaded the claim armed and insisted it was their plot, forcing out Colonel and ending his mining career.<ref name=\":0\" /> Accounts like these show the harsh and violent living and working conditions that Californios were faced with during the Gold Rush. Discriminatory and racist treatment and laws as well as being so vastly outnumbered forced them out of their native lands despite assurances by the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that they could remain.\n\n==== Foreign Miners' Tax ====\nIn response to the Mexican resistance to the American population, white miners called for something to be done about the \"Sonoran\" miner \"problem\". In response, in 1850, the Californian government introduced a tax on foreign miners who were working plots, called the Foreign Miners' Tax Law. The claimed purpose of the tax was to fund the government's efforts to protect the foreign workers. There are conflicting reports on the amount of the tax ranging from $20 to $30 per month.<ref name=\":0\" /> This extremely high tax forced all but the most successful Latinos to stop mining as they were unable to obtain enough gold to make mining profitable. This left only the most successful of the Mexican prospectors, who ironically were the ones who drew the most ire from the Euro-American miners initially. By 1851, when the tax law was repealed, approximately two-thirds of the Latinos and Californios that had been living and working in mining areas had been driven out by the tax.<ref>Mora, Anthony. \"Introduction to Latino Studies\". Tisch Hall, Ann Arbor. 9-28-2015. Lecture.</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2016|reason=If there is a recording or transcript of the lecture, a link is required; otherwise it doesn't really exist at all}} After repealing the $20 or $30 per month tax, the California legislature instituted a much more reasonable $3 per month tax in 1852.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, at this point, many of the Californios had already been driven out of their homes and mining plots, making it somewhat of a moot point. These taxes were for the most part only enforced against Latinos, including Californios, and the Chinese, but not any other foreign, but white Europeans, showing systematic racism on the part of the newly formed California Legislature.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group    = Californios\n|image    ={{image array|perrow=3|width=100|height=150\n| image1 = Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo (cropped).jpg| caption1 = [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]]\n| image2 = Juan Bandini portrait4x3.jpg| caption2 = [[Juan Bandini]]\n| image3 = Andres Pico.jpg| caption3 = [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]]\n| image4 = Romualdo Pacheco - Brady-Handy.jpg| caption4 = [[Romualdo Pacheco]]\n| image5 =Eulalia Perez (1765-1878).jpg |caption5 = [[Eulalia P\u00e9rez de Guill\u00e9n Marin\u00e9]]\n| image6 = Portret Antonio Coronela.jpg | caption6=[[Antonio F.

''The Squatter and the Don'' (2nd ed.). Houston: Arte Publico Press</ref> The novel was based on the legal struggles of General [[Mariano G. Vallejo]], a friend of the author. The novel depicts the legal process by which Californios were often \"relieved\" of their land. This process was long (most Californios spent up to 15 years defending their grants before the courts), and the legal fees were enough to make many Californios landless. Californios resented having to pay land taxes to United States officials, because the principle of paying taxes for land ownership did not exist in Mexican law. In some cases Californios had little available capital, because their economy had operated on a barter system; they often lost land because of the inability to pay the taxes.<ref>Pitt, ''Decline of the Californios'', pp. 83\u2013102</ref> They could not compete economically with the European and Anglo-American immigrants who arrived in the region with large amounts of cash.\n\nA portrayal of Californio culture is depicted in the novel ''[[Ramona]]'' (1884), written by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]].\n\nThe fictional character of [[Zorro]] has become the most identifiable Californio due to [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[film|motion pictures]] and the 1950s television series.

Capable of [[V/STOL|vertical or short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]], the first operational V/STOL aircraft. The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from [[close air support]] of ground troops to armed [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. The AV-8B is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), the [[Spanish Navy]], and the [[Italian Navy]]. A variant of the AV-8B, the [[British Aerospace Harrier II]], was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].\n\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]] to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK, [[McDonnell Douglas]] extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing with one additional [[hardpoint]] each, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage and other structural and [[aerodynamic]] refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its [[maiden flight]] in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through [[British Aerospace]], re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. Since corporate mergers in the 1990s, [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.\n\nTypically operated from small [[aircraft carrier]]s, large [[amphibious assault ship]]s and simple [[forward operating base]]s, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian operations]], proving themselves versatile assets. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the [[Gulf War]]. It has also served in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan since 2001, the [[Iraq War]] since 2003, and was used in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35B]], with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|first-generation Harriers]] entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), but were handicapped in range and [[payload]]. In [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] configuration, the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried less than half the 4,000&nbsp;lb (1,800&nbsp;kg) payload of the smaller [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], over a more limited radius.<ref>Donald and March 2004, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> To address this issue, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier in 1973. Early efforts concentrated on an improved [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]], designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by [[Bristol Siddeley]].<ref name=Wilson_p26>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;26.</ref> Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by {{Convert|2.75|in|mm|sigfig=2|sp=us|abbr=on}} to fit into the Harrier easily.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370.</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, a joint American and British team completed a project document defining an Advanced Harrier powered by the Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, as well as the USMC's A-4.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0/><ref name=Nordeen_p41>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;41.</ref> The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the  RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref name=Nordeen_p41/><ref>Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;288.</ref> With development costs estimated to be around [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]180\u2013200&nbsp;million (1974 British pounds),<ref>''Flight International'' 1974, p.&nbsp;762.</ref> the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.<ref>Jackson 1987, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\nDespite the project's termination, the two companies continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to the needs of the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items\u2014such as the larger Pegasus engine\u2014McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===Designing and testing===\nAs the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;42\u201344, 48\u201349.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|title=Is The AV-8B Advanced Harrier Aircraft Ready For Full-Scale Development?|date=30 January 1979|work=General Accounting Office|publisher=General Accounting Office|location=Washington, D.C.|page=1|oclc=4711266|access-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211052027/http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing.<ref>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;41\u201343.</ref> McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes.<ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370, 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=Wilson_p28>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer.

There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]]).<ref>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;46.</ref> Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan.

In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and [[close air support]] missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying [[Air interdiction|battlefield interdiction]] and armed reconnaissance missions.

Capable of [[V/STOL|vertical or short takeoff and landing]] (V/STOL), the aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier]], the first operational V/STOL aircraft. The aircraft is primarily employed on light attack or multi-role missions, ranging from [[close air support]] of ground troops to armed [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]]. The AV-8B is used by the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), the [[Spanish Navy]], and the [[Italian Navy]]. A variant of the AV-8B, the [[British Aerospace Harrier II]], was developed for the British military, while another, the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainer]].\n\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]] to dramatically improve the capabilities of the Harrier. Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK, [[McDonnell Douglas]] extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft incorporates a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra [[hardpoint]] per wing, and other structural and [[aerodynamic]] refinements. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its [[maiden flight]] in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar, resulting in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but not pursued. The UK, through [[British Aerospace]], re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981, giving it a significant work-share in the project. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, [[Boeing]] and [[BAE Systems]] have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003.\n\nTypically operated from small [[aircraft carrier]]s, large [[amphibious assault ship]]s and simple [[forward operating base]]s, AV-8Bs have participated in numerous military and [[Humanitarian intervention|humanitarian operations]], proving themselves versatile assets. [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]] named the USMC Harrier II as one of several important weapons in the [[Gulf War]]. The aircraft took part in combat during the [[Iraq War]] beginning in 2003. The Harrier II has served in [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan since 2001, and was used in [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] in Libya in 2011. Italian and Spanish Harrier IIs have taken part in overseas conflicts in conjunction with NATO coalitions. During its service history, the AV-8B has had a high accident rate, related to the percentage of time spent in critical take-off and landing phases. USMC and Italian Navy AV-8Bs are to be replaced by the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II]], with the former expected to operate its Harriers until 2025.\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|first-generation Harriers]] entered service with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), but were handicapped in range and [[payload]]. In [[STOL|short takeoff and landing]] configuration, the AV-8A (American designation for the Harrier) carried less than half the 4,000&nbsp;lb (1,800&nbsp;kg) payload of the smaller [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawk]], over a more limited radius.<ref>Donald and March 2004, p.&nbsp;55.</ref> To address this issue, Hawker Siddeley and McDonnell Douglas began joint development of a more capable version of the Harrier in 1973. Early efforts concentrated on an improved [[Rolls-Royce Pegasus|Pegasus engine]], designated the Pegasus 15, which was being tested by [[Bristol Siddeley]].<ref name=Wilson_p26>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;26.</ref> Although more powerful, the engine's diameter was too large by {{Convert|2.75|in|mm|sigfig=2|sp=us|abbr=on}} to fit into the Harrier easily.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370.</ref>\n\nIn December 1973, a joint American and British team completed a project document defining an Advanced Harrier powered by the Pegasus 15 engine. The Advanced Harrier was intended to replace the original RAF and USMC Harriers, as well as the USMC's A-4.<ref name=Jenkins_p69-0/><ref name=Nordeen_p41>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;41.</ref> The aim of the Advanced Harrier was to double the AV-8's payload and range, and was therefore unofficially named AV-16. The British government pulled out of the project in March 1975 owing to decreased defense funding, rising costs, and the  RAF's insufficient 60-aircraft requirement.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref name=Nordeen_p41/><ref>Eden 2004, p.&nbsp;288.</ref> With development costs estimated to be around [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]180\u2013200&nbsp;million (1974 British pounds),<ref>''Flight International'' 1974, p.&nbsp;762.</ref> the United States was unwilling to fund development by itself, and ended the project later that year.<ref>Jackson 1987, p.&nbsp;138.</ref>\n\nDespite the project's termination, the two companies continued to take different paths toward an enhanced Harrier. Hawker Siddeley focused on a new larger wing that could be retrofitted to existing operational aircraft, while McDonnell Douglas independently pursued a less ambitious, though still expensive, project catering to the needs of the US military. Using knowledge gleaned from the AV-16 effort, though dropping some items\u2014such as the larger Pegasus engine\u2014McDonnell Douglas kept the basic structure and engine for an aircraft tailored for the USMC.<ref name=Wilson_p26/><ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===Designing and testing===\nAs the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine, the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1976.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;42\u201344, 48\u201349.</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|title=Is The AV-8B Advanced Harrier Aircraft Ready For Full-Scale Development?|date=30 January 1979|work=General Accounting Office|publisher=General Accounting Office|location=Washington, D.C.|page=1|oclc=4711266|access-date=24 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211052027/http://www.gao.gov/assets/130/125395.pdf|archive-date=11 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The United States Navy (USN), which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC, insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing.<ref>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;41\u201343.</ref> McDonnell Douglas modified two AV-8As with new wings, revised intakes, redesigned exhaust nozzles, and other aerodynamic changes; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes.<ref>Jenkins 1998, pp.&nbsp;69\u201370, 72\u201373.</ref><ref name=Wilson_p28>Wilson 2000, p.&nbsp;28.</ref> Designated YAV-8B, the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978, at the hands of Charles Plummer.

There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18 Hornet]]).<ref>Nordeen 2006, p.&nbsp;46.</ref> Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan.

In the operational evaluation (OPEVAL), lasting from 31 August 1984 to 30 March 1985, four pilots and a group of maintenance and support personnel tested the aircraft under combat conditions. The aircraft was graded for its ability to meet its mission requirements for navigating, acquiring targets, delivering weapons, and evading and surviving enemy actions, all at the specified range and payload limits. The first phase of OPEVAL, running until 1 February 1985, required the AV-8B to fly both deep and [[close air support]] missions (deep air support missions do not require coordination with friendly ground forces) in concert with other close-support aircraft, as well as flying [[Air interdiction|battlefield interdiction]] and armed reconnaissance missions. The aircraft flew from military installations at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton]] and [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake]] in California, [[Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake]] in Canada, and [[MCAS Yuma]] in Arizona.<ref name=Nordeen_p57-9>Nordeen 2006, pp.&nbsp;57\u201359.</ref>\n\nThe second phase of OPEVAL, which took place at MCAS Yuma from 25 February to 8 March, required the AV-8B to perform fighter escort, [[combat air patrol]], and deck-launched intercept missions.
