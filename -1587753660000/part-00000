It is believed to have originated in central China as a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of [[mandarin orange]] and the [[ichang papeda]].\n\nThe yuzu is called '''yuja''' (from Korean {{lang|ko|\uc720\uc790}}) in [[Korean cuisine]]. Both Japanese ''yuzu'' and Korean ''yuja'' are borrowings of the Chinese ''y\u00f2uzi'' ({{lang|zh|\u67da\u5b50}}), though this Chinese word now refers to the [[pomelo]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fruit looks somewhat like a small [[grapefruit]] with an uneven skin, and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. ''Yuzu'' fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between 5.5{{nbsp}}cm (2.16{{nbsp}}in) and 7.5{{nbsp}}cm (2.95{{nbsp}}in) in diameter, but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to 10{{nbsp}}cm (3.93{{nbsp}}in) or larger).\n\nYuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns.  Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], resembling those of the related [[kaffir lime]] and ichang [[Papeda (citrus)|papeda]], and are heavily scented.\n\nYuzu closely resembles [[sudachi]] (a [[Japanese citrus]] from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu\u2013mandarin orange cross) in many regards, though unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Citrus junos fruits.jpg|''Citrus junos'' fruits and cross sections\nFile:Yuzu tree 4 years old.jpg|The leaves have large leaf-like [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]].\nFile:Yuzuandmandarine.JPG|Yuzu (left) compared to [[mandarin orange]] (right)\n</gallery>\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe yuzu originated and grows wild in central China and [[Tibet]]. It was introduced to [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] during the [[Tang dynasty]], and  is still cultivated there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citrusvariety.ucr.edu/citrus/yuzu1.html |title=Yuzu ichandrin (papeda hybrid).

It is believed to have originated in central China as a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of [[mandarin orange]] and the [[ichang papeda]].\n\nThe yuzu is called '''yuja''' (from Korean {{lang|ko|\uc720\uc790}}) in [[Korean cuisine]]. Both Japanese ''yuzu'' and Korean ''yuja'' are borrowings of the Chinese ''y\u00f2uzi'' ({{lang|zh|\u67da\u5b50}}), though this Chinese word now refers to the [[pomelo]].\n\n== Description ==\nThe fruit looks somewhat like a small [[grapefruit]] with an uneven skin, and can be either yellow or green depending on the degree of ripeness. ''Yuzu'' fruits, which are very aromatic, typically range between 5.5{{nbsp}}cm (2.16{{nbsp}}in) and 7.5{{nbsp}}cm (2.95{{nbsp}}in) in diameter, but can be as large as a regular grapefruit (up to 10{{nbsp}}cm (3.93{{nbsp}}in) or larger).\n\nYuzu forms an upright shrub or small tree, which commonly has many large thorns.  Leaves are notable for a large, leaf-like [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]], resembling those of the related [[kaffir lime]] and ichang [[Papeda (citrus)|papeda]], and are heavily scented.\n\nYuzu closely resembles [[sudachi]] (a [[Japanese citrus]] from Tokushima Prefecture, a yuzu\u2013mandarin orange cross) in many regards, though unlike the sudachi, yuzu eventually ripen to an orange colour and there are subtle differences between the flavours of the fruit.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Citrus junos fruits.jpg|''Citrus junos'' fruits and cross sections\nFile:Yuzu tree 4 years old.jpg|The leaves have large leaf-like [[Petiole (botany)|petioles]].\nFile:Yuzuandmandarine.JPG|Yuzu (left) compared to [[mandarin orange]] (right)\n</gallery>\n\n== Cultivation ==\nThe yuzu originated and grows wild in central China and [[Tibet]].

''who did more than any other to hold together the diversity of first-century Christianity.'' James the brother of Jesus, and Paul of Tarsus, the two other most prominent leading figures in first-century Christianity, were too much identified with their respective \"brands\" of Christianity, at least in the eyes of Christians at the opposite ends of this particular spectrum. But Peter, as shown particularly by the Antioch episode in {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2}}, had both a care to hold firm to his Jewish heritage\u2014which Paul lacked\u2014and an openness to the demands of developing Christianity, which James lacked. John might have served as a figure of the center holding together the extremes, but if the writings linked with his name are at all indicative of his own stance, he was too much of an individualist to provide such a rallying point. Others could link the developing new religion more firmly to its founding events and to Jesus himself. But none of them, including the rest of the twelve, seem to have played any role of continuing significance for the whole sweep of Christianity\u2014though James the brother of John might have proved an exception had he been spared.\" [Italics original] [[James Dunn (theologian)|Dunn, James D.G.]] ''The Canon Debate''.

A literal translation, in the style of the [[King James Version]], of the words presumably used by Jesus would be \"Thou art Rock, and upon this rock will I build my church\".<ref>In [[French language|French]], the translation, \"Tu es ''Pierre'', et sur cette ''pierre'' je b\u00e2tirai mon \u00c9glise, et les portes de l'enfer ne pr\u00e9vaudront point contre elle\" preserves exactly the play on words in what is believed to be the original Aramaic.</ref> To preserve a supposed pun, the Greek text chose to translate Peter's name as \"\u03a0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" rather than as \"\u039a\u03b7\u03c6\u1fb6\u03c2\" (Cephas).\n\nOne common Protestant argument historically has been that the translation from the [[New Testament]] in Hebrew into Greek is tenuous at best as there is no real evidence or indication that the New Testament (in Greek) was ever translated from Hebrew or Aramaic texts; for that argument see [[Aramaic primacy]]. According to the Protestant transliteration argument,{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} in the [[Aramaic of Jesus|language that Jesus spoke]], the same word, \u05db\u05e4\u05d0 (cepha), was used for both Peter's name and for the rock on which Jesus said he would build his church. Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank. ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman Press, 1962. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}</ref>\n\n==Catholic view on relationship to the Church today==\n{{Papal primacy and infallibility|expanded=overview}}\n\nIn [[Catholicism]], it is argued that the primacy of Peter is a basis for the primacy of the bishop of Rome over other [[bishops]] throughout the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] via the doctrine of [[Apostolic succession]]. This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Some,{{which|date=July 2019}} but not nearly all, [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] accept the concept of the primacy of Peter, but believe it was only relevant during the lifetime of Peter.{{cn|date=August 2019}} They do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic dictates that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]].\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence.\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint. At the same time, the history of papal primacy has always been imperfect and much-debated.<ref>Schatz, Klaus.  Papal Primacy: From Its Origins to the Present.  Translated by John A. Otto and Linda M.

Because of the faith he confessed Peter will remain the unshakable rock of the Church.

In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed,\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem, and again, \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproaches him with what had past, but says, \"If you love me, preside over the brethren.\" ...And the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, \"How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,\" this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world\u2026\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way\u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.

In his Scorpiace of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold\u2026 For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> Scorpiace is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\" rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate, Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.

His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy.

He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.

What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.

Modern theories of Papal Primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of Primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter\u2026 So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles\" (Giles, 280). The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's Dictus Pape outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\" <ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine Primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD). Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, The Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the Pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\".

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the De unitate ecclesia of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter... There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order. Its limits are determined by the Councils, and - in the Byzantine practice \u2013 by the \"very pious emperors.\"|''The Primacy of Peter'', p. 89}}\n\nThe notion that many [[Episcopal see|Sees]] were \u2018\u2019of Peter\u2019\u2019 had also once been held in the West:\n\n[[Pope Gregory I|Pope Gregory the Great]]\n{{quote|Your most sweet Holiness has spoken much in your letter to me about the chair of Saint Peter, Prince of the apostles, saying that he himself now sits on it in the persons of his successors...Wherefore though there are many apostles, yet with regard to the principality itself the See of the Prince of the apostles alone has grown strong in authority, which in three places is the See of one...He himself stablished (sic) the See in which, though he was to leave it, he sat for seven years.

However, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul.\n\nThe Orthodox also consider that [[Pope Linus|St. Linus]], not Peter, was actually the first [[Bishop of Rome]].\n{{quote|Of the church of Rome, Linus the son of Claudia was the first, ordained by Paul; and Clemens (Clement), after Linus' death, the second, ordained by me Peter.<ref>\u2019\u2019Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions\u2019\u2019, Book 7, Chapter XLVI \u2013 \"Who Were They that the Holy Apostles Sent and Ordained?\"</ref>}}\n\n===''Keys'' and ''rock'' not exclusive to Peter===\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] theologians agree that in {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}}, \"rock\" is a likely reference to Peter personally since the very name \"Peter\" means \"rock.\".<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 47\u201348}}</ref> However {{bibleref2|Matthew|18:18}} implies that the other Apostles were given the same powers.

There were no positions of power between the twelve, only \"degrees of intimacy\" or \"degrees of honor.\" According to this view, Peter has a weak symbolic primacy or primacy of honor (in the sense of a purely honorary primacy). In the patristic era, this was actually the Western view held by St Augustine.

In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches,\" and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that the accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ... The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses.

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone. They posit that the meaning of {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16:18}} is that Jesus uses a play on words with Peter's name to say that the confession he had just made is the rock on which the church is built.<ref name=WELS-ROCK>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090927075835/http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=813&cuItem_itemID=24624 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2009 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Matthew 16:18 - Peter, This Rock |publisher=Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod |accessdate=16 Mar 2017 }}</ref>\n\nOther theologically conservative Christians, including Confessional Lutherans, also rebut comments made by Karl Keating and D.A.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Since the [[Protestant Reformation]], many non-Catholics, in disagreement with the historic Catholic Church view, have disputed whether the feminine \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 refers to Peter, claiming it instead refers to either Peter's confession of faith or to Jesus himself.<ref name=Engler>John Engler. \"The Rock-Foundation of Matthew 16:17-20\". <http://www.greatcommission.com/Matthew161720.html> Accessed 12 Mar 2013</ref><ref name=Stagg>Stagg, Frank.

This extension of Petrine primacy to popes is known as the [[primacy of the Bishop of Rome]], also known as the primacy of the Roman Pontiff. This Catholic Church doctrine holds that the [[pope|papacy]] has authority delegated from Jesus to rule over the [[Christendom|entire Church]]. There are various views on the nature of the primacy and how it has been exercised and [[Apostolic succession|passed on]]. This belief makes a distinction between the personal prestige of Peter and the supremacy of the office of [[pope]] which Catholics believe Jesus instituted in the person of Peter. Some,{{which|date=July 2019}} but not nearly all, [[Protestantism|Protestant denominations]] accept the concept of the primacy of Peter, but believe it was only relevant during the lifetime of Peter.{{cn|date=August 2019}} They do not believe the pope holds any authority over the [[Christian Church|universal Church]].\n\nSome [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] believe that [[Paul of Tarsus and Judaism|Saint Paul saw Judaism]] as the [[Typology (theology)|type]] or figure of [[Christianity]]: \"Now all these things happened to [the Jews] in figure....\"{{bibleref2c|1Cor|10:11||1 Cor. 10:11}} In the [[613 Mitzvot|Old Law]], {{bibleref2|Deut.|17:8-12}} attributes to the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] the highest jurisdiction in religious matters. Therefore, it is argued, logic dictates that a supreme head would be necessary in the Christian Church,{{cn|date=August 2019}} though the relevance of [[Biblical law in Christianity]] is still disputed; see also [[New Covenant]] and [[The New Commandment|New Commandment]].\n\nIn the [[New Testament]], which some call the ''New Law'' or \"New Greek Testament\",<ref>Knight, Kevin. \"Question 106. The law of the Gospel, called the New Law, considered in itself.\" ''New Advent.'' Sept. 11, 2009: http://www.newadvent.org/summa/2106.htm</ref> {{bibleref2|Matthew|16:16-18}} reports that Jesus changed Simon's name to Peter. Elsewhere in Scripture such a name change always denotes some change in status (e.g., Abram to Abraham, Jacob to Israel, and Saul to Paul).\n\nJesus also said to Peter in verse 19, \"I will give to thee the [[Keys of Heaven|keys of the kingdom of heaven]].\" Especially for the Hebrew people, keys were a symbol of authority. Indeed, Jesus declares in the [[Book of Revelation]], that He has the \"keys of death and hell,\" which means that He has power over death and hell; {{Bibleref2|Isaiah|22:21-22}} also supports this. [[James Gibbons|Cardinal Gibbons]], in his book ''The Faith of Our Fathers'', points out that keys are still a symbol of authority in today's culture; he uses the example of someone giving the keys of his house to another person, and that the latter represented the owner of the house in his absence.\n\nAnother source indicating Peter's supremacy can be found in {{Bibleref2|John|21:15-17}} where Christ tells Peter three times to \"feed His sheep\" and \"feed His lambs.\" The \"sheep\" might be understood to be the stronger portion of Jesus' flock (the [[clergy]]), and the \"lambs\" as the weaker portion (the [[laity]]). From this, Catholics believe that Peter was given charge over Christ's whole flock, that is, the [[Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nMoreover, Peter is always named first in all listings of the Apostles; [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] is invariably mentioned last. In {{bibleref2|Matthew|10:2}} Peter is described as the \"first Apostle\". It is important to note that Peter was neither the first Apostle in age nor election; therefore, Peter must be the first Apostle in the sense of authority, if one ignores the possibility of him being first in the sense of first in the list of Twelve Apostles.{{bibleref2c|Mk.|3:16}} {{bibleref2c|Mt.|4:18-19}} According to {{bibleref2|Acts|1-2,10-11,15}}, St. Peter was the leader of the early Christian church in Jerusalem. Jesus also instructed St. Peter to strengthen his brethren, i.e., the apostles, according to {{bibleref2|Luke|22:31-32}}.\n\nBoth Latin and Greek writers in the early church (such as the St. [[John Chrysostom]]) referred to \"rock\" as applying to both Peter personally and his faith symbolically, as well as seeing Christ's promise to apply more generally to his twelve apostles and the Church at large.<ref name=\"Veselin Kesich 1992 61\u201366\">{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |pages= 61\u201366}}</ref>\n\n[[First Vatican Council|Vatican Council I]] defined the primacy of the bishop of Rome over the whole Catholic Church as an essential institution of the Church that can never be relinquished. This primacy is thus crucial to the understanding of the church from a Catholic viewpoint.

In this, they represent a middle-ground between the Catholic position and that of the [[Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] in the next section.\n\nThough among the Twelve Peter is predominant in the first chapters of [[Acts of the Apostles]], [[James the Just|James \"the brother of the Lord\"]] is shown to be a leader in his own right in later chapters, indeed he is commonly considered the first [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem#Bishops of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]]. Some assume James outranks Peter because he speaks last in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] and suggests the final ruling (concerning Gentile converts and Jewish practices such as [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcision]]) agreed upon by all, and because Paul mentions him before Peter and John when he calls them \"pillars of the church\" in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]. James was indeed the first bishop or [[patriarch]] of Jerusalem according to tradition. However, Catholics believe the bishop of Jerusalem was not by that fact the head of the Christian church, since the leadership rested in Peter as the \"Rock\" and \"Chief Shepherd\".<ref>Mckenzie, John L. ''The Dictionary of the Bible'' (Catholic)</ref> It is believed Peter entrusted the Jerusalem community to James when he was forced to leave Jerusalem due to [[Herod Agrippa]]'s persecution. {{bibleref2c|Acts|12}}<ref>''The Navarre Bible'', footnotes</ref>\n\nHowever, at the Council of Jerusalem in Acts 15, James uses the Greek ''exegesato'' to refer to Peter's statements, which refers to literally \"declaring\" or \"issuing a ruling.\" <ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=EvQJ_i7J4CEC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=exegesato+james&source=bl&ots=0T7FZfHbub&sig=MSPr7qcxxSLvgY1BDHdUgA3xu4g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3mbqave7JAhUJlB4KHTVgDV0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=exegesato%20james&f=false The Biblical Basis for the Papacy] by John Salza</ref> However, James uses the Greek word ''akouoo'' in relation to his statements, which refers to literally \"giving one's opinion,\" and does not denote authority. Catholic scholar Michael M. Winter puts it in his ''Saint Peter and the Popes'' in the following terms: \"The speech of St. James is of a different character [from that of St. Peter]. He acquiesces to what St. Peter had said, although it seems to have been against his personal inclinations, and then puts forward a practical suggestion for the sake of harmony.\"\n\nThe Fourth Century Latin Father St. Jerome, in his epistle to St. Augustine of Hippo, wrote that \"nay more, that Peter was the prime mover in issuing the decree by which this was affirmed.\" in relation to the Council of Jerusalem and again \"and to his opinion the Apostle James, and all the elders together, gave consent.\" <ref>http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/1102075.htm</ref>\n\nThis view is likewise echoed by Saint John Chrysostom, the Fourth Century Patriarch of Constantinople:\n\n{{quote|And why, then, passing by the others, does He converse with Peter on these things? (John 21:15). He was the chosen one of the Apostles, and the mouth of the disciples, and the leader of the choir. On this account, Paul also went up on a time to see him rather than the others (Galatians 1:18). And withal, to show him that he must thenceforward have confidence, as the denial was done away with, He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren. And He brings not forward the denial, nor reproches him with what had past, but says, 'If you love me, preside over the brethren ...and the third time He gives him the same injunction, showing what a price He sets the presidency over His own sheep. And if one should say, 'How then did James receive the throne of Jerusalem?,' this I would answer that He appointed this man (Peter) teacher, not of that throne, but of the whole world.<ref>http://www.catholicbridge.com/catholic/orthodox/pope_acts_15_james_and_peter.php</ref>}}\n\nFor Catholics, the fact that the new name for Simon is Peter is in fact itself very significant. In the Old Testament God is frequently referred to as a Rock or stone. Jesus refers to himself as the cornerstone. The Book of Daniel contains a prophecy that a Rock or stone from the mountain of God (heaven) will come down to earth and destroy the pagan kings. The rock will then grow itself until it covers the entire earth. Protestants consider this prophecy to allude to the [[end times]] but Catholics consider the prophecy to refer specifically to Jesus as the Rock from Heaven. Further, Catholics see the fact that the Rock does not leave but stays to until it covers the entire earth to mean that the Church, built of the Rock of Peter, is the [[body of Christ]], the Rock from Heaven, and that the Rock will eventually cover the entire Earth which is why the term Catholic (universal or worldwide) is the most common designation for the Catholic Church.\n\n===Individuals and documents supporting Roman primacy===\n\n====Irenaeus====\n[[Irenaeus]] has been called the most important witness of the [[Christianity in the 2nd century]].<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 6.</ref> Taught by [[Polycarp]], who had been instructed by John the apostle, Irenaeus became [[Bishop of Lyon]] in 178. In his ''Against the Heresies'', Irenaeus wrote, \"Although there are many dialects in the world, the force of the tradition is one and the same. For the same faith is held and handed down by the churches established in the German states, the Spains, among the Celtic tribes, in the East, in Libya, and in the central portions of the world\u2026\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 8.</ref> In Book 3, Irenaeus continues his defense of the unity of the church around the bishop, writing, \"By pointing out the apostolic tradition and faith announced to mankind, which has been brought down to our time by successions of bishops, in the greatest, most ancient, and well known church, founded and established by the two most glorious apostles, Peter and Paul, at Rome, we can confound all who in any other way\u2026 gather more than they ought.\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 9.</ref>\n\nIrenaeus asserted the Doctrine of Apostolic Succession to counter the claims of heretics, especially the Gnostics who were attacking the theology and authority of the mainstream Church. He stated that one could find true teaching in several leading episcopal sees, not just at Rome. The doctrine he asserted, therefore, has two parts: lineage from the Apostles and right teaching. Even today a bishop can be in the line of succession, but schismatic and heretical as is the case with many episcopi vagantes who claim to or may have Catholic Orders, but have no following and have deviated from the Catholic orthodox faith as defined by the larger denominations such as the Orthodox, Anglicans, Catholics and Lutherans.\n\n====Ignatius of Antioch====\n[[Ignatius of Antioch|Ignatius]], bishop of Antioch, was well known for his insistence on the authority of the bishop. In his writings to the church at [[Smyrna]] in 115 AD, he encouraged the Smyrnaeans to \"Avoid divisions, as the beginning of evil. Follow, all of you, the bishop, as Jesus Christ followed the father; and follow the presbytery as the apostles. Let no man do aught pertaining to the Church apart from the bishop. Wheresoever the bishop appears, there let the people be, even as wheresoever Christ Jesus is, there is the Catholic Church\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 4.</ref>\n\n====Tertullian====\nBorn in [[Carthage]] around 155 AD, [[Tertullian]] became a priest around the age of forty and worked tirelessly to defend the faith. In his Scorpiace of 208 AD, Tertullian wrote, \"No delay or inquest will meet Christians on the threshold\u2026 For though you think that heaven is still shut up, remember that the Lord left the keys of it to Peter here, and through him to the Church, which keys everyone will carry with him, if he has been questioned and made confession [of faith].\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 23.</ref> Scorpiace is the first known historical reference to the keys pertaining to anyone other than Peter. In it, he saw the keys as pertaining to \"everyone\" if they \"made confession\" rather than according to the modern interpretation concerning the bishops of Rome alone. Tertullian later retracted even this association in De Pudecitia,<ref>Schaff, Philip., American Ed., 1994. Alexander Roberts, D.D. & James Donaldson, LL.D. with notes by A. Cleveland Coxe, D.D..

Published online at http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.iii.viii.xxi.html</ref> listing various reasons why the Keys of Peter pertained to Peter alone. The churches later declared him an apostate along with the followers of Montanus for insisting that authority must be associated with demonstrable power.\n\n====Cyprian====\n[[Cyprian|Thascius Caecilius Cyprianus]] was made bishop of Carthage in 248 AD. but died only ten years later. Throughout his writings, Cyprian asserts that the Rock is Peter, and the Church rests upon him. He also claims that as the Church is settled upon the bishops, they too have authority. He writes, \"They, who have departed from the Church, do not allow the Church to recall and bring back the lapsed. There is one God, and one Christ, and one Church, and one chair founded by the voice of the Lord on the rock. Another altar cannot be set up, nor a new priesthood made, besides the one altar and the one priesthood. Whoever gathers elsewhere scatters.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. pp. 29-30.</ref> In his 251 AD De Catholicae Ecclesiae Unitate, Cyprian asks, \"He who deserts the chair of Peter, upon whom the Church was founded, does he trust himself to be in the Church?\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.

London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 53.</ref>\n\n====John Chrysostom====\n[[John Chrysostom]] was born at [[Antioch]] around 347 and would fight for the reform of the church until his exile in 404. His homilies emphasize his belief in the primacy. St. Chrysostom called Peter \"the leader of the choir, the mouth of all the apostles, the head of that tribe, the ruler of the whole world, the foundation of the Church, the ardent lover of Christ\u2026\"<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 126.</ref> His writings also emphasize the mortality of Peter, linking him more closely to the people of the Church.\n\n====Augustine of Hippo====\n[[Saint Augustine]] was born in [[Numidia]] in 354 AD and was baptized in [[Milan]] in 387 AD. He was also bishop of Hippo from 397 AD til his death in 430 AD. Augustine taught that Peter was first amongst the apostles, and thus represents the church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 163.</ref> His Sermo states, \"For Peter in many places in the Scriptures appears to represent the Church, especially in that place where it was said \"I give to thee the keys\u2026 shall be loosed in heaven\". What! did Peter receive these keys, and Paul not receive? Did Peter receive and John and James not receive, and the rest of the apostles? But since in a figure Peter represented the Church, what was given to him singly was given to the Church.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 175.</ref> His 395 A.D. Contra Epistolam Manichaei states, \"There are many other things which rightly keep me in the bosom of the Catholic Church\u2026 The succession of the priests keeps me, from the very seat of the apostle Peter (to whom the Lord after his resurrection gave charge to feed his sheep) down to the present episcopate.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 182.</ref>\n\n====Pope Innocent I====\n[[Pope Innocent I|Innocent I]] held the papal office from 402 to 417. Modern theories of Papal Primacy developed around Innocent and his writings. In a 416 AD letter to [[Decentius]], bishop of Eugubium, Innocent writes, \"Who does not know or observe that it [the church order] was delivered by Peter the chief of the apostles to the Roman church, and is kept until now, and ought to be retained by all, and that nothing ought to be imposed or introduced which has no authority, or seems to derive its precedents elsewhere?\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 194.</ref> It is also during this time that bishops began to recognize Innocent's primacy as Pope over other bishops in the West. This is made evident, among others, in a letter from the Council at Mileve to Innocent in 416 AD, which alludes the authority of \"his holiness\" drawn from the authority of Scripture.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 198.</ref> The doctrine of Primacy was beginning to take shape with Innocent's papacy.\n\n====Pope Leo I====\nBased on his knowledge of the Petrine texts of the Gospel, and his writings which expound upon it, it is easy to see that [[Pope Leo I|Leo I]] identified with the authority bestowed on Peter as bishop of Rome. Leo himself was consecrated bishop of Rome in 440 AD. He writes that \"The right of this power did indeed pass on to other apostles, and the order of this decree passed on to all the chiefs of the Church; but not in vain was that which was imparted to all entrusted but one. Therefore this is commended to Peter separately, because all the rulers of the Church are invested with the figure of Peter\u2026 So then in Peter the strength of all is fortified, and the help of divine grace is so ordered that the stability which through Christ is given to Peter, through Peter is conveyed to the apostles\" (Giles, 280). The [[Council of Chalcedon]] would later refer to Leo as \"him who had been charged with the custody of the vine by the savior.\" <ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 323.</ref>\n\n====Pope Gregory VII====\nThe [[Gregorian Reform|Gregorian Reform movement]] was rather a series of movements many of which involved the reform of the Catholic Church, headed by [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]], formerly the Archdeacon Hildebrand. Gregory became Pope in 1073 with the objective of reforming not the body of the church, but a purification of the clergy in general.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 101.</ref> Gregory is perhaps most recognized with the quarrel between himself and [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|King Henry IV]] of Germany, known as the \"[[Investiture Contest]]\". Gregory's Dictus Pape outlines his policies and ideals, as well as those of the Catholic Church. In this work, Gregory claims that the pope has power to depose and restore bishops, and also effectively reduces the authority of other bishops.<ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 129.</ref> This doctrine supported the idea that Rome and the church here also afforded primacy over all other churches. Gregory's papacy also bolstered the power of the Church over that of the State. The Gregorians defended the ideal of a separation of powers, claiming \"Let kings have what belongs to kings, and priests have what belongs to priests.\" <ref>Morris, Colin.  The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250.  Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. p. 133.</ref> The Petrine Primacy was now more affirmed than ever.\n\n===Challenges===\n\n====Councils====\nMany challenges faced the Popes claiming primacy throughout the history of Catholicism. The [[Edict of Milan]], the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]], and the [[First Council of Constantinople]] all dealt with the issue of primacy in that they amended the power of the popes over the other bishops. The third canon of the First Council of Constantinople of 381 AD declares Constantinople the new Rome, gives the Bishop of Rome the seat of honor and gives the Bishop of Constantinople second place in honor. The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431 AD offers debate as to whether the results determine that the Pope is at the head of the Church, or rather that it is under the authority of a council of bishops (Giles, 238-256 AD). Although the highlight of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 AD was the confession of the [[Person of Christ]], the Council also resulted in limitations to the powers of the bishops. Many letters of the Council identify its position as in agreement with papal primacy. Those present employ titles such as \"the most holy and beloved of God\" and \"ecumenical archbishop and patriarch of great Rome\" to address Pope Leo. Thus, as not all can be satisfied with the results, The Council of Chalcedon resulted in a schism with the Oriental Orthodox Church.<ref>Giles, E., ed.  Documents Illustrating Papal Authority: A.D. 96-454.  London: S.P.C.K., 1952. p. 297-321.</ref>\n\n====Schism====\nInternally, people questioned who rightfully was pope, while others wondered as to the role the Pope was to play outside of Rome.<ref>Logan, F.

The Cardinals called the election into question and elected [[Antipope Clement VII|Clement VII]] as Pope. Germany, Italy, England, and the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe remained loyal to Urban, while France, Spain, Scotland, and Rome followed Clement VII (1378\u20131394) and his successor, [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (1394&ndash;1417) who would reside in Avignon.\n\n==Eastern Orthodox view on relationship to the Church today==\n\n===Many hold the ''Primacy'' of Peter===\n[[File:StPeter-RussianMuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of St. Peter (15th century, [[Russian State Museum]], [[Saint Petersburg]]).]]\n\nThe [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] regards the Apostle Peter, together with the Apostle Paul, as \"preeminent apostles\". Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director,\" or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al.

In this traditional Orthodox and Patristic view, the Church is the local Eucharistic assembly (\"the diocese\" in today's terminology) and the one who holds the \"Chair of Peter\" (St. Cyprian's expression) is the bishop. As a result, the primacy of Peter is relevant to the relationship between the bishop and the presbyters, not between the bishop of Rome and the other bishops who are all equally holding Peter's chair.\n\nAs John Meyendorff explained:\n\n{{quote|A very clear patristic tradition sees the succession of Peter in the episcopal ministry. The doctrine of St Cyprian of Carthage on the \"See of Peter\" being present in every local Church, and not only in Rome, is well-known. It is also found in the East, among people who certainly never read the De unitate ecclesia of Cyprian, but who share its main idea, thus witnessing to it as part of the catholic tradition of the Church. St Gregory of Nyssa, for example, affirms that Christ \"through Peter gave to the bishops the keys of the heavenly honors,\" and the author of the Areopagitica, when speaking of the \"hierarchs\" of the Church, refers immediately to the image of St Peter. A careful analysis of ecclesiastical literature both Eastern and Western, of the first millennium, including such documents as the lives of the saint, would certainly show that this tradition was a persistent one; and indeed it belongs to the essence of Christian ecclesiology to consider any local bishop to be the teacher of his flock and therefore to fulfill sacramentally, through apostolic succession, the office of the first true believer, Peter... There exists, however, another succession, equally recognized by Byzantine theologians, but only on the level of the analogy existing between the apostolic college and the episcopal college, this second succession being determined by the need for ecclesiastical order.

In the East, there were numerous \"apostolic sees\", Jerusalem being considered the \"mother of all churches,\" and the bishop of Antioch could also claim the title of successor to Peter, being that Peter was the first [[List of Patriarchs of Antioch|bishop of Antioch]]. \"Canon 28 of [[Council of Chalcedon|Chalcedon]] was for [the Byzantines] one of the essential texts for the organization of the Church: 'It is for right reasons that the accorded privileges to old Rome, for this city was the seat of the Emperor and the Senate.' ... The reason why the Roman Church had been accorded an incontestable precedence over all other apostolic churches was that its Petrine and Pauline 'apostolicity' was in fact added to the city's position as the capital city, and only the conjunction of both of these elements gave the Bishop of Rome the right to occupy the place of a primate in the Christian world with the consensus of all the churches.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=\"Peter's Primacy in the New Testament and the Early Tradition\" in The Primacy of Peter|author=Veselin Kesich|year=1992|publisher=St. Vladimir's Seminary Press|id= |page= 68}}</ref>\n\n==Protestant views on relationship to the Church today==\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 400\n\n | image1 = Saint Raphael Catholic Church (Springfield, Ohio) - stained glass, Upon this Rock, detail - St. Peter's Basilica.jpg\n | caption1 = Stained glass window in a Catholic church depicting [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome sitting \"Upon this rock,\" a reference to [[:s:Bible (King James)/Matthew#Chapter 16|Matthew 16]]:18.

However he refers to the \"rock\" as ''petra''. The inspired New Testament Scriptures were written in Greek, not Aramaic. [[Aramaic of Jesus|What Jesus ''might'' have said in Aramaic]] is conjecture.

The Peshitta (written in Syriac, a language cognate with Aramaic) makes no distinction between the words in the two clauses. The Greek makes the distinction between ''petros'' and ''petra'' simply because it is trying to preserve the pun, and in Greek the feminine ''petra'' could not very well serve as a masculine name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |title=Who is the Rock? |publisher=Users.stargate.net |accessdate=2012-07-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216055823/http://users.stargate.net/~elcore/kephas.htm |archivedate=2012-02-16 }}</ref>}}\n\nAn alternate Protestant argument is that when Jesus said \"upon this rock\" in the aforementioned Matthew verse, he referred to himself, in reference to {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy|32:3-4}}, which states that \"God...is the Rock, his work is perfect\".

In classical Attic Greek ''petros'' generally meant \"pebble,\" while ''petra'' meant \"boulder\" or \"cliff.\" Accordingly, taking Peter's name to mean \"pebble,\" they argue that the \"rock\" in question cannot have been Peter, but something else, either Jesus himself, or the faith in Jesus that Peter had just professed. However, the New Testament was written in Koin\u00e9 Greek, not Attic Greek, and some authorities say no significant difference existed between the meanings of ''petros'' and ''petra''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\n[[File:Gesupietrochiave.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ Handing the Keys to St Peter'', by [[Pietro Perugino]] (1481\u201382)]]\nHowever, even though the feminine noun ''petra'' is translated as ''rock'' in the phrase \"on this rock I will build my church,\" the word ''petra'' (\u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1 in Greek) is also used at {{Bibleref2|1Cor|10:4||1 Cor. 10:4}} in describing Jesus Christ, which reads: \"They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.\"\n\nAlthough {{Bibleref2|Matthew|16}} is used as a primary proof-text for the Catholic doctrine of Papal supremacy, Protestant scholars say that prior to the Reformation of the sixteenth century, Matthew 16 was very rarely used to support papal claims. Their position is that most of the early and medieval Church interpreted the 'rock' as being a reference either to Christ or to Peter's faith, not Peter himself. They understand Jesus' remark to have been his affirmation of Peter's testimony that Jesus was the Son of God.<ref>Mathison, Keith A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=w_PHAGr2TfgC ''The Shape of Sola Scriptura''], pp.184\u2013185</ref>\n\nAnother rebuttal of the Catholic position is that if ''Peter'' really means ''the Rock'' which makes him the chief of Apostles, it would contradict Bible's teaching in {{Bibleref2|Ephesians|2:20}} which says that the church's foundation is the apostles and prophets, not Peter alone.

He disagrees with Luther and the Protestant reformers who held that by \"rock\" Christ did not mean Peter, but meant either himself or the faith of His followers. He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html Religion: Peter & the Rock.]\" \"Time,\" Dec. 07, 1953. Accessed Oct. 08, 2009</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]] believes in the re-established Apostle ministry. It sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]] in the [[Early Church]].\n\n===Lutheran view===\nFrom the ''[[Book of Concord]]'': {{quote|Chrysostom says thus: \"Upon this rock,\" not upon Peter. For He built His Church not upon man, but upon the faith of Peter. But what was his faith? \"Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\" And Hilary says: To Peter the Father revealed that he should say, \"Thou art the Son of the living God.\" Therefore, the building of the Church is upon this rock of confession; this faith is the foundation of the Church. \"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bookofconcord.org/treatise.php |title=Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope |publisher=Book of Concord |date= |accessdate=2012-07-16}}</ref>}}\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref name=WLS-Gawrisch>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |title=The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today |last1=Gawrisch |first1=Wilbert R. |date=5 Aug 1991 |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-03 }}</ref><ref name=WLS-Balge>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In The New Testament \n |last1=Balge \n |first1=Richard D. \n |date=6 June 1995 \n |publisher=Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary \n |accessdate=4 Feb 2015 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf \n |archivedate=2015-02-03 \n}}</ref><ref>[http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.htm ''Some thoughts on Matthew 16:18''] {{Dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>\n\nModern Lutheran historians even disclose that the Catholic church didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]]. This Creed binds Rome to explain the Scriptures only according to the unanimous consent of the Fathers.

Seventeen insisted, Peter is the rock. Sixteen held that Christ is the rock. Eight were emphatic that the whole apostolic college is the rock.

The LDS Church teaches that Peter was the chief apostle and head of the Church after Christ's ascension. The LDS Church further teaches that all [[Melchizedek Priesthood]] authority in the Church must come through a line of authority traceable directly from Christ through Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1996/12/the-restoration-of-the-aaronic-and-melchizedek-priesthoods?lang=eng|title = The Restoration of the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthoods}}</ref> However, in contrast to other groups, they believe that the line of succession was at some point broken following the death of the apostles, necessitating a restoration of the priesthood authority. The LDS Church teaches that this restoration occurred with the appearance of the resurrected Peter, James, and John, who ordained Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in 1829.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1979/06/dating-the-restoration-of-the-melchizedek-priesthood?lang=eng|title = Dating the Restoration of the Melchizedek Priesthood}}</ref> All ordained members of the LDS Church can obtain a written line of authority tracing back to Christ through Peter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/help/support/request-a-priesthood-line-of-authority?lang=eng|title = Request a Priesthood Line of Authority}}</ref>\n\nDespite the acceptance of Peter's primacy, several leaders of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) have taught that the rock referred to by Jesus in Matthew 16:18 was neither Peter nor his confession, but the gift of [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] from the [[Holy Spirit]] which made Christ's divinity known to Peter. [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] [[Howard W. Hunter]] taught: {{quote|\"And upon this rock I will build my church.\" Upon what rock? Peter? Upon a man? No, not upon a man, upon the rock of revelation, the thing which they were talking about.
