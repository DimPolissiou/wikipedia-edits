Upon completion, 13 of the 16 planned structures on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Midtown South]] would sit on a platform built over the [[West Side Yard]], a storage yard for [[Long Island Rail Road]] trains. The first of its two phases, opened in 2019, comprises a public green space and eight structures that contain residences, a hotel, office buildings, a mall, and a cultural facility. The second phase, on which construction has not started {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, will include residential space, an office building, and a school.\n\n[[Related Companies]] and [[Oxford Properties]] are the primary developers and major equity partners in the project. Related and Oxford, along with several large investors, have funded Hudson Yards' construction from a number of [[Financial capital|capital]] sources, including from foreign investors through the [[EB-5 visa|EB-5 investment program]]. [[Mitsui Fudosan]] owns a 92.09 percent stake in [[55 Hudson Yards]], and a 90 percent stake in [[50 Hudson Yards]]. The architectural firm [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] designed the master plan for the site, and architects including [[Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Foster + Partners]], [[Roche-Dinkeloo]], and [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] contributed designs for individual structures. Major office tenants include or will include fashion company [[Tapestry, Inc.|Tapestry]], consulting firm [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], and urban-planning organization [[Sidewalk Labs]].\n\nThe site of Hudson Yards was initially intended for other developments, most notably in the early 2000s as the site of the [[West Side Stadium]], during the [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]]. The plans for Hudson Yards were developed after the failure of the West Side Stadium. Construction began in 2012 with the groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, and the first phase opened on March 15, 2019. Both phases are projected to be complete by 2024. Agreements between various entities including the [[Government of New York City|local government]], the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), and the state of New York made the development possible.\n\nThe special zoning for Hudson Yards (an area roughly bound by 30th Street in the south, 41st Street in the north, 11th Avenue in the west, and Eighth Avenue in the east) further incentivized the building of other large-scale projects. Hudson Yards is adjacent but unrelated to [[Manhattan West]], [[3 Hudson Boulevard]], and [[The Spiral (New York City)|The Spiral]].\n\n==Site and structures==\n{{Hudson Yards map}}\nThe eastern portion of the site, developed as Phase 1, is located between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. It contains three office towers on Tenth Avenue, two of which contain a retail podium between them. Phase 1 also includes t[[The Shed (arts center)|he Shed]] performing arts center, a public plaza, the climbable ''[[Vessel (structure)|Vessel]]'' sculpture, and three residential skyscrapers on Eleventh Avenue.<ref name=\"chelseanow 2015012\" /> The western portion of the site, Phase 2, is located between Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues.

Upon completion, 13 of the 16 planned structures on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|West Side]] of [[Midtown South]] would sit on a platform built over the [[West Side Yard]], a storage yard for [[Long Island Rail Road]] trains. The first of its two phases, opened in 2019, comprises a public green space and eight structures that contain residences, a hotel, office buildings, a mall, and a cultural facility. The second phase, on which construction has not started {{as of|2020|lc=y}}, will include residential space, an office building, and a school.\n\n[[Related Companies]] and [[Oxford Properties]] are the primary developers and major equity partners in the project. Related and Oxford, along with several large investors, have funded Hudson Yards' construction from a number of [[Financial capital|capital]] sources, including from foreign investors through the [[EB-5 visa|EB-5 investment program]]. [[Mitsui Fudosan]] owns a 92.09 percent stake in [[55 Hudson Yards]], and a 90 percent stake in [[50 Hudson Yards]]. The architectural firm [[Kohn Pedersen Fox]] designed the master plan for the site, and architects including [[Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Foster + Partners]], [[Roche-Dinkeloo]], and [[Diller Scofidio + Renfro]] contributed designs for individual structures. Major office tenants include or will include fashion company [[Tapestry, Inc.|Tapestry]], consulting firm [[Boston Consulting Group|BCG]], and urban-planning organization [[Sidewalk Labs]].\n\nThe site of Hudson Yards was initially intended for other developments, most notably in the early 2000s as the site of the [[West Side Stadium]], during the [[New York City bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics]]. The plans for Hudson Yards were developed after the failure of the West Side Stadium. Construction began in 2012 with the groundbreaking for 10 Hudson Yards, and the first phase opened on March 15, 2019. Both phases are projected to be complete by 2024. Agreements between various entities including the [[Government of New York City|local government]], the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (MTA), and the state of New York made the development possible.\n\nThe special zoning for Hudson Yards (an area roughly bound by 30th Street in the south, 41st Street in the north, 11th Avenue in the west, and Eighth Avenue in the east) further incentivized the building of other large-scale projects. Hudson Yards is adjacent but unrelated to [[Manhattan West]], [[3 Hudson Boulevard]], and [[The Spiral (New York City)|The Spiral]].\n\n==Site and structures==\n{{Hudson Yards map}}\nThe eastern portion of the site, developed as Phase 1, is located between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. It contains three office towers on Tenth Avenue, two of which contain a retail podium between them.

They are (mainly) of [[control code]]s and [[escape code]]s that can be sent to or received from the terminal.  The escape codes sent to the terminal perform various functions that a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] terminal (and software [[terminal emulator]]s) is capable of, but that a teletypewriter is not; such as moving the terminal's cursor to positions on the screen, clearing and scrolling all or parts of the screen, turning on and off attached printer devices, programming programmable function keys, changing display colours and attributes (such as [[reverse video]]), and setting display title strings.  The escape codes received from the terminal signify things such as [[function key]], [[arrow key]], and other special key ([[home key]], [[end key]], [[help key]], [[PgUp key]], [[PgDn key]], [[insert key]], [[delete key]], and so forth) [[keystroke]]s.{{sfn|Afzal|2008|p=419}}{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=770}}\n\n== Unix and POSIX: termcap, terminfo, et al. ==\nIn Unix and other [[POSIX]]-compliant systems that support the [[POSIX terminal interface]], these capabilities are encoded in databases that are configured by a system administrator and accessed from programs via the [[terminfo]] library (which supersedes the older [[termcap]] library), upon which in turn are built libraries such as the [[curses (programming library)|curses]] and [[ncurses]] libraries, by which applications programs use the terminal capabilities to provide [[textual user interface]]s with windows, dialogue boxes, buttons, labels, input fields, menus, and so forth.{{sfn|Coffin|1991|p=115}}{{sfn|Coffin|1991|p=372}}  The intention is that this allows applications programs to be independent of actual terminal characteristics.  They don't need to hardwire any control codes or escape sequences into their code, and so don't have problems being used on a range of terminals with a range of capabilities.{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=769}}\n\n=== termcap ===\n{{main|termcap}}\nThe <code>termcap</code> (for \"'''term'''inal '''cap'''abilities\") library was developed for BSD systems.  It uses a database stored in the file <code>/etc/termcap</code>.  This database consists of a series of records (each of which consists of one or more lines in the file, joined by backslash characters at the ends of each line that continues onto a following one) each of which represents the capabilities of a particular terminal.  The fields of the record comprise the terminal type name, or names, followed by a sequence of capabilities, separated by colons.{{sfn|Coffin|1991|p=115}}{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=770}}  The capability fields themselves fall into three groups:\n;characteristics of the terminal\n:These comprise such things as the (nominal) number of rows and columns the terminal's display has, whether output automatically wraps onto the next line when it reaches the end of a line, and so forth.{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=770}}\n;control sequences sent as output to the terminal\n:These comprise the control codes and escape sequences sent to the terminal in order for it to perform some action (not necessarily a display action).  An example of one of the simplest is the output sequence to clear the screen, which may be the [[form feed]] (ASCII <code>FF</code>) character on some types of terminal but may, say, be the escape sequence <tt>\u241b2J</tt> on a terminal that requires [[ANSI escape sequence]]s.{{sfn|Kumar|2004|p=417}}{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=770}}\n;control sequences sent as input by the terminal\n:These comprise the control codes and escape sequences that the terminal sends to the host to represent various actions and events, such as [[function key]]s and [[arrow key]]s being pressed.{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=770}}\n\n=== terminfo ===\n{{main|terminfo}}\nThe terminfo (\"'''term'''inal '''info'''rmation\") library was developed for System V systems.  It uses a database stored in multiple files within a directory, which can be variously (on different Unices and POSIX-compatible systems) <code>/usr/lib/terminfo</code>, <code>/usr/share/terminfo</code>, or even <code>/usr/share/lib/terminfo</code>.{{sfn|Frisch|2002|p=769}}  (Its location isn't even uniform across different [[Linux distribution|distributions of Linux]].{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=31}})\n\nUnlike the termcap database, the terminfo database is compiled, a machine-readable database that is constructed from a human-readable source file format by a utility program, <tt>tic</tt>.  They can be decompiled from machine-readable form back to human-readable form by another utility program, <tt>infocmp</tt>.{{sfn|Raymond|2004|p=144&ndash;145}}  The command to output the human-readable form of the \"vt100\" terminal definition, for example, is:{{sfn|Blum|2008|p=31}}<syntaxhighlight lang=bash>infocmp vt100</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe use of a machine-readable format was to avoid the unnecessary overhead, in applications programs using systems such as the termcap library, of repeatedly parsing the database content to read the fields of a record.  The use of multiple files was to avoid the similar overhead of parsing the database content to find the database record for the target terminal type.  The terminal type name index is, effectively, the Unix/POSIX filesystem's ordinary directory structure.  Originally, Unix had severe performance problems with large directories containing lots of files, and thus terminfo uses a two-level structure, dividing up the directory entries by first letter into a series of subdirectories.  More recent filesystem formats used on Unix systems don't suffer as much from such problems (because their on-disc directory structures are no longer simple arrays of entries, but are organized into trees or hash tables) and so the necessity for this design element, that still exists in modern terminfo implementations, has since disappeared.{{sfn|Raymond|2004|p=144&ndash;145}}\n\n=== Utility programs to exercise terminal capabilities ===\n{{further|tput}}\nOn Unix systems, the <tt>tput</tt> command is used to look up a specific capability in the system's database, and output it to the command's [[Standard streams|standard output]] (which is, presumably, the terminal by which the function denoted by the capability is to be performed).{{sfn|Afzal|2008|p=419}}  One of the simplest operations is clearing the screen.

The commands for this are:{{sfn|Winsor|2001|p=244&ndash;245}}<syntaxhighlight lang=bash>tput init</syntaxhighlight> and <syntaxhighlight lang=bash>tput reset</syntaxhighlight>\n\nNormally the <tt>tput</tt> command uses the terminal type specified by the <code>TERM</code> [[environment variable]], one of the [[POSIX terminal interface#Controlling environment variables: TERM et al.|controlling environment variables of the POSIX terminal interface]].  This can be overridden, however, to force <tt>tput</tt> to look up a different terminal type in the database, with a command-line option to the command.{{sfn|Afzal|2008|p=419}}  So, for example, to issue the reset sequence appropriate for the type of terminal named \"vt100\" in the database (usually a [[VT100|DEC VT100]] terminal), irrespective of terminal type specified in environment variables, the command is:<syntaxhighlight lang=bash>tput -T vt100 reset</syntaxhighlight>\n\n== References ==\n=== What supports what ===\n{{reflist|\n  colwidth=20em|\n  refs=\n}}\n\n=== Sources used ===\n{{refbegin|1}}\n* {{cite book|\n  ref=harv|\n  title=UNIX unbounded: a beginning approach|\n  first=Amir|last=Afzal|\n  edition=5th|\n  publisher=Prentice Hall|\n  year=2008|\n  isbn=978-0-13-119449-6\n}}\n* {{cite book|\n  ref=harv|\n  title=Linux Command Line and Shell Scripting Bible|\n  series=Bible Series|\n  first=Richard|\n  last=Blum|\n  page=|\n  publisher=John Wiley and Sons|\n  year=2008|\n  isbn=978-0-470-25128-7|\n  url=https://archive.org/details/linuxcommandline00blum_0}}\n* {{cite book|\n  ref=harv|\n  title=UNIX system V release 4: the complete reference|\n  first=Stephen|\n  last=Coffin|\n  publisher=Osborne McGraw-Hill|\n  year=1991|\n  isbn=978-0-07-881653-6|\n  url=https://archive.org/details/unixsystemvrelea00coff}}\n* {{cite book|\n  ref=harv|\n  title=Essential system administration|   url=https://archive.org/details/essentialsystema00fris_0|   url-access=registration|\n  series=A nutshell handbook|\n  first=\u00c6leen|last=Frisch|\n  edition=3rd|\n  publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|\n  year=2002|\n  isbn=978-0-596-00343-2\n}}\n* {{cite book|\n  ref=harv|\n  title=Encyclopaedia of Operating System|\n  first=Sudhir|last=Kumar|\n  publisher=Anmol Publications PVT.
