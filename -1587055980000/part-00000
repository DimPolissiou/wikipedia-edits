Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

In addition, CIMS provides opportunities and facilities for undergraduate students to do and discuss mathematical research, including an undergraduate math lounge on the 11th floor and an undergraduate computer science lounge on the 3rd floor of Warren Weaver Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |title=Math Lounge |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174327/http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php?Itemid=5&id=91&option=com_content&task=view |title=New York University - MSc Mathematics in Finance |publisher=Global-derivatives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n[[File:CIMS Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom at Warren Weaver Hall]]\nThe mathematics and computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the Courant Institute has a strong focus on building quantitative and problem-solving skills through teamwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ |title=Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> An undergraduate computer science course on Computer Vision, for example, requires students to be in small teams to use and apply recently developed algorithms by researchers around the world on their own. One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU > A & S > Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

{"title_page": "Preadditive category", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[category theory]], a '''preadditive category''' is \nanother name for an '''Ab-category''', i.e., a [[category (mathematics)|category]] that is [[enriched category|enriched]] over the [[category of abelian groups]],  '''Ab'''.\nThat is, an '''Ab-category''' '''C'''  is a [[category (mathematics)|category]] such that\nevery [[hom-set]] Hom(''A'',''B'') in '''C''' has the structure of an abelian group, and composition of morphisms is [[bilinear operator|bilinear]], in the sense that composition of morphisms distributes over the group operation.\nIn formulas:\n<math display='block'>\n   f\\circ (g + h) = (f\\circ g) + (f\\circ h)\n</math>\nand\n<math display='block'>\n   (f + g)\\circ h = (f\\circ h) + (g\\circ h),\n</math>\nwhere + is the group operation.\n\nSome authors have used the term ''additive category'' for preadditive categories, but here we follow the current trend of reserving this word for certain special preadditive categories (see {{section link||Special cases}} below).\n\n== Examples ==\n\nThe most obvious example of a preadditive category is the category '''Ab''' itself. More precisely, '''Ab''' is a [[closed monoidal category]]. Note that [[commutativity]] is crucial here; it ensures that the sum of two [[group homomorphism]]s is again a homomorphism. In contrast, the category of all [[group (mathematics)|group]]s is not closed. See [[Medial category]].\n\nOther common examples:\n* The category of (left) [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'', in particular:\n** the [[category of vector spaces]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''K''.\n* The algebra of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over a ring, thought of as a category as described in the article [[Additive category]].\n* Any ring, thought of as a category with only one object, is a preadditive category. Here composition of morphisms is just ring multiplication and the unique hom-set is the underlying abelian group.\n\nThese will give you an idea of what to think of; for more examples, follow the links to {{section link||Special cases}} below.\n\n== Elementary properties ==\n\nBecause every hom-set Hom(''A'',''B'') is an abelian group, it has a [[0 (number)|zero]] element 0. This is the '''[[zero morphism]]''' from ''A'' to ''B''. Because composition of morphisms is bilinear, the composition of a zero morphism and any other morphism (on either side) must be another zero morphism. If you think of composition as analogous to multiplication, then this says that multiplication by zero always results in a product of zero, which is a familiar intuition. Extending this analogy, the fact that composition is bilinear in general becomes the [[distributivity]] of multiplication over addition.\n\nFocusing on a single object ''A'' in a preadditive category, these facts say that the [[endomorphism]] hom-set Hom(''A'',''A'') is a [[ring (algebra)|ring]], if we define multiplication in the ring to be composition. This ring is the '''[[endomorphism ring]]''' of ''A''. Conversely, every ring (with [[identity element|identity]]) is the endomorphism ring of some object in some preadditive category. Indeed, given a ring ''R'', we can define a preadditive category '''R''' to have a single object ''A'', let Hom(''A'',''A'') be ''R'', and let composition be ring multiplication. Since ''R'' is an abelian group and multiplication in a ring is bilinear (distributive), this makes '''R''' a preadditive category. Category theorists will often think of the ring ''R'' and the category '''R''' as two different representations of the same thing, so that a particularly [[abstract nonsense|perverse]] category theorist might define a ring as a preadditive category with exactly [[1 (number)|one]] object (in the same way that a [[monoid]] can be viewed as a category with only one object\u2014and forgetting the additive structure of the ring gives us a monoid).\n\nIn this way, preadditive categories can be seen as a generalisation of rings. Many concepts from ring theory, such as [[ideal (ring)|ideal]]s, [[Jacobson radical]]s, and [[factor ring]]s can be generalized in a straightforward manner to this setting. When attempting to write down these generalizations, one should think of the morphisms in the preadditive category as the \"elements\" of the \"generalized ring\".\n\n== Additive functors ==\n\nIf '''C''' and '''D''' are preadditive categories, then a [[functor]] ''F'':&nbsp;'''C'''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;'''D''' is '''additive''' if it too is [[enriched functor|enriched]] over the category '''Ab'''. That is, ''F'' is additive [[if and only if]], given any objects ''A'' and ''B'' of '''C''', the [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'':&nbsp;Hom(''A'',''B'')&nbsp;\u2192 Hom(''F''(''A''),''F''(''B'')) is a [[group homomorphism]]. Most functors studied between preadditive categories are additive.\n\nFor a simple example, if the rings ''R'' and ''S'' are represented by the one-object preadditive categories '''R''' and '''S''', then a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to ''S'' is represented by an additive functor from '''R''' to '''S''', and conversely.\n\nIf '''C''' and '''D''' are categories and '''D''' is preadditive, then the [[functor category]] '''D'''<sup>'''C'''</sup> is also preadditive, because [[natural transformation]]s can be added in a natural way.\nIf '''C''' is preadditive too, then the category Add('''C''','''D''') of additive functors and all natural transformations between them is also preadditive.\n\nThe latter example leads to a generalization of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over rings: If '''C''' is a preadditive category, then Mod('''C''')&nbsp;:= Add('''C''','''Ab''') is called the '''module category''' over '''C'''.{{fact|date=June 2015}} When '''C''' is the one-object preadditive category corresponding to the ring ''R'', this reduces to the ordinary category of [[category of modules|(left) ''R''-modules]]. Again, virtually all concepts from the theory of modules can be generalised to this setting.\n\n== {{mvar|R}}-linear categories ==\n\nMore generally, one can consider a category '''C''' enriched over the monoidal category of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}}, called an '''{{mvar|R}}-linear category'''. In other words, each [[hom-set]] Hom(''A'',''B'') in '''C''' has the structure of an {{mvar|R}}-module, and composition of morphisms is {{mvar|R}}-bilinear.\n\nWhen considering functors between two {{mvar|R}}-linear categories, one often restricts to those that are {{mvar|R}}-linear, so those that induce {{mvar|R}}-linear maps on each hom-set. \n\n== Biproducts ==\n\n{{Main|Biproduct}}\n\nAny [[finite set|finite]] [[product (category theory)|product]] in a preadditive category must also be a [[coproduct]], and conversely. In fact, finite products and coproducts in preadditive categories can be characterised by the following ''biproduct condition'':\n:The object ''B'' is a '''biproduct''' of the objects ''A''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''A<sub>n</sub>'' [[if and only if]] there are ''projection morphisms'' ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>:&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''A''<sub>''j''</sub> and ''injection morphisms'' ''i''<sub>''j''</sub>:&nbsp;''A''<sub>''j''</sub>&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'', such that (''i''<sub>1</sub>\u2218''p''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&nbsp;+ (''i<sub>n</sub>''\u2218''p<sub>n</sub>'') is the identity morphism of ''B'', ''p<sub>j</sub>''\u2218''i<sub>j</sub>'' is the [[identity morphism]] of <var>A</var><sub><var>j</var></sub>, and ''p''<sub>''j''</sub>\u2218''i<sub>k</sub>'' is the zero morphism from ''A''<sub>''k''</sub> to ''A<sub>j</sub>'' whenever ''j'' and ''k'' are [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]].\n\nThis biproduct is often written ''A''<sub>1</sub>&thinsp;\u2295&thinsp;\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&thinsp;\u2295&thinsp;''A<sub>n</sub>'', borrowing the notation for the [[direct sum]]. This is because the biproduct in well known preadditive categories like '''Ab''' ''is'' the direct sum. However, although [[Infinity|infinite]] direct sums make sense in some categories, like '''Ab''', infinite biproducts do ''not'' make sense.\n\nThe biproduct condition in the case ''n''&thinsp;=&thinsp;0 simplifies drastically; ''B'' is a ''nullary biproduct'' if and only if the identity morphism of ''B'' is the zero morphism from ''B'' to itself, or equivalently if the hom-set Hom(''B'',''B'') is the [[trivial ring]]. Note that because a nullary biproduct will be both [[Terminal object|terminal]] (a nullary product) and [[Initial object|initial]] (a nullary coproduct), it will in fact be a '''[[zero object]]'''.\nIndeed, the term \"zero object\" originated in the study of preadditive categories like '''Ab''', where the zero object is the [[trivial group|zero group]].\n\nA preadditive category in which every biproduct exists (including a zero object) is called ''[[additive category|additive]]''. Further facts about biproducts that are mainly useful in the context of additive categories may be found under that subject.\n\n== Kernels and cokernels ==\n\nBecause the hom-sets in a preadditive category have zero morphisms,\nthe notion of [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and [[cokernel]]\nmake sense. That is, if ''f'':&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'' is a\nmorphism in a preadditive category, then the kernel of ''f'' is the\n[[Equaliser (mathematics)|equaliser]] of ''f'' and the zero morphism from ''A'' to ''B'', while the cokernel of ''f'' is the [[coequaliser]] of ''f'' and this zero morphism. Unlike with products and coproducts, the kernel and cokernel of ''f'' are generally not equal in a preadditive category. \n\nWhen specializing to the preadditive categories of abelian groups or modules over a ring, this notion of kernel coincides with the ordinary notion of a [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of a homomorphism, if one identifies the ordinary kernel ''K'' of ''f'':&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'' with its embedding ''K''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''A''. However, in a general preadditive category there may exist morphisms without kernels and/or cokernels.\n\nThere is a convenient relationship between the kernel and cokernel and the abelian group structure on the hom-sets. Given parallel morphisms ''f'' and ''g'', the equaliser of ''f'' and ''g'' is just the kernel of ''g''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''f'', if either exists, and the analogous fact is true for coequalisers. The alternative term \"difference kernel\" for binary equalisers derives from this fact.\n\nA preadditive category in which all biproducts, kernels, and cokernels exist is called ''[[pre-abelian category|pre-abelian]]''. Further facts about kernels and cokernels in preadditive categories that are mainly useful in the context of pre-abelian categories may be found under that subject.\n\n== Special cases ==\n\nMost of these special cases of preadditive categories have all been mentioned above, but they're gathered here for reference.\n* A ''[[ring (algebra)|ring]]'' is a preadditive category with exactly one object.\n* An ''[[additive category]]'' is a preadditive category with all finite biproducts.\n* A ''[[pre-abelian category]]'' is an additive category with all kernels and cokernels.\n* An ''[[abelian category]]'' is a pre-abelian category such that every [[monomorphism]] and [[epimorphism]] is [[normal monomorphism|normal]].\nThe preadditive categories most commonly studied are in fact abelian categories; for example, '''Ab''' is an abelian category.\n\n== References ==\n\n* [[Nicolae Popescu]]; 1973; <cite>Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules</cite>; Academic Press, Inc.; out of print\n* [[Charles Weibel]]; 1994; <cite>An introduction to homological algebras</cite>; Cambridge Univ.

Most functors studied between preadditive categories are additive.\n\nFor a simple example, if the rings ''R'' and ''S'' are represented by the one-object preadditive categories '''R''' and '''S''', then a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''R'' to ''S'' is represented by an additive functor from '''R''' to '''S''', and conversely.\n\nIf '''C''' and '''D''' are categories and '''D''' is preadditive, then the [[functor category]] '''D'''<sup>'''C'''</sup> is also preadditive, because [[natural transformation]]s can be added in a natural way.\nIf '''C''' is preadditive too, then the category Add('''C''','''D''') of additive functors and all natural transformations between them is also preadditive.\n\nThe latter example leads to a generalization of [[module (mathematics)|module]]s over rings: If '''C''' is a preadditive category, then Mod('''C''')&nbsp;:= Add('''C''','''Ab''') is called the '''module category''' over '''C'''.{{fact|date=June 2015}} When '''C''' is the one-object preadditive category corresponding to the ring ''R'', this reduces to the ordinary category of [[category of modules|(left) ''R''-modules]]. Again, virtually all concepts from the theory of modules can be generalised to this setting.\n\n== {{mvar|R}}-linear categories ==\n\nMore generally, one can consider a category '''C''' enriched over the monoidal category of [[module (mathematics)|modules]] over a [[commutative ring]] {{mvar|R}}, called an '''{{mvar|R}}-linear category'''. In other words, each [[hom-set]] Hom(''A'',''B'') in '''C''' has the structure of an {{mvar|R}}-module, and composition of morphisms is {{mvar|R}}-bilinear.\n\nWhen considering functors between two {{mvar|R}}-linear categories, one often restricts to those that are {{mvar|R}}-linear, so those that induce {{mvar|R}}-linear maps on each hom-set. \n\n== Biproducts ==\n\n{{Main|Biproduct}}\n\nAny [[finite set|finite]] [[product (category theory)|product]] in a preadditive category must also be a [[coproduct]], and conversely. In fact, finite products and coproducts in preadditive categories can be characterised by the following ''biproduct condition'':\n:The object ''B'' is a '''biproduct''' of the objects ''A''<sub>1</sub>,...,''A<sub>n</sub>'' [[if and only if]] there are ''projection morphisms p<sub>j</sub>'':&nbsp;''B''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''A<sub>j</sub>'' and ''injection morphisms i<sub>j</sub>'':&nbsp;''A<sub>j</sub>''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'', such that (''i''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;''p''<sub>1</sub>)&nbsp;+ \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&nbsp;+ (''i<sub>n</sub>''&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;''p<sub>n</sub>'') is the identity morphism of ''B'', ''p<sub>j</sub>''&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;''i<sub>j</sub>'' is the [[identity morphism]] of <var>A</var><sub><var>j</var></sub>, and ''p<sub>j</sub>''&nbsp;<sup>o</sup>&nbsp;''i<sub>k</sub>'' is the zero morphism from ''A<sub>k</sub>'' to ''A<sub>j</sub>'' whenever ''j'' and ''k'' are [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]].\n\nThis biproduct is often written ''A''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;\u2295 \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7&nbsp;\u2295&nbsp;''A<sub>n</sub>'', borrowing the notation for the [[direct sum]]. This is because the biproduct in well known preadditive categories like '''Ab''' ''is'' the direct sum. However, although [[Infinity|infinite]] direct sums make sense in some categories, like '''Ab''', infinite biproducts do ''not'' make sense.\n\nThe biproduct condition in the case ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 simplifies drastically; ''B'' is a ''nullary biproduct'' if and only if the identity morphism of ''B'' is the zero morphism from ''B'' to itself, or equivalently if the hom-set Hom(''B'',''B'') is the [[trivial ring]]. Note that because a nullary biproduct will be both [[terminal object|terminal]] (a nullary product) and [[coterminal]] (a nullary coproduct), it will in fact be a '''[[zero object]]'''.\nIndeed, the term \"zero object\" originated in the study of preadditive categories like '''Ab''', where the zero object is the [[trivial group|zero group]].\n\nA preadditive category in which every biproduct exists (including a zero object) is called ''[[additive category|additive]]''. Further facts about biproducts that are mainly useful in the context of additive categories may be found under that subject.\n\n== Kernels and cokernels ==\n\nBecause the hom-sets in a preadditive category have zero morphisms,\nthe notion of [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] and [[cokernel]]\nmake sense. That is, if ''f'':&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'' is a\nmorphism in a preadditive category, then the kernel of ''f'' is the\n[[Equaliser (mathematics)|equaliser]] of ''f'' and the zero morphism from ''A'' to ''B'', while the cokernel of ''f'' is the [[coequaliser]] of ''f'' and this zero morphism. Unlike with products and coproducts, the kernel and cokernel of ''f'' are generally not equal in a preadditive category. \n\nWhen specializing to the preadditive categories of abelian groups or modules over a ring, this notion of kernel coincides with the ordinary notion of a [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of a homomorphism, if one identifies the ordinary kernel ''K'' of ''f'':&nbsp;''A''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''B'' with its embedding ''K''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''A''. However, in a general preadditive category there may exist morphisms without kernels and/or cokernels.\n\nThere is a convenient relationship between the kernel and cokernel and the abelian group structure on the hom-sets. Given parallel morphisms ''f'' and ''g'', the equaliser of ''f'' and ''g'' is just the kernel of ''g''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''f'', if either exists, and the analogous fact is true for coequalisers. The alternative term \"difference kernel\" for binary equalisers derives from this fact.\n\nA preadditive category in which all biproducts, kernels, and cokernels exist is called ''[[pre-abelian category|pre-abelian]]''. Further facts about kernels and cokernels in preadditive categories that are mainly useful in the context of pre-abelian categories may be found under that subject.\n\n== Special cases ==\n\nMost of these special cases of preadditive categories have all been mentioned above, but they're gathered here for reference.\n* A ''[[ring (algebra)|ring]]'' is a preadditive category with exactly one object.\n* An ''[[additive category]]'' is a preadditive category with all finite biproducts.\n* A ''[[pre-abelian category]]'' is an additive category with all kernels and cokernels.\n* An ''[[abelian category]]'' is a pre-abelian category such that every [[monomorphism]] and [[epimorphism]] is [[normal monomorphism|normal]].\nThe preadditive categories most commonly studied are in fact abelian categories; for example, '''Ab''' is an abelian category.\n\n== References ==\n\n* [[Nicolae Popescu]]; 1973; <cite>Abelian Categories with Applications to Rings and Modules</cite>; Academic Press, Inc.; out of print\n* [[Charles Weibel]]; 1994; <cite>An introduction to homological algebras</cite>; Cambridge Univ.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in colour marking of German Wasps ''Vespula germanica'' (F.) and Common Wasps ''Vespula vulgaris'' (L.)

It has [[aposematic]] colors of black and yellow; yellow pronotal bands which are almost parallel to each other and black dots and rings on its abdomen. The queens and females appear very similar to ''[[Vespula germanica]]''), except when they are seen head on, as the ''V. vulgaris'' face lacks the three black dots of ''V. germanica''. Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped. However, identification of this species may be difficult because the black mark on its ''clypeus'' can sometimes appear broken, making it again look similar to ''V. germanica''.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nStill more difficult to distinguish between species are the males.

It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force. The queen is now a nurse and egg producer. There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

She flies frontwards and backwards in front of the nest with a slow, hovering flight and repeats this movement until its distance is further away from the hole. When the arc of the flight increases up to about 6 ft (183 cm), the pathway makes a figure of a sideways \"8\" and when the queen is about 60 ft (18 m) away from the nest site, she then flies in a straight line. This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R.

There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J.

This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and three species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it directly predates native insects and competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{Cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates that these wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

A founding queen searches for a hollow tree, wall cavity, rock crevice, or even a mammal-made hole to build a nest. One colony cycle lasts for about 6\u201311 months and each colony cycle consists of around 3000\u20138000 larvae.\n\nThe extraordinary adaptation skills of ''V. vulgaris'' enable it to live in a wide range of habitats, from very humid areas to artificial environments such as gardens and human structures. This species, along with other wasp species such as ''V. germanica'', has impacted the ecosystem, especially those in New Zealand and Australia, where they were imported by humans, and frequently cause damage to fruit crops and endanger humans.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |url= |title=Variation in colour marking of German Wasps ''Vespula germanica'' (F.) and Common Wasps ''Vespula vulgaris'' (L.)

Instead, each has only one black mark on its [[Clypeus (arthropod anatomy)|''clypeus'']], which is usually anchor or dagger-shaped.

It is invasive in New Zealand and Australia.<ref name=\":3\" /> Until 2010, it was thought to be in North America as well, but molecular and morphological data showed that specimens identified as ''V. vulgaris'' in North America were ''Vespula alascensis'', which had previously been considered a taxonomic synonym, but is now considered a separate species.<ref name=\"digitallibrary.amnh.org\"/>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' has high adaptation skills for environments. It flourishes in most types of habitats, including prairie, grassland, natural and planted forests, shrub lands, and even in urban zones such as gardens, orchards, and buildings. However, it does require the temperature to be moderately warm, because its [[foraging]] activity is temperature-dependent (above 2 \u00b0C).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Northern Hemisphere colony cycle==\nFive distinguishable stages occur in ''V. vulgaris'' colony cycle in the temperate parts of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Each lasts for similar periods, around 30\u201335 days. The colony starts in April as the queen begins the foundation of the nest and degenerates around October when the temperature drops and the queen dies. The size of the colony ranges from 3000 [[larvae]] up to a maximum of 8000 larvae, with the queen producing around 200\u2013300 eggs per day for 24 days.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book |last1=Potter |first1=N.B. |title=A Study of the Biology of the Common Wasp, ''Vespula vulgaris'' L., with Special Reference to the Foraging Behavior |date=1964 |publisher=University of Bristol |location=Bristol |pages=5\u201360}}</ref>\n\n*Stage 1 \u2013 solitary stage: the queen builds the nest, provisions the cells and rears the first brood of workers.\n*Stage 2 \u2013 rapid increase: the workers replace the queen as the foraging force.

There is very rapid buildup of worker population.\n*Stage 3 \u2013 slow increase: the rate of population growth is not as rapid as in stage 2.\n*Stage 4 \u2013 climax of colony: worker population no longer increases. Cells built are all queen cells. Males emerge, and foraging rate per worker increases.\n*Stage 5 \u2013 decline: probably caused by death or sickness of queen. Colony cohesion breaks down, cannibalism sets in, and the foraging becomes erratic.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Brood production==\nThe general incubation period is five days, but it can occasionally be seven, due to [[cannibalism]], [[scavenging]] or replacement. The larval period can depend on the trophic condition inside and outside the nest. If there are abundant resources of food being brought into the nest, the larval period is short, but if the resource is short, the period can lengthen. The first adult emerges after around 23 days of hatching and the queen-pupated brood is completed in about a month (30 days).<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe first brood of workers are all of normal size, but the next generation of them is generally smaller, due to a decrease in the queen's foraging activity after producing the first batch of larvae. As the queen's foraging decreases, the second group of workers does not get so much food, often starves, and so spends more time in the larval stage.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Nest foundation by the queen==\nAfter coming out of hibernation in the spring, the queen forages for flowers or shrubs and begins looking for nesting sites. She flies low on the ground, searching for any round, dark object or depression. If it is a hole, she flies in to inspect the details if it is suitable and if not moves on to the next hole. What constitutes a \"perfect\" nest is yet to be discovered, but it is mainly speculated that the queen's physiological state is the main deciding factor of the time and the place of nesting. When she has found a suitable site for nesting, she performs dance-like wing movements which allow her to locate the site even after she has left the area.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal |last1=M.

She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a [[wikt:spindle|spindle]] and flying back out to bring in more pulp. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her [[anterior]] legs and mouth parts.<ref name=\":5\" /> She builds 20\u201330 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a [[Petiole (insect)|petiole]] and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its body against the sides.<ref name=\"TeAra\" />\n\nWhen the nest is completed, the queen is replaced by the workers as the foraging force and instead is now concerned only with nursing and egg producing. Her ovaries develop, her abdomen becomes distended with eggs, and she loses the ability to fly.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter the founding phase has been completed, the colony encounters a change where the workers begin to build queen cells. Once the workers start building on the queen cells, no more worker cells are built, but those that still have brood growing in them are retained. The majority of the food resource brought in by the workers is fed to the queen larvae, known as [[gynes]] and the lack of feeding for other larvae causes the prolongation of their larval periods.<ref name=\":6\" /> To ensure that only the queen's eggs are reared to adulthood, female workers remove worker-laid eggs in a process known as [[worker policing]].\n\nWhen the queen has completed her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving a crop of virgin queens which will leave the nest, mate, hibernate, and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death, so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when [[cannibalism]] occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry them out of the nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal |last1=R. J. |first1=Harris |last2=J.

Aerial nests and nests that are very close to the surface of the ground have much thicker envelopes than those under the ground. The wasps build thick envelopes to prevent heat from escaping. Also, smaller nests have thicker envelopes than larger nests. This is mainly due to the fact that the amount of heat produced is proportional to the volume of the nest. The larger a nest is the better it will be in conserving the nest warmth. The optimal temperature of the nest is around 32&nbsp;\u00b0C. However, when the temperature rises above the optimal temperature (during hot days), the workers use their wings as fans to cool the nest down.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal |last1=R. |first1=Sailer |title=Nest temperature in the common yellow-jacket |journal=Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society |date=1950 |volume=23 |pages=134\u2013137}}</ref>\n\n''V. vulgaris'' wasps recognize their nests by making [[pheromone]] trails from the entrance of their nest to the site of foraging.

This is how the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' marks the land, in respect to the landmarks around the nesting site.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n===Defensive behaviors===\nOnly wasps leaving the nest notice a disturbance and defend or fight off an intruder. The ones returning to the nest do not detect any disturbance and try to enter the nest. The workers that detect danger show a certain gesture \u2013 they rise onto the tips of their [[Arthropod leg#Tarsus|tarsi]], put forward their heads, turn down their abdomens and constantly vibrate their wings in high frequencies and short beats. This behavior signals other workers to fly to the entrance of the nest and defend. However, if the nest is disturbed enough times, the workers stop defending the nest and instead grow tolerant to such attacks.<ref name=\":5\" /> However, when they detect life-threatening level of danger, the ''Vespula vulgaris'' workers will vigorously defend their nest. Unlike honey bees, which die after stinging, ''Vespula vulgaris'' can sting multiple times. This makes its sting viable for personal defense when away from the colony, and the common wasp is therefore more apt to sting. However, it will usually not sting without being provoked by sudden movement or other violent behavior.\n\nResearch indicates the wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":8\" /> ''Vespula vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with [[honey bees]] for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island black beech forests.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n===Over-wintering behaviors===\nAfter mating, the queen overwinters in a hole or other sheltered location, sometimes in buildings. Wasp nests are not reused from one year to the next, but in rare instances wasps have been seen to re-nest in the footprint of a removed nest or even begin building a new nest within an old nest. In the mild climate of New Zealand and Australia, a few of the colonies may survive the winter, although this is much more common with the [[German wasp]].<ref name=\"doc\" /><ref name=\":9\" />\n\n==Factors affecting foraging==\nThe foraging activity of ''Vespula vulgaris'' is dependent on the light and temperature of the surrounding area. Generally, if the temperature of the surrounding area falls below 2\u00b0 C, the wasps will not proceed with foraging even if the temperature of the nest itself is optimal. When the temperature is above 2\u00b0 C, light intensity comes in to play a role. If the light intensity is high enough, the wasps will fly off to forage. However, there is a wide variance within the species, and even within individuals what that threshold light intensity would be \u2013 i. e. when would be the best light intensity for a wasp to go out to forage.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Blackith |first1=R. E. |title=Visual sensitivity and foraging in social wasps |journal=Insectes Sociaux |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1007/bf02224066 |year=1958}}</ref>\n\nThe foraging activities of ''Vespula vulgaris'' are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. First is to satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off early in the morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because [[dew]]s and [[nectar]]s are most abundant early in the morning and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nGenerally, wasps are unable to predict heavy rainfalls. They continue their foraging activities even in the rain, but cease when the rain becomes torrential. When the rainfall becomes extremely heavy near the nesting site, the workers rapidly return to their nests. Those whose foraging activities were interrupted by heavy rainfall become reluctant to forage again in the future, even when the weather is dry and calm. Those who continue to forage do so mainly for fluid.\n\nThe average life span of an adult ''Vespula vulgaris'' is known to be around two weeks (14 days). There was a negative correlation found between the age of the worker ''Vespula vulgaris'' and their respective foraging speeds, and a positive correlation between their age and the amount of time each worker spent in the nest between each foraging trip. The foraging speed decreased as the workers aged and the time a worker spent in the nest between foraging trips increased as they got older. Wasps that are over 30 days, in fact, generally cease from foraging trips and spend all of their time guarding the entrance of the nest.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Diet==\nSimilarly to other ''Vespulas'', ''Vespula vulgaris'' feed on animal preys such as caterpillars to feed their developing larvae and [[carbohydrate]]s, such as nectar and sweet fruits, to satisfy their own energy requirements.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite journal |last1=Spradbery |first1=J. P. |title=Wasps: an account of the biology and natural history of solitary and social wasps |journal=London, Sidgwick & Jackson |date=1973 |page=508}}</ref> Their usual food sources are: wood pulp, freshly killed insects such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[lepidopteran]] larvae and [[Diptera]] and Spiders.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Harris |title=Diet of the Wasps Vespula vulgaris and Vespula germanica in Honeydew Beech Forest of the South Island, New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Zoology |date=1991 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=159\u2013169 |doi=10.1080/03014223.1991.10757963}}</ref> Common wasps will also attempt to invade honey bees' nests to steal their honey.\n\nAlthough the types of prey ''Vespula vulgaris'' and ''Vespula germanica'' forage are almost the same, that of ''Vespula germanica'' are generally 2\u20133.5 times bigger and heavier than that of ''Vespula vulgaris''. This is mainly due to the size difference of the two species. Because the ''Vespula germanica'' foragers are bigger in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] than those of ''Vespula vulgaris'', and they both transport the prey by carrying on them, it would be advantageous for the wasp to be bigger to be able to hold larger prey.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==Caste system==\nIn the early stage of the colony founding, the queen ''Vespula vulgaris'' does most of the work, both building and foraging. After the nest is completely built, she expands her foraging resources from only pulps to pulps, fluids and insect flesh. The labor divides as the first batch of larvae is hatched. However, during the very beginning of the hatching, the workers do not take part of any labor. Rather, they remain motionless with their heads inside a cell. Workers actually start foraging actively after seven days. They both forage and take care of the broods by feeding the larvae, breaking down the insect flesh, dividing fluids collected by the foragers, removing trophallactic secretion from the larvae, and fixing the nests.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Queen==\nOne possible factor that determines a female's social caste is known to be its nest position. The location of each cell is directly related to the amount of food a larva can receive, and the queen cell, being located at the very bottom of the nest, encounters the foragers before any other cell. Therefore, it gets most of the food and naturally, yields the biggest female \u2013 the queen.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAs mentioned above, the cell location can alter the size of the larva and eventually determine which female ''Vespula vulgaris'' is going to be queen. However, when several candidates of queens arise, there is competition among them. Certain variations among them rank the [[hierarchy]] of the queens and thus select the ultimate queen. Although the precise causes of the variations in the queens are still unknown, one possible factor is the amount of fat stored in the queen's body. Smaller developing queens have less fat stored, and thus have relatively higher mortality rates in winter than larger queens. The bigger the size and larger the amount of fat stored, the \"higher\" the queen is considered in quality, and she is able to out-compete other queens in finding a fit mate. She will then have an advantage in establishing a nest in the following spring.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nIn order for the ''Vespula vulgaris'' queen to dominate all the workers \u2013 usually numbering more than 3000 in a colony  \u2013she possesses a special chemical that sends signals of dominance. The workers were discovered to regularly lick the queen while feeding her, and the air-borne [[pheromone]] from the queen's body alerts those workers of her dominance.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Pest status==\nAlong with the German wasp and three species of ''[[Polistes]]'' (all [[invasive species]]), the common wasp is considered a pest species in New Zealand, as it directly predates native insects and competes with [[Endemism|endemic]] species for food, such as insects and [[Honeydew (secretion)|honeydew]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.envbop.govt.nz/Factsheets/PestAnimal-090526-PA03.pdf |date=November 2004 |publisher=[[Environment Bay of Plenty]] |title=Wasps |work=Pest Animal Control}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=The vulgar wasp: the story of a ruthless invader and ingenious predator |last=Lester, Phil, 1969-|isbn=9781776561858 |location=Wellington |oclc=1031341683|date = April 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" /> In some [[South Island]] beech forests it is thought that densities of wasps are higher than anywhere else in the world.<ref name=doc>{{Cite web |title=Vespula Wasp Factsheet |url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803073040/http://www.doc.govt.nz/upload/documents/conservation/threats-and-impacts/animal-pests/fact-sheet175-vespula-wasp.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 August 2012 |publisher=Department of Conservation |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref> It is calculated that the total weight of common wasps in these places may exceed that of all birds.<ref name=TeAra>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Story: Wasps and bees |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/wasps-and-bees/3 |encyclopedia=Te Ara \u2013 the Encyclopedia of New Zealand |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref><ref name=\":12\" />\n\nResearch indicates that these wasps use odor to identify and attack rival wasps from other colonies, and nest odor frequently changes.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal |pmid=16158272 |year=2005 |last1=Steinmetz |first1=I |last2=Schmolz |first2=E |title=Nest odor dynamics in the social wasp Vespula vulgaris |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=414\u20138 |doi=10.1007/s00114-005-0006-9 |journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|bibcode=2005NW.....92..414S}}</ref> ''V. vulgaris'' wasps have been observed aggressively competing with honey bees for the honeydew secreted by the scale insect ''Ultracoelostoma brittini'' in New Zealand's South Island [[black beech]] forests.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal |last=Markwell |first=T.

It provides day and night, high-altitude ({{convert|70000|ft|m|sigfig=3|disp=comma|abbr=off|sp=us}}), all-weather [[intelligence gathering]].<ref>Drew, Christopher (21 March 2010).

Retrieved: 23 March 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Lockheed Corporation]] originally proposed it in 1953, it was approved in 1954, and its first test flight was in 1955. It was flown during the [[Cold War]] over the [[Soviet Union]], China, [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[Cuba]]. In 1960, [[Francis Gary Powers|Gary Powers]] was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] in a CIA U-2A over the Soviet Union by a [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM).  Major [[Rudolf Anderson|Rudolf Anderson Jr.]] was shot down in a U-2 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.\n\nU-2s have taken part in post-Cold War conflicts in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq]], and supported several multinational [[NATO]] operations. The U-2 has also been used for electronic sensor research, satellite calibration, scientific research, and communications purposes. The U-2 is one of a handful of aircraft types to have served the USAF for over 50 years, along with the [[Boeing B-52]] and [[Boeing KC-135]]. The newest models (TR-1, U-2R, U-2S) entered service in the 1980s, and the latest model, the U-2S, had a technical upgrade in 2012. \n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nAfter [[World War II]], the U.S. military desired better strategic [[aerial reconnaissance]] to help determine Soviet capabilities and intentions. Into the 1950s, the best intelligence the American government had on facilities deep inside the Soviet Union were German [[Luftwaffe]] photographs taken during the war of territory west of the [[Ural Mountains]], so [[United States aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Union|overflights]] to take [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] of the Soviet Union began. After 1950, Soviet air defenses aggressively attacked all aircraft near the country's borders\u2014sometimes even those over Japanese airspace\u2014and existing reconnaissance aircraft, primarily bombers converted for reconnaissance duty such as the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|Boeing RB-47]], were vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery, missiles, and fighters. Richard Leghorn of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) suggested that an aircraft that could fly at {{convert|60000|ft|m|-2}} should be safe from the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]], the Soviet Union's best interceptor aircraft, which could barely reach {{convert|45000|ft|m|-2}}. He and others believed that Soviet radar, which used American equipment provided during the war, could not track aircraft above {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 4\u20135, 22.</ref>\n\nThe highest-flying aircraft available to America and its allies at the time was the [[English Electric Canberra]], which could reach {{convert|48000|ft|m|-2}}. The British had already produced the PR3 photo-reconnaissance variant, but the USAF asked for English Electric's help to further modify the American-licensed version of the Canberra, the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|Martin B-57]], with long, narrow wings, new engines, and a lighter airframe to reach {{convert|67000|ft|m|-2}}. The U.S. [[Air Research and Development Command]] mandated design changes that made the aircraft more durable for combat, but the resulting [[Martin RB-57D Canberra|RB-57D]] aircraft of 1955 could only reach {{convert|64000|ft|m|-2}}. The Soviet Union, unlike the United States and Britain, had improved radar technology after the war, and could track aircraft above {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Lockheed proposal===\nIt was thought that an aircraft that could fly at {{convert|70000|ft|m|-2}} would be beyond the reach of Soviet fighters, missiles, and radar.<ref>Miller, Herbert L. (Director) [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB54/st04.pdf \"Suggestions re: The intelligence value of Aquatone.\"] ''Central Intelligence Agency'', 17 July 1956. Retrieved: 10 March 2009.</ref> Another USAF officer, John Seaberg, wrote a [[request for proposal]] in 1953 for an aircraft that could reach {{convert|70000|ft|m|-2}} over a target with {{convert |1500|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} of operational radius. The USAF decided to solicit designs only from smaller aircraft companies that could give the project more attention.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> Under the code name \"Bald Eagle\", it gave contracts<ref>Pocock 2005, p. 10.</ref> to [[Bell Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin Aircraft]], and [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine and Airplane]] to develop proposals for the new reconnaissance aircraft. Officials at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]] heard about the project and decided to submit an unsolicited proposal. To save weight and increase altitude, Lockheed executive John Carter suggested that the design eliminate landing gear and not attempt to meet combat [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factors]] for the airframe. The company asked [[Clarence Johnson|Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] to come up with such a design. Johnson was Lockheed's best aeronautical engineer,<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> responsible for the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] and the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|P-80]]. He was also known for completing projects ahead of schedule, working in a separate division of the company, informally called the [[Skunk Works]].<ref>Miller 1995, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:U- 2A Dragon Lady \"Article 389\" at USAF Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Original U-2A at USAF Museum]]\nJohnson's design, named CL-282, was based on the [[Lockheed XF-104]] with long, slender wings and a shortened fuselage. The design was powered by the [[General Electric J73]] engine and took off from a special cart and landed on its belly. It could reach an altitude of {{convert|73000|ft|m|-2}} and had a {{convert |1600|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} radius.<ref>Jenkins 1998, p. 6.</ref> The reconnaissance aircraft was essentially a jet-powered [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]]. In June 1954, the USAF rejected the design in favor of the [[Bell X-16]] and the modified B-57. Reasons included the lack of landing gear, use of the J73 engine instead of the more proven [[Pratt & Whitney J57]] used by the competing designs, and not using multiple engines, which, the USAF believed, was more reliable. General [[Curtis LeMay]] of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) walked out during a CL-282 presentation, saying that he was not interested in an airplane without wheels or guns.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 11\u201316.</ref>\n\n===Approval===\nCivilian officials including [[Trevor Gardner]], an aide to [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Harold E. Talbott]], were more positive about the CL-282 because of its higher potential altitude and smaller radar cross-section, and recommended the design to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Office of Scientific Intelligence]]. At that time,{{when|date=January 2018}} the CIA depended on the military for overflights, and [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]] favored [[HUMINT|human]] over [[TECHINT|technical intelligence-gathering]] methods. However, the Intelligence Systems Panel, a civilian group advising the USAF and CIA on aerial reconnaissance, had recognized by 1954 that the RB-57D would not meet the {{convert|70000|ft|m|-2}} requirement that panel member Allen Donovan of [[Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory]] believed was necessary for safety. The CIA told the panel about the CL-282, and the aspects of its design that the USAF saw as flaws (the single-engine and light load factor) appealed to Donovan, a sailplane enthusiast who believed that a sailplane was the type of high-altitude aircraft the panel was seeking.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 24\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[Edwin Land]], the developer of instant photography and another member of the panel proposed to Dulles through Dulles' aide, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]], that his agency should fund and operate this aircraft. Land considered that if the military, rather than the CIA, operated the CL-282 during peacetime it could provoke a war. Although Dulles remained reluctant to have the CIA conduct its own overflights, Land and [[James Killian]] of [[MIT]] told [[President Eisenhower]] about the aircraft; Eisenhower agreed that the CIA should be the operator. Dulles finally agreed, but some USAF officers opposed the project because they feared it would endanger the RB-57D and X-16. The USAF's Seaberg helped persuade his own agency to support the CL-282, albeit with the higher-performance J57 engine, and final approval for a joint USAF-CIA project (the first time the CIA dealt with sophisticated technology) came in November 1954. Lockheed had meanwhile become busy with other projects and had to be persuaded to accept the CL-282 contract after approval.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 29\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Manufacture===\nBissell became head of the project, which used covert funding; under the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] of 1949, the [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA's director]] is the only federal government employee who can spend \"un-vouchered\" government money. Lockheed received a $22.5 million contract (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|22.5|1955|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in March 1955 for the first 20 aircraft, with the first $1.26 million (${{inflation|US|1.26|1955|r=2|fmt=c}} million today) mailed to Johnson's home in February 1955 to keep work going during negotiations. The company agreed to deliver the first aircraft by July of that year and the last by November 1956. It did so, and for $3.5 million (${{inflation|US|3.5|1956|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) under budget.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 39\u201345.</ref> The Flight Test Engineer in charge was [[Joseph F. Ware Jr.]]<ref>Cefaratt 2002, pp. 78, 158.</ref>\n\nProcurement of the aircraft's components occurred secretly. When Johnson ordered altimeters calibrated to {{convert|80000|ft|m|-2}} from a company whose instruments only went to {{convert|45000|ft|m|-2}}, the CIA set up a cover story involving experimental rocket aircraft. [[Shell Oil]] developed a new low-volatility, low vapor pressure jet fuel that would not evaporate at high altitudes; the fuel became known as [[JP-7]], and manufacturing several hundred thousand gallons for the aircraft in 1955 caused a nationwide shortage of Esso's [[FLIT]] insecticide. The aircraft was renamed the U-2 in July 1955, the same month the first aircraft, Article 341, was delivered to [[Groom Lake]]. The \"U\" referred to the deliberately vague [[United States Department of Defense aerospace vehicle designation|designation]] \"utility\" instead of \"R\" for \"reconnaissance\", and the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter|U-1]] and [[Cessna 310|U-3]] aircraft already existed.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 59\u201362, 66.</ref> The CIA assigned the cryptonym AQUATONE to the project, with the USAF using the name OILSTONE for their support to the CIA.<ref>Pocock 2005, p. 24.</ref>\n\n[[File:U2 Camera.JPG|thumb|U-2 camera on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]]]\n[[James Gilbert Baker|James Baker]] developed the optics for a large-format camera to be used in the U-2 while working for [[Perkin-Elmer]].

JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude [[Jet fuel|fuel]], created specifically for the U-2. JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard USAF fuels. In 1999, USAF spent approximately $11.3 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|11.3|1999|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) on fuel for the U-2 aircraft and was looking for a lower cost alternative. JPTS is a specialty fuel and as such has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the per-gallon price of USAF's primary jet fuel, [[JP-8]]. Research was carried out to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used jet fuels. A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, was being considered in 2001. JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability by {{convert|100|F-change|C-change}} over stock JP-8, and is only 0.5 cents per gallon more expensive; low-temperature additives can be blended to this stock to achieve desired cold performance.<ref name=\"Simms\">{{cite journal |last=Simms |first=Christian G. |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a391242.pdf |title= JP-8+100LT: A low cost replacement of JPTS as the primary fuel for the U-2 aircraft? |publisher=[[Air Force Institute of Technology]] |date=March 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the small landing gear, a perfect balance in the fuel tanks was essential for a safe landing. Similarly to [[sailplane]]s, the U-2 had a [[yaw string]] on the canopy to detect slip or skid during the approach. A skid during flight with no bank was the hint of an imbalance around the longitudinal axis which could be resolved by moving the fuel to the left or right wing tank.<ref>{{cite interview |last=LaRue |first=Carl |subject-link= |interviewer=Markus V\u00f6lter |title=Omega Tau Podcast Episode 109 \u2013 Flying the U-2 Dragon Lady |url= http://omegataupodcast.net/109-flying-the-u-2-dragon-lady/|publisher= Omega Tau Podcast|date=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radar cross-section reduction===\nWhen the first overflights of the Soviet Union were tracked by radar, the CIA initiated [[Project Rainbow]] to reduce the U-2's [[radar cross-section]].

Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to USAF several times but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. USAF has no requirement or timeframe for a next-generation [[High-Altitude Long Endurance]] (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early. The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the [[RQ-3 DarkStar]], which never made it past flight testing and was canceled.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/lockheed-skunk-works-designing-next-gen-u-2-spy-plane-415842/ \"Lockheed Skunk Works designing next-gen U-2 spy plane\"].

Size, and thus cost, is kept down by having less endurance than the Global Hawk at around 20 hours, which is still about the same time as a normal RQ-4 sortie even though it is capable of flying for 34 hours. The TR-X concept is aimed squarely at USAF needs, and is not currently being marketed to the CIA or other government agencies. It would have increased power and cooling to accommodate new sensors, communication equipment, [[electronic warfare]] suites, and perhaps offensive or defensive [[directed-energy weapon|laser weapons]].

However, at lower altitudes the higher air density and lack of a power-assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly: control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, and a great deal of physical strength is needed to operate the controls. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in [[Ground effect (aircraft)|ground effect]] is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wings are fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a [[Chase plane|chase car]], which is driven by a second U-2 pilot who assists the landing U-2 by reporting the aircraft's altitude and attitude.<ref>Hennigan, W.J.

Chase cars and live calling of aircraft altitude are necessary because the landing gear is not designed to absorb the weight of the aircraft when falling from altitudes much above {{convert|2|ft|spell=in||}}.\n\nInstead of the typical tricycle landing gear, the U-2 uses a bicycle configuration with a forward set of main wheels located just behind the cockpit, and a rear set of main wheels located behind the engine. The rear wheels are coupled to the rudder to provide steering during taxiing. To maintain balance while taxiing and take-off, two auxiliary wheels called \"pogos\" are attached under the wings. These fit into sockets underneath each wing at about mid-span, and fall off at takeoff. To protect the wings during landing, each wingtip has a titanium skid. After the U-2 comes to a halt, the ground crew re-installs the pogos, then the aircraft taxis to parking.<ref>Bennett, Christopher W.

The program only recruited fighter pilots with reserve USAF commissions, as regular commissions complicated the resignation process. The program offered high salaries and the USAF promised that pilots could return at the same rank as their peers. The CIA's standards for selection were higher than the USAF's once the latter began its own U-2 flights; although more candidates were rejected, the CIA's program had a much lower accident rate. Test pilot [[Tony LeVier]] trained other Lockheed pilots to fly the U-2. By September 1955 he had trained six USAF pilots, who in turn trained other \"sheep-dipped\" pilots. As no two-seat trainer model was available for the program's first 15 years, training was done before the trainee's first solo flight and via radio.

LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the first intentional test flight three days later. On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was better than making the initial touchdown with the front wheel. Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing, due to the ground effect holding the aircraft off the runway for long distances.

By 16 August, the prototype flew at {{convert|52000|ft|m|-2}}, an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 68\u201371.</ref>\n\nBy January 1956, the U-2 had so impressed the USAF that it decided to obtain its own aircraft. The USAF purchased a total of 31 U-2s through the CIA; the transaction's code name, Project DRAGON LADY,<!-- NOTE: DRAGON LADY is all-caps here, in CIA codeword context; elsewhere, it is used as the name of the aircraft, which is written about in mixed case in sources. (AlanM1) --> was the origin of the aircraft's nickname. Meanwhile, U-2s conducted eight overflights of the U.S. in April 1956, convincing project overseers that the aircraft was ready for deployment. As often happens with new aircraft designs, there were several operational accidents. One occurred during these test flights, when a U-2 suffered a [[flameout]] over Tennessee; the pilot calculated that he could reach New Mexico. Every air base in the continental U.S. had sealed orders on what to do if a U-2 landed. The commander of [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] near [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] was told to open his orders, prepare for the arrival of an unusual aircraft making a [[deadstick landing]], and get it inside a hangar as soon as possible. The U-2 successfully landed after gliding for more than {{convert|300|mi|km}}, and its strange, glider-like appearance and the space-suited pilot startled the base commander and other witnesses.<ref name=\"U&O\">Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 76\u201379.</ref>\n\nNot all U-2 incidents were so benign, with three fatal accidents in 1956 alone. The first was on 15 May 1956, when the pilot stalled the aircraft during a post-takeoff maneuver that was intended to drop off the wingtip outrigger wheels. The second occurred on 31 August, when the pilot stalled the aircraft immediately after takeoff. On 17 September, a third aircraft disintegrated during ascent in Germany, also killing the pilot.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> There were other non-fatal incidents, including at least one that resulted in the loss of the aircraft.\n\n====Cover story====\nA committee of Army, Navy, USAF, CIA, [[National Security Agency|NSA]], and [[United States State Department|State Department]] representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods. The U-2 project received the list and drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan for the president to consider as he decided whether to approve it. The CIA's Photo Intelligence Division grew in size to prepare for the expected flood of U-2 photographs. Before the aircraft became operational, however, USAF's [[Project Genetrix]], which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many [[diplomatic protest]]s from those countries and for a while CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk. While Genetrix was also a technical failure\u2014only 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs\u2014the balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nWith approval from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA)'s director [[Hugh Dryden]], Bissell's team at the CIA developed a cover story for the U-2 that described the aircraft as used by NACA for high-altitude weather research; the cover story would be used if the aircraft were lost over hostile territory. U-2s flew some real weather-related missions, taking photographs that appeared in the press,{{r|cia1992_89_90_156_157_216}}{{r|afmag-richelson}} but few believed in the cover story; in May 1957 the UK's ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper reported the U-2 operating east of the [[Iron Curtain]].{{r|afmag-richelson}}\n\nThe civilian advisers Land and Killian disagreed with the cover story, advising that in case of an aircraft loss, the United States forthrightly acknowledge its use of U-2 overflights \"to guard against surprise attack\". Their advice was not followed, and the weather cover story led to the disaster that followed the May 1960 U-2 loss.<ref name=\"cia1992_89_90_156_157_216\">Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 89\u201390, 156\u2013157, 216.</ref>\n\n====First overflights of Communist territory====\nThe British government in January 1956 approved the U-2's deployment from [[RAF Lakenheath]]. NACA announced that the USAF [[Air Weather Service]] would use a Lockheed-developed aircraft to study the weather and cosmic rays at altitudes up to 55,000&nbsp;feet; accordingly, the first CIA detachment of U-2s (\"Detachment A\") was known publicly as the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1). The death in April 1956, however, of British agent [[Lionel Crabb]] while examining Soviet ships in [[Portsmouth]] harbor embarrassed the British government, which asked the United States to postpone the Lakenheath flights. To avoid delays, in June 1956, Detachment A moved to [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, without approval from the German government, while [[Giebelstadt Army Airfield]] was prepared as a more permanent base.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\nEisenhower remained concerned that despite their great intelligence value, overflights of the Soviet Union might cause a war. While the U-2 was under development, at the [[Geneva Summit (1955)|1955 Geneva Summit]] he proposed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]] that the Soviet Union and the United States would each grant the other country airfields to use to photograph military installations. Khrushchev rejected the \"Open Skies\" proposal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |title=Mandate for Change, 1953-56. |date=1963 |publisher=Heinemann |isbn=978-0434225804 |page=521}}</ref> The CIA told the president that the Soviets could not track high-altitude U-2 flights; this belief was based on studies using old Soviet radar systems and American systems that were not as effective at high altitudes as current Soviet systems, of which the U.S. was not aware. Knutson later said that \"the U-2 was really quite invisible to American radar, but Russian radar were a little different \u2013 better, you might say\". Although the Office of Scientific Intelligence issued a more cautious report in May 1956 that stated that detection was possible, it believed that the Soviets could not consistently track the aircraft. Dulles further told Eisenhower, according to presidential aide [[Andrew Goodpaster]], that in any aircraft loss the pilot would almost certainly not survive. With such assurances and the growing demand for accurate intelligence regarding the alleged \"[[bomber gap]]\" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in June 1956 Eisenhower approved 10 days of overflights.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 96\u2013100.</ref>{{r|cnncoldwarknutson}}\n\nThe first U-2 overflight had already occurred, using existing authorization of air force overflights over Eastern Europe. On 20 June 1956, a U-2 flew over Poland and East Germany, with more flights on 2 July. The fact that radar had\u2014contrary to the CIA's expectations\u2014successfully tracked the aircraft worried Eisenhower, but he approved the first Soviet overflight, Mission 2013 on 4 July. U-2 Article 347's main targets were the Soviet submarine construction program in [[Leningrad]], and counting the numbers of the new [[Myasishchev M-4]] \"Bison\" bomber. A second flight on 5 July continued searching for Bisons, took photographs of Moscow (the only ones taken by the program), and flew over cloud-covered<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gruntman |first1=Mike |title=Intercept 1961: the birth of Soviet missile defense |location=Figs 4.8,4.9,4.10 |isbn=978-1624103490 |page=73-78 |edition=Firstition}}</ref> rocket factories at Kaliningrad and Khimki. Eisenhower knew from the earlier overflights that his hope of no Soviet detection was unrealistic, but ordered that the overflights stop if the aircraft could be tracked. The CIA found that the Soviets could not consistently track the U-2s, and they therefore did not know that Moscow and Leningrad had been overflown. The aircraft's photographs showed tiny images of MiG-15s and MiG-17s attempting and failing to intercept the aircraft, proving that the Soviets could not shoot down an operational U-2.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 100\u2013108.</ref> Knutson recalled that the \"constant stream of Russian fighters\" trying to shoot down the U-2 during overflights was sometimes \"so thick\" that they interfered with photographs. Repeatedly failing for years to stop the aircraft embarrassed the USSR, which made diplomatic protests against the flights but did not publicize the penetration of Soviet territory.{{r|cnncoldwarknutson}}\n\nU-2 missions from Wiesbaden would depart westward in order to gain altitude over friendly territory before turning eastward at operational altitudes. The NATO Air Defence mission in that area included [[No. 1 Air Division RCAF (Europe)]], which operated the [[Canadair Sabre]] Mark 6 from bases in northeastern France. This aircraft had a service ceiling of 54,000&nbsp;feet and numerous encounters between the U-2 and RCAF 'ZULU' alert flights have been recorded for posterity.<ref>Gummeson, Ray.

Retrieved: 25 October 2012.</ref>\n\n====\"Bomber gap\" disproven====\n{{main|Bomber gap}}\n\nOn 10 July, the Soviets protested what they described as overflights by a USAF \"twin-engine medium bomber\", apparently believing that it was a Canberra. The U.S. replied on 19 July that no American \"military planes\" had overflown the Soviet Union, but the fact that the Soviets' report showed that they could track the U-2s for extended periods caused Eisenhower to immediately halt overflights over eastern Europe. Beyond the Soviet protests, the president was concerned about American public reaction to news that the U.S. had violated international law. To avoid project cancellation, the CIA began [[Project Rainbow]] to make the U-2 less detectable. The eight overflights over communist territory, however, had already shown that the bomber gap did not exist; the U-2s had not found any [[Myasishchev M-4]] Bison bombers at the nine bases they had visited. Because the Eisenhower administration could not disclose the source of its intelligence, however, Congressional and public debate over the bomber gap continued.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 100\u2013112.</ref>\n\n====Suez Crisis and aftermath====\nThe presidential order did not restrict U-2 flights outside eastern Europe. In May 1956, Turkey approved the deployment of Detachment B at [[Incirlik Air Base]], near [[Adana, Turkey]]. Before the new detachment was ready, however, Detachment A in late August used Adana as a refueling base to photograph the Mediterranean. The aircraft found evidence of many British troops on Malta and Cyprus as the United Kingdom prepared for its forthcoming [[Suez Crisis|intervention in Suez]]. The U.S. released some of the photographs to the British government. As the crisis grew in seriousness, the project converted from a source of strategic reconnaissance, which prioritized high quality over speed (the film was processed by its maker, then analyzed in Washington), to a tactical reconnaissance unit that provided immediate analysis. The Photo Intelligence Division set up a lab at Wiesbaden; as Detachment B took over from A and flew over targets that remain classified {{as of|2013|07|lc=y}}, the Wiesbaden lab's rapid reports helped the U.S. government to predict the Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it began on 29 October. On 1 November a flight flew over the Egyptian air base at Almaza twice, 10 minutes apart; in between the British and French attacked the base, and the visible results of the attack in the \"10-minute reconnaissance\" impressed Eisenhower. Beginning on 5 November, flights over Syria showed that the Soviets had not sent aircraft there despite their threats against the British, French and Israelis, a cause of worry for the U.S.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 113\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn the four years following the Suez Crisis, repeated U-2 missions over the Middle East were launched, particularly in times of tension.  The end of the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] saw a decline in U-2 operations, although Detachment B U-2s operating from Turkey still sometimes overflew the Middle East along with occasional missions over [[Albania]] to check for Soviet missile activity. [[Israel]] was a major target of U-2 missions during this period, with U-2 missions detecting the construction of the [[Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center|Negev Nuclear Research Center]] in 1958, first bringing [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear program]] to the attention of the US. The overflights drew the attention of the [[Israeli Air Force]].  Its radars detected and tracked the overflights, and on numerous occasions Israeli fighter aircraft were scrambled to intercept them, but were unable to reach them due to their altitude. The Israeli defense establishment was baffled by the overflights. However, Israeli fighter pilots were twice able to spot the intruding aircraft. On 11 March 1959, two Israeli [[Dassault Super Myst\u00e8re|Super Mystere]] fighters were directed to intercept a U-2 detected over Israel by Israeli ground-based radar. Although the aircraft were unable to make an intercept, the formation leader, Major [[Yosef Alon]], managed to get a good look at the aircraft. He subsequently identified it out of a book as a U-2, which was registered as a weather reconnaissance aircraft to the US Weather Service at the time. On 22 July 1959, after an overflight was detected, an Israeli Air Force [[Sud Aviation Vautour|Vautour]] jet was deployed to photograph the mysterious aircraft. The Vautour came within visual range and the U-2 was successfully photographed. In spite of this, it was not until the 1960 shootdown of a U-2 over the Soviet Union and its subsequent public exposure as a spy plane that the Israeli defense establishment understood the identity of the mystery aircraft.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/u-s-u-2-planes-flew-over-israel-in-1950s-1.5293435|title=U.S. Espionage Planes Violated Israeli Airspace in the 1950s, IAF Archives Reveal|date=2012-08-30|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679415633|url-access=registration|quote=Ehud Yonay.|title=No Margin for Error: The Making of the Israeli Air Force|last=Yonay|first=Ehud|date=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=978-0-679-41563-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaf.org.il/4385-39415-en/IAF.aspx|title=The Israeli Air Force : Mysterious Spyplane Revealed|website=www.iaf.org.il|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n====Renewal of Eastern Bloc overflights====\nEisenhower refused CIA pleas in September 1956 to reauthorize overflights of Eastern Europe but the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] in November, and [[1956 United States presidential election|his reelection that month]], caused the president to permit flights over border areas. Soviet interceptors could still not reach the U-2s but, after the Soviets protested a December overflight of Vladivostok by RB-57Ds, Eisenhower again forbade communist overflights. Flights close to the border continued, now including the first [[ELINT]]-equipped U-2s. In May 1957, Eisenhower again authorized overflights over certain important Soviet missile and atomic facilities. He continued to personally authorize each flight, closely examining maps and sometimes making changes to the flight plan.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 122\u2013124, 126\u2013128.</ref> By 1957, one of the European units was based at Giebelstadt, and the far eastern unit was based at the [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], Japan.<ref name=\"CIA0000743239\">[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000743239.pdf \"Future Plans for Project AQUATONE/OILSTONE.\"] ''Central Intelligence Agency'', 29 July 1957, p. 2.

On 2 April 1957, a RAINBOW test flight crashed in Nevada, killing the pilot. The U-2's large wingspan slowed its descent during crashes, often leaving its remains salvageable; Lockheed was able to rebuild the wreckage from the incident into a flyable airframe, but that it could do so should have been evidence to the CIA that its cover story might not be viable after a crash in hostile territory.

To reduce visibility Lockheed [[military camouflage|painted the aircraft in a blue-black color]] that helped them blend in against the darkness of space, and the CIA aircraft received the more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75-P-13]] engine that increased maximum altitude by {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}}, to {{convert|74600|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 143\u2013144, 147\u2013152.</ref>\n\nThe Soviets developed their own overflight aircraft, variants of the [[Yakovlev Yak-25|Yak-25]], which in addition to photographing various parts of the world through the early 1960s acted as a target for the new [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] interceptors to practice for the U-2.\n\nIn April 1958, CIA source [[Pyotr Semyonovich Popov]] told his handler [[George Kisevalter]] that a senior KGB official had boasted of having \"full technical details\" of the U-2, leading Bissell to conclude the project had a leak.

The U-2 intelligence caused Eisenhower to state in a press conference on 9 October that the launch did \"not raise my apprehensions, not one iota\", but he refused to disclose the U-2's existence as he believed that the Soviets would demand the end of the flights.<ref name=\"smith2012\">Smith 2012, pp. 731\u2013732, 734.</ref> In December 1958 [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] boasted that a Soviet missile could deliver a 5-megaton warhead {{convert|8000|mi|km}}. Although the Soviets' [[SS-6 Sapwood]] missile program was actually stalled due to technical failures, subsequent boasts\u2014and U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Neil McElroy]]'s statement in February 1959 to Congress that the Soviets might have a three-to-one temporary advantage in ICBMs during the early 1960s\u2014caused widespread concern in the U.S. about the existence of a \"missile gap\". The American intelligence community was divided, with the CIA suspecting technical delays but the USAF believing that the SS-6 was ready for deployment. Khrushchev continued to exaggerate the Soviet program's success; the missile gap concerns, and CIA and State Department support, caused Eisenhower to reauthorize one Communist territory overflight in July 1959 after 16 months, as well as many [[ELINT]] flights along the Soviet border. British U-2 overflights were made in December and February 1960. The first one targeted a large segment of the railways in the Tyuratam test range area as ballistic missiles were expected to be deployed close to rail lines, as well as nuclear complexes and missile test sites. No sites were found.<ref>\"Eyes in the Sky\", Dino Brugioni 2010, Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|978 1 59114 082 5}}, p. 342</ref> Neither flight proved or disproved the existence of a \"missile gap\".

Despite the much increased risk, the CIA did not stop the overflights as they were overconfident following the years of successful missions, and because of the strong demand for more missile-site photographs\u2014the U-2 was the major source of covert intelligence on the Soviet Union, and had photographed about 15% of the country, producing almost 5,500 intelligence reports.

After delays, the flight began on [[International Workers' Day|May Day]], 1 May. This was a mistake because, as an important Soviet holiday, there was much less air traffic than usual. The Soviets began tracking the U-2 15&nbsp;miles outside the border, and over Sverdlovsk, four and a half hours into the flight, one of three [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] missiles detonated behind the aircraft at 70,500&nbsp;feet; another hit a Soviet interceptor attempting to reach the American aircraft. The U-2 crashed but Powers survived the near miss and was quickly captured; the crash did not destroy the U-2 and the Soviets were able to identify much of the equipment.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 170\u2013177.</ref>\n\n[[File:KellyJohnsonandGaryPowers.jpg|thumb|right|Kelly Johnson and Gary Powers in front of a U-2]]\nBissell and other project officials believed that surviving a U-2 accident from above 70,000&nbsp;feet was impossible, so they used the pre-existing cover story. On 3 May, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA, the successor to NACA) announced that one of its aircraft, making a high-altitude research flight in Turkey, was missing; the government planned to say, if necessary, that the NASA aircraft had drifted with an incapacitated pilot across the Soviet border. By remaining silent, Khrushchev lured the Americans into reinforcing the cover story until he revealed on 7 May that Powers was alive and had confessed to spying on the Soviet Union. Eisenhower turned down Dulles' offer to resign and publicly took full responsibility for the incident on 11 May; by then all overflights were canceled. The Paris Summit collapsed after Khrushchev, as the first speaker, demanded an apology from the U.S., which Eisenhower refused.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 177\u2013181.</ref>\n\nU-2 pilots were told if captured, Knutson later said, \"to tell them everything that they knew\", because they were told little about their missions other than targets on maps.{{r|cnncoldwarknutson}} Otherwise, Powers had little instruction on what to do during an interrogation. Although he had been told that he could reveal everything about the aircraft since the Soviets could learn what they wanted from it, Powers did his best to conceal classified information while appearing to cooperate. His trial began on 17 August 1960. Powers\u2014who apologized on advice of his Soviet defense counsel\u2014was sentenced to three years in prison, but on 10 February 1962 the USSR exchanged him and American student [[Frederic Pryor]] for [[Rudolf Abel]] at [[Glienicke Bridge]] between West Berlin and Potsdam, Germany. Two CIA investigations found that Powers had done well during the interrogation and had \"complied with his obligations as an American citizen during this period\". Although the government was reluctant to reinstate him to the USAF because of its statements that the U-2 program was civilian, it had promised to do so after CIA employment ended; Powers resolved the dilemma by choosing to work for Lockheed as a U-2 pilot.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 181\u2013186.</ref>\n\nThe debris of Powers' aircraft was used to design a copy under the name [[Beriev S-13]].

Both detachments merged into Detachment G, under the command of Lt. Col. William Gregory, at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California where the CIA had relocated the U-2 program after nuclear testing forced it to abandon Groom Lake in 1957.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe CIA sought to determine if the U-2 could, from a fixed base at North Edwards, rapidly deploy to an advanced American base and complete reconnaissance flights on a largely self-sustaining basis.  A proving exercise was arranged with Gregory and the new Detachment G unit to simulate deploying a U-2 unit overseas, taking two or three aircraft, and conducting three reconnaissance missions with no resupply.  The exercise was critical to continued CIA operation of the U-2, since basing the aircraft in a foreign country was no longer an option. The exercise was completed with excellent results, and actual reconnaissance missions began to be scheduled immediately.<ref>Robert Richardson, Spying from the Sky, 2020, pp. 186-187.</ref>\n\nOn 4 January 1961, the CIA U-2 reconnaissance effort, which was formerly known as CHALICE, was redesignated IDEALIST.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP63-00313A000600070037-9.pdf REDESIGNATION OF CIA PROJECT INVOLVING UTILIZATION OF U-2 AIRCRAFT FOR RECONNAISSANCE PURPOSES AS PROJECT IDEALIST, January 4, 1961, CIA-RDP63-00313A000600070037-9, Central Intelligence Agency.]</ref> This program codeword by the end of the decade was being used to describe the U.S. reconnaissance along the Chinese coastline, while Taiwanese missions into the Chinese country would be known as the IDEALIST program<ref name=\"cia1969\"/>\n\nBy the next U-2 flight, in October 1960 over Cuba, the previously informal procedure in which the president personally approved or disapproved each flight after discussion with advisors was replaced by the [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] Special Group.

Although Lockheed modified six CIA aircraft into the [[aerial refueling]]-capable U-2F model in 1961, permitting some Cuba missions to originate from Edwards, pilot fatigue limited flights to about 10 hours. An August 1962 flight showed Soviet SA-2 SAM sites on the island; later overflights found more sites and MiG-21 interceptors. The increasing number of SAMs caused the United States to more cautiously plan Cuban overflights. USAF U-2s did not conduct overflights, but officials believed that it would be better for a military officer to be the pilot in case he was shot down. Following one last Cuba overflight that originated from Edwards and ended at [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida on 14 October 1962, all further U-2 operations over Cuba originated from a detachment operating location that was established at McCoy.<ref>[http://www.blackbirds.net/u2/u2-timeline/u2tl60.html \"U-2 Timeline of Events, 1960s.\"] ''Blackbirds.net'', 7 August 1997.

As determined later by USAF investigators, trouble with the aircraft's oxygen system caused Hickman to lose consciousness. U.S. Navy pilot John Newlin, flying an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4B]] assigned to VF-74, was scrambled from [[Naval Air Station Key West]], ordered to intercept Hickman before he violated Cuban airspace, and, if necessary, shoot him down.  Newlin could not reach the U-2 before flying closer than 12&nbsp;miles from the Cuban coastline and so had to turn back.  Hickman's U-2 flew across Cuba, ran out of fuel and crashed in Bolivia.

The CIA's [[Civil Air Transport]], aiding the rebels, so badly needed pilots that it borrowed two CIA U-2 pilots despite the high risk to the U-2 program if one were captured. The Indonesian government soon defeated the rebels, however, and the U-2s returned to Japan. That year, Detachment C also flew over the Chinese coast near [[Quemoy]] during the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] to see if Communist Chinese forces were preparing to invade, and in 1959 aided CIA operations during the [[1959 Tibetan uprising|Tibetan uprising]].

In July 1970, the 349th SRS at Bien Hoa moved to Thailand and was redesignated the [[99th Reconnaissance Squadron|99th SRS]] in November 1972, remaining there until March 1976.<ref>Hobson 2001, p. 269.</ref>\n\n====U-2 carrier operations====\nAt one time, in an effort to extend the U-2's operating range and to eliminate the need for foreign government approval for U-2 operations from USAF bases in foreign countries, it was suggested that the U-2 be operated from aircraft carriers. Three aircraft were converted for carrier operations by the installation of arrester hooks, and carrier-qualified naval aviators were recruited to fly them.\n\nIt turned out to be possible to take off and land a U-2 from a carrier. Testing in 1964 with the [[USS Ranger (CV-61)|USS ''Ranger'']] and in 1969 with the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']] proved the concept. The only operational carrier use occurred in May 1964 when a U-2, operating from USS ''Ranger'', was used to spy on a French atomic test in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kristinhillartist.com/FishHawk_article.html |title=Operation Fish Hawk \u2013 Secret CIA mission \u2013 U-2 reconnaissance flight \u2013 1964 French nuclear test on Mururoa Atoll |website=kristinhillartist.com |author= Kristin Hill |date= 2014 |access-date= 4 November 2019}}</ref><ref>https://theaviationist.com/2015/06/28/u-2-carrier-operations-story/</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the larger U-2Rs were flown from the carrier {{USS|America|CV-66|2}}.

Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] agreed with the plan, and four RAF officers were sent to Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas for training in May 1958. On 8 July, the senior British pilot, [[Squadron Leader]] Christopher H. Walker, was killed when his U-2 malfunctioned and crashed near Wayside, Texas. This was the first death involving the U-2, and the circumstances were not disclosed for over 50 years. Another pilot was quickly selected and sent to replace Walker. After training, the group of RAF U-2 pilots arrived in Turkey in November 1958, shortly after the CIA's Detachment B from Adana provided valuable intelligence during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] with both the United States and United Kingdom involvement. Since the September 1956 disclosure of Mediterranean photographs, the United Kingdom had received U-2 intelligence, except during the Suez Crisis. The CIA and Eisenhower viewed using British pilots as a way of increasing [[plausible deniability]] for the flights. The CIA also saw British participation as a way of obtaining additional Soviet overflights that the president would not authorize. The United Kingdom gained the ability to target flights toward areas of the world the United States was less interested in, and possibly avoid another Suez-like interruption of U-2 photographs.<ref name=\"lashmar19970126\"/><ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 152\u2013156, 181.</ref>\n\nAlthough the RAF unit operated as part of Detachment B, the UK formally received title to the U-2s their pilots would fly, and Eisenhower wrote to Macmillan that because of the separate lines of authority, the nations were conducting \"two complementary programs rather than a joint one\".<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, p. 156.</ref> A secret [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] bank account paid the RAF pilots, whose cover was employment with the [[Meteorological Office]].

To create misdirection typical of the time, the unit was created under the cover of high altitude weather research missions for ROCAF. To the U.S. government, the 35th Squadron and any U.S. CIA/USAF personnel assigned to the unit were known as Detachment H on all documents.

Each of the 35th Squadron's operational missions had to be approved by both the U.S. and the ROC presidents beforehand. A further layer of security and secrecy was enforced by all U.S. military and CIA/government personnel stationed in Taoyuan assigned to Detachment H having been issued official documents and IDs with false names and cover titles as Lockheed employees/representatives in civilian clothes. The ROCAF personnel would never know their U.S. counterparts' real names and rank/titles, or which U.S. government agencies they were dealing with.

For this purpose, the ROC pilots flew as far as [[Gansu]] and other remote regions in northwest China. Some missions, due to mission requirements and range, plus to add some element of surprise, had the 35th Squadron's U-2s flying from or recovered at other U.S. air bases in Southeast Asia and Eastern Asia, such as [[Kunsan Air Base]] in South Korea, or [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base|Takhli]] in Thailand. All U.S. airbases in the region were listed as emergency/alternate recovery airfields and could be used besides the 35th Squadron's home base at Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan. Initially, all film taken by the Black Cat Squadron would be flown to Okinawa or Guam for processing and development, and the U.S. forces would not share any mission photos with ROC. In the late 1960s, the USAF agreed to share complete sets of mission photos and help set up a photo development and interpretation unit at Taoyuan.\n\nIn 1968, the ROC U-2C/F/G fleet was replaced with the newer U-2R. However, with the overwhelming threats from [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] missiles and [[MiG-21]] interceptors, along with the [[rapprochement]] between the U.S. and the PRC, the ROC U-2s stopped entering Chinese airspace, only conducting electronic intelligence-gathering and photo-reconnaissance missions using new Long Range Oblique Reconnaissance (LOROP) cameras on the U-2R from above international waters. The last U-2 mission over mainland China took place on 16 March 1968. After that, all missions had the U-2 fly outside a buffer zone at least {{convert|20|nmi|km|sigfig=2|sp=us}} around China.\n\nDuring his visit to China in 1972, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] promised the Chinese to cease all reconnaissance missions near and over China, though this was also practical as by 1972 U.S. photo satellites could provide better overhead images without risking losing aircraft and pilots, or provoking international incidents.

Retrieved: 23 March 2010.</ref>\n\n[[Lockheed Corporation]] originally proposed it in 1953, it was approved in 1954, and its first test flight was in 1955. It was flown during the [[Cold War]] over the [[Soviet Union]], China, [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[Cuba]]. In 1960, [[Francis Gary Powers|Gary Powers]] was [[1960 U-2 incident|shot down]] in a CIA U-2A over the Soviet Union by a [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM).  Major [[Rudolf Anderson|Rudolf Anderson Jr.]] was shot down in a U-2 during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in 1962.\n\nU-2s have taken part in post-Cold War conflicts in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Operation Iraqi Freedom|Iraq]], and supported several multinational [[NATO]] operations. The U-2 has also been used for electronic sensor research, satellite calibration, scientific research, and communications purposes. The U-2 is one of a handful of aircraft types to have served the USAF for over 50 years, along with the [[Boeing B-52]] and [[Boeing KC-135]]. The newest models (TR-1, U-2R, U-2S) entered service in the 1980s, and the latest model, the U-2S, had a technical upgrade in 2012. \n\n==Development==\n\n===Background===\nAfter [[World War II]], the U.S. military desired better strategic [[aerial reconnaissance]] to help determine Soviet capabilities and intentions. Into the 1950s, the best intelligence the American government had on facilities deep inside the Soviet Union were German [[Luftwaffe]] photographs taken during the war of territory west of the [[Ural Mountains]], so [[United States aerial reconnaissance of the Soviet Union|overflights]] to take [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] of the Soviet Union began. After 1950, Soviet air defenses aggressively attacked all aircraft near the country's borders\u2014sometimes even those over Japanese airspace\u2014and existing reconnaissance aircraft, primarily bombers converted for reconnaissance duty such as the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet|Boeing RB-47]], were vulnerable to anti-aircraft artillery, missiles, and fighters. Richard Leghorn of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) suggested that an aircraft that could fly at {{convert|60000|ft|m|-2}} should be safe from the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]], the Soviet Union's best interceptor aircraft, which could barely reach {{convert|45000|ft|m|-2}}. He and others believed that Soviet radar, which used American equipment provided during the war, could not track aircraft above {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 4\u20135, 22.</ref>\n\nThe highest-flying aircraft available to America and its allies at the time was the [[English Electric Canberra]], which could reach {{convert|48000|ft|m|-2}}. The British had already produced the PR3 photo-reconnaissance variant, but the USAF asked for English Electric's help to further modify the American-licensed version of the Canberra, the [[Martin B-57 Canberra|Martin B-57]], with long, narrow wings, new engines, and a lighter airframe to reach {{convert|67000|ft|m|-2}}. The U.S. [[Air Research and Development Command]] mandated design changes that made the aircraft more durable for combat, but the resulting [[Martin RB-57D Canberra|RB-57D]] aircraft of 1955 could only reach {{convert|64000|ft|m|-2}}. The Soviet Union, unlike the United States and Britain, had improved radar technology after the war, and could track aircraft above {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 5\u20137.</ref>\n\n===Lockheed proposal===\nIt was thought that an aircraft that could fly at {{convert|70000|ft|m|-2}} would be beyond the reach of Soviet fighters, missiles, and radar.<ref>Miller, Herbert L. (Director) [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB54/st04.pdf \"Suggestions re: The intelligence value of Aquatone.\"] ''Central Intelligence Agency'', 17 July 1956. Retrieved: 10 March 2009.</ref> Another USAF officer, John Seaberg, wrote a [[request for proposal]] in 1953 for an aircraft that could reach {{convert|70000|ft|m|-2}} over a target with {{convert |1500|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} of operational radius. The USAF decided to solicit designs only from smaller aircraft companies that could give the project more attention.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> Under the code name \"Bald Eagle\", it gave contracts<ref>Pocock 2005, p. 10.</ref> to [[Bell Aircraft]], [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin Aircraft]], and [[Fairchild Aircraft|Fairchild Engine and Airplane]] to develop proposals for the new reconnaissance aircraft. Officials at [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]] heard about the project and decided to submit an unsolicited proposal. To save weight and increase altitude, Lockheed executive John Carter suggested that the design eliminate landing gear and not attempt to meet combat [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factors]] for the airframe. The company asked [[Clarence Johnson|Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson]] to come up with such a design. Johnson was Lockheed's best aeronautical engineer,<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> responsible for the [[Lockheed P-38 Lightning|P-38]] and the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|P-80]]. He was also known for completing projects ahead of schedule, working in a separate division of the company, informally called the [[Skunk Works]].<ref>Miller 1995, p. 5.</ref>\n\n[[File:U- 2A Dragon Lady \"Article 389\" at USAF Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Original U-2A at USAF Museum]]\nJohnson's design, named CL-282, was based on the [[Lockheed XF-104]] with long, slender wings and a shortened fuselage. The design was powered by the [[General Electric J73]] engine and took off from a special cart and landed on its belly. It could reach an altitude of {{convert|73000|ft|m|-2}} and had a {{convert |1600|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} radius.<ref>Jenkins 1998, p. 6.</ref> The reconnaissance aircraft was essentially a jet-powered [[Glider (sailplane)|glider]]. In June 1954, the USAF rejected the design in favor of the [[Bell X-16]] and the modified B-57. Reasons included the lack of landing gear, use of the J73 engine instead of the more proven [[Pratt & Whitney J57]] used by the competing designs, and not using multiple engines, which, the USAF believed, was more reliable. General [[Curtis LeMay]] of [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) walked out during a CL-282 presentation, saying that he was not interested in an airplane without wheels or guns.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 11\u201316.</ref>\n\n===Approval===\nCivilian officials including [[Trevor Gardner]], an aide to [[Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Harold E. Talbott]], were more positive about the CL-282 because of its higher potential altitude and smaller radar cross-section, and recommended the design to the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[Office of Scientific Intelligence]]. At that time,{{when|date=January 2018}} the CIA depended on the military for overflights, and [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]] favored [[HUMINT|human]] over [[TECHINT|technical intelligence-gathering]] methods. However, the Intelligence Systems Panel, a civilian group advising the USAF and CIA on aerial reconnaissance, had recognized by 1954 that the RB-57D would not meet the {{convert|70000|ft|m|-2}} requirement that panel member Allen Donovan of [[Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory]] believed was necessary for safety. The CIA told the panel about the CL-282, and the aspects of its design that the USAF saw as flaws (the single-engine and light load factor) appealed to Donovan, a sailplane enthusiast who believed that a sailplane was the type of high-altitude aircraft the panel was seeking.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 24\u201326.</ref>\n\n[[Edwin Land]], the developer of instant photography and another member of the panel proposed to Dulles through Dulles' aide, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]], that his agency should fund and operate this aircraft. Land considered that if the military, rather than the CIA, operated the CL-282 during peacetime it could provoke a war. Although Dulles remained reluctant to have the CIA conduct its own overflights, Land and [[James Killian]] of [[MIT]] told [[President Eisenhower]] about the aircraft; Eisenhower agreed that the CIA should be the operator. Dulles finally agreed, but some USAF officers opposed the project because they feared it would endanger the RB-57D and X-16. The USAF's Seaberg helped persuade his own agency to support the CL-282, albeit with the higher-performance J57 engine, and final approval for a joint USAF-CIA project (the first time the CIA dealt with sophisticated technology) came in November 1954. Lockheed had meanwhile become busy with other projects and had to be persuaded to accept the CL-282 contract after approval.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 29\u201337.</ref>\n\n===Manufacture===\nBissell became head of the project, which used covert funding; under the [[Central Intelligence Agency Act]] of 1949, the [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA's director]] is the only federal government employee who can spend \"un-vouchered\" government money. Lockheed received a $22.5 million contract (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|22.5|1955|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) in March 1955 for the first 20 aircraft, with the first $1.26 million (${{inflation|US|1.26|1955|r=2|fmt=c}} million today) mailed to Johnson's home in February 1955 to keep work going during negotiations. The company agreed to deliver the first aircraft by July of that year and the last by November 1956. It did so, and for $3.5 million (${{inflation|US|3.5|1956|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) under budget.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 39\u201345.</ref> The Flight Test Engineer in charge was [[Joseph F. Ware Jr.]]<ref>Cefaratt 2002, pp. 78, 158.</ref>\n\nProcurement of the aircraft's components occurred secretly. When Johnson ordered altimeters calibrated to {{convert|80000|ft|m|-2}} from a company whose instruments only went to {{convert|45000|ft|m|-2}}, the CIA set up a cover story involving experimental rocket aircraft. [[Shell Oil]] developed a new low-volatility, low vapor pressure jet fuel that would not evaporate at high altitudes; the fuel became known as [[JP-7]], and manufacturing several hundred thousand gallons for the aircraft in 1955 caused a nationwide shortage of Esso's [[FLIT]] insecticide. The aircraft was renamed the U-2 in July 1955, the same month the first aircraft, Article 341, was delivered to [[Groom Lake]]. The \"U\" referred to the deliberately vague [[United States Department of Defense aerospace vehicle designation|designation]] \"utility\" instead of \"R\" for \"reconnaissance\", and the [[de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter|U-1]] and [[Cessna 310|U-3]] aircraft already existed.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 59\u201362, 66.</ref> The CIA assigned the cryptonym AQUATONE to the project, with the USAF using the name OILSTONE for their support to the CIA.<ref>Pocock 2005, p. 24.</ref>\n\n[[File:U2 Camera.JPG|thumb|U-2 camera on display at the [[National Air and Space Museum]]]]\n[[James Gilbert Baker|James Baker]] developed the optics for a large-format camera to be used in the U-2 while working for [[Perkin-Elmer]]. The new camera had a resolution of {{convert|2.5|ft|cm|sigfig=2|sp=us}} from an altitude of {{convert|60000|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"I&T\"/> The aircraft was so crowded that when Baker asked Johnson for {{convert|6|in|cm|spell=in|adj=pre|more}} of space for a lens with a {{convert|240|in|cm|adj=on}} focal length, Johnson replied \"I'd sell my grandmother for six more inches!\"; Baker instead used a {{convert|180|in|cm|adj=on}} f/13.85 lens in a {{cvt|13|x|13|in|cm||}} format for his final design.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 54\u201355.</ref>\n\n===Fuel===\nThe U-2 has used Jet Propellant Thermally Stable ([[JPTS]]) since the aircraft's development in the 1950s. JPTS is a high thermal stability, high altitude [[Jet fuel|fuel]], created specifically for the U-2. JPTS has a lower freeze point, higher viscosity, and higher thermal stability than standard USAF fuels. In 1999, USAF spent approximately $11.3 million (equivalent to ${{inflation|US|11.3|1999|r=1|fmt=c}} million today) on fuel for the U-2 aircraft and was looking for a lower cost alternative. JPTS is a specialty fuel and as such has limited worldwide availability and costs over three times the per-gallon price of USAF's primary jet fuel, [[JP-8]]. Research was carried out to find a cheaper and easier alternative involving additives to generally used jet fuels. A JP-8 based alternative, JP-8+100LT, was being considered in 2001. JP-8+100 has increased thermal stability by {{convert|100|F-change|C-change}} over stock JP-8, and is only 0.5 cents per gallon more expensive; low-temperature additives can be blended to this stock to achieve desired cold performance.<ref name=\"Simms\">{{cite journal |last=Simms |first=Christian G. |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a391242.pdf |title= JP-8+100LT: A low cost replacement of JPTS as the primary fuel for the U-2 aircraft? |publisher=[[Air Force Institute of Technology]] |date=March 2001 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the small landing gear, a perfect balance in the fuel tanks was essential for a safe landing. Similarly to [[sailplane]]s, the U-2 had a [[yaw string]] on the canopy to detect slip or skid during the approach. A skid during flight with no bank was the hint of an imbalance around the longitudinal axis which could be resolved by moving the fuel to the left or right wing tank.<ref>{{cite interview |last=LaRue |first=Carl |subject-link= |interviewer=Markus V\u00f6lter |title=Omega Tau Podcast Episode 109 \u2013 Flying the U-2 Dragon Lady |url= http://omegataupodcast.net/109-flying-the-u-2-dragon-lady/|publisher= Omega Tau Podcast|date=12 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Radar cross-section reduction===\nWhen the first overflights of the Soviet Union were tracked by radar, the CIA initiated [[Project Rainbow]] to reduce the U-2's [[radar cross-section]]. This effort ultimately proved unsuccessful, and work began on a follow-on aircraft, which resulted in the [[Lockheed A-12]] ''Oxcart''.<ref>Suhler 2009, p. 45.</ref>\n\n===Possible successor===\nIn August 2015, the 60th anniversary of the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works revealed they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, referred to as the UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned [[Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk]] and improving upon them. Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to USAF several times but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. USAF has no requirement or timeframe for a next-generation [[High-Altitude Long Endurance]] (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early. The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the [[RQ-3 DarkStar]], which never made it past flight testing and was canceled.<ref>[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/lockheed-skunk-works-designing-next-gen-u-2-spy-plane-415842/ \"Lockheed Skunk Works designing next-gen U-2 spy plane\"].

Its name was changed to mean \"tactical reconnaissance\" to reflect its purpose as an affordable peace and wartime ISR aircraft, distinguishing it from strategic, penetrating SR-71-class platforms; TR is a reference to the short-lived rebranding of the U-2 as the TR-1 in the 1980s. Size, and thus cost, is kept down by having less endurance than the Global Hawk at around 20 hours, which is still about the same time as a normal RQ-4 sortie even though it is capable of flying for 34 hours. The TR-X concept is aimed squarely at USAF needs, and is not currently being marketed to the CIA or other government agencies. It would have increased power and cooling to accommodate new sensors, communication equipment, [[electronic warfare]] suites, and perhaps offensive or defensive [[directed-energy weapon|laser weapons]]. TR-X could be ready for service in the 2025 timeframe, with a fleet of 25\u201330 aircraft proposed to replace the nearly 40-aircraft mix of U-2s and RQ-4s.<ref>Drew, James.

However, at lower altitudes the higher air density and lack of a power-assisted control system makes the aircraft very difficult to fly: control inputs must be extreme to achieve the desired response, and a great deal of physical strength is needed to operate the controls. The U-2 is very sensitive to crosswinds, which, together with its tendency to float over the runway, makes the aircraft notoriously difficult to land. As it approaches the runway, the cushion of air provided by the high-lift wings in [[Ground effect (aircraft)|ground effect]] is so pronounced that the U-2 will not land unless the wings are fully stalled. A landing U-2 is accompanied on the ground by a [[Chase plane|chase car]], which is driven by a second U-2 pilot who assists the landing U-2 by reporting the aircraft's altitude and attitude.<ref>Hennigan, W.J.

The rear wheels are coupled to the rudder to provide steering during taxiing. To maintain balance while taxiing and take-off, two auxiliary wheels called \"pogos\" are attached under the wings. These fit into sockets underneath each wing at about mid-span, and fall off at takeoff. To protect the wings during landing, each wingtip has a titanium skid. After the U-2 comes to a halt, the ground crew re-installs the pogos, then the aircraft taxis to parking.<ref>Bennett, Christopher W.

Nonetheless, the USAF substantially participated in the project; Bissell described it as a \"49 percent\" partner. The USAF agreed to select and train pilots and plot missions, while the CIA would handle cameras and project security, process film, and arrange foreign bases.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 60\u201361.</ref>\n\nBeyond not using American military personnel to fly the U-2, Eisenhower preferred to use non-U.S. citizens. Seven Greek pilots and a Polish expatriate were added to the U-2 trainees although only two of the Greek pilots were subsequently allowed to fly the aircraft. Their flight proficiency was poor. The language barrier and a lack of appropriate flying experience proved problematic; by late 1955, foreign pilots had been dropped from the program.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 73\u201374.</ref><ref>\"Eyes in the Sky\", Dino Brugioni 2010, Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|978 1 59114 082 5}}, p.106</ref> USAF pilots had to resign their military commissions before joining the agency as civilians, a process referred to as \"sheep dipping\",<ref name=\"I&T\"/> and were always called \"drivers\", not pilots. The program only recruited fighter pilots with reserve USAF commissions, as regular commissions complicated the resignation process. The program offered high salaries and the USAF promised that pilots could return at the same rank as their peers. The CIA's standards for selection were higher than the USAF's once the latter began its own U-2 flights; although more candidates were rejected, the CIA's program had a much lower accident rate. Test pilot [[Tony LeVier]] trained other Lockheed pilots to fly the U-2. By September 1955 he had trained six USAF pilots, who in turn trained other \"sheep-dipped\" pilots. As no two-seat trainer model was available for the program's first 15 years, training was done before the trainee's first solo flight and via radio. Pilots had to adjust to the U-2's unusual combination of jet engines and enormous, high-lift glider wings; because of the \"coffin corner\" they learned of the need to pay complete attention to flying when not using the autopilot.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 59, 74\u201376.</ref>\n\n====Test flights====\n[[File:U2-Cockpit 1.jpg|thumb|Pilot view within the U-2 cockpit.

The lake bed had no markings, making it difficult for LeVier to judge the distance to the ground, and the brakes proved too weak; he bounced the U-2 once before it stopped rolling, but the aircraft suffered only minor damage. LeVier again found landing the U-2 difficult during the first intentional test flight three days later. On his sixth try, he found that landing the aircraft by touching down on the rear wheel first was better than making the initial touchdown with the front wheel. Pilots continued to have difficulty during landing, due to the ground effect holding the aircraft off the runway for long distances. On a test flight on 8 August, the U-2 reached {{convert|32000|ft|m|-2}}, proving that Johnson had met his promised specifications and deadline. By 16 August, the prototype flew at {{convert|52000|ft|m|-2}}, an altitude never before reached in sustained flight; by 8 September, it reached {{convert|65000|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 68\u201371.</ref>\n\nBy January 1956, the U-2 had so impressed the USAF that it decided to obtain its own aircraft. The USAF purchased a total of 31 U-2s through the CIA; the transaction's code name, Project DRAGON LADY,<!-- NOTE: DRAGON LADY is all-caps here, in CIA codeword context; elsewhere, it is used as the name of the aircraft, which is written about in mixed case in sources. (AlanM1) --> was the origin of the aircraft's nickname. Meanwhile, U-2s conducted eight overflights of the U.S. in April 1956, convincing project overseers that the aircraft was ready for deployment. As often happens with new aircraft designs, there were several operational accidents. One occurred during these test flights, when a U-2 suffered a [[flameout]] over Tennessee; the pilot calculated that he could reach New Mexico. Every air base in the continental U.S. had sealed orders on what to do if a U-2 landed. The commander of [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] near [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] was told to open his orders, prepare for the arrival of an unusual aircraft making a [[deadstick landing]], and get it inside a hangar as soon as possible. The U-2 successfully landed after gliding for more than {{convert|300|mi|km}}, and its strange, glider-like appearance and the space-suited pilot startled the base commander and other witnesses.<ref name=\"U&O\">Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 76\u201379.</ref>\n\nNot all U-2 incidents were so benign, with three fatal accidents in 1956 alone. The first was on 15 May 1956, when the pilot stalled the aircraft during a post-takeoff maneuver that was intended to drop off the wingtip outrigger wheels. The second occurred on 31 August, when the pilot stalled the aircraft immediately after takeoff. On 17 September, a third aircraft disintegrated during ascent in Germany, also killing the pilot.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 79\u201380.</ref> There were other non-fatal incidents, including at least one that resulted in the loss of the aircraft.\n\n====Cover story====\nA committee of Army, Navy, USAF, CIA, [[National Security Agency|NSA]], and [[United States State Department|State Department]] representatives created lists of priority targets for U-2 and other intelligence-gathering methods. The U-2 project received the list and drew up flight plans, and the committee provided a detailed rationale for each plan for the president to consider as he decided whether to approve it. The CIA's Photo Intelligence Division grew in size to prepare for the expected flood of U-2 photographs. Before the aircraft became operational, however, USAF's [[Project Genetrix]], which used high-altitude balloons to photograph the Soviet Union, China, and eastern Europe, led to many [[diplomatic protest]]s from those countries and for a while CIA officials feared that the U-2 project was at risk. While Genetrix was also a technical failure\u2014only 34 of the 516 balloons returned usable photographs\u2014the balloon flights gave the United States many clues on how the Communist countries used radar to track overflights, which benefited the U-2 program.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 80\u201388.</ref>\n\nWith approval from the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA)'s director [[Hugh Dryden]], Bissell's team at the CIA developed a cover story for the U-2 that described the aircraft as used by NACA for high-altitude weather research; the cover story would be used if the aircraft were lost over hostile territory. U-2s flew some real weather-related missions, taking photographs that appeared in the press,{{r|cia1992_89_90_156_157_216}}{{r|afmag-richelson}} but few believed in the cover story; in May 1957 the UK's ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper reported the U-2 operating east of the [[Iron Curtain]].{{r|afmag-richelson}}\n\nThe civilian advisers Land and Killian disagreed with the cover story, advising that in case of an aircraft loss, the United States forthrightly acknowledge its use of U-2 overflights \"to guard against surprise attack\". Their advice was not followed, and the weather cover story led to the disaster that followed the May 1960 U-2 loss.<ref name=\"cia1992_89_90_156_157_216\">Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 89\u201390, 156\u2013157, 216.</ref>\n\n====First overflights of Communist territory====\nThe British government in January 1956 approved the U-2's deployment from [[RAF Lakenheath]]. NACA announced that the USAF [[Air Weather Service]] would use a Lockheed-developed aircraft to study the weather and cosmic rays at altitudes up to 55,000&nbsp;feet; accordingly, the first CIA detachment of U-2s (\"Detachment A\") was known publicly as the 1st Weather Reconnaissance Squadron, Provisional (WRSP-1). The death in April 1956, however, of British agent [[Lionel Crabb]] while examining Soviet ships in [[Portsmouth]] harbor embarrassed the British government, which asked the United States to postpone the Lakenheath flights. To avoid delays, in June 1956, Detachment A moved to [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, without approval from the German government, while [[Giebelstadt Army Airfield]] was prepared as a more permanent base.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 93\u201395.</ref>\n\nEisenhower remained concerned that despite their great intelligence value, overflights of the Soviet Union might cause a war. While the U-2 was under development, at the [[Geneva Summit (1955)|1955 Geneva Summit]] he proposed to [[Nikita Khrushchev]] that the Soviet Union and the United States would each grant the other country airfields to use to photograph military installations. Khrushchev rejected the \"Open Skies\" proposal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eisenhower |title=Mandate for Change, 1953-56. |date=1963 |publisher=Heinemann |isbn=978-0434225804 |page=521}}</ref> The CIA told the president that the Soviets could not track high-altitude U-2 flights; this belief was based on studies using old Soviet radar systems and American systems that were not as effective at high altitudes as current Soviet systems, of which the U.S. was not aware. Knutson later said that \"the U-2 was really quite invisible to American radar, but Russian radar were a little different \u2013 better, you might say\". Although the Office of Scientific Intelligence issued a more cautious report in May 1956 that stated that detection was possible, it believed that the Soviets could not consistently track the aircraft. Dulles further told Eisenhower, according to presidential aide [[Andrew Goodpaster]], that in any aircraft loss the pilot would almost certainly not survive. With such assurances and the growing demand for accurate intelligence regarding the alleged \"[[bomber gap]]\" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in June 1956 Eisenhower approved 10 days of overflights.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 96\u2013100.</ref>{{r|cnncoldwarknutson}}\n\nThe first U-2 overflight had already occurred, using existing authorization of air force overflights over Eastern Europe. On 20 June 1956, a U-2 flew over Poland and East Germany, with more flights on 2 July. The fact that radar had\u2014contrary to the CIA's expectations\u2014successfully tracked the aircraft worried Eisenhower, but he approved the first Soviet overflight, Mission 2013 on 4 July. U-2 Article 347's main targets were the Soviet submarine construction program in [[Leningrad]], and counting the numbers of the new [[Myasishchev M-4]] \"Bison\" bomber. A second flight on 5 July continued searching for Bisons, took photographs of Moscow (the only ones taken by the program), and flew over cloud-covered<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gruntman |first1=Mike |title=Intercept 1961: the birth of Soviet missile defense |location=Figs 4.8,4.9,4.10 |isbn=978-1624103490 |page=73-78 |edition=Firstition}}</ref> rocket factories at Kaliningrad and Khimki. Eisenhower knew from the earlier overflights that his hope of no Soviet detection was unrealistic, but ordered that the overflights stop if the aircraft could be tracked. The CIA found that the Soviets could not consistently track the U-2s, and they therefore did not know that Moscow and Leningrad had been overflown. The aircraft's photographs showed tiny images of MiG-15s and MiG-17s attempting and failing to intercept the aircraft, proving that the Soviets could not shoot down an operational U-2.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 100\u2013108.</ref> Knutson recalled that the \"constant stream of Russian fighters\" trying to shoot down the U-2 during overflights was sometimes \"so thick\" that they interfered with photographs. Repeatedly failing for years to stop the aircraft embarrassed the USSR, which made diplomatic protests against the flights but did not publicize the penetration of Soviet territory.{{r|cnncoldwarknutson}}\n\nU-2 missions from Wiesbaden would depart westward in order to gain altitude over friendly territory before turning eastward at operational altitudes. The NATO Air Defence mission in that area included [[No. 1 Air Division RCAF (Europe)]], which operated the [[Canadair Sabre]] Mark 6 from bases in northeastern France. This aircraft had a service ceiling of 54,000&nbsp;feet and numerous encounters between the U-2 and RCAF 'ZULU' alert flights have been recorded for posterity.<ref>Gummeson, Ray.

Retrieved: 25 October 2012.</ref>\n\n====\"Bomber gap\" disproven====\n{{main|Bomber gap}}\n\nOn 10 July, the Soviets protested what they described as overflights by a USAF \"twin-engine medium bomber\", apparently believing that it was a Canberra. The U.S. replied on 19 July that no American \"military planes\" had overflown the Soviet Union, but the fact that the Soviets' report showed that they could track the U-2s for extended periods caused Eisenhower to immediately halt overflights over eastern Europe. Beyond the Soviet protests, the president was concerned about American public reaction to news that the U.S. had violated international law. To avoid project cancellation, the CIA began [[Project Rainbow]] to make the U-2 less detectable. The eight overflights over communist territory, however, had already shown that the bomber gap did not exist; the U-2s had not found any [[Myasishchev M-4]] Bison bombers at the nine bases they had visited. Because the Eisenhower administration could not disclose the source of its intelligence, however, Congressional and public debate over the bomber gap continued.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 100\u2013112.</ref>\n\n====Suez Crisis and aftermath====\nThe presidential order did not restrict U-2 flights outside eastern Europe. In May 1956, Turkey approved the deployment of Detachment B at [[Incirlik Air Base]], near [[Adana, Turkey]]. Before the new detachment was ready, however, Detachment A in late August used Adana as a refueling base to photograph the Mediterranean. The aircraft found evidence of many British troops on Malta and Cyprus as the United Kingdom prepared for its forthcoming [[Suez Crisis|intervention in Suez]]. The U.S. released some of the photographs to the British government. As the crisis grew in seriousness, the project converted from a source of strategic reconnaissance, which prioritized high quality over speed (the film was processed by its maker, then analyzed in Washington), to a tactical reconnaissance unit that provided immediate analysis. The Photo Intelligence Division set up a lab at Wiesbaden; as Detachment B took over from A and flew over targets that remain classified {{as of|2013|07|lc=y}}, the Wiesbaden lab's rapid reports helped the U.S. government to predict the Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt three days before it began on 29 October. On 1 November a flight flew over the Egyptian air base at Almaza twice, 10 minutes apart; in between the British and French attacked the base, and the visible results of the attack in the \"10-minute reconnaissance\" impressed Eisenhower. Beginning on 5 November, flights over Syria showed that the Soviets had not sent aircraft there despite their threats against the British, French and Israelis, a cause of worry for the U.S.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 113\u2013120.</ref>\n\nIn the four years following the Suez Crisis, repeated U-2 missions over the Middle East were launched, particularly in times of tension.  The end of the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] saw a decline in U-2 operations, although Detachment B U-2s operating from Turkey still sometimes overflew the Middle East along with occasional missions over [[Albania]] to check for Soviet missile activity. [[Israel]] was a major target of U-2 missions during this period, with U-2 missions detecting the construction of the [[Shimon Peres Negev Nuclear Research Center|Negev Nuclear Research Center]] in 1958, first bringing [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|Israel's nuclear program]] to the attention of the US. The overflights drew the attention of the [[Israeli Air Force]].  Its radars detected and tracked the overflights, and on numerous occasions Israeli fighter aircraft were scrambled to intercept them, but were unable to reach them due to their altitude. The Israeli defense establishment was baffled by the overflights. However, Israeli fighter pilots were twice able to spot the intruding aircraft. On 11 March 1959, two Israeli [[Dassault Super Myst\u00e8re|Super Mystere]] fighters were directed to intercept a U-2 detected over Israel by Israeli ground-based radar. Although the aircraft were unable to make an intercept, the formation leader, Major [[Yosef Alon]], managed to get a good look at the aircraft. He subsequently identified it out of a book as a U-2, which was registered as a weather reconnaissance aircraft to the US Weather Service at the time. On 22 July 1959, after an overflight was detected, an Israeli Air Force [[Sud Aviation Vautour|Vautour]] jet was deployed to photograph the mysterious aircraft. The Vautour came within visual range and the U-2 was successfully photographed. In spite of this, it was not until the 1960 shootdown of a U-2 over the Soviet Union and its subsequent public exposure as a spy plane that the Israeli defense establishment understood the identity of the mystery aircraft.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/u-s-u-2-planes-flew-over-israel-in-1950s-1.5293435|title=U.S. Espionage Planes Violated Israeli Airspace in the 1950s, IAF Archives Reveal|date=2012-08-30|work=Haaretz|access-date=2019-12-18|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780679415633|url-access=registration|quote=Ehud Yonay.|title=No Margin for Error: The Making of the Israeli Air Force|last=Yonay|first=Ehud|date=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=978-0-679-41563-3|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iaf.org.il/4385-39415-en/IAF.aspx|title=The Israeli Air Force : Mysterious Spyplane Revealed|website=www.iaf.org.il|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref>\n\n====Renewal of Eastern Bloc overflights====\nEisenhower refused CIA pleas in September 1956 to reauthorize overflights of Eastern Europe but the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] in November, and [[1956 United States presidential election|his reelection that month]], caused the president to permit flights over border areas. Soviet interceptors could still not reach the U-2s but, after the Soviets protested a December overflight of Vladivostok by RB-57Ds, Eisenhower again forbade communist overflights. Flights close to the border continued, now including the first [[ELINT]]-equipped U-2s. In May 1957, Eisenhower again authorized overflights over certain important Soviet missile and atomic facilities. He continued to personally authorize each flight, closely examining maps and sometimes making changes to the flight plan.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 122\u2013124, 126\u2013128.</ref> By 1957, one of the European units was based at Giebelstadt, and the far eastern unit was based at the [[Naval Air Facility Atsugi]], Japan.<ref name=\"CIA0000743239\">[http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000743239.pdf \"Future Plans for Project AQUATONE/OILSTONE.\"] ''Central Intelligence Agency'', 29 July 1957, p. 2.

On 2 April 1957, a RAINBOW test flight crashed in Nevada, killing the pilot. The U-2's large wingspan slowed its descent during crashes, often leaving its remains salvageable; Lockheed was able to rebuild the wreckage from the incident into a flyable airframe, but that it could do so should have been evidence to the CIA that its cover story might not be viable after a crash in hostile territory.

The president sought to avoid angering the Soviets as he worked to achieve a [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty|nuclear test ban]]; meanwhile the Soviets began trying to shoot down U-2 flights that never entered Soviet airspace, and the details in their diplomatic protests showed that Soviet radar operators were able to effectively track the aircraft. To reduce visibility Lockheed [[military camouflage|painted the aircraft in a blue-black color]] that helped them blend in against the darkness of space, and the CIA aircraft received the more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J75-P-13]] engine that increased maximum altitude by {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}}, to {{convert|74600|ft|m|-2}}.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 143\u2013144, 147\u2013152.</ref>\n\nThe Soviets developed their own overflight aircraft, variants of the [[Yakovlev Yak-25|Yak-25]], which in addition to photographing various parts of the world through the early 1960s acted as a target for the new [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21|MiG-21]] interceptors to practice for the U-2.\n\nIn April 1958, CIA source [[Pyotr Semyonovich Popov]] told his handler [[George Kisevalter]] that a senior KGB official had boasted of having \"full technical details\" of the U-2, leading Bissell to conclude the project had a leak.

The U-2 intelligence caused Eisenhower to state in a press conference on 9 October that the launch did \"not raise my apprehensions, not one iota\", but he refused to disclose the U-2's existence as he believed that the Soviets would demand the end of the flights.<ref name=\"smith2012\">Smith 2012, pp. 731\u2013732, 734.</ref> In December 1958 [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] boasted that a Soviet missile could deliver a 5-megaton warhead {{convert|8000|mi|km}}. Although the Soviets' [[SS-6 Sapwood]] missile program was actually stalled due to technical failures, subsequent boasts\u2014and U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Neil McElroy]]'s statement in February 1959 to Congress that the Soviets might have a three-to-one temporary advantage in ICBMs during the early 1960s\u2014caused widespread concern in the U.S. about the existence of a \"missile gap\". The American intelligence community was divided, with the CIA suspecting technical delays but the USAF believing that the SS-6 was ready for deployment. Khrushchev continued to exaggerate the Soviet program's success; the missile gap concerns, and CIA and State Department support, caused Eisenhower to reauthorize one Communist territory overflight in July 1959 after 16 months, as well as many [[ELINT]] flights along the Soviet border. British U-2 overflights were made in December and February 1960. The first one targeted a large segment of the railways in the Tyuratam test range area as ballistic missiles were expected to be deployed close to rail lines, as well as nuclear complexes and missile test sites. No sites were found.<ref>\"Eyes in the Sky\", Dino Brugioni 2010, Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|978 1 59114 082 5}}, p. 342</ref> Neither flight proved or disproved the existence of a \"missile gap\".

Despite the much increased risk, the CIA did not stop the overflights as they were overconfident following the years of successful missions, and because of the strong demand for more missile-site photographs\u2014the U-2 was the major source of covert intelligence on the Soviet Union, and had photographed about 15% of the country, producing almost 5,500 intelligence reports. The April flight was indeed tracked quickly, and Khrushchev said in his memoir that it should have been shot down by new SAMs, but the missile crews were slow to react.<ref name=\"pedlow1992_157_169_172_316\">Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 157, 169\u2013172, 316.</ref><ref name=\"cia1960summit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/sherman-kent-and-the-board-of-national-estimates-collected-essays/8summit.html|title=The Summit Conference of 1960: An Intelligence Officer's View \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref>\n\n====May 1960: U-2 shot down====\n{{main|1960 U-2 incident}}\n[[File:OperationGrandSlam1960.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|U-2 \"GRAND SLAM\" flight plan on 1 May 1960, from CIA publication 'The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance; The U-2 And Oxcart Programs, 1954\u20131974', declassified 25 June 2013.]]\n\nEisenhower authorized one more overflight, which was to be made no later than 1 May because the important Paris Summit of the [[Big Four Conference]] would begin on 16 May.{{r|pedlow1992_157_169_172_316}}{{r|cia1960summit}} The CIA chose for the mission\u2014the 24th deep-penetration Soviet overflight\u2014Operation GRAND SLAM, an ambitious flight plan for the first crossing of the Soviet Union from [[Peshawar, Pakistan]] to [[Bod\u00f8, Norway]]; previous flights had always exited in the direction from which they had entered. The route would permit visits to [[Baikonur Cosmodrome|Tyuratam]], [[Yekaterinberg|Sverdlovsk]], [[Kirov, Kirov Oblast|Kirov]], [[Kotlas]], [[Severodvinsk]], and [[Murmansk]]. It was expected, given good weather, to resolve missile, nuclear and nuclear submarine intelligence issues with one flight.<ref>\"Eyes in the Sky\", Dino Brugioni 2010, Naval Institute Press, {{ISBN|978 1 59114 082 5}}, p.345</ref> [[Francis Gary Powers]], the most experienced pilot with 27 missions, was chosen for the flight. After delays, the flight began on [[International Workers' Day|May Day]], 1 May. This was a mistake because, as an important Soviet holiday, there was much less air traffic than usual. The Soviets began tracking the U-2 15&nbsp;miles outside the border, and over Sverdlovsk, four and a half hours into the flight, one of three [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] missiles detonated behind the aircraft at 70,500&nbsp;feet; another hit a Soviet interceptor attempting to reach the American aircraft. The U-2 crashed but Powers survived the near miss and was quickly captured; the crash did not destroy the U-2 and the Soviets were able to identify much of the equipment.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 170\u2013177.</ref>\n\n[[File:KellyJohnsonandGaryPowers.jpg|thumb|right|Kelly Johnson and Gary Powers in front of a U-2]]\nBissell and other project officials believed that surviving a U-2 accident from above 70,000&nbsp;feet was impossible, so they used the pre-existing cover story. On 3 May, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA, the successor to NACA) announced that one of its aircraft, making a high-altitude research flight in Turkey, was missing; the government planned to say, if necessary, that the NASA aircraft had drifted with an incapacitated pilot across the Soviet border. By remaining silent, Khrushchev lured the Americans into reinforcing the cover story until he revealed on 7 May that Powers was alive and had confessed to spying on the Soviet Union. Eisenhower turned down Dulles' offer to resign and publicly took full responsibility for the incident on 11 May; by then all overflights were canceled. The Paris Summit collapsed after Khrushchev, as the first speaker, demanded an apology from the U.S., which Eisenhower refused.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 177\u2013181.</ref>\n\nU-2 pilots were told if captured, Knutson later said, \"to tell them everything that they knew\", because they were told little about their missions other than targets on maps.{{r|cnncoldwarknutson}} Otherwise, Powers had little instruction on what to do during an interrogation. Although he had been told that he could reveal everything about the aircraft since the Soviets could learn what they wanted from it, Powers did his best to conceal classified information while appearing to cooperate. His trial began on 17 August 1960. Powers\u2014who apologized on advice of his Soviet defense counsel\u2014was sentenced to three years in prison, but on 10 February 1962 the USSR exchanged him and American student [[Frederic Pryor]] for [[Rudolf Abel]] at [[Glienicke Bridge]] between West Berlin and Potsdam, Germany. Two CIA investigations found that Powers had done well during the interrogation and had \"complied with his obligations as an American citizen during this period\". Although the government was reluctant to reinstate him to the USAF because of its statements that the U-2 program was civilian, it had promised to do so after CIA employment ended; Powers resolved the dilemma by choosing to work for Lockheed as a U-2 pilot.<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 181\u2013186.</ref>\n\nThe debris of Powers' aircraft was used to design a copy under the name [[Beriev S-13]].

William Gregory, at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California where the CIA had relocated the U-2 program after nuclear testing forced it to abandon Groom Lake in 1957.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe CIA sought to determine if the U-2 could, from a fixed base at North Edwards, rapidly deploy to an advanced American base and complete reconnaissance flights on a largely self-sustaining basis.  A proving exercise was arranged with Gregory and the new Detachment G unit to simulate deploying a U-2 unit overseas, taking two or three aircraft, and conducting three reconnaissance missions with no resupply.  The exercise was critical to continued CIA operation of the U-2, since basing the aircraft in a foreign country was no longer an option. The exercise was completed with excellent results, and actual reconnaissance missions began to be scheduled immediately.<ref>Robert Richardson, Spying from the Sky, 2020, pp. 186-187.</ref>\n\nOn 4 January 1961, the CIA U-2 reconnaissance effort, which was formerly known as CHALICE, was redesignated IDEALIST.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP63-00313A000600070037-9.pdf REDESIGNATION OF CIA PROJECT INVOLVING UTILIZATION OF U-2 AIRCRAFT FOR RECONNAISSANCE PURPOSES AS PROJECT IDEALIST, January 4, 1961, CIA-RDP63-00313A000600070037-9, Central Intelligence Agency.]</ref> This program codeword by the end of the decade was being used to describe the U.S. reconnaissance along the Chinese coastline, while Taiwanese missions into the Chinese country would be known as the IDEALIST program<ref name=\"cia1969\"/>\n\nBy the next U-2 flight, in October 1960 over Cuba, the previously informal procedure in which the president personally approved or disapproved each flight after discussion with advisors was replaced by the [[National Security Council (United States)|National Security Council]] Special Group.

Although Lockheed modified six CIA aircraft into the [[aerial refueling]]-capable U-2F model in 1961, permitting some Cuba missions to originate from Edwards, pilot fatigue limited flights to about 10 hours. An August 1962 flight showed Soviet SA-2 SAM sites on the island; later overflights found more sites and MiG-21 interceptors. The increasing number of SAMs caused the United States to more cautiously plan Cuban overflights. USAF U-2s did not conduct overflights, but officials believed that it would be better for a military officer to be the pilot in case he was shot down. Following one last Cuba overflight that originated from Edwards and ended at [[McCoy Air Force Base]], Florida on 14 October 1962, all further U-2 operations over Cuba originated from a detachment operating location that was established at McCoy.<ref>[http://www.blackbirds.net/u2/u2-timeline/u2tl60.html \"U-2 Timeline of Events, 1960s.\"] ''Blackbirds.net'', 7 August 1997.

U.S. Navy pilot John Newlin, flying an [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4B]] assigned to VF-74, was scrambled from [[Naval Air Station Key West]], ordered to intercept Hickman before he violated Cuban airspace, and, if necessary, shoot him down.

The Indonesian government soon defeated the rebels, however, and the U-2s returned to Japan. That year, Detachment C also flew over the Chinese coast near [[Quemoy]] during the [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]] to see if Communist Chinese forces were preparing to invade, and in 1959 aided CIA operations during the [[1959 Tibetan uprising|Tibetan uprising]].

The detachment at [[Bien Hoa AB]], South Vietnam, was redesignated the 349th SRS.<ref name=hobson>Hobson 2001 {{page needed|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe only loss of a U-2 during combat operations occurred on 8 October 1966, when Major Leo Stewart, flying with the 349th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron, developed mechanical problems high over North Vietnam. The U-2 managed to return to South Vietnam where Stewart ejected safely. The U-2 crashed near its base at Bien Hoa. In July 1970, the 349th SRS at Bien Hoa moved to Thailand and was redesignated the [[99th Reconnaissance Squadron|99th SRS]] in November 1972, remaining there until March 1976.<ref>Hobson 2001, p. 269.</ref>\n\n====U-2 carrier operations====\nAt one time, in an effort to extend the U-2's operating range and to eliminate the need for foreign government approval for U-2 operations from USAF bases in foreign countries, it was suggested that the U-2 be operated from aircraft carriers. Three aircraft were converted for carrier operations by the installation of arrester hooks, and carrier-qualified naval aviators were recruited to fly them.\n\nIt turned out to be possible to take off and land a U-2 from a carrier. Testing in 1964 with the [[USS Ranger (CV-61)|USS ''Ranger'']] and in 1969 with the [[USS America (CV-66)|USS ''America'']] proved the concept. The only operational carrier use occurred in May 1964 when a U-2, operating from USS ''Ranger'', was used to spy on a French atomic test in the Pacific.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kristinhillartist.com/FishHawk_article.html |title=Operation Fish Hawk \u2013 Secret CIA mission \u2013 U-2 reconnaissance flight \u2013 1964 French nuclear test on Mururoa Atoll |website=kristinhillartist.com |author= Kristin Hill |date= 2014 |access-date= 4 November 2019}}</ref><ref>https://theaviationist.com/2015/06/28/u-2-carrier-operations-story/</ref>\n\nIn 1969, the larger U-2Rs were flown from the carrier {{USS|America|CV-66|2}}.

Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] agreed with the plan, and four RAF officers were sent to Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas for training in May 1958. On 8 July, the senior British pilot, [[Squadron Leader]] Christopher H. Walker, was killed when his U-2 malfunctioned and crashed near Wayside, Texas. This was the first death involving the U-2, and the circumstances were not disclosed for over 50 years. Another pilot was quickly selected and sent to replace Walker. After training, the group of RAF U-2 pilots arrived in Turkey in November 1958, shortly after the CIA's Detachment B from Adana provided valuable intelligence during the [[1958 Lebanon crisis]] with both the United States and United Kingdom involvement. Since the September 1956 disclosure of Mediterranean photographs, the United Kingdom had received U-2 intelligence, except during the Suez Crisis. The CIA and Eisenhower viewed using British pilots as a way of increasing [[plausible deniability]] for the flights. The CIA also saw British participation as a way of obtaining additional Soviet overflights that the president would not authorize. The United Kingdom gained the ability to target flights toward areas of the world the United States was less interested in, and possibly avoid another Suez-like interruption of U-2 photographs.<ref name=\"lashmar19970126\"/><ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, pp. 152\u2013156, 181.</ref>\n\nAlthough the RAF unit operated as part of Detachment B, the UK formally received title to the U-2s their pilots would fly, and Eisenhower wrote to Macmillan that because of the separate lines of authority, the nations were conducting \"two complementary programs rather than a joint one\".<ref>Pedlow and Welzenbach 1992, p. 156.</ref> A secret [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] bank account paid the RAF pilots, whose cover was employment with the [[Meteorological Office]].

To create misdirection typical of the time, the unit was created under the cover of high altitude weather research missions for ROCAF. To the U.S. government, the 35th Squadron and any U.S. CIA/USAF personnel assigned to the unit were known as Detachment H on all documents.

Each of the 35th Squadron's operational missions had to be approved by both the U.S. and the ROC presidents beforehand.

For this purpose, the ROC pilots flew as far as [[Gansu]] and other remote regions in northwest China. Some missions, due to mission requirements and range, plus to add some element of surprise, had the 35th Squadron's U-2s flying from or recovered at other U.S. air bases in Southeast Asia and Eastern Asia, such as [[Kunsan Air Base]] in South Korea, or [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base|Takhli]] in Thailand. All U.S. airbases in the region were listed as emergency/alternate recovery airfields and could be used besides the 35th Squadron's home base at Taoyuan Air Base in Taiwan. Initially, all film taken by the Black Cat Squadron would be flown to Okinawa or Guam for processing and development, and the U.S. forces would not share any mission photos with ROC. In the late 1960s, the USAF agreed to share complete sets of mission photos and help set up a photo development and interpretation unit at Taoyuan.\n\nIn 1968, the ROC U-2C/F/G fleet was replaced with the newer U-2R. However, with the overwhelming threats from [[S-75 Dvina|SA-2]] missiles and [[MiG-21]] interceptors, along with the [[rapprochement]] between the U.S. and the PRC, the ROC U-2s stopped entering Chinese airspace, only conducting electronic intelligence-gathering and photo-reconnaissance missions using new Long Range Oblique Reconnaissance (LOROP) cameras on the U-2R from above international waters. The last U-2 mission over mainland China took place on 16 March 1968. After that, all missions had the U-2 fly outside a buffer zone at least {{convert|20|nmi|km|sigfig=2|sp=us}} around China.\n\nDuring his visit to China in 1972, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] promised the Chinese to cease all reconnaissance missions near and over China, though this was also practical as by 1972 U.S. photo satellites could provide better overhead images without risking losing aircraft and pilots, or provoking international incidents.

Designed for standoff tactical reconnaissance in Europe, the TR-1A was structurally identical to the U-2R. The [[17th Reconnaissance Wing]], [[RAF Alconbury]], England used operational TR-1As from 1983 until 1991. The last U-2 and TR-1 aircraft were delivered to USAF in October 1989. In 1992 all TR-1s were re-designated to U-2R for uniformity across the fleet. The two-seat trainer variant of the TR-1, the ''TR-1B'', was redesignated as the ''TU-2R''.
