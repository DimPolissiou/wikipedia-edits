The four travel to [[Los Angeles]] to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune.\n\nSusan welcomes Kelly and her friends, even promising a third of her inheritance to her niece, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor, Porter Hall, discredits them as \"[[hippies]]\" in an attempt to embezzle her fortune. Undeterred, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]]). The band is so well-received that {{nowrap|Z-Man}} becomes their [[svengali]] manager, changing their name to [[Carrie Nation|The Carrie Nations]] and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.\n\nKelly drifts away from Harris and takes up with Lance Rocke, a high-priced [[male prostitution|gigolo]], who has designs on her inheritance. At first, Harris fends off the sexually aggressive [[pornographic actor|porn star]] Ashley St. Ives, but after losing Kelly, he allows Ashley to seduce him. Ashley soon tires of his conventional nature and inability to perform sexually due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris descends further into heavy drug and alcohol use, leading to a fistfight with Lance and a drug-addled [[one-night stand]] with Casey which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris. Casey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men's foibles, has a [[lesbian]] affair with clothes designer Roxanne, who pressures her to have an [[abortion]].\n\nPetronella has a seemingly enchanted romance with law student Emerson Thorne. After a [[meet cute]] at {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} party, they are shown running slow-motion through golden fields and frolicking in a haystack. Their fairy-tale romance frays when Pet sleeps with Randy Black, a violent prize fighter who beats up Emerson and tries to run him down with a car.\n\nSusan Lake is reunited with her former fianc\u00e9 Baxter Wolfe. The Carrie Nations release records and continue to perform successfully, despite constant touring and [[recreational drug use|drug use]]. Upset at being pushed to the sidelines, Harris attempts [[suicide]] by leaping from the rafters of a sound stage during a television appearance by the band. Harris survives the fall, but becomes [[paraplegic]] from his injuries.\n\nKelly devotes herself to caring for Harris. Emerson forgives Petronella for her infidelity. Casey and Roxanne have a steamy, intimate romance, but this idyllic existence ends when {{nowrap|Z-Man}} invites Casey, Roxanne, and Lance to a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]-fueled party at his house. After {{nowrap|Z-Man}} tries to seduce Lance, who spurns him, he reveals that he has breasts, meaning he has been a female in drag all this time.{{#tag:ref|To quote Roger Ebert: \"Readers who have seen ''BVD'' will know that {{nowrap|Z-Man}} is a rock Svengali who seems to be a gay man for most of the movie, but is finally revealed to be a woman in drag.\"<ref name=ebertfest />|group=N}} {{nowrap|Z-Man}} then goes on a murderous rampage: he beheads Lance with a sword, stabs his servant Otto to death, and shoots Roxanne and Casey, killing them.\n\nResponding to a desperate phone call Casey made shortly before her death, Kelly, Harris, Pet, and Emerson arrive at {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} house and try to subdue him. Petronella is wounded in the melee, which ends in {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} death. Harris is able to move his feet, the start of his recovery from paralysis.\n\nAn epilogue follows, with a preachy, satirical, voice-over monologue and scenes of Kelly and Harris (now in crutches) hiking on a log over a creek, and a final scene with the courthouse wedding of three couples\u2014Kelly and Harris, Pet and Emerson, and Susan and Baxter\u2014with Porter observing from outside the courthouse window.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Dolly Martin|Dolly Read]] as Kelly MacNamara\n*[[Cynthia Myers]] as Casey Anderson\n*Marcia McBroom as Petronella Danforth\n*[[John LaZar]] as Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell\n*[[Michael Blodgett]] as Lance Rocke\n*David Gurian as Harris Allsworth\n*[[Edy Williams]] as Ashley St. Ives\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Erica Gavin]] as Roxanne\n*[[Phyllis Davis]] as Susan Lake\n*[[Harrison Page]] as Emerson Thorne\n*Duncan McLeod as Porter Hall\n*[[James Iglehart]] as Randy Black\n*[[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Baxter Wolfe\n*[[Henry Rowland (actor)|Henry Rowland]] as Otto\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n*[[Pam Grier]] has a bit part as a partygoer.\n*[[Trina Parks]], of James Bond's [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]] has a bit part.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls'' was originally intended as a straightforward sequel to the [[1967 in film|1967]] film ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]''.\n\n[[Jacqueline Susann]], author of the novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'', had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel ''[[The Love Machine (novel)|The Love Machine]]''.

Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together.\"<ref name=\"script\"/>\n\nMeyer's intention was for the film to \"simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the [[Sharon Tate]] murders) of what the opening crawl called 'the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business'\".<ref name=ebertfest />\n\nEbert later recalled:\n\n<blockquote>At the time we were working on BVD I didn't really understand how unusual the project was. But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even congnizance) from the Front Office.<ref name=\"roger\">Russ Meyer: Ten Years After the 'Beyond'\nEbert, Roger.

Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn't supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material.\"<ref name=\"roger\"/>\n\nBecause the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Movie Review (1980) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beyond-the-valley-of-the-dolls-1980 |website=www.rogerebert.com |accessdate=20 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development.<ref name=ebertfest /> As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner, saying \"If the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work.\" Ebert described the resulting tone as \"curious\".<ref name=ebertfest />\n\nIn 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it:\n\n<blockquote>I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message.<ref name=ebertfest /></blockquote>\n\n===Editing===\nUpon its initial release, the film was given an [[X rating]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Richard W. |title=The Moviegoing Experience, 1968-2001|publisher=McFarland|year=2003|page=48|isbn=0-7864-1361-1}}</ref> in [[1990 in film|1990]], it was reclassified as [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#NC-17|NC-17]]. Meyer's response to the original X rating was to attempt to re-edit the film to insert more nudity and sex, but Fox wanted to get the movie released quickly and would not give him the time.<ref name=ebertfest />\n\n===Music and soundtrack===\nMost of the film's music was written by [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]]. Phillips adapted [[Paul Dukas]]' ''[[The Sorcerer's Apprentice (Dukas)|The Sorcerer's Apprentice]]'' for the psychedelic scene at Z-Man's house near the film's end.<ref name=audioCD>''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: The Original Soundtrack.''

Vocals for the [[lip-sync]]ed songs were performed by [[Lynn Carey]], a [[blue-eyed soul]] singer based in Los Angeles. Carey's voice is showcased on the apocalyptic rocker \"Find It\" (by Stu Phillips and Carey),<ref name=afi /> the earnest folk anthem \"Come With the Gentle People\" (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone),<ref name=afi /> the raunchy [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] of \"Sweet Talking Candyman\" (by Phillips and Stone),<ref name=afi /> the lilting ballad \"In the Long Run\" (by Phillips and Stone),<ref name=afi /> and the soulful strut of \"Look On Up At the Bottom\" (also by Phillips and Stone).<ref name=afi /> She also sings \"Once I had Love\", written by Stu Phillips and herself.<ref name=afi />\n\n[[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] performed their 1967 hit \"[[Incense and Peppermints (song)|Incense and Peppermints]]\", the mid-tempo rocker \"Girl from the City\" (written by Paul Marshall),<ref name=afi /> and the [[power pop]] anthem \"I'm Comin' Home\" (also by Marshall)<ref name=afi /> during the first party scene at Z-Man's house. The film's title song was performed by [[A&M Records|A&M]] artists [[The Sandpipers]] and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 ''[[Come Saturday Morning (The Sandpipers album)|Come Saturday Morning]]'' LP.\n\nDifferent versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties.<ref name=audioCD/> The original vinyl soundtrack, reissued in the early 2000s, substitutes Ami Rushes' vocals for Lynn Carey's originals, and includes one song, \"Once I Had Love\", not on the 2003 CD reissue.

The four travel to [[Los Angeles]] to find Kelly's estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune.\n\nSusan welcomes Kelly and her friends, even promising a third of her inheritance to her niece, but Susan's sleazy financial advisor, Porter Hall, discredits them as \"[[hippies]]\" in an attempt to embezzle her fortune. Undeterred, Susan introduces The Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by real-life band [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]]). The band is so well-received that {{nowrap|Z-Man}} becomes their [[svengali]] manager, changing their name to [[Carrie Nation|The Carrie Nations]] and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.\n\nKelly drifts away from Harris and takes up with Lance Rocke, a high-priced [[male prostitution|gigolo]], who has designs on her inheritance. At first, Harris fends off the sexually aggressive [[pornographic actor|porn star]] Ashley St. Ives, but after losing Kelly, he allows Ashley to seduce him. Ashley soon tires of his conventional nature and inability to perform sexually due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris descends further into heavy drug and alcohol use, leading to a fistfight with Lance and a drug-addled [[one-night stand]] with Casey which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris. Casey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men's foibles, has a [[lesbian]] affair with clothes designer Roxanne, who pressures her to have an [[abortion]].\n\nPetronella has a seemingly enchanted romance with law student Emerson Thorne. After a [[meet cute]] at {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} party, they are shown running slow-motion through golden fields and frolicking in a haystack. Their fairy-tale romance frays when Pet sleeps with Randy Black, a violent prize fighter who beats up Emerson and tries to run him down with a car.\n\nSusan Lake is reunited with her former fianc\u00e9 Baxter Wolfe. The Carrie Nations release records and continue to perform successfully, despite constant touring and [[recreational drug use|drug use]]. Upset at being pushed to the sidelines, Harris attempts [[suicide]] by leaping from the rafters of a sound stage during a television appearance by the band. Harris survives the fall, but becomes [[paraplegic]] from his injuries.\n\nKelly devotes herself to caring for Harris. Emerson forgives Petronella for her infidelity. Casey and Roxanne have a steamy, intimate romance, but this idyllic existence ends when {{nowrap|Z-Man}} invites Casey, Roxanne, and Lance to a [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]]-fueled party at his house. After {{nowrap|Z-Man}} tries to seduce Lance, who spurns him, he reveals that he has breasts, meaning he has been a female in drag all this time.{{#tag:ref|To quote Roger Ebert: \"Readers who have seen ''BVD'' will know that {{nowrap|Z-Man}} is a rock Svengali who seems to be a gay man for most of the movie, but is finally revealed to be a woman in drag.\"<ref name=ebertfest />|group=N}} {{nowrap|Z-Man}} then goes on a murderous rampage: he beheads Lance with a sword, stabs his servant Otto to death, and shoots Roxanne and Casey, killing them.\n\nResponding to a desperate phone call Casey made shortly before her death, Kelly, Harris, Pet, and Emerson arrive at {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} house and try to subdue him. Petronella is wounded in the melee, which ends in {{nowrap|Z-Man's}} death. Harris is able to move his feet, the start of his recovery from paralysis.\n\nAn epilogue follows, with a preachy, satirical, voice-over monologue and scenes of Kelly and Harris (now in crutches) hiking on a log over a creek, and a final scene with the courthouse wedding of three couples\u2014Kelly and Harris, Pet and Emerson, and Susan and Baxter\u2014with Porter observing from outside the courthouse window.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n*[[Dolly Martin|Dolly Read]] as Kelly MacNamara\n*[[Cynthia Myers]] as Casey Anderson\n*Marcia McBroom as Petronella Danforth\n*[[John LaZar]] as Ronnie \"Z-Man\" Barzell\n*[[Michael Blodgett]] as Lance Rocke\n*David Gurian as Harris Allsworth\n*[[Edy Williams]] as Ashley St. Ives\n{{col-break}}\n*[[Erica Gavin]] as Roxanne\n*[[Phyllis Davis]] as Susan Lake\n*[[Harrison Page]] as Emerson Thorne\n*Duncan McLeod as Porter Hall\n*[[James Iglehart]] as Randy Black\n*[[Charles Napier (actor)|Charles Napier]] as Baxter Wolfe\n*[[Henry Rowland (actor)|Henry Rowland]] as Otto\n{{col-end}}\n\n'''Cast notes'''\n*[[Pam Grier]] has a bit part as a partygoer.\n*[[Trina Parks]], of James Bond's [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]] has a bit part.\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Beyond the Valley of the Dolls'' was originally intended as a straightforward sequel to the [[1967 in film|1967]] film ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]''.\n\n[[Jacqueline Susann]], author of the novel ''[[Valley of the Dolls]]'', had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel ''[[The Love Machine (novel)|The Love Machine]]''.

An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio's own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio's own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even congnizance) from the Front Office.<ref name=\"roger\">Russ Meyer: Ten Years After the 'Beyond'\nEbert, Roger.

The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material.\"<ref name=\"roger\"/>\n\nBecause the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ebert |first1=Roger |title=Beyond the Valley of the Dolls Movie Review (1980) {{!}} Roger Ebert |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/beyond-the-valley-of-the-dolls-1980 |website=www.rogerebert.com |accessdate=20 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref> were made on the spot, without the chance to bring previous already-shot scenes into alignment with the new development.<ref name=ebertfest /> As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic or not, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert, instead. Meyer's intention was to have the actors perform the material in a straightforward manner, saying \"If the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won't work.\" Ebert described the resulting tone as \"curious\".<ref name=ebertfest />\n\nIn 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it:\n\n<blockquote>I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It's an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clich\u00e9s and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it's cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message.<ref name=ebertfest /></blockquote>\n\n===Editing===\nUpon its initial release, the film was given an [[X rating]] by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]];<ref>{{cite book|last=Haines|first=Richard W. |title=The Moviegoing Experience, 1968-2001|publisher=McFarland|year=2003|page=48|isbn=0-7864-1361-1}}</ref> in [[1990 in film|1990]], it was reclassified as [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#NC-17|NC-17]].
