He first gained prominence as the writer, publisher, and printer of ''The Underground Grammarian'', a newsletter that offered lively, witty, satiric, and often derisive essays on the misuse of the English language, particularly the misuse of written English on college campuses. He privately published the journal from 1977 to 1992. Although its circulation was limited, ''The Underground Grammarian'' was highly regarded, and, in addition to its academic audience, had a following outside academia that included [[George Will]], [[Edwin Newman]], and [[Johnny Carson]], on whose ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' Mitchell appeared many times.\n\nMitchell went on to publish four books: ''Less Than Words Can Say'' (1979), ''The Graves of Academe'' (1981), ''The Leaning Tower of Babel'' (1984), and ''The Gift of Fire'' (1987). Virtually all of his writings, including these books and ''The Underground Grammarian'', are available online for free. Mitchell gave his permission that all of these works be made available on the Internet and be disseminated freely, without charge, especially to teachers for use in their classrooms.\n\nMitchell's final book, ''The Psyche Papers'', was left uncompleted. Mitchell published the four chapters he had completed in the final four issues of ''The Underground Grammarian'' (see [[#Bibliography|below]]). Mitchell said in 2001 that he had \"lost his faith.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Although he appreciated that his works would live beyond him, he could not help but note how little impact they had on changing education in America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] said of Mitchell, \"There exists in every age, in every society, a small, still choir of reason emanating from a few scattered thinkers ignored by the mainstream. Their collective voices, when duly discovered a century or so too late, reveal what was wrong with that society and age, and how it could have been corrected if only people had listened and acted accordingly. Richard Mitchell's is such a voice.\"<ref>Mitchell 1987, as above. Simon's words are printed on the back of the dust jacket, along with praise from [[Thomas H. Middleton]], [[Edwin Newman]], and [[Clifton Fadiman]].</ref>\n\nMitchell retired in 1991, but continued to teach part-time until the fall of 2002.<ref name=\"Holmes, as above\"/><ref name=\"Rowan Today, as above\"/> He died in his home of diabetes complications on December 27, 2002 at the age of 73, and was survived by his wife, Francis, daughters Amanda Merritt, Felicity Myers, Sonia Armstrong and Daphne Keller, as well as five grandchildren.<ref name=\"Holmes, as above\"/>\n\n==The Underground Grammarian==\nIn December 1976, the students, faculty, and administrators of Glassboro State College in New Jersey were greeted by a small, 4-page missive printed from hand-set type distributed on campus that proclaimed the following editorial policy:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Underground Grammarian is an unauthorised journal devoted to the protection of the [[Mother tongue|Mother Tongue]] at Glassboro State College. Our language can be written and even spoken correctly, even beautifully. We do not demand beauty, but bad English cannot be excused or tolerated in a college. The Underground Grammarian will expose and ridicule examples of jargon, faulty syntax, redundancy, needless neologism, and any other kind of outrage against English.\n\nClear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought is the most important benefit of education. We are neither peddlers nor politicians that we should prosper by that use of language which carries the least meaning. We cannot honorably accept the wages, confidence, or licensure of the citizens who employ us as we darken counsel by words without understanding. And so, to the whole college community, to students, to teachers, and to administrators of every degree, The Underground Grammarian gives WARNING! RAPE OF THE MOTHER TONGUE WILL BE PUNISHED!\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd so began the polemicist career of Richard Mitchell, launched with the January 1977 issue of ''The Underground Grammarian'', wherein he exposed and ridiculed academics, educationists, school principals, and teachers who engaged in spreading mindlessness in the name of enlightenment.\n\nHis maiden publication also asserted, under the heading \"What Can We Do?\", the following:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Underground Grammarian does not advocate violence; it advocates ridicule. Abusers of English are often pompous, and ridicule hurts them more than violence. In every edition we will bring you practical advice for ridiculing abusers of English.\n</blockquote>\n\nRegarding subscriptions, the editor stated rather tersely:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere are no subscriptions. We don't lack money, and we may attack you in the next issue. No one is safe.\n\nWe will print no letters to the editor. We will give no space to opposing points of view. They are wrong. The Underground Grammarian is at war and will give the enemy nothing but battle.\n</blockquote>\n\nBy January 1979, ''The Underground Grammarian'' had garnered national attention and a circulation of 1800, with Mitchell receiving 12 to 15 letters per day from readers offering examples of bad writing, speaking, and teaching. Mitchell published ''The Underground Grammarian'' for 15 years.\n\nMitchell eventually charged a modest annual subscription fee starting in September 1979: \"U.S & Canada, $10; others, $14.\" In February 1984 Mitchell raised subscription fees: \"Persons in USA & Canada, $15US; Persons elsewhere, $20; Institutions, $25.\" Institutional requests (i.e., libraries) seemed to have bothered Mitchell since before long he had replaced \"Institution, $25\" with \"non-personal entities of any description, $25 or even more.\" By the April 1990 issue, the subscription information included the subtle declaration, \"No more libraries allowed!\" After several years, Mitchell gave half-price discounts to retired teachers, stating that their \"presence among our readers indicates that they must have been ''good'' teachers, and the same discount, or even more, applies to readers who happen to need it.\"\n\nBy then the request for back issues forced Mitchell to write, \"We remind readers one and all that we ''approve'' when our readers make photocopies, however numerous. It just shows good judgment.\" Mitchell always encouraged free distribution of his writings. In 1983 Mitchell pulled back from nine issues per year to eight. The amount of text had doubled by then. In 1990 he reduced the number of printed issues to five, and in 1991, the final year, he published only four, but these two years saw double-sized issues (16 half-pages).\n\nMitchell started out using an ancient Gordon-Franklin press and within two years switched to a Chandler & Price press. By 1981, he had moved on to an elderly (circa 1935) cylinder letterpress, a Webendorfer \"Little Giant.\" In the March 1985 issue, Mitchell informed his readers that he had given up printing from hand-set type for a machine that could self-justify text on a line: the new [[Macintosh computer]]. Of hand-set type, Mitchell explained:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis method of composition is interesting and full of suspense, to be sure, but it has certain disadvantages of which most writers have never even dreamed....sometimes, when thirty or forty lines have been set, it becomes obvious that the piece is just no good. That sort of catastrophe might mean a delay of a week or more in what we don't even bother to call a \"production schedule.\" Even one such false start, added to the fact that all the type used to print the last edition has to be redistributed for the next edition, can set us back for a month or more....We are a bit sentimental and sorry. We'll miss the taste of lead. But the choice, although painful, was not difficult. Our proper business is to get this thing out, and not to preserve a fine and ancient craft.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe first seven issues of ''The Underground Grammarian'' were published anonymously, simply referring to the author/editor as \"The Grammarian.\" The eighth issue announced that \"R. Mitchell of our staff has been promoted to the post of Assistant Circulation Manager.\" In the December 1986 issue, R. Mitchell was quietly promoted to Associate Circulation Manager, and then in the Spring 1991 issue, he was promoted to Full Circulation Manager, \"with tenure,\" the title he carried to the end.\n\nMention was also made of \"Central Control,\" the real power behind the scenes. Central Control was Mitchell's title for his wife and apparently held the mailing list. Mitchell wrote in the March 1988 issue: \"Every morning, the Associate Circulation Manager drives Central Control down to the post office. She sits there dearly hoping that you have not moved. She does not entirely approve of moving. And she has dark visions when your Grammarian comes back marked, Address Unknown, Not Even a Trace of You. She hopes that if you must move, a), that someone else is paying, and b), that you will send her your new address.\"\n\nMitchell did not announce to his readers that he was retiring ''The Underground Grammarian''. The final newsletter was mailed early in 1992, still with subscription information, ten years before his death. Articles in the final issue included: \"Running on Empty,\" \"Words, Words, Words,\" and \"[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]] in Darkness.\"\n\n==Books==\n\n=== Less Than Words Can Say ===\n\nIn the summer of 1979, [[Little, Brown & Company]] published Richard Mitchell's first book, ''Less Than Words Can Say.'' Mitchell had originally submitted the title as ''The Worm in the Brain'' but his editors felt it too frightening and grisly. The book is a gloomy contemplation of the new illiteracy, its roots and consequences, and its prosperous practitioners.\n\n[[Clifton Fadiman]] called it \"the wittiest, the most brilliant and probably the most penetrating discussion now available of our growing American illiteracy.\" [[Josiah Mitchell Morse]] praised Mitchell for having \"the courage to write well \u2014 an even rarer courage now that sloppy thought is equated with democratic virtue. His own prose illustrates the qualities and habits of mind our educationists don't want our children to develop: wit, clarity, precision, mastery of detail, intellectual self-respect, and contempt for charlatans.\"\n\nWhat follows is a list of the chapters and pointed quotes from each:\n\n<blockquote> '''Foreword''' \"Words never fail. We hear them, we read them; they enter into the mind and become part of us for as long as we shall live. Who speaks reason to his fellow men bestows it upon them. Who mouths inanity disorders thought for all who listen. There must be some minimum allowable dose of inanity beyond which the mind cannot remain reasonable. Irrationality, like buried chemical waste, sooner or later must seep into all the tissues of thought.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''1. The Worm in the Brain''' \"The next step is not taken until you learn to see a world in which worms are eaten and decisions made and ''all'' responsible agency has disappeared. Now you are ready to be an administrator.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''2. The Two Tribes''' \"There is a curious thing about the way they use their verbs. They have, of course, both passive and active forms, but they consider it a serious breach of etiquette amounting almost to sacrilege to use the active form when speaking of persons.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''3. A Bunch of Marks''' \"An education that does not teach clear, coherent writing cannot provide our world with thoughtful adults; it gives us instead, at the best, clever children of all ages.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''4. The Voice of Sisera''' \"Jefferson must have imagined an America in which all citizens would be able, when they felt like it, to address one another as members of the same class. That we cannot do so is a sore impediment to equality, but, of course, a great advantage to those who ''can'' use the English of power and wealth.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''5. \"let's face it Fellows\"''' \"The questions are good ones. Who does hire teachers who can't spell? Where do they come from? The questions grow more ominous the more we think about them. Just as we suspect that this teacher's ineptitude in spelling is not limited to those two words, so we must suspect that she has other ineptitudes as well.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''6. Trifles''' \"Our educators, panting after professionalism, are little interested in being known for a picayune concern with trifles like spelling and punctuation. They would much rather make the world a better place. They have tried on the gowns of philosophers, psychologists, and priests.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''7. The Columbus Gap''' \"American public education is a remarkable enterprise; it succeeds best where it fails. Imagine an industry that consistently fails to do what it sets out to do, a factory where this year's product is invariably sleazier than last year's but, nevertheless, better than next year's.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''8. The Pill''' \"Thought control, like birth control, is best undertaken as long as possible before the fact. Many grown-ups will obstinately persist, if only now and then, in composing small strings of sentences in their heads and achieving at least a momentary logic. This probably cannot be prevented, but we have learned how to minimize its consequences by arranging that such grown-ups will be unable to pursue that logic very far.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''9. A Handout of Material''' \"The propensity for borrowed jargon is always a mark of limited ability in the technique of discursive thought. It comes from a poor education. A poor education is not simply a matter of thinking that components and elements might just as well be called factors; it is the inability to manipulate that elaborate symbol system that permits us to make fine distinctions among such things.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''10. Grant Us, O Lord''' \"One of the most important uses of language in all cultures is the performance of magic. Since language deals easily with invisible worlds, it's natural that it provide whatever access we think we have to the world of the spirits.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''11. Spirits from the Vasty Deep''' \"Bad writing is like any other form of crime; most of it is unimaginative and tiresomely predictable. The professor of education seeking a grant and the neighborhood lout looking for a score simply go and do as their predecessors have done. The one litanizes about carefully unspecified developments in philosophy, psychology, and communications theory, and the other sticks up the candy store.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''12. Darkling Plain English''' \"The bureaucrats who have produced most of our dismal official English will, at first, be instructed to fix it. They will try, but ''nihil ex nihilo''. That English is the mess it is because they did it in the first place and they'll never be able to fix it.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''13. Hydra''' \"At one time I thought that I was the victim of a conspiracy myself. I was certain that the Admissions Office had salted my classes with carefully selected students, students who had no native tongue.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''14. The Turkeys that Lay the Golden Eggs''' \"The minimum competence school of education is nothing new. We've had it for many years, but we didn't talk about it until we discovered that we could make a virtue of it.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''15. Devices and Desires''' \"If you cannot be the master of your language, you must be its slave. If you cannot examine your thoughts, you have no choice but to think them, however silly they may be.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''16. Naming and Telling''' \"Two things, then, are necessary for intelligent discourse: an array of names, and a conventional system for telling. The power of a language is related, therefore, to the size and subtlety of its lexicon, its bank of names, and the flexibility and accuracy of its telling system, its grammar.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''17. Sentimental Education''' \"The history of mankind hasn't yet provided any examples of a decrease in stupidity and ignorance and their presumably attendant evils, but we have hope. After all, history hasn't provided anything like us, either, until pretty recently.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Critical Bibliography''' \"I should say, for those who might think these things unusual, that they aren't and that they weren't difficult to find.\"</blockquote>\n\n===The Graves of Academe===\nMitchell's second book started out as a collection of articles from ''The Underground Grammarian'' before transforming into a description \"by extrapolation from one visible protuberance to another, and with a little probing, the great invisible hulk of the beast, the brooding monstrosity of American educationism, the immense, mindless brute that by now troubles the waters of all, ''all'' that is done in our land in the supposed cause of 'education.'\"\n\nA TIME magazine review of the book said that Mitchell \"makes [[H.L. Mencken]] sound like a waffler.\"<ref>Maddocks, as above.</ref>\n\nWhat follows is a list of the chapter titles and quotes from each chapter:\n\n<blockquote> '''Foreword''' \"Clear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought is the most important benefit of education.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Propositions Three and Seven''' \"It was Jefferson's dream that civilization could best perpetuate itself in which the citizens were 'educated,' whatever he meant by that, and we do have some clue as to what he meant.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Educated People''' \"It is possible, of course, to keep educated people unfree in a state of civilization, but it\u2019s much easier to keep ignorant people unfree in a state of civilization. And it is easiest of all if you can convince the ignorant that they  are educated, for you can thus make them collaborators in your disposition of their liberty\nand property. That is the institutionally assigned task, for all that it may be invisible to those who perform it, of American public education. \"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The End of the String''' \"It seemed to me that those teacher-trainers must be amiable and playful folk with well-developed aesthetic sensibilities and a penchant for drama, in bold contrast to the rest of us who taught what you call 'subjects,' dour and narrow people reciting lectures and devising 'thought' questions.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Wundter of It All''' \"There is no counting the doctorates in education that have been awarded to those who have done nothing more than tabulate the answers to questionnaires. That such degrees are so common, however, is not only because the work is easy, bad enough, but also because the supposed objects of study often cannot be known directly. When they can, in fact, they are obviously trivial.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Seven Deadly Principles''' \"After sober and judicious consideration, and weighing one thing against another in the interests of reasonable compromise, H. L. Mencken concluded that a startling and dramatic improvement in American education required only that we hang all the professors and burn down the schools. His uncharacteristically moderate proposal was not adopted.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Principles March On''' \"It is fascinating, of course, to hear those who operate the schools argue that because there are people who can build aircraft for profit and cite law in their own cause we may conclude that the schools have actually provided too much \"excellence.\" What is even more fascinating is that this bewildering and ignorant line of reasoning should find, apparently, no detractors among the vast membership of the National Education Association...\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Pygmies Revenge''' \"Peter's well-known Principle was obviously discovered by a man who knew nothing at all about schools. In schools it just isn't true that the people who can actually do their jobs get promoted until they find themselves, at last and forever, in the jobs they can't do. This is because the most difficult and demanding jobs in education are what industry calls \"entry-level positions,\" teaching in classrooms.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Problem-Solving in the Content Area''' \"The problems and disorders in education have become more and more visible in the last few years, of course, and even the ordinary citizen who happens to have no children in the schools suspects that something is very wrong, but he will never understand exactly ''what'' is wrong until he realizes that all our educational problems and disorders, none of which are new, although they ''are'' more obvious, provide endless and growing employment for the people who made them.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Every Three Second''' \"Schools do not fail. They succeed. Children always learn in school. Always and every day. When their rare and tiny compositions are \"rated holistically\" without regard for separate \"aspects\" like spelling, punctuation, capitalization, or even organization, they ''learn''. They learn that mistakes bring no consequences.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Afterword: Plus \u00c7a Change''' \"The ideologues of educationism (fortunately for us, if we will pay thoughtful attention) have so thoroughly given themselves to their disdain of intellectual discipline that they ''always'', and always inadvertently, reveal some truth when they pretend to do the work of the mind in writing.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===The Leaning Tower of Babel===\nIn his third book, which turned out to be what was originally meant to be his second book, Mitchell published a collection of articles from ''The Underground Grammarian'' under ten topics and with an Introduction by [[Thomas H. Middleton]]. In that Introduction, Middleton wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI first met Richard Mitchell when he came from the East Coast out here to Los Angeles to appear on the Johnny Carson show. We had had a bit of correspondence, and I'd told him I'd like to meet him if he ever traveled to the West. I planted myself at the bar of his hotel, the Sheraton Universal, and he came in almost immediately. We had a couple of drinks and a very congenial chat, in the course of which I complimented him on his UNDERGROUND GRAMMARIAN essays. I said that each of them was a masterpiece. He instantly denied authorship of them. \"It's a muse,\" he said. \"Something out there comes down and guides my hand.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I laughed, but he insisted that it was so. He said that surely I must have written columns that seemed to write themselves. I owned that on rare occasions I had \u2014 usually when I was mad as hell about something \u2014 and I admitted that I had frequently written letters to the editor and letters of complaint to offending merchants and manufacturers, and that those letters flowed effortlessly from a hand that almost seemed not my own.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Exactly,\" he said.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>So there you are. THE UNDERGROUND GRAMMARIAN will have great appeal for anyone who simply loves good writing, for the writing in these articles is superb. Moreover, these pieces, articulate, intelligent, often wildly funny, and frequently dazzling, spring from a splendid mind, tuned to just the right pitch, and fired with an angry passion under the supernatural control of Mitchell's muse. </blockquote>\n\nBefore the publication of this book, Mitchell invited his readers to submit entries to the Amazing Blurb Contest. Three readers won, having their blurbs printed on the dustjacket of the book.\n\n===The Gift of Fire===\n<blockquote>\nI suspect that those who have read some of my other works will be a little surprised by this one. I am a little surprised by this one. </blockquote>\n\nThus began the Introduction to Mitchell's final book, wherein he describes the turn he has taken from the \"castigation of fools... an ancient and honorable task of writers\" to writing a book \"about how to live by a man who doesn't know how to live, but who has begun to learn that he doesn't know how.\"\n\nHere are the chapter titles and selected quotes from this unusual book of philosophy:\n\n<blockquote> '''1. Who Is Socrates, Now That We Need Him?''' \"Nevertheless, people do from time to time come to know enough about Socrates to be drawn into his company, and to agree, with rare exceptions, that it would indeed be a good thing to imitate him.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''2. The Square of the Hypotenuse''' \"Who first called Reason sweet, I don't know. I suspect that he was a man with very few responsibilities, no children to rear, and no payroll to meet.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''3. The Land of We All''' \"It is an obvious but simple distinction \u2014 though rarely made \u2014 that there are some things that we can do because we are humanity, and some things that we can do because we are persons, and that there is some radical and absolute difference between the two classes of things. They do not overlap. A person can no more invade Normandy than an army can play the violin.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''4. The Right Little Thing''' \"Although many of us seem to have misunderstood, or even deliberately misconstrued, the nature of education for a very long time, that nature is still recognized in some corner of almost every mind.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''5. The Gift of Fire''' \"So I imagined myself in conversation with Prometheus, who had come back to find out what we mortals had managed to do with the astounding powers that he had given to us alone of all creatures.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''6. Children and Fish''' \"If you should prefer to understand that children are those human beings who have not yet found the grasp of their own minds, then the task you have given yourself, that task of rearing a child wisely and well, is suddenly transformed from indoctrination to education, in its truest sense, and made not only possible but even likely \u2014 provided, to be sure, one little prerequisite, which is that you are not a child, that you have come into the grasp of your mind.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''7. The Perils of Petronilla''' \"Epictetus, who could neither read nor write, supposed that education was an inner condition, easily \u2014 if temporarily \u2014 reached, in nothing more than an afternoon of thoughtful discourse, but a condition by virtue of which one could do everything that living requires, and do it well.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''8. Sad Stories of the Death of Kings''' \"Any truthful literature will admit: No, this is not life itself, it is only a serious sort of game, but it is like life, and the mind that plays here is like yours, and this vision is what you too can see, and consider, and find worthy, and by which you may know yourself better. For this book is about you. Every truthful and thoughtful book is about you, every story is yours.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''9. Home Rule''' \"From Epictetus, we can take another possible understanding of education. It is power over the inner world, the ability to know and judge the self and to do something about it.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''10. Colonialism''' \"Here is a truth that most teachers will not tell you, even if they know it: Good training is a continual friend and a solace; it helps you now, and assures you of help in the future. Good education is a continual pain in the neck, and assures you always of more of the same.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''11. The World of No One At All''' \"Epictetus was doing no more than reaffirming, simply and literally, a very old idea. He could see no sense at all in presuming the existence of goodness or badness where there was no intention, no will.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''12. How to Live (I Think)''' \"Look around you, near and far, and find someone whom you can praise, and that without any consideration of self-interest or the profit that you might take from your praising. Whom do you find to praise? The just or the unjust? The patient or the impatient? The courageous or the cowardly?\"</blockquote>\n\n==Bibliography==\nLinks to online texts are given where available.\n* ''[https://sourcetext.com/grammarian/ The Underground Grammarian]'', a newsletter published nine times yearly from 1977 to 1983, eight times yearly from 1984 to 1989, five times in 1990, and four times in 1991.<ref>Mitchell, Richard.

He first gained prominence as the writer, publisher, and printer of ''The Underground Grammarian'', a newsletter that offered lively, witty, satiric, and often derisive essays on the misuse of the English language, particularly the misuse of written English on college campuses. He privately published the journal from 1977 to 1992. Although its circulation was limited, ''The Underground Grammarian'' was highly regarded, and, in addition to its academic audience, had a following outside academia that included [[George Will]], [[Edwin Newman]], and [[Johnny Carson]], on whose ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' Mitchell appeared many times.\n\nMitchell went on to publish four books: ''Less Than Words Can Say'' (1979), ''The Graves of Academe'' (1981), ''The Leaning Tower of Babel'' (1984), and ''The Gift of Fire'' (1987). Virtually all of his writings, including these books and ''The Underground Grammarian'', are available online for free. Mitchell gave his permission that all of these works be made available on the Internet and be disseminated freely, without charge, especially to teachers for use in their classrooms.\n\nMitchell's final book, ''The Psyche Papers'', was left uncompleted. Mitchell published the four chapters he had completed in the final four issues of ''The Underground Grammarian'' (see [[#Bibliography|below]]). Mitchell said in 2001 that he had \"lost his faith.\"{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Although he appreciated that his works would live beyond him, he could not help but note how little impact they had on changing education in America.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}\n\n[[John Simon (critic)|John Simon]] said of Mitchell, \"There exists in every age, in every society, a small, still choir of reason emanating from a few scattered thinkers ignored by the mainstream. Their collective voices, when duly discovered a century or so too late, reveal what was wrong with that society and age, and how it could have been corrected if only people had listened and acted accordingly. Richard Mitchell's is such a voice.\"<ref>Mitchell 1987, as above. Simon's words are printed on the back of the dust jacket, along with praise from [[Thomas H. Middleton]], [[Edwin Newman]], and [[Clifton Fadiman]].</ref>\n\nMitchell retired in 1991, but continued to teach part-time until the fall of 2002.<ref name=\"Holmes, as above\"/><ref name=\"Rowan Today, as above\"/> He died in his home of diabetes complications on December 27, 2002 at the age of 73, and was survived by his wife, Francis, daughters Amanda Merritt, Felicity Myers, Sonia Armstrong and Daphne Keller, as well as five grandchildren.<ref name=\"Holmes, as above\"/>\n\n==The Underground Grammarian==\nIn December 1976, the students, faculty, and administrators of Glassboro State College in New Jersey were greeted by a small, 4-page missive printed from hand-set type distributed on campus that proclaimed the following editorial policy:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Underground Grammarian is an unauthorised journal devoted to the protection of the [[Mother tongue|Mother Tongue]] at Glassboro State College. Our language can be written and even spoken correctly, even beautifully. We do not demand beauty, but bad English cannot be excused or tolerated in a college. The Underground Grammarian will expose and ridicule examples of jargon, faulty syntax, redundancy, needless neologism, and any other kind of outrage against English.\n\nClear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought is the most important benefit of education. We are neither peddlers nor politicians that we should prosper by that use of language which carries the least meaning. We cannot honorably accept the wages, confidence, or licensure of the citizens who employ us as we darken counsel by words without understanding. And so, to the whole college community, to students, to teachers, and to administrators of every degree, The Underground Grammarian gives WARNING! RAPE OF THE MOTHER TONGUE WILL BE PUNISHED!\n</blockquote>\n\nAnd so began the polemicist career of Richard Mitchell, launched with the January 1977 issue of ''The Underground Grammarian'', wherein he exposed and ridiculed academics, educationists, school principals, and teachers who engaged in spreading mindlessness in the name of enlightenment.\n\nHis maiden publication also asserted, under the heading \"What Can We Do?\", the following:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe Underground Grammarian does not advocate violence; it advocates ridicule. Abusers of English are often pompous, and ridicule hurts them more than violence. In every edition we will bring you practical advice for ridiculing abusers of English.\n</blockquote>\n\nRegarding subscriptions, the editor stated rather tersely:\n\n<blockquote>\nThere are no subscriptions. We don't lack money, and we may attack you in the next issue. No one is safe.\n\nWe will print no letters to the editor. We will give no space to opposing points of view. They are wrong. The Underground Grammarian is at war and will give the enemy nothing but battle.\n</blockquote>\n\nBy January 1979, ''The Underground Grammarian'' had garnered national attention and a circulation of 1800, with Mitchell receiving 12 to 15 letters per day from readers offering examples of bad writing, speaking, and teaching. Mitchell published ''The Underground Grammarian'' for 15 years.\n\nMitchell eventually charged a modest annual subscription fee starting in September 1979: \"U.S & Canada, $10; others, $14.\" In February 1984 Mitchell raised subscription fees: \"Persons in USA & Canada, $15US; Persons elsewhere, $20; Institutions, $25.\" Institutional requests (i.e., libraries) seemed to have bothered Mitchell since before long he had replaced \"Institution, $25\" with \"non-personal entities of any description, $25 or even more.\" By the April 1990 issue, the subscription information included the subtle declaration, \"No more libraries allowed!\" After several years, Mitchell gave half-price discounts to retired teachers, stating that their \"presence among our readers indicates that they must have been ''good'' teachers, and the same discount, or even more, applies to readers who happen to need it.\"\n\nBy then the request for back issues forced Mitchell to write, \"We remind readers one and all that we ''approve'' when our readers make photocopies, however numerous. It just shows good judgment.\" Mitchell always encouraged free distribution of his writings. In 1983 Mitchell pulled back from nine issues per year to eight. The amount of text had doubled by then. In 1990 he reduced the number of printed issues to five, and in 1991, the final year, he published only four, but these two years saw double-sized issues (16 half-pages).\n\nMitchell started out using an ancient Gordon-Franklin press and within two years switched to a Chandler & Price press. By 1981, he had moved on to an elderly (circa 1935) cylinder letterpress, a Webendorfer \"Little Giant.\" In the March 1985 issue, Mitchell informed his readers that he had given up printing from hand-set type for a machine that could self-justify text on a line: the new [[Macintosh computer]]. Of hand-set type, Mitchell explained:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis method of composition is interesting and full of suspense, to be sure, but it has certain disadvantages of which most writers have never even dreamed....sometimes, when thirty or forty lines have been set, it becomes obvious that the piece is just no good. That sort of catastrophe might mean a delay of a week or more in what we don't even bother to call a \"production schedule.\" Even one such false start, added to the fact that all the type used to print the last edition has to be redistributed for the next edition, can set us back for a month or more....We are a bit sentimental and sorry. We'll miss the taste of lead. But the choice, although painful, was not difficult. Our proper business is to get this thing out, and not to preserve a fine and ancient craft.\n</blockquote>\n\nThe first seven issues of ''The Underground Grammarian'' were published anonymously, simply referring to the author/editor as \"The Grammarian.\" The eighth issue announced that \"R. Mitchell of our staff has been promoted to the post of Assistant Circulation Manager.\" In the December 1986 issue, R. Mitchell was quietly promoted to Associate Circulation Manager, and then in the Spring 1991 issue, he was promoted to Full Circulation Manager, \"with tenure,\" the title he carried to the end.\n\nMention was also made of \"Central Control,\" the real power behind the scenes. Central Control was Mitchell's title for his wife and apparently held the mailing list. Mitchell wrote in the March 1988 issue: \"Every morning, the Associate Circulation Manager drives Central Control down to the post office. She sits there dearly hoping that you have not moved. She does not entirely approve of moving. And she has dark visions when your Grammarian comes back marked, Address Unknown, Not Even a Trace of You. She hopes that if you must move, a), that someone else is paying, and b), that you will send her your new address.\"\n\nMitchell did not announce to his readers that he was retiring ''The Underground Grammarian''. The final newsletter was mailed early in 1992, still with subscription information, ten years before his death. Articles in the final issue included: \"Running on Empty,\" \"Words, Words, Words,\" and \"[[Psyche (psychology)|Psyche]] in Darkness.\"\n\n==Books==\n\n=== Less Than Words Can Say ===\n\nIn the summer of 1979, [[Little, Brown & Company]] published Richard Mitchell's first book, ''Less Than Words Can Say.'' Mitchell had originally submitted the title as ''The Worm in the Brain'' but his editors felt it too frightening and grisly. The book is a gloomy contemplation of the new illiteracy, its roots and consequences, and its prosperous practitioners.\n\n[[Clifton Fadiman]] called it \"the wittiest, the most brilliant and probably the most penetrating discussion now available of our growing American illiteracy.\" [[Josiah Mitchell Morse]] praised Mitchell for having \"the courage to write well \u2014 an even rarer courage now that sloppy thought is equated with democratic virtue. His own prose illustrates the qualities and habits of mind our educationists don't want our children to develop: wit, clarity, precision, mastery of detail, intellectual self-respect, and contempt for charlatans.\"\n\nWhat follows is a list of the chapters and pointed quotes from each:\n\n<blockquote> '''Foreword''' \"Words never fail. We hear them, we read them; they enter into the mind and become part of us for as long as we shall live. Who speaks reason to his fellow men bestows it upon them. Who mouths inanity disorders thought for all who listen. There must be some minimum allowable dose of inanity beyond which the mind cannot remain reasonable. Irrationality, like buried chemical waste, sooner or later must seep into all the tissues of thought.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''1. The Worm in the Brain''' \"The next step is not taken until you learn to see a world in which worms are eaten and decisions made and ''all'' responsible agency has disappeared. Now you are ready to be an administrator.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''2. The Two Tribes''' \"There is a curious thing about the way they use their verbs. They have, of course, both passive and active forms, but they consider it a serious breach of etiquette amounting almost to sacrilege to use the active form when speaking of persons.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''3. A Bunch of Marks''' \"An education that does not teach clear, coherent writing cannot provide our world with thoughtful adults; it gives us instead, at the best, clever children of all ages.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''4. The Voice of Sisera''' \"Jefferson must have imagined an America in which all citizens would be able, when they felt like it, to address one another as members of the same class. That we cannot do so is a sore impediment to equality, but, of course, a great advantage to those who ''can'' use the English of power and wealth.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''5. \"let's face it Fellows\"''' \"The questions are good ones. Who does hire teachers who can't spell? Where do they come from? The questions grow more ominous the more we think about them. Just as we suspect that this teacher's ineptitude in spelling is not limited to those two words, so we must suspect that she has other ineptitudes as well.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''6. Trifles''' \"Our educators, panting after professionalism, are little interested in being known for a picayune concern with trifles like spelling and punctuation. They would much rather make the world a better place. They have tried on the gowns of philosophers, psychologists, and priests.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''7. The Columbus Gap''' \"American public education is a remarkable enterprise; it succeeds best where it fails. Imagine an industry that consistently fails to do what it sets out to do, a factory where this year's product is invariably sleazier than last year's but, nevertheless, better than next year's.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''8. The Pill''' \"Thought control, like birth control, is best undertaken as long as possible before the fact. Many grown-ups will obstinately persist, if only now and then, in composing small strings of sentences in their heads and achieving at least a momentary logic. This probably cannot be prevented, but we have learned how to minimize its consequences by arranging that such grown-ups will be unable to pursue that logic very far.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''9. A Handout of Material''' \"The propensity for borrowed jargon is always a mark of limited ability in the technique of discursive thought. It comes from a poor education. A poor education is not simply a matter of thinking that components and elements might just as well be called factors; it is the inability to manipulate that elaborate symbol system that permits us to make fine distinctions among such things.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''10. Grant Us, O Lord''' \"One of the most important uses of language in all cultures is the performance of magic. Since language deals easily with invisible worlds, it's natural that it provide whatever access we think we have to the world of the spirits.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''11. Spirits from the Vasty Deep''' \"Bad writing is like any other form of crime; most of it is unimaginative and tiresomely predictable. The professor of education seeking a grant and the neighborhood lout looking for a score simply go and do as their predecessors have done. The one litanizes about carefully unspecified developments in philosophy, psychology, and communications theory, and the other sticks up the candy store.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''12. Darkling Plain English''' \"The bureaucrats who have produced most of our dismal official English will, at first, be instructed to fix it. They will try, but ''nihil ex nihilo''. That English is the mess it is because they did it in the first place and they'll never be able to fix it.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''13. Hydra''' \"At one time I thought that I was the victim of a conspiracy myself. I was certain that the Admissions Office had salted my classes with carefully selected students, students who had no native tongue.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''14. The Turkeys that Lay the Golden Eggs''' \"The minimum competence school of education is nothing new. We've had it for many years, but we didn't talk about it until we discovered that we could make a virtue of it.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''15. Devices and Desires''' \"If you cannot be the master of your language, you must be its slave. If you cannot examine your thoughts, you have no choice but to think them, however silly they may be.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''16. Naming and Telling''' \"Two things, then, are necessary for intelligent discourse: an array of names, and a conventional system for telling. The power of a language is related, therefore, to the size and subtlety of its lexicon, its bank of names, and the flexibility and accuracy of its telling system, its grammar.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''17. Sentimental Education''' \"The history of mankind hasn't yet provided any examples of a decrease in stupidity and ignorance and their presumably attendant evils, but we have hope. After all, history hasn't provided anything like us, either, until pretty recently.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Critical Bibliography''' \"I should say, for those who might think these things unusual, that they aren't and that they weren't difficult to find.\"</blockquote>\n\n===The Graves of Academe===\nMitchell's second book started out as a collection of articles from ''The Underground Grammarian'' before transforming into a description \"by extrapolation from one visible protuberance to another, and with a little probing, the great invisible hulk of the beast, the brooding monstrosity of American educationism, the immense, mindless brute that by now troubles the waters of all, ''all'' that is done in our land in the supposed cause of 'education.'\"\n\nA TIME magazine review of the book said that Mitchell \"makes [[H.L. Mencken]] sound like a waffler.\"<ref>Maddocks, as above.</ref>\n\nWhat follows is a list of the chapter titles and quotes from each chapter:\n\n<blockquote> '''Foreword''' \"Clear language engenders clear thought, and clear thought is the most important benefit of education.\" </blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Propositions Three and Seven''' \"It was Jefferson's dream that civilization could best perpetuate itself in which the citizens were 'educated,' whatever he meant by that, and we do have some clue as to what he meant.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Educated People''' \"It is possible, of course, to keep educated people unfree in a state of civilization, but it\u2019s much easier to keep ignorant people unfree in a state of civilization. And it is easiest of all if you can convince the ignorant that they  are educated, for you can thus make them collaborators in your disposition of their liberty\nand property. That is the institutionally assigned task, for all that it may be invisible to those who perform it, of American public education. \"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The End of the String''' \"It seemed to me that those teacher-trainers must be amiable and playful folk with well-developed aesthetic sensibilities and a penchant for drama, in bold contrast to the rest of us who taught what you call 'subjects,' dour and narrow people reciting lectures and devising 'thought' questions.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Wundter of It All''' \"There is no counting the doctorates in education that have been awarded to those who have done nothing more than tabulate the answers to questionnaires. That such degrees are so common, however, is not only because the work is easy, bad enough, but also because the supposed objects of study often cannot be known directly. When they can, in fact, they are obviously trivial.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Seven Deadly Principles''' \"After sober and judicious consideration, and weighing one thing against another in the interests of reasonable compromise, H. L. Mencken concluded that a startling and dramatic improvement in American education required only that we hang all the professors and burn down the schools. His uncharacteristically moderate proposal was not adopted.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Principles March On''' \"It is fascinating, of course, to hear those who operate the schools argue that because there are people who can build aircraft for profit and cite law in their own cause we may conclude that the schools have actually provided too much \"excellence.\" What is even more fascinating is that this bewildering and ignorant line of reasoning should find, apparently, no detractors among the vast membership of the National Education Association...\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''The Pygmies Revenge''' \"Peter's well-known Principle was obviously discovered by a man who knew nothing at all about schools. In schools it just isn't true that the people who can actually do their jobs get promoted until they find themselves, at last and forever, in the jobs they can't do. This is because the most difficult and demanding jobs in education are what industry calls \"entry-level positions,\" teaching in classrooms.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Problem-Solving in the Content Area''' \"The problems and disorders in education have become more and more visible in the last few years, of course, and even the ordinary citizen who happens to have no children in the schools suspects that something is very wrong, but he will never understand exactly ''what'' is wrong until he realizes that all our educational problems and disorders, none of which are new, although they ''are'' more obvious, provide endless and growing employment for the people who made them.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Every Three Second''' \"Schools do not fail. They succeed. Children always learn in school. Always and every day. When their rare and tiny compositions are \"rated holistically\" without regard for separate \"aspects\" like spelling, punctuation, capitalization, or even organization, they ''learn''. They learn that mistakes bring no consequences.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''Afterword: Plus \u00c7a Change''' \"The ideologues of educationism (fortunately for us, if we will pay thoughtful attention) have so thoroughly given themselves to their disdain of intellectual discipline that they ''always'', and always inadvertently, reveal some truth when they pretend to do the work of the mind in writing.\"\n</blockquote>\n\n===The Leaning Tower of Babel===\nIn his third book, which turned out to be what was originally meant to be his second book, Mitchell published a collection of articles from ''The Underground Grammarian'' under ten topics and with an Introduction by [[Thomas H. Middleton]]. In that Introduction, Middleton wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nI first met Richard Mitchell when he came from the East Coast out here to Los Angeles to appear on the Johnny Carson show. We had had a bit of correspondence, and I'd told him I'd like to meet him if he ever traveled to the West. I planted myself at the bar of his hotel, the Sheraton Universal, and he came in almost immediately. We had a couple of drinks and a very congenial chat, in the course of which I complimented him on his UNDERGROUND GRAMMARIAN essays. I said that each of them was a masterpiece. He instantly denied authorship of them. \"It's a muse,\" he said. \"Something out there comes down and guides my hand.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>I laughed, but he insisted that it was so. He said that surely I must have written columns that seemed to write themselves. I owned that on rare occasions I had \u2014 usually when I was mad as hell about something \u2014 and I admitted that I had frequently written letters to the editor and letters of complaint to offending merchants and manufacturers, and that those letters flowed effortlessly from a hand that almost seemed not my own.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\"Exactly,\" he said.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>So there you are. THE UNDERGROUND GRAMMARIAN will have great appeal for anyone who simply loves good writing, for the writing in these articles is superb. Moreover, these pieces, articulate, intelligent, often wildly funny, and frequently dazzling, spring from a splendid mind, tuned to just the right pitch, and fired with an angry passion under the supernatural control of Mitchell's muse. </blockquote>\n\nBefore the publication of this book, Mitchell invited his readers to submit entries to the Amazing Blurb Contest. Three readers won, having their blurbs printed on the dustjacket of the book.\n\n===The Gift of Fire===\n<blockquote>\nI suspect that those who have read some of my other works will be a little surprised by this one. I am a little surprised by this one. </blockquote>\n\nThus began the Introduction to Mitchell's final book, wherein he describes the turn he has taken from the \"castigation of fools... an ancient and honorable task of writers\" to writing a book \"about how to live by a man who doesn't know how to live, but who has begun to learn that he doesn't know how.\"\n\nHere are the chapter titles and selected quotes from this unusual book of philosophy:\n\n<blockquote> '''1. Who Is Socrates, Now That We Need Him?''' \"Nevertheless, people do from time to time come to know enough about Socrates to be drawn into his company, and to agree, with rare exceptions, that it would indeed be a good thing to imitate him.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''2. The Square of the Hypotenuse''' \"Who first called Reason sweet, I don't know. I suspect that he was a man with very few responsibilities, no children to rear, and no payroll to meet.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''3. The Land of We All''' \"It is an obvious but simple distinction \u2014 though rarely made \u2014 that there are some things that we can do because we are humanity, and some things that we can do because we are persons, and that there is some radical and absolute difference between the two classes of things. They do not overlap. A person can no more invade Normandy than an army can play the violin.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''4. The Right Little Thing''' \"Although many of us seem to have misunderstood, or even deliberately misconstrued, the nature of education for a very long time, that nature is still recognized in some corner of almost every mind.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''5. The Gift of Fire''' \"So I imagined myself in conversation with Prometheus, who had come back to find out what we mortals had managed to do with the astounding powers that he had given to us alone of all creatures.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''6. Children and Fish''' \"If you should prefer to understand that children are those human beings who have not yet found the grasp of their own minds, then the task you have given yourself, that task of rearing a child wisely and well, is suddenly transformed from indoctrination to education, in its truest sense, and made not only possible but even likely \u2014 provided, to be sure, one little prerequisite, which is that you are not a child, that you have come into the grasp of your mind.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''7. The Perils of Petronilla''' \"Epictetus, who could neither read nor write, supposed that education was an inner condition, easily \u2014 if temporarily \u2014 reached, in nothing more than an afternoon of thoughtful discourse, but a condition by virtue of which one could do everything that living requires, and do it well.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''8. Sad Stories of the Death of Kings''' \"Any truthful literature will admit: No, this is not life itself, it is only a serious sort of game, but it is like life, and the mind that plays here is like yours, and this vision is what you too can see, and consider, and find worthy, and by which you may know yourself better. For this book is about you. Every truthful and thoughtful book is about you, every story is yours.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''9. Home Rule''' \"From Epictetus, we can take another possible understanding of education. It is power over the inner world, the ability to know and judge the self and to do something about it.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''10. Colonialism''' \"Here is a truth that most teachers will not tell you, even if they know it: Good training is a continual friend and a solace; it helps you now, and assures you of help in the future. Good education is a continual pain in the neck, and assures you always of more of the same.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''11. The World of No One At All''' \"Epictetus was doing no more than reaffirming, simply and literally, a very old idea. He could see no sense at all in presuming the existence of goodness or badness where there was no intention, no will.\"</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> '''12. How to Live (I Think)''' \"Look around you, near and far, and find someone whom you can praise, and that without any consideration of self-interest or the profit that you might take from your praising. Whom do you find to praise? The just or the unjust? The patient or the impatient? The courageous or the cowardly?\"</blockquote>\n\n==Bibliography==\nLinks to online texts are given where available.\n* ''[https://sourcetext.com/grammarian/ The Underground Grammarian]'', a newsletter published nine times yearly from 1977 to 1983, eight times yearly from 1984 to 1989, five times in 1990, and four times in 1991.<ref>Mitchell, Richard.

Forewing: apex and termen deep black, this colour continued narrowly along the costal margin to base of wing, near which it often becomes diffuse; the inner margin of the black area from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, between veins 2 and 4 excavate on the inner side, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins and inwardly toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies the whole of the tornal angle; the inner margin of this dilatation is variable, in the typical form slightly concave. Hindwing: terminal margin with a narrow black band which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; dorsal margin broadly paler than the ground colour.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\nUnderside: yellow, generally a slightly paler shade than that of the upperside, with the following reddish-brown markings. Forewing: two small spots or specks in basal half of cell and a reniform (kidney-shaped) spot or ring on the discocellulars. Hindwing: a slightly curved subbasal series of three small spots, an irregular slender ring or spot on the discocellulars, followed by a highly irregular, curved, transverse, discal series of spots or specks, some or all of which are often obsolescent. On both the forewings and hindwings, the veins that attain the costal and terminal margins end in minute reddish-brown specks. Antenna are greyish yellow, the club black; head, thorax and abdomen are yellow, shaded with fuscous scales; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen are yellowish white. The sex-mark seen from above appears as a thickening of the basal half of the median vein on the forewing.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\n=== Female ===\n\nUpperside: Very similar to that of the male but without the sex-mark; the black areas on both forewings and hindwings slightly broader, with the inner edge of the black terminal band on the hindwing often diffuse.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\nUnderside: ground colour and markings as in the male. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similarly coloured.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\n=== Dry-season form ===\nUpperside: ground colour and markings much as in wet-season specimens, the emargination on the inner side of the black area and the tornal dilatation on the forewing similar. On the hindwing, in the great majority of individuals, the black terminal band is also similar; in a few it is narrower and diffuse inwardly in both sexes.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\nUnderside: ground colour similar to that in wet-season specimens, but very many have a greater or less irroration of black scales over the yellow parts of the wing; the reddish-brown markings on both forewings and hindwings are also similar, but the spots are larger, more clearly defined, darker, and therefore far more conspicuous. In addition, on the forewing there is a preapical, very prominent, transverse, elongate spot or short bar or reddish brown extended downwards from the costa. This spot is irregular in shape and of variable width, but does not seem to ever spread outwards to the actual edge of the termen. In a few specimens there is also a small reddish-brown spot in interspace near the tornus. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen, and in the male, the sex-mark, as in wet-season specimens.<ref name=\"bingham\">{{citation-attribution|{{cite book |last1=Bingham |first1=C.T. |authorlink=Charles Thomas Bingham |title=The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma |url=https://archive.org/stream/butterflies02bingiala#page/250/mode/2up/ |volume=II |edition=1st |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor and Francis, Ltd.]] |location=London |year=1907|pages=250\u2013254}}|}}</ref><ref name=SwinhoeIndica>{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/103631#page/64/mode/1up|title=Lepidoptera Indica.

Forewing: apex and termen deep black, this colour continued narrowly along the costal margin to base of wing, near which it often becomes diffuse; the inner margin of the black area from costa to vein 4 very oblique and irregular, between veins 2 and 4 excavate on the inner side, this excavation outwardly rounded between the veins and inwardly toothed on vein 3; below vein 2 the black area is suddenly dilated into a square spot which occupies the whole of the tornal angle; the inner margin of this dilatation is variable, in the typical form slightly concave. Hindwing: terminal margin with a narrow black band which is attenuated anteriorly and posteriorly; dorsal margin broadly paler than the ground colour.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\nUnderside: yellow, generally a slightly paler shade than that of the upperside, with the following reddish-brown markings. Forewing: two small spots or specks in basal half of cell and a reniform (kidney-shaped) spot or ring on the discocellulars. Hindwing: a slightly curved subbasal series of three small spots, an irregular slender ring or spot on the discocellulars, followed by a highly irregular, curved, transverse, discal series of spots or specks, some or all of which are often obsolescent. On both the forewings and hindwings, the veins that attain the costal and terminal margins end in minute reddish-brown specks. Antenna are greyish yellow, the club black; head, thorax and abdomen are yellow, shaded with fuscous scales; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen are yellowish white. The sex-mark seen from above appears as a thickening of the basal half of the median vein on the forewing.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\n=== Female ===\n\nUpperside: Very similar to that of the male but without the sex-mark; the black areas on both forewings and hindwings slightly broader, with the inner edge of the black terminal band on the hindwing often diffuse.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\nUnderside: ground colour and markings as in the male. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similarly coloured.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\n=== Dry-season form ===\nUpperside: ground colour and markings much as in wet-season specimens, the emargination on the inner side of the black area and the tornal dilatation on the forewing similar. On the hindwing, in the great majority of individuals, the black terminal band is also similar; in a few it is narrower and diffuse inwardly in both sexes.<ref name=\"bingham\"/>\n\nUnderside: ground colour similar to that in wet-season specimens, but very many have a greater or less irroration of black scales over the yellow parts of the wing; the reddish-brown markings on both forewings and hindwings are also similar, but the spots are larger, more clearly defined, darker, and therefore far more conspicuous. In addition, on the forewing there is a preapical, very prominent, transverse, elongate spot or short bar or reddish brown extended downwards from the costa. This spot is irregular in shape and of variable width, but does not seem to ever spread outwards to the actual edge of the termen. In a few specimens there is also a small reddish-brown spot in interspace near the tornus. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen, and in the male, the sex-mark, as in wet-season specimens.<ref name=\"bingham\">{{citation-attribution|{{cite book |last1=Bingham |first1=C.T. |authorlink=Charles Thomas Bingham |title=The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma |url=https://archive.org/stream/butterflies02bingiala#page/250/mode/2up/ |volume=II |edition=1st |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor and Francis, Ltd.]] |location=London |year=1907|pages=250\u2013254}}|}}</ref><ref name=SwinhoeIndica>{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/103631#page/64/mode/1up|title=Lepidoptera Indica.

After the end of the war, he was called to the Bar ([[Middle Temple]]). Following his father, he was elected as an [[Alderman]] of the City of London. He was a Director of Bovis, becoming chairman in 1958, and became an underwriter at [[Lloyd's of London]]. In 1945, Joseph joined the leadership of the Post-War Orphans\u2019 Committee of the Central British Fund for German Jewry (now [[World Jewish Relief]]).<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. ''Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933\u20131945.'' London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.185</ref>\n\n== Member of Parliament ==\nHe failed to be elected to the marginal seat of [[Barons Court (UK Parliament constituency)|Barons Court]] in West London by 125 votes in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 election]].\n\nHe was elected to parliament in a by-election for [[1956 Leeds North East by-election|Leeds North East]] in February 1956. He was swiftly appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary.\n\n=== In government ===\nAfter 1959, Joseph had several junior posts in the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] government at the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government|Ministry of Housing]] and the [[Board of Trade]]. In the 'Night of the Long Knives' reshuffle of 13 July 1962 he was made Minister for Housing and Local Government, a cabinet position. He introduced a massive programme to build [[council housing]], which aimed at 400,000 new homes per year by 1965. He wished to increase the proportion of owner-occupied households, by offering help with mortgage deposits. Housing was an important issue at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]] and Joseph was felt to have done well on television in the campaign.\n\n=== Social Services ===\nIn opposition, Joseph was spokesman on Social Services, and then on Labour under [[Edward Heath]]. He was one of twelve founder members of the NCSWD, the National Council for Single Woman and Her Dependants on 15 December 1965. According to Tim Cook in his book ''The History of the Carers' Movement'', he and [[Sally Oppenheim]] were critical in raising funds from the [[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust|Carnegie]] Trust and other organisations, which enabled the carers movement to succeed and thrive through their formative years.\n\n=== Trade spokesman ===\nDespite Joseph's reputation as a right-winger, Heath promoted him to Trade spokesman in 1967, where he had an important role in policy development. In the run-up to the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 election]] Joseph made a series of speeches under the title \"civilised capitalism\", in which he outlined his political philosophy and hinted of cuts in public spending. At the [[Selsdon Park Hotel]] meeting, the Conservative Party largely adopted this approach.\n\nAfter the Conservatives won the election, Joseph was made [[Secretary of State for Social Services]], which put him in charge of the largest bureaucracy of any government department but kept him out of control of economics. Despite his speeches against bureaucracy, Joseph found himself compelled to add to it as he increased and improved services in the [[National Health Service]]. However, he grew increasingly opposed to the Heath government's economic strategy, which had seen a 'U-turn' in favour of intervention in industry in 1972.\n\n=== 1974 ===\nFollowing the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|election defeat of February 1974]], Joseph worked with [[Margaret Thatcher]] to set up the [[Centre for Policy Studies]], a think-tank to develop policies for the new free-market Conservatism that they both favoured. Joseph became interested in the economic theory of [[monetarism]] as formulated by [[Milton Friedman]] and persuaded Thatcher to support it.<ref>[[Margaret Thatcher]] acknowledged his influence on her intellectual evolution, especially in her book, ''The Path to Power'', 1995</ref>\n\nDespite still being a member of Heath's Shadow Cabinet, Joseph was openly critical of his government's record.  Joseph delivered his famous Stockton lecture on the economy ''Monetarism Is Not Enough'' in which he contrasted wealth-producing sectors in an economy, such as manufacturing, with the service sector and government, which tend to be wealth-consuming. He contended that an economy begins to decline as its wealth-producing sector shrinks.<ref>Sir Keith Joseph, Centre for Policy Studies (5 April 1976).[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110796 Stockton Lecture, ''Monetarism Is Not Enough'', with foreword by Margaret Thatcher].

It covered a variety of [[social conservative|socially-conservative]] topics and drew on an article that had been written by [[Arthur Wynn]] and his wife and published by the [[Child Poverty Action Group]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/29/guardianobituaries.ianaitken|title=Obituary: Arthur Wynn|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2001|accessdate=12 May 2009 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Aitken}}</ref>\n\nThe notion of the \"cycle of deprivation\" holding down poor people was the basis of his speech.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Pierson|author2=Martin Thomas|title=Dictionary of Social Work: The Definitive A to Z of Social Work and Social Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ve0XPezZj28C&pg=PA140|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=140}}</ref> He linked it to current theories of the culture of poverty, especially to the chaotic lifestyle of the poorest people. However, he suggested that poor people should stop having so many children. In his highly publicised speech at Edgbaston, he reflected on the moral and spiritual state of Britain:{{quote|A high and rising proportion of children are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world&nbsp;... Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment. They are unlikely to be able to give children the stable emotional background, the consistent combination of love and firmness&nbsp;... They are producing problem children&nbsp;... The balance of our human stock, is threatened.<ref>Halcrow, p 83</ref>}}\n\nThe outrage, despite his repeated apologies, in reaction to his speech sharply undercut Joseph's campaign to replace Heath as party leader. The speech was largely written by [[Alfred Sherman]], with [[Jonathan Sumption]], but the most controversial sentence was inserted by Joseph himself.<ref>Andrew Denham and Mark Garnett, ''Keith Joseph'' (Acumen, 2002), p. 265.</ref><ref>Moore, ''Thatcher,'' 1:272-4</ref>\n\n=== Thatcher ===\nJoseph withdrew from the contest against Heath and endorsed Thatcher. She had been eager to run but had backed Joseph.\n\nHe now became a major advisor. Thatcher later referred to Joseph as her closest political friend, and they both moved sharply to the right. His overnight conversion to free-market, small-government policies  \"had the force of a religious conversion\".<ref>Andrew Marr, ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2007) p 355</ref> In 1975, he said:{{quote|It was only in April 1974 that I was converted to Conservatism. (I had thought I was a Conservative but I now see that I was not really one at all.)<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Wright|title=British Politics: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCkBJCrjQ4UC&pg=PT49|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=49}}</ref>}}\n\nThis remark expressed Joseph's sense of failure during multiple Conservative governments that had automatically followed the [[post-war consensus]] of a welfare state with strong labour unions. Their policies to stabilise the economy retained government control on industries and creating an intricate system to control wages and dividends.  In the eyes of Thatcher and Joseph, that pragmatic approach was contrary to the true \"Conservative\" ideology. As he had done a great deal to promote Thatcher, when she won the leadership in [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975]], she determined to put him in a position that would facilitate a profound influence on Conservative Party policy.\n\nIn Thatcher's [[Shadow Cabinet]], Joseph wanted to be [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], but that was impossible since his notorious 1974 speech. Instead, he was given overall responsibility for Policy and Research. He had a large impact on the Conservative manifesto for the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]], but frequently, a compromise had to be reached with Heath's more moderate supporters, such as [[James Prior]].\n\nThatcher named Joseph [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|Secretary of State for Industry]]. He began to prepare the many nationalised industries for privatisation by bringing in private sector managers such as [[Ian MacGregor]] but was still forced to give large subsidies to those industries making losses.\n\n=== Secretary of State for Education and Science ===\nAs Thatcher's [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]] from 1981 he started the ball rolling for [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], and the establishment of a national curriculum in England and Wales. [[Mark Carlisle]], his predecessor in the Conservative government in 1979, had cancelled the plans of [[Shirley Williams]], his second-last predecessor, to merge [[O Level]]s and [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSEs]], but he achieved that policy. Although that was not normally the responsibility of central government, he insisted on personally approving the individual subject syllabuses before the GCSE system was introduced.\n\nHis attempts to reform teachers' pay and bring in new contracts were opposed by the trade unions and led to a series of one-day strikes.\n\nIn 1984, his public spending negotiations with his Treasury colleagues resulted in a proposed plan for extra research funding for universities financed through the curtailment of financial support to students who were dependent children of more affluent parents. That plan provoked heated opposition from fellow members of the Cabinet (particularly, [[Cecil Parkinson]]) and a compromise plan was found necessary to secure consensus. The compromise involved the abandonment of Joseph's plan to levy [[tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] but preserved his aspiration to abolish the minimum grant.  The resulting loss to research funding was halved by a concession of further revenue by the Treasury team.\n\nJoseph was one of the ministers to survive the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s [[Brighton hotel bombing|bomb in the Grand Hotel]] during the Conservative Party Conference at [[Brighton]] in 1984.\n\nIn 1985, he published a White Paper on the university sector, ''The Development of Higher Education into the 1990s''. It advocated an appraisal system to assess the relative quality of research and foresaw a retrenchment in the size of the higher education sector. Both proposals were highly controversial.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Backbenches, retirement and peerage ==\n{{Missing information|section|Joseph's death|date=April 2018}}\nJoseph stepped down from the Cabinet in 1986, and retired from Parliament at the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election]]. He was appointed to the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] in 1986.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50547 |date=10 June 1986 |page=7729}}</ref>\n\nHe received a [[life peer]]age in the dissolution honours, being created '''Baron Joseph''', of [[Portsoken]] in the [[City of London]] on 12 October 1987.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=51092 |date=15 October 1987 |page=12747}}</ref>\n\n=== 30-year rule and official documents ===\nAt the end of 2011, the release of confidential documents under the UK Government's 30-year rule revealed Joseph's thoughts regarding the [[Toxteth riots|Liverpool Riots]]. In response to [[Michael Heseltine]]'s regeneration proposal, Joseph suggested that there should be a \"managed rundown\" of Merseyside instead.<ref name=\"Gainsbury\">{{cite news|last=Gainsbury |first=Sally |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd6851e2-2d8a-11e1-b5bf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1i0r4fqrM |title=Tories debated letting Liverpool \u2018decline\u2019 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref> Later, his private secretary asked for minutes of a meeting to be amended to remove reference to explicit economic regeneration as Joseph believed \u201cit is by no means clear that any such strategy could lead to a viable economic entity\u201d.<ref name=\"Gainsbury\" />\n\n==Thought leadership and legacy==\nJoseph's speech ''Monetarism is Not Enough'' was described by Margaret Thatcher as \u201cone of the very few speeches which have fundamentally affected a political generation's way of thinking.\"<ref>Margaret Thatcher'' The Path to Power'' (London 1995), p. 255</ref>\n\nJoseph's political achievement was in pioneering the application of monetarist economics to British political economics, and in developing what would later become known as '[[Thatcherism]]'. He knew his own limitations, remarking of the prospect of his becoming Leader of the Conservative Party that \"it would have been a disaster for the party, country, and me\", and he rated himself a failure in office.\n\nHis political philosophy speeches, which led to his being nicknamed 'The Mad Monk', were ridiculed at the time but they were profoundly influential within the Conservative Party and in practice set the tone for politics in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Personal life==\nJoseph was married twice: firstly, in 1951 to Hellen Guggenheimer, with whom he had four children.

At the end of his term he was created a [[baronet]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_0/page/92 |title=Excerpt from \"The Commanding Heights\" |first1=Daniel |last1=Yergin |authorlink1=Daniel Yergin |first2=Joseph |last2=Stanislaw |authorlink2=Joseph Stanislaw |year=1998 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/commandingheight00yerg_0/page/92 92\u2013105] |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82975-3 |accessdate=22 July 2014 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref>http://www.thepeerage.com/p19148.htm#i191472</ref> Joseph's family was Jewish.\n\nOn the death of his father on 4 October 1944, 26-year-old Keith inherited the [[baronet]]cy.\n\n== Education and academic career==\nJoseph was educated at [[Lockers Park School]] in [[Hemel Hempstead]] in Hertfordshire, followed by [[Harrow School]] and [[Magdalen College]], Oxford, where he studied [[Law|Jurisprudence]], obtaining first class honours. He was elected a Prize Fellow of [[All Souls College]] in 1946.\n\n== Early career ==\nDuring [[World War II]], Joseph served as a captain in the [[Royal Artillery]], and suffered a minor wound during German shelling of his company's headquarters in Italy, as well as being [[mentioned in despatches]]. After the end of the war, he was called to the Bar ([[Middle Temple]]). Following his father, he was elected as an [[Alderman]] of the City of London. He was a Director of Bovis, becoming chairman in 1958, and became an underwriter at [[Lloyd's of London]]. In 1945, Joseph joined the leadership of the Post-War Orphans\u2019 Committee of the Central British Fund for German Jewry (now [[World Jewish Relief]]).<ref>Gottlieb, Amy Zahl. ''Men of Vision: Anglo-Jewry's Aid to Victims of the Nazi Regime, 1933\u20131945.'' London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1998, p.185</ref>\n\n== Member of Parliament ==\nHe failed to be elected to the marginal seat of [[Barons Court (UK Parliament constituency)|Barons Court]] in West London by 125 votes in the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 election]].\n\nHe was elected to parliament in a by-election for [[1956 Leeds North East by-election|Leeds North East]] in February 1956. He was swiftly appointed as a Parliamentary Private Secretary.\n\n=== In government ===\nAfter 1959, Joseph had several junior posts in the [[Harold Macmillan|Macmillan]] government at the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government|Ministry of Housing]] and the [[Board of Trade]]. In the 'Night of the Long Knives' reshuffle of 13 July 1962 he was made Minister for Housing and Local Government, a cabinet position. He introduced a massive programme to build [[council housing]], which aimed at 400,000 new homes per year by 1965. He wished to increase the proportion of owner-occupied households, by offering help with mortgage deposits. Housing was an important issue at the [[1964 United Kingdom general election|1964 election]] and Joseph was felt to have done well on television in the campaign.\n\n=== Social Services ===\nIn opposition, Joseph was spokesman on Social Services, and then on Labour under [[Edward Heath]]. He was one of twelve founder members of the NCSWD, the National Council for Single Woman and Her Dependants on 15 December 1965. According to Tim Cook in his book ''The History of the Carers' Movement'', he and [[Sally Oppenheim]] were critical in raising funds from the [[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust|Carnegie]] Trust and other organisations, which enabled the carers movement to succeed and thrive through their formative years.\n\n=== Trade spokesman ===\nDespite Joseph's reputation as a right-winger, Heath promoted him to Trade spokesman in 1967, where he had an important role in policy development. In the run-up to the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 election]] Joseph made a series of speeches under the title \"civilised capitalism\", in which he outlined his political philosophy and hinted of cuts in public spending. At the [[Selsdon Park Hotel]] meeting, the Conservative Party largely adopted this approach.\n\nAfter the Conservatives won the election, Joseph was made [[Secretary of State for Social Services]], which put him in charge of the largest bureaucracy of any government department but kept him out of control of economics. Despite his speeches against bureaucracy, Joseph found himself compelled to add to it as he increased and improved services in the [[National Health Service]]. However, he grew increasingly opposed to the Heath government's economic strategy, which had seen a 'U-turn' in favour of intervention in industry in 1972.\n\n=== 1974 ===\nFollowing the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|election defeat of February 1974]], Joseph worked with [[Margaret Thatcher]] to set up the [[Centre for Policy Studies]], a think-tank to develop policies for the new free-market Conservatism that they both favoured. Joseph became interested in the economic theory of [[monetarism]] as formulated by [[Milton Friedman]] and persuaded Thatcher to support it.<ref>[[Margaret Thatcher]] acknowledged his influence on her intellectual evolution, especially in her book, ''The Path to Power'', 1995</ref>\n\nDespite still being a member of Heath's Shadow Cabinet, Joseph was openly critical of his government's record.  Joseph delivered his famous Stockton lecture on the economy ''Monetarism Is Not Enough'' in which he contrasted wealth-producing sectors in an economy, such as manufacturing, with the service sector and government, which tend to be wealth-consuming. He contended that an economy begins to decline as its wealth-producing sector shrinks.<ref>Sir Keith Joseph, Centre for Policy Studies (5 April 1976).[http://www.margaretthatcher.org/commentary/displaydocument.asp?docid=110796 Stockton Lecture, ''Monetarism Is Not Enough'', with foreword by Margaret Thatcher].

It covered a variety of [[social conservative|socially-conservative]] topics and drew on an article that had been written by [[Arthur Wynn]] and his wife and published by the [[Child Poverty Action Group]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/sep/29/guardianobituaries.ianaitken|title=Obituary: Arthur Wynn|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2001|accessdate=12 May 2009 | location=London | first=Ian | last=Aitken}}</ref>\n\nThe notion of the \"cycle of deprivation\" holding down poor people was the basis of his speech.<ref>{{cite book|author1=John Pierson|author2=Martin Thomas|title=Dictionary of Social Work: The Definitive A to Z of Social Work and Social Care|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ve0XPezZj28C&pg=PA140|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=140}}</ref> He linked it to current theories of the culture of poverty, especially to the chaotic lifestyle of the poorest people. However, he suggested that poor people should stop having so many children. In his highly publicised speech at Edgbaston, he reflected on the moral and spiritual state of Britain:{{quote|A high and rising proportion of children are being born to mothers least fitted to bring children into the world&nbsp;... Some are of low intelligence, most of low educational attainment. They are unlikely to be able to give children the stable emotional background, the consistent combination of love and firmness&nbsp;... They are producing problem children&nbsp;... The balance of our human stock, is threatened.<ref>Halcrow, p 83</ref>}}\n\nThe outrage, despite his repeated apologies, in reaction to his speech sharply undercut Joseph's campaign to replace Heath as party leader. The speech was largely written by [[Alfred Sherman]], with [[Jonathan Sumption]], but the most controversial sentence was inserted by Joseph himself.<ref>Andrew Denham and Mark Garnett, ''Keith Joseph'' (Acumen, 2002), p. 265.</ref><ref>Moore, ''Thatcher,'' 1:272-4</ref>\n\n=== Thatcher ===\nJoseph withdrew from the contest against Heath and endorsed Thatcher. She had been eager to run but had backed Joseph.\n\nHe now became a major advisor. Thatcher later referred to Joseph as her closest political friend, and they both moved sharply to the right. His overnight conversion to free-market, small-government policies  \"had the force of a religious conversion\".<ref>Andrew Marr, ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2007) p 355</ref> In 1975, he said:{{quote|It was only in April 1974 that I was converted to Conservatism. (I had thought I was a Conservative but I now see that I was not really one at all.)<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Wright|title=British Politics: A Very Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCkBJCrjQ4UC&pg=PT49|year=2013|publisher=Oxford UP|page=49}}</ref>}}\n\nThis remark expressed Joseph's sense of failure during multiple Conservative governments that had automatically followed the [[post-war consensus]] of a welfare state with strong labour unions. Their policies to stabilise the economy retained government control on industries and creating an intricate system to control wages and dividends.  In the eyes of Thatcher and Joseph, that pragmatic approach was contrary to the true \"Conservative\" ideology. As he had done a great deal to promote Thatcher, when she won the leadership in [[1975 Conservative Party leadership election|1975]], she determined to put him in a position that would facilitate a profound influence on Conservative Party policy.\n\nIn Thatcher's [[Shadow Cabinet]], Joseph wanted to be [[Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]], but that was impossible since his notorious 1974 speech. Instead, he was given overall responsibility for Policy and Research. He had a large impact on the Conservative manifesto for the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 election]], but frequently, a compromise had to be reached with Heath's more moderate supporters, such as [[James Prior]].\n\nThatcher named Joseph [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry|Secretary of State for Industry]]. He began to prepare the many nationalised industries for privatisation by bringing in private sector managers such as [[Ian MacGregor]] but was still forced to give large subsidies to those industries making losses.\n\n=== Secretary of State for Education and Science ===\nAs Thatcher's [[Secretary of State for Education and Skills|Secretary of State for Education and Science]] from 1981 he started the ball rolling for [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSEs]], and the establishment of a national curriculum in England and Wales. [[Mark Carlisle]], his predecessor in the Conservative government in 1979, had cancelled the plans of [[Shirley Williams]], his second-last predecessor, to merge [[O Level]]s and [[Certificate of Secondary Education|CSEs]], but he achieved that policy. Although that was not normally the responsibility of central government, he insisted on personally approving the individual subject syllabuses before the GCSE system was introduced.\n\nHis attempts to reform teachers' pay and bring in new contracts were opposed by the trade unions and led to a series of one-day strikes.\n\nIn 1984, his public spending negotiations with his Treasury colleagues resulted in a proposed plan for extra research funding for universities financed through the curtailment of financial support to students who were dependent children of more affluent parents. That plan provoked heated opposition from fellow members of the Cabinet (particularly, [[Cecil Parkinson]]) and a compromise plan was found necessary to secure consensus. The compromise involved the abandonment of Joseph's plan to levy [[tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fees]] but preserved his aspiration to abolish the minimum grant.  The resulting loss to research funding was halved by a concession of further revenue by the Treasury team.\n\nJoseph was one of the ministers to survive the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]'s [[Brighton hotel bombing|bomb in the Grand Hotel]] during the Conservative Party Conference at [[Brighton]] in 1984.\n\nIn 1985, he published a White Paper on the university sector, ''The Development of Higher Education into the 1990s''. It advocated an appraisal system to assess the relative quality of research and foresaw a retrenchment in the size of the higher education sector. Both proposals were highly controversial.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Backbenches, retirement and peerage ==\n{{Missing information|section|Joseph's death|date=April 2018}}\nJoseph stepped down from the Cabinet in 1986, and retired from Parliament at the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 election]]. He was appointed to the [[Order of the Companions of Honour]] in 1986.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=50547 |date=10 June 1986 |page=7729}}</ref>\n\nHe received a [[life peer]]age in the dissolution honours, being created '''Baron Joseph''', of [[Portsoken]] in the [[City of London]] on 12 October 1987.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=51092 |date=15 October 1987 |page=12747}}</ref>\n\n=== 30-year rule and official documents ===\nAt the end of 2011, the release of confidential documents under the UK Government's 30-year rule revealed Joseph's thoughts regarding the [[Toxteth riots|Liverpool Riots]]. In response to [[Michael Heseltine]]'s regeneration proposal, Joseph suggested that there should be a \"managed rundown\" of Merseyside instead.<ref name=\"Gainsbury\">{{cite news|last=Gainsbury |first=Sally |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/cd6851e2-2d8a-11e1-b5bf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1i0r4fqrM |title=Tories debated letting Liverpool \u2018decline\u2019 |newspaper=Financial Times |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=22 July 2014}}</ref> Later, his private secretary asked for minutes of a meeting to be amended to remove reference to explicit economic regeneration as Joseph believed \u201cit is by no means clear that any such strategy could lead to a viable economic entity\u201d.<ref name=\"Gainsbury\" />\n\n==Thought leadership and legacy==\nJoseph's speech ''Monetarism is Not Enough'' was described by Margaret Thatcher as \u201cone of the very few speeches which have fundamentally affected a political generation's way of thinking.\"<ref>Margaret Thatcher'' The Path to Power'' (London 1995), p. 255</ref>\n\nJoseph's political achievement was in pioneering the application of monetarist economics to British political economics, and in developing what would later become known as '[[Thatcherism]]'. He knew his own limitations, remarking of the prospect of his becoming Leader of the Conservative Party that \"it would have been a disaster for the party, country, and me\", and he rated himself a failure in office.\n\nHis political philosophy speeches, which led to his being nicknamed 'The Mad Monk', were ridiculed at the time but they were profoundly influential within the Conservative Party and in practice set the tone for politics in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n==Personal life==\nJoseph was married twice: firstly, in 1951 to Hellen Guggenheimer, with whom he had four children.

The band combined elements of [[Folk music|folk]] and [[country music]] with [[British invasion]] and [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic-rock]] influences, and, along with [[the Byrds]], were part of the early development of [[folk rock|folk-rock]].\n\nWith a name taken from the manufacturer's nameplate from a [[steamroller]], Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]] (drums, vocals), [[Bruce Palmer]] (bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals).<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Russell|title=Encyclopedia of Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZjoO9_YhfwC|year=1983|publisher=Crescent Books|isbn=978-0-517-40865-0|page=161}}</ref> The band signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1966 and released their debut single \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", which became a hit in Los Angeles.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web|title=Buffalo Springfield|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio/|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> The following January, the group released the [[protest song]] \"[[For What It's Worth]]\", for which they are now best known.<ref name=AM/> Their second album, ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]'', marked their progression to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]].<ref name=AM>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0000939567|tab=biography|label=Artist Biography|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter various drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group broke up in 1968. Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] with [[David Crosby]] of [[the Byrds]] and [[Graham Nash]] of [[the Hollies]]. Neil Young launched his solo career and later joined Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. Furay, along with [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], went on to form the country-rock band [[Poco]].<ref name=\"Eder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poco-mn0000297894/biography\n|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Poco|author=Bruce Eder}}</ref> Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997.<ref name=RRHF/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n[[Neil Young]] and [[Stephen Stills]] met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario. Young was there with [[the Squires]], a [[Winnipeg]] group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with [[The Company (folk-rock band)|The Company]], a spin-off from the [[Cafe Au Go Go|Au Go Go Singers]]. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where he worked as a [[session musician]] and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, [[the Monkees]].<ref name=\"Prown Newquist 1997\">{{cite book|author= Pete Prown, HP Newquist|date= 1997|title= Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|page= 45|publisher= Hal Leonard| ISBN= 978-0-7935-4042-6}}</ref> Told by record producer [[Barry Friedman]] there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player [[Ken Koblun]] to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]].\n\nWhile in Toronto in early 1966, Young met [[Bruce Palmer]], a Canadian who was playing bass for [[The Mynah Birds]]. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for [[Motown Records]] when their singer Ricky James Matthews\u2014James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as [[Rick James]]\u2014was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being [[Desertion|AWOL]]. \n\nWith their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer pawned the Mynah Birds' musical equipment and bought a 1953 [[Pontiac]] [[hearse]], which they drove to Los Angeles.<ref name=\"WFP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|title=One moment that made music history|author=John Einarson|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=April 16, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}</ref> Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet [[Stephen Stills]], whom Young had previously learned was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name=\"WFP\"/> \n\nDrummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group the [[Standells]] and [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[the Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of the [[Byrds]]' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on April 11, 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood|Hollywood]], mere days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[the Dillards]] and [[the Byrds]].\n\n=== Management and first recordings ===\n[[Chris Hillman]] of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.\n\nThe first Buffalo Springfield single, \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by the Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.\n[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]\nIn November 1966, Stills composed \"[[For What It's Worth]]\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=Latimes.com|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" with \"For What It's Worth\" and re-releasing the album. \"For What It's Worth\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"Murrells 1978\">{{cite book| author = Joseph Murrells| year = 1978| title = The Book of Golden Discs| publisher = Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217 217]| isbn = 978-0-214-20512-5| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217}}</ref>\n\n=== Lineup changes and breakup ===\nIn January 1967, Palmer was deported for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Bruce Palmer|author=Adam Sweeting|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= October 16, 2004}}</ref>\n\nPalmer returned to the group at the beginning of June, while Young was temporarily absent. (Guitarist Doug Hastings filled in for Young during this period.) The band, with [[David Crosby]] sitting in for Young, played the [[Monterey Pop Festival]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA160#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=160|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|author=Peter Lavezzoli|publisher=A&C Black|date= April 24, 2006}}</ref> Young returned in August and the band severed ties with Greene and Stone, then divided its time between playing gigs and finalising the second album, ultimately titled ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]''. Produced by Ertegun, ''Buffalo Springfield Again'' was released in November 1967. It includes \"[[Mr. Soul]]\", \"Rock & Roll Woman\", \"Bluebird\", \"Sad Memory\", and \"Broken Arrow\". The band toured as support for [[the Beach Boys]] during early 1968.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OCL_DAAAQBAJ&pg=PT34#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=34|title=Neil Young: Heart of Gold|author= Harvey Kubernik|publisher=Omnibus Press|date= November 9, 2015}}</ref> In January of that year, after Palmer was again deported for drug possession, [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], who had worked as engineer on the band's second album, was hired as a permanent replacement on [[electric bass|bass]].<ref name=\"break\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XG9CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA125#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=125|title=The 100 Greatest Bands of All Time: A Guide to the Legends Who Rocked the World|author=David V. Moskowitz|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= November 10, 2015}}</ref> During this period Young began to appear less and less frequently, and he often left Stills to handle lead-guitar parts at concerts. Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing. In April 1968, Young, Furay, and Messina were arrested for disturbing the peace after making too much noise during a party with [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=\"break\" /> Following a gig at the [[Long Beach Arena]] on May 5, 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup \u2013 Stills and Furay staying with Atlantic, Young going to Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"break\" /> Furay and Messina then compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).\n\n== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\nMartin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[the Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's Love, bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]], and others.\n\nThe new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized \"Holiday Rock Festival\" in San Francisco on December 25\u201326, 1968, but soon fell afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to abandon future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to work as New Buffalo. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1969 Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob \"BJ\" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and he Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called [[Medicine Ball]], which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which didn't appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.\n\nIn 1984 Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), Stan Endersby (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form The Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin would drop out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave the BSR permission to tour with this name. \n\nIn July 1986 a full reunion of Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills all gathered together at Stills' house, with current BSR keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the  1986 rehearsals was preserved on video and would be the last time all five original members would be seen together. The plans for a reunion tour were abandoned.\n\nBy 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California|Topanga]], where Dennis Knicely joined on percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and Michael Curtis (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992 and he retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== 2011 reunion tour ==\nOn his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to reform the group and to \"see those guys again and give it a shot\" (\"Buffalo Springfield Again\"). Due to the deaths of Palmer (in 2004) and Martin (in 2009), a true reunion of the original lineup is now impossible, but surviving members Young, Stills, and Furay reunited at the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]] concerts on October 23 and 24, 2010, in [[Mountain View, California]].

The group released three albums and several singles, including \"[[For What It's Worth]]\". The band combined elements of [[Folk music|folk]] and [[country music]] with [[British invasion]] and [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic-rock]] influences, and, along with [[the Byrds]], were part of the early development of [[folk rock|folk-rock]].\n\nWith a name taken from the manufacturer's nameplate from a [[steamroller]], Buffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]] (drums, vocals), [[Bruce Palmer]] (bass), Furay (guitar, vocals), and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals).<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Russell|title=Encyclopedia of Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZjoO9_YhfwC|year=1983|publisher=Crescent Books|isbn=978-0-517-40865-0|page=161}}</ref> The band signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1966 and released their debut single \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", which became a hit in Los Angeles.<ref name=RRHF>{{cite web|title=Buffalo Springfield|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio/|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref> The following January, the group released the [[protest song]] \"[[For What It's Worth]]\", for which they are now best known.<ref name=AM/> Their second album, ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]'', marked their progression to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[hard rock]].<ref name=AM>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=mn0000939567|tab=biography|label=Artist Biography|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|accessdate=February 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter various drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group broke up in 1968. Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] with [[David Crosby]] of [[the Byrds]] and [[Graham Nash]] of [[the Hollies]]. Neil Young launched his solo career and later joined Stills in Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young in 1969. Furay, along with [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], went on to form the country-rock band [[Poco]].<ref name=\"Eder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poco-mn0000297894/biography\n|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Poco|author=Bruce Eder}}</ref> Buffalo Springfield was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997.<ref name=RRHF/>\n\n== History ==\n=== Origins ===\n[[Neil Young]] and [[Stephen Stills]] met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario. Young was there with [[the Squires]], a [[Winnipeg]] group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with [[The Company (folk-rock band)|The Company]], a spin-off from the [[Cafe Au Go Go|Au Go Go Singers]]. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where he worked as a [[session musician]] and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, [[the Monkees]].<ref name=\"Prown Newquist 1997\">{{cite book|author= Pete Prown, HP Newquist|date= 1997|title= Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|page= 45|publisher= Hal Leonard| ISBN= 978-0-7935-4042-6}}</ref> Told by record producer [[Barry Friedman]] there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player [[Ken Koblun]] to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]].\n\nWhile in Toronto in early 1966, Young met [[Bruce Palmer]], a Canadian who was playing bass for [[The Mynah Birds]]. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for [[Motown Records]] when their singer Ricky James Matthews\u2014James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as [[Rick James]]\u2014was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being [[Desertion|AWOL]]. \n\nWith their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer pawned the Mynah Birds' musical equipment and bought a 1953 [[Pontiac]] [[hearse]], which they drove to Los Angeles.<ref name=\"WFP\">{{cite web|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|title=One moment that made music history|author=John Einarson|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=April 16, 2017|accessdate=November 26, 2018}}</ref> Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet [[Stephen Stills]], whom Young had previously learned was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name=\"WFP\"/> \n\nDrummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group the [[Standells]] and [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[the Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of the [[Byrds]]' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on April 11, 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood|Hollywood]], mere days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[the Dillards]] and [[the Byrds]].\n\n=== Management and first recordings ===\n[[Chris Hillman]] of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.\n\nThe first Buffalo Springfield single, \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the Top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by the Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in December 1966. A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.\n[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]\nIn November 1966, Stills composed \"[[For What It's Worth]]\" in response to a protest that had turned into a riot following the closing of a nightclub called [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=Latimes.com|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards. By March 1967, it was a Top Ten hit. Atco took advantage of this momentum by replacing the song \"Baby Don't Scold Me\" with \"For What It's Worth\" and re-releasing the album. \"For What It's Worth\" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"Murrells 1978\">{{cite book| author = Joseph Murrells| year = 1978| title = The Book of Golden Discs| publisher = Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| page = [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217 217]| isbn = 978-0-214-20512-5| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/217}}</ref>\n\n=== Lineup changes and breakup ===\nIn January 1967, Palmer was deported for possession of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/oct/16/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1|title=Bruce Palmer|author=Adam Sweeting|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date= October 16, 2004}}</ref>\n\nPalmer returned to the group at the beginning of June, while Young was temporarily absent. (Guitarist Doug Hastings filled in for Young during this period.) The band, with [[David Crosby]] sitting in for Young, played the [[Monterey Pop Festival]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OSZKCXtx-wEC&pg=PA160#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=160|title=The Dawn of Indian Music in the West|author=Peter Lavezzoli|publisher=A&C Black|date= April 24, 2006}}</ref> Young returned in August and the band severed ties with Greene and Stone, then divided its time between playing gigs and finalising the second album, ultimately titled ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]''. Produced by Erteg\u00fcn, ''Buffalo Springfield Again'' was released in November 1967. It includes \"[[Mr. Soul]]\", \"Rock & Roll Woman\", \"Bluebird\", \"Sad Memory\", and \"Broken Arrow\".

Moskowitz|publisher=ABC-CLIO|date= November 10, 2015}}</ref> During this period Young began to appear less and less frequently, and he often left Stills to handle lead-guitar parts at concerts. Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing. In April 1968, Young, Furay, and Messina were arrested for disturbing the peace after making too much noise during a party with [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=\"break\" /> Following a gig at the [[Long Beach Arena]] on May 5, 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup \u2013 Stills and Furay staying with Atlantic, Young going to Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"break\" /> Furay and Messina then compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).\n\n== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\nMartin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[the Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's Love, bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]], and others.\n\nThe new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized \"Holiday Rock Festival\" in San Francisco on December 25\u201326, 1968, but soon fell afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to abandon future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to work as New Buffalo. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1969 Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob \"BJ\" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and he Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called [[Medicine Ball]], which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which didn't appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.\n\nIn 1984 Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), Stan Endersby (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form The Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin would drop out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave the BSR permission to tour with this name. \n\nIn July 1986 a full reunion of Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills all gathered together at Stills' house, with current BSR keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the  1986 rehearsals was preserved on video and would be the last time all five original members would be seen together. The plans for a reunion tour were abandoned.\n\nBy 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California|Topanga]], where Dennis Knicely joined on percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and Michael Curtis (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992 and he retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== 2011 reunion tour ==\nOn his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to reform the group and to \"see those guys again and give it a shot\" (\"Buffalo Springfield Again\"). Due to the deaths of Palmer (in 2004) and Martin (in 2009), a true reunion of the original lineup is now impossible, but surviving members Young, Stills, and Furay reunited at the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]] concerts on October 23 and 24, 2010, in [[Mountain View, California]].
