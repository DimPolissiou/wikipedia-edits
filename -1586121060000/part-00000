The population was 4,527 at the [[2010 United States Census]]. It is one of the island's principal points of arrival for summer tourists, and is noted for its \"gingerbread cottages\" and other well-preserved mid- to late-nineteenth-century buildings.  The town has been an historically important center of African American culture since the eighteenth century.\n\n==History==\nThe first inhabitants of Oak Bluffs were the [[Wampanoag]] people, who have lived on Martha's Vineyard (Wampanoag name: Noepe) for approximately 10,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wampanoagtribe.net/Pages/Wampanoag_WebDocs/history_culture |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715073751/http://www.wampanoagtribe.net/Pages/Wampanoag_WebDocs/history_culture |archive-date=2006-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The area that is now Oak Bluffs was called \"Ogkeshkuppe,\" which means \"damp/wet thicket or woods.\" <ref>http://history.vineyard.net/dukes/bnk2ob_3.htm</ref>\n\nThe area was later settled by Europeans in 1642 and was part of [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]] until 1880, when it was officially incorporated as Cottage City. The town re-incorporated in 1907 as Oak Bluffs, named because the town was the site of an [[oak]] grove along the bluffs overlooking [[Nantucket Sound]]. Oak Bluffs was the only one of the six towns on the island to be consciously planned, and the only one developed specifically with tourism in mind.\n\nPeople of African descent first arrived at Martha's Vineyard in the 1600s as enslaved West Africans who worked on the farms of European settlers. The Oak Bluffs harbor drew freed slaves, laborers and sailors in the 18th century, and white locals sold them land.<ref name=\"nyt-Calmes\">{{cite web|last=Calmes|first=Jackie|title=Revisiting Black History on Martha\u2019s Vineyard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/us/30vineyard.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-09-11|date=2010-08-29}}</ref> After slavery was [[Slavery in the United States#The end of slavery|abolished]], the freed blacks came to work in the fishing industries, in turn drawing black residents from the Massachusetts mainland, who came and started businesses to serve the Vineyard's growing population.<ref name=\"placeOfOurOwn-place\" /> In the 1800s some black laborers also worked as servants to wealthy white families and in the hotels.<ref name=\"wp-Brown\"/> In the late 19th and 20th centuries, middle-class blacks bought or rented summer homes, and many of their descendants returned annually.<ref name=\"nyt-Calmes\" /> Formerly enslaved people, or their descendants, bought property around Baptist Temple Park in the early 20th century, drawn by the religious services held there.

It was built by a Charles Shearer, the son of a slave and a slave owner, when Shearer saw that black visitors were not able to stay at the homes due to [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. Guests at the inn included the first self-made American millionairess [[Madame CJ Walker]], singers [[Paul Robeson]], [[Ethel Waters]] and [[Lillian Evanti]]; and composer [[Harry T. Burleigh]].<ref name=\"wp-Brown\"/><ref name=\"cbs-smithsonian\">{{cite web|title=How a small town on Martha's Vineyard became a getaway for African-American elite|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/marthas-vineyard-oak-bluffs-smithsonian-national-museum-of-african-american-history-and-culture/|website=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=2017-09-11|date=2016-09-08}}</ref>\n\nIn 1866 [[Robert Morris Copeland]] was hired by a group of New England developers to design a planned residential community in Martha's Vineyard. The site, a large, rolling, treeless pasture overlooking Vineyard Sound, was adjacent to the immensely popular [[Wesleyan Grove|Methodist camp meeting]], Wesleyan Grove, a curving network of narrow streets lined with quaint \"Carpenter's Gothic\" cottages, picket fences, and pocket parks. Seeking to take advantage of the camp's seasonal popularity (and overflowing population), the developers established Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company, gaining immediate success: Five hundred lots were sold between 1868 and 1871.  Copeland would end up creating three plans for the community to accommodate its constant expansion. Oak Bluffs is the one of the earliest planned residential communities and largely informed later suburban development in the United States.<ref>Ellen Weiss, \"Robert Morris Copeland's Plans for Oak Bluffs.\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 34, No. 1 (March, 1975) pp. 60-66.</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest visitors to the area that became Cottage City and later Oak Bluffs were [[Methodists]], who gathered in the oak grove each summer for multi-day religious \"camp meetings\" held under large tents and in the open air.  As families returned to the grove year after year, tents pitched on the ground gave way to tents pitched on wooden platforms and eventually to small wooden cottages.  Small in scale and closely packed, the cottages grew more elaborate over time.  Porches, balconies, elaborate door and window frames became common, as did complex wooden scrollwork affixed to the roof edges as decorative trim.  The unique \"Carpenter's Gothic\" architectural style of the cottages was often accented by the owner's use of bright, multi-hue paint schemes, and gave the summer cottages a quaint, almost storybook look. Dubbed \"gingerbread cottages,\" they became a tourist attraction in their own right in the late nineteenth century.  So, too, did the Tabernacle: a circular, open-sided pavilion covered by a metal roof supported by tall wrought iron columns, erected in the late 1880s, which became a venue for services and community events.  The campground's gingerbread cottages are cherished historic landmarks as well as very expensive real estate. Many are still family owned and passed on generation to generation.  On April 5, 2005, the grounds and buildings in the Campground were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nNineteenth-century tourists, arriving by steamer from the mainland, could also choose from a wide range of secular attractions: shops, restaurants, ice cream parlors, dance halls, band concerts, walks along seaside promenades, or swims in the waters of Nantucket Sound.  Resort hotels, of which the Wesley House is the sole surviving example, lined the waterfront and the bluffs. For a time, a narrow-gauge railway carried curious travelers from the steamship wharf in Oak Bluffs to Edgartown, running along tracks laid on what is now Joseph Sylvia State Beach.  In 1884, the [[Flying Horses Carousel]] was brought to Oak Bluffs from [[Coney Island]] and installed a few blocks inland from the ocean, where it remains in operation today. Built in 1876, it is the oldest platform carousel still in operation.  Like the grounds and buildings of the Campground (so designated in April 2005), the Flying Horses were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nIn 1873 the neighboring community of [[Harthaven]] was established by [[William H. Hart]] when he purchased a lot from the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company. The community later moved in 1911 to its present location between Oak Bluffs town and Edgartown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oak Bluffs View.jpg|thumb|The lights of Oak Bluffs at twilight viewed from Mashpee (about 9 miles/14.5 km distant)]]\n[[Image:OakBluffs2.jpg|thumb|More cottages in the Campground area]]\n[[Image:Ocean Park Oak Bluffs.jpg|thumb|upright|Ocean Park [[gazebo]], Oak Bluffs]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|26.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|7.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|18.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (71.61%) is water.  In terms of land area, the town is 323rd out of 351 communities in the Commonwealth, and the third smallest community (behind [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]] and [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]]) in Dukes County. Oak Bluffs is bordered by [[Nantucket Sound]] to the north and east, [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]] to the south, and Vineyard Haven Harbor, Lagoon Pond and [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]] to the west. It also shares a common corner, along with Tisbury and Edgartown, with [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]].\n\nThe northernmost point of the town, [[East Chop]], is just over five miles from the mainland. The town shares Sengekontacket Pond with Edgartown, with the town's land ending at Sarson's Island, but wrapping around the waters around Felix Neck into Major's Cove. The highest points in town are between Sengekontacket and Lagoon Ponds, and west of Lagoon Pond in the irregular triangle of land which juts into Tisbury.\n\n[[File:OakBluffsFishingPier.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Oak Bluffs Fishing Pier]]\nThere are four public beaches in the town: Eastville Beach, facing Vineyard Haven Harbor and adjacent to the entrance to Lagoon Pond; Oak Bluffs Town Beach or The\u201d Inkwell\u201d  is the name of the popular beach frequented by African Americans beginning in the late nineteenth century. The strand was pejoratively called \u201cThe Inkwell\u201d by nearby whites in reference to the skin color of the beach-goers.  It is the most famous of beaches across the U.S. to transform this odious nickname into an emblem of pride,<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/aah/inkwell-martha-s-vineyard-1890s#sthash.4iq786D6.dpuf MARTHA\u2019S VINEYARD INKWELL (1890S\u2013 ) POSTED ON FEBRUARY 7, 2013]</ref> bordering Nantucket Sound just south of the Steamship Authority Pier; Hart Haven Beach, further to the south; and Joseph Sylvia State Beach, a barrier beach (shared by Oak Bluffs and [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]]) that separates Sengekontacket Pond from Nantucket Sound. State Beach is punctuated by two inlets that connect the pond to the ocean.  The smaller of the two is spanned by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Bridge, which lies wholly within Oak Bluffs, and the larger by the American Legion Bridge, the midpoint of which is the boundary between Oak Bluffs and Edgartown.  The formal names of the bridges are generally ignored by residents in favor of the traditional designations \"Little Bridge\" and \"Big Bridge.\"\n\nOak Bluffs has a small, tightly enclosed harbor that draws large numbers of recreational boaters, and serves as a year-round home port to a small number of fishing boats. Seasonal passenger ferries to [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]], [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]], and [[Nantucket]] dock along the east side of the harbor, as does a high-speed ferry to [[Quonset, Rhode Island|Quonset Point, RI]].  The seasonal car-and-truck-ferry service operated by the Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority docks outside the harbor, at a long pier projecting into [[Nantucket Sound]], as does the fast ferry that provides seasonal service to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. The exposed nature of the pier means that Steamship Authority ferries are routinely diverted to Vineyard Haven during strong northeasterly winds.  Oak Bluffs is also the site of Trade Winds Airport, a private grass landing strip located just north of Sengekontacket Pond.\n\n==Tourism==\nThe \"[[Grand Illumination]]\" is a yearly event, usually held in August, the date of which is not always publicly disclosed. For the 2012 summer events, there was an open Cottage Tour, of the National Historical Registered homes, on Wednesday, August 8, and Grand Illumination Night on Wednesday, August 15.<ref>http://www.mvcma.org/events.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618162134/http://www.mvcma.org/events.htm |date=2012-06-18 }} (dead link)</ref> Martha's Vineyard, Oak Bluffs and the Campground events attract many tourists. For one special night, residents of the Campground place ornate Chinese lanterns (some electric, some still lit with just a candle), around each Gingerbread Cottage. The lanterns remain dark until after dusk. At an appointed hour, people gather in the Tabernacle for a sing-along and community gathering. At the end all the lights go out and thousands of Chinese lanterns spring to life in a brilliant cascade of light throughout the campground. The celebration ends after visitors walk through the Campground enjoying the sights and sounds of an event taken straight from the mid 1800s.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWt_mrbBAQo</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA\n | 1880|672\n | 1890|1080\n | 1900|1100\n | 1910|1084\n | 1920|1047\n | 1930|1333\n | 1940|1584\n | 1950|1521\n | 1960|1419\n | 1970|1385\n | 1980|1984\n | 1990|2804\n | 2000|3713\n | 2010|4527\n | footnote=* = population estimate.

The [[population density]] was 504.1 people per square mile (194.5/km\u00b2).  There were 3,820 housing units at an average density of 518.6 per square mile (200.1/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the town was 86.72% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 4.31% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 1.51% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.67% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 2.50% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 4.28% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.19% of the population.\n\nLike other towns in Southeastern Massachusetts, Oak Bluffs has had a large [[Portuguese-American]] population since the late 19th century. Many of these town residents were originally from the island of [[Faial Island|Faial]] in the [[Azores]], and the neighborhood where many of them lived, located between Vineyard Avenue and Wing Rd, was once nicknamed Fayal. Today the town's Portuguese heritage is best appreciated at the Annual Portuguese Feast, held at the Portuguese-American Club on Vineyard Avenue in mid-July.\n\nThere were 1,590 households out of which 27.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 42.5% were non-families, 32.6% were made up of individuals and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.94.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out with 22.6% under the age of 18, 6.0% from 18 to 24, 31.9% from 25 to 44, 24.8% from 45 to 64, and 14.8% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.3 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.2 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the town was $42,044, and the median income for a family was $53,841. Males had a median income of $39,113 versus $31,797 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $23,829.  About 6.2% of families and 8.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 13.0% of those under age 18 and 8.5% of those age 65 or over.\n\nOak Bluffs ranks 263rd in population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and third in Dukes County (behind Edgartown and Tisbury).

located on the island of [[Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Dukes County, Massachusetts|Dukes County]], [[Massachusetts]], United States.  The population was 4,527 at the [[2010 United States Census]]. It is one of the island's principal points of arrival for summer tourists, and is noted for its \"gingerbread cottages\" and other well-preserved mid- to late-nineteenth-century buildings.  The town has been an historically important center of African American culture since the eighteenth century.\n\n==History==\nThe first inhabitants of Oak Bluffs were the [[Wampanoag]] people, who have lived on Martha's Vineyard (Wampanoag name: Noepe) for approximately 10,000 years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wampanoagtribe.net/Pages/Wampanoag_WebDocs/history_culture |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-09-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715073751/http://www.wampanoagtribe.net/Pages/Wampanoag_WebDocs/history_culture |archive-date=2006-07-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The area that is now Oak Bluffs was called \"Ogkeshkuppe,\" which means \"damp/wet thicket or woods.\" <ref>http://history.vineyard.net/dukes/bnk2ob_3.htm</ref>\n\nThe area was later settled by Europeans in 1642 and was part of [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]] until 1880, when it was officially incorporated as Cottage City. The town re-incorporated in 1907 as Oak Bluffs, named because the town was the site of an [[oak]] grove along the bluffs overlooking [[Nantucket Sound]]. Oak Bluffs was the only one of the six towns on the island to be consciously planned, and the only one developed specifically with tourism in mind.\n\nPeople of African descent first arrived at Martha\u2019s Vineyard in the 1600s as enslaved West Africans who worked on the farms of European settlers. The Oak Bluffs harbor drew freed slaves, laborers and sailors in the 18th century, and white locals sold them land.<ref name=\"nyt-Calmes\">{{cite web|last=Calmes|first=Jackie|title=Revisiting Black History on Martha\u2019s Vineyard|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/us/30vineyard.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2017-09-11|date=2010-08-29}}</ref> After slavery was [[Slavery in the United States#The end of slavery|abolished]], the freed blacks came to work in the fishing industries, in turn drawing black residents from the Massachusetts mainland, who came and started businesses to serve the Vineyard\u2019s growing population.<ref name=\"placeOfOurOwn-place\" /> In the 1800s some black laborers also worked as servants to wealthy white families and in the hotels.<ref name=\"wp-Brown\"/> In the late 19th and 20th centuries, middle-class blacks bought or rented summer homes, and many of their descendants returned annually.<ref name=\"nyt-Calmes\" /> Formerly enslaved people, or their descendants, bought property around Baptist Temple Park in the early 20th century, drawn by the religious services held there.

The site, a large, rolling, treeless pasture overlooking Vineyard Sound, was adjacent to the immensely popular [[Wesleyan Grove|Methodist camp meeting]], Wesleyan Grove, a curving network of narrow streets lined with quaint \"Carpenter's Gothic\" cottages, picket fences, and pocket parks. Seeking to take advantage of the camp\u2019s seasonal popularity (and overflowing population), the developers established Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company, gaining immediate success: Five hundred lots were sold between 1868 and 1871.  Copeland would end up creating three plans for the community to accommodate its constant expansion. Oak Bluffs is the one of the earliest planned residential communities and largely informed later suburban development in the United States.<ref>Ellen Weiss, \"Robert Morris Copeland's Plans for Oak Bluffs.\" Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 34, No. 1 (March, 1975) pp. 60-66.</ref>\n\nSome of the earliest visitors to the area that became Cottage City and later Oak Bluffs were [[Methodists]], who gathered in the oak grove each summer for multi-day religious \"camp meetings\" held under large tents and in the open air.  As families returned to the grove year after year, tents pitched on the ground gave way to tents pitched on wooden platforms and eventually to small wooden cottages.  Small in scale and closely packed, the cottages grew more elaborate over time.  Porches, balconies, elaborate door and window frames became common, as did complex wooden scrollwork affixed to the roof edges as decorative trim.  The unique \"Carpenter's Gothic\" architectural style of the cottages was often accented by the owner's use of bright, multi-hue paint schemes, and gave the summer cottages a quaint, almost storybook look. Dubbed \"gingerbread cottages,\" they became a tourist attraction in their own right in the late nineteenth century.  So, too, did the Tabernacle: a circular, open-sided pavilion covered by a metal roof supported by tall wrought iron columns, erected in the late 1880s, which became a venue for services and community events.  The campground's gingerbread cottages are cherished historic landmarks as well as very expensive real estate. Many are still family owned and passed on generation to generation.  On April 5, 2005, the grounds and buildings in the Campground were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nNineteenth-century tourists, arriving by steamer from the mainland, could also choose from a wide range of secular attractions: shops, restaurants, ice cream parlors, dance halls, band concerts, walks along seaside promenades, or swims in the waters of Nantucket Sound.  Resort hotels, of which the Wesley House is the sole surviving example, lined the waterfront and the bluffs. For a time, a narrow-gauge railway carried curious travelers from the steamship wharf in Oak Bluffs to Edgartown, running along tracks laid on what is now Joseph Sylvia State Beach.  In 1884, the [[Flying Horses Carousel]] was brought to Oak Bluffs from [[Coney Island]] and installed a few blocks inland from the ocean, where it remains in operation today. Built in 1876, it is the oldest platform carousel still in operation.  Like the grounds and buildings of the Campground (so designated in April 2005), the Flying Horses were designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the Secretary of the Interior.\n\nIn 1873 the neighboring community of [[Harthaven]] was established by [[William H. Hart]] when he purchased a lot from the Oak Bluffs Land and Wharf Company. The community later moved in 1911 to its present location between Oak Bluffs town and Edgartown.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Oak Bluffs View.jpg|thumb|The lights of Oak Bluffs at twilight viewed from Mashpee (about 9 miles/14.5 km distant)]]\n[[Image:OakBluffs2.jpg|thumb|More cottages in the Campground area]]\n[[Image:Ocean Park Oak Bluffs.jpg|thumb|upright|Ocean Park [[gazebo]], Oak Bluffs]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|26.0|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|7.4|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|18.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (71.61%) is water.  In terms of land area, the town is 323rd out of 351 communities in the Commonwealth, and the third smallest community (behind [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]] and [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]]) in Dukes County. Oak Bluffs is bordered by [[Nantucket Sound]] to the north and east, [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]] to the south, and Vineyard Haven Harbor, Lagoon Pond and [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]] to the west. It also shares a common corner, along with Tisbury and Edgartown, with [[West Tisbury, Massachusetts|West Tisbury]].\n\nThe northernmost point of the town, [[East Chop]], is just over five miles from the mainland. The town shares Sengekontacket Pond with Edgartown, with the town's land ending at Sarson's Island, but wrapping around the waters around Felix Neck into Major's Cove. The highest points in town are between Sengekontacket and Lagoon Ponds, and west of Lagoon Pond in the irregular triangle of land which juts into Tisbury.\n\n[[File:OakBluffsFishingPier.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Oak Bluffs Fishing Pier]]\nThere are four public beaches in the town: Eastville Beach, facing Vineyard Haven Harbor and adjacent to the entrance to Lagoon Pond; Oak Bluffs Town Beach or The\u201d Inkwell\u201d  is the name of the popular beach frequented by African Americans beginning in the late nineteenth century. The strand was pejoratively called \u201cThe Inkwell\u201d by nearby whites in reference to the skin color of the beach-goers.  It is the most famous of beaches across the U.S. to transform this odious nickname into an emblem of pride,<ref>[http://www.blackpast.org/aah/inkwell-martha-s-vineyard-1890s#sthash.4iq786D6.dpuf MARTHA\u2019S VINEYARD INKWELL (1890S\u2013 ) POSTED ON FEBRUARY 7, 2013]</ref> bordering Nantucket Sound just south of the Steamship Authority Pier; Hart Haven Beach, further to the south; and Joseph Sylvia State Beach, a barrier beach (shared by Oak Bluffs and [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]]) that separates Sengekontacket Pond from Nantucket Sound. State Beach is punctuated by two inlets that connect the pond to the ocean.  The smaller of the two is spanned by the Veterans of Foreign Wars Bridge, which lies wholly within Oak Bluffs, and the larger by the American Legion Bridge, the midpoint of which is the boundary between Oak Bluffs and Edgartown.  The formal names of the bridges are generally ignored by residents in favor of the traditional designations \"Little Bridge\" and \"Big Bridge.\"\n\nOak Bluffs has a small, tightly enclosed harbor that draws large numbers of recreational boaters, and serves as a year-round home port to a small number of fishing boats. Seasonal passenger ferries to [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]], [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]], and [[Nantucket]] dock along the east side of the harbor, as does a high-speed ferry to [[Quonset, Rhode Island|Quonset Point, RI]].  The seasonal car-and-truck-ferry service operated by the Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority docks outside the harbor, at a long pier projecting into [[Nantucket Sound]], as does the fast ferry that provides seasonal service to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]]. The exposed nature of the pier means that Steamship Authority ferries are routinely diverted to Vineyard Haven during strong northeasterly winds.  Oak Bluffs is also the site of Trade Winds Airport, a private grass landing strip located just north of Sengekontacket Pond.\n\n==Tourism==\nThe \"[[Grand Illumination]]\" is a yearly event, usually held in August, the date of which is not always publicly disclosed. For the 2012 summer events, there was an open Cottage Tour, of the National Historical Registered homes, on Wednesday, August 8, and Grand Illumination Night on Wednesday, August 15.<ref>http://www.mvcma.org/events.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618162134/http://www.mvcma.org/events.htm |date=2012-06-18 }} (dead link)</ref> Martha's Vineyard, Oak Bluffs and the Campground events attract many tourists. For one special night, residents of the Campground place ornate Chinese lanterns (some electric, some still lit with just a candle), around each Gingerbread Cottage. The lanterns remain dark until after dusk. At an appointed hour, people gather in the Tabernacle for a sing-along and community gathering. At the end all the lights go out and thousands of Chinese lanterns spring to life in a brilliant cascade of light throughout the campground. The celebration ends after visitors walk through the Campground enjoying the sights and sounds of an event taken straight from the mid 1800s.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWt_mrbBAQo</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{See also|List of Massachusetts locations by per capita income}}\n{{Historical populations | type=USA\n | 1880|672\n | 1890|1080\n | 1900|1100\n | 1910|1084\n | 1920|1047\n | 1930|1333\n | 1940|1584\n | 1950|1521\n | 1960|1419\n | 1970|1385\n | 1980|1984\n | 1990|2804\n | 2000|3713\n | 2010|4527\n | footnote=* = population estimate.

Many of these town residents were originally from the island of [[Faial Island|Faial]] in the [[Azores]], and the neighborhood where many of them lived, located between Vineyard Avenue and Wing Rd, was once nicknamed Fayal. Today the town's Portuguese heritage is best appreciated at the Annual Portuguese Feast, held at the Portuguese-American Club on Vineyard Avenue in mid-July.\n\nThere were 1,590 households out of which 27.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 44.3% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, 42.5% were non-families, 32.6% were made up of individuals and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.

Males had a median income of $39,113 versus $31,797 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the town was $23,829.  About 6.2% of families and 8.4% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 13.0% of those under age 18 and 8.5% of those age 65 or over.\n\nOak Bluffs ranks 263rd in population in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and third in Dukes County (behind Edgartown and Tisbury).  It is 173rd in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in terms of population density, and second behind Tisbury in Dukes County.\n\n==Government==\n\nOn the national level, Oak Bluffs is a part of [[Massachusetts's 9th congressional district]], and is currently represented by Bill Keating.  Massachusetts is currently represented in the [[United States Senate]] by Senators [[Elizabeth Warren]] and [[Ed Markey]].\n\nOn the state level, Oak Bluffs is represented in the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] as a part of the Barnstable, Dukes and Nantucket district, which includes all of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, as well as a portion of [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]].

The town has its own police and fire departments, with the police being located near Oak Bluffs Harbor and the fire department being more centrally located in the town.  The post office is located just east of the Vineyard Camp Meeting Association lands, as is Oak Bluffs Public Library, which is a member of the [[Cape Libraries Automated Materials Sharing]] library network.

Because of this, N\u00eemes is often referred to as the French Rome.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Timeline of N\u00eemes}}\n[[File:2015-Arena-of-N\u00eemes.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arena of N\u00eemes]].]]\nThe city derives its name from that of a spring in the Roman village. The contemporary coat of arms of the city of N\u00eemes includes a crocodile chained to a palm tree with the inscription <small>COL NEM</small>, for ''Colonia Nemausus'', meaning the \"colony\" or \"settlement\" of [[Nemausus]], the local Celtic god of the [[Volcae Arecomici]]. Veterans of the Roman legions who had served Julius Caesar in his Nile campaigns, at the end of fifteen years of soldiering, were given plots of land to cultivate on the plain of N\u00eemes.<ref>Alain Veyrac, \"Le symbolisme de l'as de N\u00eemes au crocodile\" ''Arch\u00e9ologie et histoire romaine'' vol. 1 (1998) ([http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/dha_0755-7256_2000_num_26_2_2560 on-line text]).</ref>\n\nThe city was located on the [[Via Domitia]], a [[Roman road]] constructed in 118 BC which connected [[Italy]] with [[:Spain]].\n\nIts name appears in inscriptions in [[Gaulish]] as ''dede matrebo Namausikabo'' = \"he has given to the mothers of N\u00eemes\" and \"''toutios Namausatis''\" = \"citizen of N\u00eemes\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aPEENAEp938C&lpg=PA183&dq=namausikabo&pg=PA183#v=onepage&q=namausikabo&f=false |title=The Ancient Languages of Europe - Woodard - Google Books |date= 10 April 2008|accessdate=|isbn=9781139469326 |last1=Woodard |first1=Roger D. }}</ref>\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe site on which the built-up area of N\u00eemes has become established in the course of centuries is part of the edge of the alluvial plain of the Vistrenque River which butts up against low hills: to the northeast, Mont Duplan; to the southwest, Montaury; to the west, Mt. Cavalier and the knoll of Canteduc.\n\n===4000\u20132000 BC===\nThe Neolithic site of Serre Paradis reveals the presence of semi-nomadic cultivators in the period 4000 to 3500 BC on the future site of N\u00eemes. The population of the site increased during the thousand-year period of the Bronze Age.\nThe [[menhir]] of Courbessac (or La Poudri\u00e8re) stands in a field, near the airstrip. This limestone monolith of over two metres in height dates to about 2500 BC, and must be considered the oldest monument of N\u00eemes.\n\n===1800\u2013600 BC===\nThe Bronze Age has left traces of villages that were made out of huts and branches\n\n===600\u201349 BC===\nThe Warrior of Grezan is considered to be the most ancient indigenous sculpture in southern Gaul.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The hill named Mt. Cavalier was the site of the early [[oppidum]], which gave birth to the city. During the third and 2nd centuries BC a surrounding wall was built, closed at the summit by a dry-stone tower, which was later incorporated into the masonry of the [[Tour Magne]]. The Wars of Gaul and the fall of [[Marseille]] (49 BC) allowed N\u00eemes to regain its autonomy under Rome.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also| Nemausus}}\n[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|left|Pont du Gard from the south bank]]\n[[File:2015-Arena-of-N\u00eemes-Interior.JPG|thumb|Arena Interior.]]\n[[File:2015-Maison-Carr\u00e9e-N\u00eemes.JPG|thumb|Maison Carr\u00e9e.]]\nN\u00eemes became a Roman colony sometime before 28 BC, as witnessed by the earliest coins, which bear the abbreviation <small>NEM.

N\u00eemes was already under Roman influence, though it was Augustus who made the city the capital of [[Narbonne]] province, and gave it all its glory. It was also known as the birthplace of the family of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]].\n[[File:Arena de Nimes.jpg|alt=N\u00eemes arena is popularly used for concerts and also bull related activities|thumb|The arena is popularly used as a venue for concerts and also bull related activities]]\nThe city had an estimated population of 60,000 in the time of [[Augustus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Augustus gave the town a ring of ramparts six kilometres ({{convert|6|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) long, reinforced by fourteen towers; two gates remain today: the Porta Augusta and the Porte de France. An [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] was built to bring water from the hills to the north. Where this crossed the [[River Gard]] between [[Uzes]] and [[Remoulins]], the spectacular [[Pont du Gard]] was built. This is {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} north east of the city.  Also, the [[Maison Carr\u00e9e]] is one of the best preserved temples to be found anywhere in the territory of the former Roman Empire; it later inspired the design of the [[Virginia State Capitol]] at Richmond.  Nothing remains of some other monuments, the existence of which is known from inscriptions or architectural fragments found in the course of excavations. It is known that the town had a civil basilica, a curia, a gymnasium and perhaps a circus. [[Arena of N\u00eemes|The amphitheatre]] dates from the end of the 2nd century AD and was one of the largest amphitheatres in the Empire.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Dimensions of the largest amphitheatres of the Roman Empire\n|-\n|[[Colosseum]] (Rome, Italy)\n|188 \u00d7 156&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Capua#Amphitheatre|Capua]] (Italy)\n|167 \u00d7 137&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Italica]] (Spain): \n|157 \u00d7 134&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Tours Amphitheatre|Tours]]\n|156 \u00d7 134&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Carthage amphitheatre|Carthage]] (Tunisia) \n|156 \u00d7 128&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Autun]] \n|154 \u00d7 130&nbsp;m\n|-\n|N\u00eemes\n|133 \u00d7 101&nbsp;m\n|}\n\nEmperor Constantine endowed the city with baths. It became the seat of the Diocesan Vicar, the chief administrative officer of southern Gaul.\n\nThe town was prosperous until the end of the 3rd century \u2013 during the 4th and 5th centuries, the nearby town of [[Arles]] enjoyed more prosperity. In the early 5th century the Praetorian Prefecture was moved from [[Trier]] in northeast Gaul to Arles. The [[Visigoths]] finally captured the city from the Romans in 473 AD.\n\n===4th\u201313th centuries===\n[[File:Nimes 1569.jpg|thumb|left|''Nemausus, Nismes Civitas Narbonensis'' surrounded by its walls, after Sebastian Minister (1569), 1572.]]\nAfter the Roman period, in the days of invasion and decadence, the Christian Church, already established in Gaul since the 1st century AD, appeared to be the last refuge of classical civilization \u2013 it was remarkably organized and directed by a series of Gallo-Roman aristocrats. However, when the Visigoths were accepted into the Roman Empire, N\u00eemes was included in their territory (472), even after the Frankish victory at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] (507). The urban landscape went through transformation with the Goths, but much of the heritage of the Roman era remained largely intact.\n\n[[File:Temple de Diane N\u00eemes.JPG|thumb|[[Temple of Diana (N\u00eemes)|The Temple of Diana]]|alt=]]By 725, the Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had conquered the whole Visigothic territory of [[Septimania]] including N\u00eemes. In 736\u2013737, Charles Martel and his brother led an expedition to Septimania and Provence, and largely destroyed the city (in the hands of Umayyads allied with the local Gallo-Roman and Gothic nobility), including the amphitheatre, thereafter heading back north. The Muslim government came to an end in 752, when [[Pepin the Short]] captured the city. In 754, an uprising took place against the Carolingian king, but was put down, and count Radulf, a Frank, appointed as master of the city. After the events connected with the war, N\u00eemes was now only a shadow of the opulent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city it had once been. The local authorities installed themselves in the remains of [[Arena of N\u00eemes|the amphitheatre]].\n\nCarolingian rule brought relative peace, but feudal times in the 12th century brought local troubles, which lasted until the days of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]]. During that period N\u00eemes was jointly administered by a lay power resident in the old amphitheatre, where lived the Viguier and the Knights of the Arena, and the religious power based in the Bishop's palace complex, around the cathedral, its chapter and the Bishop's house; meanwhile the city was represented by four Consuls, who sat in the Maison Carr\u00e9e.[[File:Hubert Robert - Ruins at Nimes - WGA19596.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins at N\u00eemes, painting by [[Hubert Robert]].]]\n\nDespite incessant feudal squabbling, N\u00eemes saw some progress both in commerce and industry as well as in stock-breeding and associated activities.\n\nAfter the last effort by [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]], St. Louis managed to establish royal power in the region which became [[Languedoc]]. N\u00eemes thus finally came into the hands of the King of France.\n\n===Period of invasions===\n[[File:N\u00eemes La porte Auguste.png|thumb|The Augustan Gate]]\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries the Rhone Valley underwent an uninterrupted series of invasions which ruined the economy and caused famine. Customs were forgotten, religious troubles developed (''see [[French Wars of Religion]]'') and epidemics, all of which affected the city. N\u00eemes, which was one of the Protestant strongholds, felt the full force of repression and fratricidal confrontations (including the ''[[Michelade]]'' massacre) which continued until the middle of the 17th century, adding to the misery of periodic outbreaks of plague.\n\n===17th century to the French Revolution===\nIn the middle of the 17th century N\u00eemes experienced a period of prosperity. Population growth caused the town to expand, and slum housing to be replaced. To this period also belong the reconstruction of Notre-Dame-Saint-Castor, the Bishop's palace and numerous mansions (h\u00f4tels). This renaissance strengthened the manufacturing and industrial potential of the city, the population rising from 21,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\n[[File:Les Quais de la Fontaine.jpg|thumb|left|Les Quais de la Fontaine, the embankments of the spring that provided water for the city, the first civic gardens of France, were laid out in 1738\u201355.]]\nIn this same period the Fountain gardens, the ''Quais de la Fontaine'', were laid out, the areas surrounding the Maison Carr\u00e9e and [[Arena of N\u00eemes|the Amphitheatre]] were cleared of encroachments, whilst the entire population benefited from the atmosphere of prosperity.\n\n===From the French Revolution to the present===\nFollowing a European economic crisis that hit N\u00eemes with full force, the [[French revolution|Revolutionary period]] awoke the slumbering demons of political and religious antagonism. The [[Second White Terror|White Terror]] added to natural calamities and economic recession, produced murder, pillage and arson until 1815. Order was however restored in the course of the century, and N\u00eemes became the metropolis of Bas-Languedoc, diversifying its industry into new kinds of activity. At the same time the surrounding countryside adapted to market needs and shared in the general increase of wealth.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Maquis resistance fighters [http://www.midi-france.info/1016_ww2.htm Jean Robert and Vinicio Fa\u00efta were executed] at N\u00eemes on 22 April 1943.

The city has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa''), being wetter than a typical Mediterranean climate, especially for its moderately rainy summers. Its slightly inland, southerly location results in hot air over the city during summer months, temperatures above 34&nbsp;\u00baC are common in July and August, whereas winters are cool but not cold.

remains of the [[Roman Empire]] can still be seen in and around N\u00eemes:\n\n* The elliptical [[Arena of N\u00eemes|Roman amphitheatre]], of the 1st or 2nd century AD, is the best-preserved Roman arena in France. It was filled with medieval housing, when its walls served as [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s, but they were cleared under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]. It is still used as a [[bull fighting]] and concert arena.\n* The [[Maison Carr\u00e9e]] (''Square House''), a small [[Roman temple]] dedicated to sons of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] was built c. 19 BC. It is one of the best-preserved Roman temples anywhere. Visitors can watch a short film about the history of N\u00eemes inside.\n* The 18th-century ''Jardins de la Fontaine'' (Gardens of the Fountain) built around the Roman [[thermae]] ruins.\n* The nearby [[Pont du Gard]], also built by Agrippa, is a well-preserved [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] that used to carry water across the small [[Gardon]] river valley.\n* The nearby Mont Cavalier is crowned by the ''Tour Magne'' (\"Great Tower\"), a ruined Roman tower.<ref>Giving rise to the example of ''[[rime richissime]]'' ''Gall, amant de la Reine, alla (tour magnanime)/ Gallament de l'Ar\u00e8ne a la Tour Magne, \u00e0 N\u00eemes'', or \"Gall, lover opf the Queen, passed (magnanimous gesture), gallantly from the Arena to the Tour Magne at N\u00eemes\".</ref>\n\nLater monuments include:\n* [[N\u00eemes Cathedral|The cathedral]] (dedicated to [[Saint Castor of Apt]], a native of the city), occupying, it is believed, the site of the temple of Augustus, is partly [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and partly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] in style.\n* The [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de N\u00eemes]]\n\nThere is modern architecture at N\u00eemes too: [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]] conceived the  ''Carr\u00e9 d'art'' (1986), a museum of modern art and ''mediatheque'', and [[Jean Nouvel]] designed the Nemausus, a [[post-modern]] residential ensemble.\n\nTree-shaded boulevards trace the foundations of its former city walls.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\nN\u00eemes is historically known for its textiles.

The [[Gare de N\u00eemes]] is the central railway station, offering connections to Paris (high-speed rail), Marseille, Montpellier, Narbonne, Toulouse, Perpignan, [[Figueras]] and [[Barcelona]] in Spain and several regional destinations. The motorway [[A9 autoroute|A9]] connects N\u00eemes with Orange, Montpellier, Narbonne, and Perpignan, the [[A54 autoroute|A54]] with Arles and Salon-de-Provence.\n\nWork is almost complete on the construction of a high-speed [[TGV]] line, [[Contournement N\u00eemes \u2013 Montpellier]] bypassing N\u00eemes and [[Montpellier]] with the [[LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/southern-lgv-projects-make-progress.html|accessdate=14 February 2011|title=Railway Gazette: Southern LGV projects make progress}}</ref>\n\nThe new line is scheduled to open to passenger service on 15 December 2019 together with a new TGV station at NIMES-PONT DU GARD,(a potentially confusing name as it located some 12km from the city itself and 20km from the Pont du Gard.

Cavalier was the site of the early [[oppidum]], which gave birth to the city. During the third and 2nd centuries BC a surrounding wall was built, closed at the summit by a dry-stone tower, which was later incorporated into the masonry of the [[Tour Magne]]. The Wars of Gaul and the fall of [[Marseille]] (49 BC) allowed N\u00eemes to regain its autonomy under Rome.\n\n===Roman period===\n{{See also| Nemausus}}\n[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|thumb|left|Pont du Gard from the south bank]]\n[[File:2015-Arena-of-N\u00eemes-Interior.JPG|thumb|Arena Interior.]]\n[[File:2015-Maison-Carr\u00e9e-N\u00eemes.JPG|thumb|Maison Carr\u00e9e.]]\nN\u00eemes became a Roman colony sometime before 28 BC, as witnessed by the earliest coins, which bear the abbreviation <small>NEM.

N\u00eemes was already under Roman influence, though it was Augustus who made the city the capital of [[Narbonne]] province, and gave it all its glory. It was also known as the birthplace of the family of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Antoninus Pius]].\n[[File:Arena de Nimes.jpg|alt=N\u00eemes arena is popularly used for concerts and also bull related activities|thumb|The arena is popularly used as a venue for concerts and also bull related activities]]\nThe city had an estimated population of 60,000 in the time of [[Augustus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Augustus gave the town a ring of ramparts six kilometres ({{convert|6|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) long, reinforced by fourteen towers; two gates remain today: the Porta Augusta and the Porte de France. An [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] was built to bring water from the hills to the north. Where this crossed the [[River Gard]] between [[Uzes]] and [[Remoulins]], the spectacular [[Pont du Gard]] was built. This is {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} north east of the city.  Also, the [[Maison Carr\u00e9e]] is one of the best preserved temples to be found anywhere in the territory of the former Roman Empire; it later inspired the design of the [[Virginia State Capitol]] at Richmond.  Nothing remains of some other monuments, the existence of which is known from inscriptions or architectural fragments found in the course of excavations. It is known that the town had a civil basilica, a curia, a gymnasium and perhaps a circus. [[Arena of N\u00eemes|The amphitheatre]] dates from the end of the 2nd century AD and was one of the largest amphitheatres in the Empire.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"4\" |Dimensions of the largest amphitheatres of the Roman Empire\n|-\n|[[Colosseum]] (Rome, Italy)\n|188 \u00d7 156&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Capua#Amphitheatre|Capua]] (Italy)\n|167 \u00d7 137&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Italica]] (Spain): \n|157 \u00d7 134&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Tours Amphitheatre|Tours]]\n|156 \u00d7 134&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Carthage amphitheatre|Carthage]] (Tunisia) \n|156 \u00d7 128&nbsp;m\n|-\n|[[Autun]] \n|154 \u00d7 130&nbsp;m\n|-\n|N\u00eemes\n|133 \u00d7 101&nbsp;m\n|}\n\nEmperor Constantine endowed the city with baths. It became the seat of the Diocesan Vicar, the chief administrative officer of southern Gaul.\n\nThe town was prosperous until the end of the 3rd century \u2013 during the 4th and 5th centuries, the nearby town of [[Arles]] enjoyed more prosperity. In the early 5th century the Praetorian Prefecture was moved from [[Trier]] in northeast Gaul to Arles. The [[Visigoths]] finally captured the city from the Romans in 473 AD.\n\n===4th\u201313th centuries===\n[[File:Nimes 1569.jpg|thumb|left|''Nemausus, Nismes Civitas Narbonensis'' surrounded by its walls, after Sebastian Minister (1569), 1572.]]\nAfter the Roman period, in the days of invasion and decadence, the Christian Church, already established in Gaul since the 1st century AD, appeared to be the last refuge of classical civilization \u2013 it was remarkably organized and directed by a series of Gallo-Roman aristocrats. However, when the Visigoths were accepted into the Roman Empire, N\u00eemes was included in their territory (472), even after the Frankish victory at the [[Battle of Vouill\u00e9]] (507). The urban landscape went through transformation with the Goths, but much of the heritage of the Roman era remained largely intact.\n\n[[File:Temple de Diane N\u00eemes.JPG|thumb|[[Temple of Diana (N\u00eemes)|The Temple of Diana]]|alt=]]By 725, the Muslim [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had conquered the whole Visigothic territory of [[Septimania]] including N\u00eemes. In 736-737, Charles Martel and his brother led an expedition to Septimania and Provence, and largely destroyed the city (in the hands of Umayyads allied with the local Gallo-Roman and Gothic nobility), including the amphitheatre, thereafter heading back north. The Muslim government came to an end in 752, when [[Pepin the Short]] captured the city. In 754, an uprising took place against the Carolingian king, but was put down, and count Radulf, a Frank, appointed as master of the city. After the events connected with the war, N\u00eemes was now only a shadow of the opulent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city it had once been. The local authorities installed themselves in the remains of [[Arena of N\u00eemes|the amphitheatre]].\n\nCarolingian rule brought relative peace, but feudal times in the 12th century brought local troubles, which lasted until the days of [[Louis IX of France|St. Louis]]. During that period N\u00eemes was jointly administered by a lay power resident in the old amphitheatre, where lived the Viguier and the Knights of the Arena, and the religious power based in the Bishop's palace complex, around the cathedral, its chapter and the Bishop's house; meanwhile the city was represented by four Consuls, who sat in the Maison Carr\u00e9e.[[File:Hubert Robert - Ruins at Nimes - WGA19596.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins at N\u00eemes, painting by [[Hubert Robert]].]]\n\nDespite incessant feudal squabbling, N\u00eemes saw some progress both in commerce and industry as well as in stock-breeding and associated activities.\n\nAfter the last effort by [[Raymond VII of Toulouse]], St. Louis managed to establish royal power in the region which became [[Languedoc]]. N\u00eemes thus finally came into the hands of the King of France.\n\n===Period of invasions===\n[[File:N\u00eemes La porte Auguste.png|thumb|The Augustan Gate]]\nDuring the 14th and 15th centuries the Rhone Valley underwent an uninterrupted series of invasions which ruined the economy and caused famine. Customs were forgotten, religious troubles developed (''see [[French Wars of Religion]]'') and epidemics, all of which affected the city. N\u00eemes, which was one of the Protestant strongholds, felt the full force of repression and fratricidal confrontations (including the ''[[Michelade]]'' massacre) which continued until the middle of the 17th century, adding to the misery of periodic outbreaks of plague.\n\n===17th century to the French Revolution===\nIn the middle of the 17th century N\u00eemes experienced a period of prosperity. Population growth caused the town to expand, and slum housing to be replaced. To this period also belong the reconstruction of Notre-Dame-Saint-Castor, the Bishop's palace and numerous mansions (h\u00f4tels). This renaissance strengthened the manufacturing and industrial potential of the city, the population rising from 21,000 to 50,000 inhabitants.\n[[File:Les Quais de la Fontaine.jpg|thumb|left|Les Quais de la Fontaine, the embankments of the spring that provided water for the city, the first civic gardens of France, were laid out in 1738\u201355.]]\nIn this same period the Fountain gardens, the ''Quais de la Fontaine'', were laid out, the areas surrounding the Maison Carr\u00e9e and [[Arena of N\u00eemes|the Amphitheatre]] were cleared of encroachments, whilst the entire population benefited from the atmosphere of prosperity.\n\n===From the French Revolution to the present===\nFollowing a European economic crisis that hit N\u00eemes with full force, the [[French revolution|Revolutionary period]] awoke the slumbering demons of political and religious antagonism. The [[Second White Terror|White Terror]] added to natural calamities and economic recession, produced murder, pillage and arson until 1815. Order was however restored in the course of the century, and N\u00eemes became the metropolis of Bas-Languedoc, diversifying its industry into new kinds of activity. At the same time the surrounding countryside adapted to market needs and shared in the general increase of wealth.\n\nDuring the Second World War, the Maquis resistance fighters [http://www.midi-france.info/1016_ww2.htm Jean Robert and Vinicio Fa\u00efta were executed] at N\u00eemes on 22 April 1943.

The city has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: ''Csa''), being wetter than a typical Mediterranean climate, especially for its moderately rainy summers. Its slightly inland, southerly location results in hot air over the city during summer months, temperatures above 34&nbsp;\u00baC are common in July and August, whereas winters are cool but not cold.
