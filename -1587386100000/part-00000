The city was captured by the forces of the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] ruler [[Nader Shah]] in 1739, and fell into a period of decay while being contested between the Afghans and the Sikhs.

The ban was lifted for two days in 2007, then immediately reimposed when 11 people were killed by [[celebratory gunfire]], sharp kite-strings, electrocution, and falls related to the competition.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/26/world/main2514554.shtml |title=11 Dead at Pakistani Kite Festival, Metal Kite Strings, Stray Celebratory Gunfire Claim Lives at Annual Event, More Than 100 Injured |accessdate=2 August 2007 |date=26 February 2007 |publisher=CBS News}}</ref>\n\n== Tourism ==\nLahore remains a major tourist destination in Pakistan.

Photosystems are found in the [[thylakoid membrane]]s of plants, algae and cyanobacteria. They are located in the [[chloroplast]]s of plants and algae, and in the cytoplasmic membrane of photosynthetic bacteria. There are two kinds of photosystems: II and I.\n\n==Reaction centers==\n The REACTION CENTRE is made of Single molecule of chlorophyll a which having ability to absorb various wavelengths of light. At the heart of a photosystem lies the [[photosynthetic reaction centre|reaction center]], which is an [[enzyme]] that uses light to [[redox|reduce]] molecules (provide with electrons). This reaction center is surrounded by [[light-harvesting complex]]es that enhance the absorption of light.\n\nTwo families of reaction centers in photosystems exist: type I reaction centers (such as [[photosystem 1|photosystem I]] ([[P700]]) in chloroplasts and in green-sulphur bacteria  and type II reaction centers (such as [[photosystem II]] ([[P680]]) in chloroplasts and in non-sulphur purple bacteria.\n\nEach of the photosystem can be identified by the [[wavelength]] of light to which it is most reactive (700 and 680 [[nanometer]]s, respectively for [[photosystem 1|PSI]] and [[photosystem 2|PSII]]  in chloroplasts), the amount and type of light-harvesting complex present and the type of terminal electron acceptor used.\n\nType I photosystems use [[ferredoxin]]-like iron-sulfur cluster proteins as terminal electron acceptors, while type II photosystems ultimately shuttle electrons to a [[quinone]] terminal electron acceptor. Both reaction center types are present in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, and work together to form a unique photosynthetic chain able to extract electrons from water, creating oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n==Structure==\nA reaction center comprises several (>24 or >33) protein subunits, that provide a scaffold for a series of cofactors. The cofactors can be pigments (like [[chlorophyll]], [[pheophytin]], [[carotenoids]]), quinones, or iron-sulfur clusters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jagannathan|first1=B|last2=Golbeck|first2=JH|title=Photosynthesis:Microbial|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd ed|date=2009|pages=325\u2013341|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00352-7|isbn=9780123739445}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship between photosystems I and II==\n\nFor oxygenic photosynthesis, both [[Photosystem I|photosystems I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]] are required. Oxygenic photosynthesis can be performed by plants and cyanobacteria; cyanobacteria are believed to be the progenitors of the photosystem-containing chloroplasts of [[eukaryotes]]. Photosynthetic bacteria that cannot produce oxygen have [[Light-dependent_reactions#In_bacteria|a single photosystem similar to either]].\n\nWhen photosystem II absorbs light, electrons in the reaction-center chlorophyll are excited to a higher energy level and are trapped by the primary electron acceptors. \n\nPhotoexcited electrons travel through the [[cytochrome b6f complex]] to photosystem I via an electron transport chain set in the [[thylakoid membrane]]. This energy fall is harnessed, (the whole process termed [[chemiosmosis]]), to transport hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) through the membrane, into the thylakoid lumen, to provide a potential energy difference between the thylakoid lumen space and the chloroplast stroma, which amounts to a proton-motive force that can be used to generate ATP. The protons are transported by the [[plastoquinone]]. If electrons only pass through once, the process is termed noncyclic photophosphorylation.\n\nWhen the electron reaches photosystem I, it fills the electron deficit of the reaction-center chlorophyll of photosystem I.\nATP is generated when the [[ATP synthase]] transports the protons present in the lumen to the stroma, through the membrane. The electrons may either continue to go through cyclic electron transport around PS I or pass, via ferredoxin, to the enzyme NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase. Electrons and hydrogen ions are added to NADP<sup>+</sup> to form NADPH. \nThis reducing agent is transported to the Calvin cycle to react with [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], along with ATP to form [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]], the basic building-block from which plants can make a variety of substances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Light-dependent reactions|Light reaction]]\n*[[Photoinhibition]]\n*[[Photosynthetic reaction centre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/research/barber Photosystems I + II: Imperial College, Barber Group]\n*[https://dx.doi.org/10.2210/rcsb_pdb/mom_2001_10  Photosystem I: Molecule of the Month in the Protein Data Bank]\n*[https://dx.doi.org/10.2210/rcsb_pdb/mom_2004_11  Photosystem II: Molecule of the Month in the Protein Data Bank]\n*[http://www.rsbs.anu.edu.au/o2/O2_3_PhotosystemII.htm Photosystem II: ANU]\n* [[Orientations of Proteins in Membranes database|UMich Orientation of Proteins in Membranes]] ''{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013031932/http://opm.phar.umich.edu/families.php?superfamily=2 |date=Oct 13, 2017 |title=Superfamily \u00bb 1.1.002.

This reaction center is surrounded by [[light-harvesting complex]]es that enhance the absorption of light.\n\nTwo families of reaction centers in photosystems exist: type I reaction centers (such as [[photosystem 1|photosystem I]] ([[P700]]) in chloroplasts and in green-sulphur bacteria  and type II reaction centers (such as [[photosystem II]] ([[P680]]) in chloroplasts and in non-sulphur purple bacteria.\n\nEach of the photosystem can be identified by the [[wavelength]] of light to which it is most reactive (700 and 680 [[nanometer]]s, respectively for [[photosystem 1|PSI]] and [[photosystem 2|PSII]]  in chloroplasts), the amount and type of light-harvesting complex present and the type of terminal electron acceptor used.\n\nType I photosystems use [[ferredoxin]]-like iron-sulfur cluster proteins as terminal electron acceptors, while type II photosystems ultimately shuttle electrons to a [[quinone]] terminal electron acceptor. Both reaction center types are present in chloroplasts and cyanobacteria, and work together to form a unique photosynthetic chain able to extract electrons from water, creating oxygen as a byproduct.\n\n==Structure==\nA reaction center comprises several (>24 or >33) protein subunits, that provide a scaffold for a series of cofactors. The cofactors can be pigments (like [[chlorophyll]], [[pheophytin]], [[carotenoids]]), quinones, or iron-sulfur clusters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jagannathan|first1=B|last2=Golbeck|first2=JH|title=Photosynthesis:Microbial|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd ed|date=2009|pages=325\u2013341|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00352-7|isbn=9780123739445}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship between photosystems I and II==\n\nFor oxygenic photosynthesis, both [[Photosystem I|photosystems I]] and [[Photosystem II|II]] are required. Oxygenic photosynthesis can be performed by plants and cyanobacteria; cyanobacteria are believed to be the progenitors of the photosystem-containing chloroplasts of [[eukaryotes]]. Photosynthetic bacteria that cannot produce oxygen have [[Light-dependent_reactions#In_bacteria|a single photosystem similar to either]].\n\nWhen photosystem II absorbs light, electrons in the reaction-center chlorophyll are excited to a higher energy level and are trapped by the primary electron acceptors. \n\nPhotoexcited electrons travel through the [[cytochrome b6f complex]] to photosystem I via an electron transport chain set in the [[thylakoid membrane]]. This energy fall is harnessed, (the whole process termed [[chemiosmosis]]), to transport hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) through the membrane, into the thylakoid lumen, to provide a potential energy difference between the thylakoid lumen space and the chloroplast stroma, which amounts to a proton-motive force that can be used to generate ATP. The protons are transported by the [[plastoquinone]]. If electrons only pass through once, the process is termed noncyclic photophosphorylation.\n\nWhen the electron reaches photosystem I, it fills the electron deficit of the reaction-center chlorophyll of photosystem I.\nATP is generated when the [[ATP synthase]] transports the protons present in the lumen to the stroma, through the membrane. The electrons may either continue to go through cyclic electron transport around PS I or pass, via ferredoxin, to the enzyme NADP<sup>+</sup> reductase. Electrons and hydrogen ions are added to NADP<sup>+</sup> to form NADPH. \nThis reducing agent is transported to the Calvin cycle to react with [[glycerate 3-phosphate]], along with ATP to form [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]], the basic building-block from which plants can make a variety of substances.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Light-dependent reactions|Light reaction]]\n*[[Photoinhibition]]\n*[[Photosynthetic reaction centre]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/research/barber Photosystems I + II: Imperial College, Barber Group]\n*[https://dx.doi.org/10.2210/rcsb_pdb/mom_2001_10  Photosystem I: Molecule of the Month in the Protein Data Bank]\n*[https://dx.doi.org/10.2210/rcsb_pdb/mom_2004_11  Photosystem II: Molecule of the Month in the Protein Data Bank]\n*[http://www.rsbs.anu.edu.au/o2/O2_3_PhotosystemII.htm Photosystem II: ANU]\n* [[Orientations of Proteins in Membranes database|UMich Orientation of Proteins in Membranes]] ''{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013031932/http://opm.phar.umich.edu/families.php?superfamily=2 |date=Oct 13, 2017 |title=Superfamily \u00bb 1.1.002.

A powerful yet overconfident warrior that serves under the command of [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]], he is one of the chief antagonists of the titular protagonists in the show's first three seasons. Goldar is based on the ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'' villain [[List_of_Ky\u014dry\u016b_Sentai_Zyuranger_characters#Grifforzar|Grifforzar, also spelled as Grifforzer or Griforza by some sources]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Powerplay\"/>\n\nGoldar has been portrayed by numerous actors: in the ''Sentai'' footage repurposed for the Power Rangers, the Japanese actors who physically portrayed the character were Takashi Sakamoto for non-action scenes and Kazutoshi Yokoyama for battle sequences; while in original footage produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], Goldar was physically portrayed by Danny Wayne Stallcup for the first two seasons, and by David Wald and several other actors during season three. Goldar is voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in every major adaptation of the show since the franchise's inception, until the 2007 video game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]'' where the character is voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> A reimagined version of Goldar is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 reboot film]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nGoldar is depicted as a bipedal alien from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], who wields a sword, and wears a gold-plated suit of \"Titanian Armor\", with a matching helmet which looks like a mix of ancient Greek and Egyptian visual design. He had red eyes, a long mane, a wolf-like snout, and speaks in a gravelly voice.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He originally Lord Zedd long ago, and was later assigned to serve Rita prior to their imprisonment on the Moon.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He is usually depicted as the obsequious commander of Rita and Zedd's minions, the Putty Patrol (or Putties), to frighten and distract the Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Media\"/> The Putties are typically used as a diversion for Goldar's masters to further their plans, and Goldar would often engage in speculation as to the likelihood of said plan's success.<ref name=\"Media\"/> \n\nGoldar is portrayed as a formidable enemy in the show's pilot episode, and often depicted in the show's early seasons as capable of holding his own against the entire Power Ranger team and defeat them single-handedly unlike many of their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Nerdbot\"/> In later seasons of the series, Goldar's characterization became less threatening and more comical in nature.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:GrifforzerConcept.png|left|thumb|Concept art of Grifforzar from ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]''.]]\nMuch of the footage for the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series was taken from the Japanese TV show ''Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger'' and used as the basis for its costumes, Zords, and villains.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Scenes were shot with North American actors and spliced together with recycled footage from ''Zyuranger'' together to make a brand new show with radically different plots and storylines.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nGoldar's design was initially identical to the original character design for his Zyuranger counterpart Grifforzar, which is visually similar to a [[manticore]]: a humanoid face, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion. From the first episode, ''[[Day of the Dumpster]]'', to ''Lions and Blizzards'', the Goldar costume looked like [[The Bandora Gang|Grifforzar]], where the snout would move awkwardly whenever the character is talking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Goldar's costume was revised in the show's second season, with more realistic skin, longer fangs, and a mouth that could fully move, though the old iteration of Goldar with the rising snout would occasionally appear in recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nIn addition to the changes in his facial appearance, the revised costume has a permanent pair of extended wings.<ref name=Screenrant/> Although Goldar is shown with the ability to fly in early episodes, the wings on the ''Sentai'' original costume were designed to fold behind the character.<ref name=Screenrant/> The wings later disappear for reasons not explained within the season, though the show's writers later addressed this by making the wings symbolic.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> When Goldar defects from [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]] upon [[Lord Zedd]]'s arrival in \"Mutiny, Part I\", Zedd uses his staff to restore Goldar's wings as reward for his loyalty.<ref name=\"Zedd\"/> It was implied that Rita had taken them away as punishment for the character's repeated failures against the Rangers, which was confirmed when he lost his wings during the ''Power Rangers Zeo'' series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nMahan initially used a gruff, growling voice for Goldar's, but he could not sustain the voice which eventually took a toll on his vocal chords; while experimenting with different voices, he came up with a voice that was more low-pitched and grumbly.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Mahan's original high pitched voice for Goldar can still be heard in later episodes, particularly in recycled scenes where Goldar would fight or grow to giant size, as the showrunners did not re-dub any recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n \n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nGoldar led Rita Repulsa's first invasion against Earth. However, he was soon faced the Power Rangers and was beaten by their Megazord after an intense fight. Ever since then, Goldar is a recurring opponent of the Rangers and their Zords, developing a particular vendetta for [[Jason Lee Scott]] and [[Tommy Oliver]], the Red and Green Rangers respectively.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> In the first season he is often berated by Rita for his failures, who calls him by a variety of derogatory names. This pattern also happened when [[Lord Zedd]] was introduced as well; in addition to insulting the now apparently incompetent golden warrior, he often blamed Goldar for his ''own'' failures, and had a habit of silencing him frequently. Goldar also pilots a [[Zord]] known as Cyclopsis, an ancient war machine owned by Rita, but the Zord was defeated by the Rangers' Ultrazord after a prolonged battle.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He was also one of [[Bulk and Skull]]'s more memorable encounters with a monster, where he picked up a bus with the duo inside while giant-sized.\n\nWhen [[Lord Zedd]] arrived on Rita's Moon palace in the second season, Goldar eagerly defected and regained his wings in the process. As Zedd's right hand man, Goldar led many missions for him, repeatedly encountering Tommy (now the White Ranger). Each time they fought, the White Ranger would best him, sending Goldar back to Zedd in disgrace. Rita later returned to the Moon and successfully seduced Zedd into marrying her as part of her plan of usurping Zedd. When he later discovered it was a cover for Rita's plot, he immediately made [[List_of_Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_characters#Finster|Finster]] create an antidote for the love spell that Rita used.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Goldar discovered to his dismay that Zedd had come to love Rita on his own, even after the antidote has been applied. In the third season, Goldar is often paired with Rita's brother [[Rito Revolto]], and is often disgusted by his buffoonish behaviour. Goldar was also essential in Lord Zedd's powering of the [[Shogun Zords]], as he defeated [[Ninjor]], allowing Zedd to capture and use him as a power source for the Zords.\n\n=== In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nIn the ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'' mini series, which sets up the transition from ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' to ''Power Rangers Zeo'', Goldar and Rito plants a bomb outside of the Command Center, but it is defused by Alpha 5.  Goldar also played a role in the destruction of the Ninja power coins. Later, Goldar and Rito were sent to the Command Center, having been given a map of the Command Center's basement, and attempted to destroy the Command Center with an implosion device. The bomb went off and destroyed the Command Center. Just before the implosion device went off, Goldar steals the Zeo Crystal with the help of Rito. \n\n=== In ''Power Rangers Zeo'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nIn ''Power Rangers Zeo'', the Rangers discovered the Zeo Crystal in the ruins of the Command Center, surmising that Rito and Goldar must have dropped it. An amnesiac Goldar, who also lost his wings along with his memories, is later seen wandering around [[Angel Grove]] along with Rito; as Zedd and Rita flee from the Machine Empire, one of their Tenga Warriors is seen carrying Goldar's detached wings after his failure to destroy the Rangers, despite successfully blowing up the Command Center.<ref name=Screenrant/> They eventually encountered Bulk and Skull, and ended up becoming their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. Zedd and Rita eventually found them and restored their memories. They returned to their masters and helped them in their quest to destroy the [[Machine Empire]].\n\n=== In ''Power Rangers in Space'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers in Space}}\nGoldar's final appearance was in the final episode of ''Power Rangers in Space'', \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes| Countdown to Destruction]]\". Unlike Rito, Goldar went with Zedd and Rita to the Cimmerian Planet for Dark Specter's conference, where he was responsible for revealing Andros' identity as a Power Ranger by removing his cloak.  He was later present in their invasion of the Vica Galaxy, helping to subdue the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Ranger]]. Goldar's final fate remains unknown, as he was not shown among the other villains who were either destroyed or purified following Zordon's destruction as the subsequent energy wave.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n==Reception==\nGoldar is considered to be one of the ''Power Ranger'' franchise's most notable villains, and his original iteration's appearance is considered to be recognizable.<ref name=Screenrant/><ref name=\"Player\"/><ref name=Spin/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin magazine]]'' described the character as a \"big freak with wings\" in their 1995 coverage of the franchise and the then-upcoming ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''.<ref name=Spin/> Joe Otterson from ''[[The Wrap]]'' described Goldar as a \"gargoyle-type beast covered in gold armor\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Justin Harp from ''Digital Spy'' remembered the character as a \"hulking baboon-type creature with gold armour and a penchant for sassy comebacks\".<ref name=\"Digital\"/> Eric Francisco from Inverse said Goldar \"strongly resembled a [[Flying Monkey]] from [[The Wizard of Oz]] on steroids\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and Blair Marnell from ''The Nerdist'' opined that Goldar looks like an \"anthropomorphic ape-wolf with wings\".<ref name=Nerdist/> Loryn Stone from ''Nerdbot'' was of the view that Goldar stood out from the rest of the ''Power Ranger's'' ensemble cast of characters as a \"legitimately terrifying\" antagonist. She praised Goldar's characterization and depiction in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', and considered him to be the show's most definitive villain.<ref name=Nerdbot/> \n\n== In Other Media ==\n===Movies===\n==== In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\n[[File:MovieGoldar1.jpg|left|thumb|Goldar in the 1995 film ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''.]]\nGoldar appears as a thoroughly bumbling sidekick who serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, and does not carry a sword unlike his television counterpart. His suit was specifically created for the movie and was of much higher quality than the ones seen in the show, as it allowed the character's face to be more expressive and had increased flexibility that allowed the actor to move naturally.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/>\n\nGoldar accompanies Zedd and Rita to Earth, where they release the sorcerer Ivan Ooze from his egg-like prison. Goldar and his cohort Mordant defects to Ooze immediately after he traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe and deprive them of the their powers. He serves Ooze as his right hand man while the sorcerer terrorizes Angel Grove. He flees Earth for the Moon after Ivan Ooze merges with one of his monsters in an attempt to defeat the resurgent Power Rangers. In a mid-credits scene, Goldar had taken over the Moon palace and calls himself King Goldar. He lounges on Zedd's throne being served by Mordant, only to panic when Zedd and Rita unexpectedly appears to punish both him and Mordant.\n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n{{main|Power Rangers (2017 film)}}\n[[File:GoldarMovie2.jpg|left|thumb|A Goldar action figure, released to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I said with my production designer language lets sort of push the envelope on him.

He appears as a giant [[gargoyle]]-like monster made purely out of gold.<ref name=\"NYCC\"/> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, director [[Dean Israelite]] envisioned Goldar to be a [[kaiju]]-like beast that would be a physical manifestation of Rita\u2019s evil, as opposed to an individual with a distinct personality.<ref name=\"EW\"/>  Israelite and production designer Andrew Menzies said Goldar is a faceless and intimidating extension of Rita which is nigh unstoppable, and designed the creature's look after a [[chocolate fountain]] with a melting form that never takes shape.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Menzies commented, \"I think as humans we always search for character in a face, and if it\u2019s always shifting and changing, it becomes scary\".<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nIn the film's narrative, Goldar was created by Rita to penetrate the force field that protects the Zeo crystal. Goldar's molecular essence was scattered after he was vaporized by Zordon into a cloud of microscopic gold particles during the opening action sequence on Ancient Earth.<ref name=Wrap/> Rita reconstitutes Goldar by stealing gold from jewelry stores, buildings, and even dental implants to manifest the monster. As Rita orders Goldar to retrieve the Zeo Crystal from underneath the local [[Krispy Kreme]] shop, the Rangers confront him with their zords for the first time, which culminates in them assembling the Megazord. Rita attempts to counter them by merging herself with Goldar directly, but the Rangers are able to destroy the monster.\n\nA preview of Goldar's appearance, in the form of a tie-in action figure for the 2017 film has generated commentary about the film's visual direction, with various sources noting his gold-centric character design as one of the biggest departures from the 1990's series. Otterson described the iteration as \"someone took an old Goldar action figure and put it through a few popcorn cycles on a microwave\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Other sources have described his appearance as a \"melting candle of gold\",<ref name=Nerdist/> \"a giant chocolate fountain\",<ref name=\"Digital\"/> \"a golem formed out of molten, melted gold\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and \"someone took the classic Goldar and drowned him in [[nacho cheese]].\"<ref name=\"Slash\"/>\n\n===Comics===\nGoldar appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/> The comic series revealed that Goldar once had a brother named Silverback, and they both served Lord Zedd as the emperor.<ref name=Screenrant/> At one point, Silverback tries to overthrow Zedd, who gravely wounds his traitor subordinate and instructs Goldar to finish off his own brother with his sword, who complies without much hesitation.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|List of Power Rangers video games}}\nGoldar has appeared in multiple iterations of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' video games. He serves as the main villain in the Mighty Morphin' section of the game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]''.  He is first seen complaining about Rita making him do her dirty work. Lord Zedd then appears in a time hole and tells him to contaminate Angel Grove's water supply, zombifying everyone there to form an army of Z-Putties.  Goldar follows Zedd's demands, however the Power Rangers are hot on his tail.  The \"chase\" ends at Angel Grove, where Goldar is ready to contaminate the water supply, however the Power Rangers stop him and he is forced to grow. He is defeated in the [[Megazord]] battle.\n\n===Stage play===\nGoldar appeared in ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Live'', a traveling stage show featuring voice recordings of the entire cast of the TV series for their lines and scenes, with different actors playing all the characters on stage.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Promotion and merchandise===\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise.

Cyclopsis\n}}\n\n'''Goldar''' (known as '''Flydar''' in the pilot episode), is a [[fictional character]] from the television series ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]''. A powerful yet overconfident warrior that serves under the command of [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]], he is one of the chief antagonists of the titular protagonists in the show's first three seasons. Goldar is based on the ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'' villain [[List_of_Ky\u014dry\u016b_Sentai_Zyuranger_characters#Grifforzar|Grifforzar, also spelled as Grifforzer or Griforza by some sources]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Powerplay\"/>\n\nGoldar has been portrayed by numerous actors: in the ''Sentai'' footage repurposed for the Power Rangers, the Japanese actors who physically portrayed the character were Takashi Sakamoto for non-action scenes and Kazutoshi Yokoyama for battle sequences; while in original footage produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], Goldar was physically portrayed by Danny Wayne Stallcup for the first two seasons, and by David Wald and several other actors during season three. Goldar is voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in every major adaptation of the show since the franchise's inception, until the 2007 video game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]'' where the character is voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> A reimagined version of Goldar is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 reboot film]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nGoldar is depicted as a bipedal alien from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], who wields a sword, and wears a gold-plated suit of \"Titanian Armor\", with a matching helmet which looks like a mix of ancient Greek and Egyptian visual design. He had red eyes, a long mane, a wolf-like snout, and speaks in a gravelly voice.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He originally Lord Zedd long ago, and was later assigned to serve Rita prior to their imprisonment on the Moon.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He is usually depicted as the obsequious commander of Rita and Zedd's minions, the Putty Patrol (or Putties), to frighten and distract the Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Media\"/> The Putties are typically used as a diversion for Goldar's masters to further their plans, and Goldar would often engage in speculation as to the likelihood of said plan's success.<ref name=\"Media\"/> \n\nGoldar is portrayed as a formidable enemy in the show's pilot episode, and often depicted in the show's early seasons as capable of holding his own against the entire Power Ranger team and defeat them single-handedly unlike many of their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Nerdbot\"/> In later seasons of the series, Goldar's characterization became less threatening and more comical in nature.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:GrifforzerConcept.png|left|thumb|Concept art of Grifforzar from ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]''.]]\nMuch of the footage for the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series was taken from the Japanese TV show ''Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger'' and used as the basis for its costumes, Zords, and villains.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Scenes were shot with North American actors and spliced together with recycled footage from ''Zyuranger'' together to make a brand new show with radically different plots and storylines.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nGoldar's design was initially identical to the original character design for his Zyuranger counterpart Grifforzar, which is visually similar to a [[manticore]]: a humanoid face, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion. From the first episode, ''[[Day of the Dumpster]]'', to ''Lions and Blizzards'', the Goldar costume looked like [[The Bandora Gang|Grifforzar]], where the snout would move awkwardly whenever the character is talking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Goldar's costume was revised in the show's second season, with more realistic skin, longer fangs, and a mouth that could fully move, though the old iteration of Goldar with the rising snout would occasionally appear in recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nIn addition to the changes in his facial appearance, the revised costume has a permanent pair of extended wings.<ref name=Screenrant/> Although Goldar is shown with the ability to fly in early episodes, the wings on the ''Sentai'' original costume were designed to fold behind the character.<ref name=Screenrant/> The wings later disappear for reasons not explained within the season, though the show's writers later addressed this by making the wings symbolic.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> When Goldar defects from [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]] upon [[Lord Zedd]]'s arrival in \"Mutiny, Part I\", Zedd uses his staff to restore Goldar's wings as reward for his loyalty.<ref name=\"Zedd\"/> It was implied that Rita had taken them away as punishment for the character's repeated failures against the Rangers, which was confirmed when he lost his wings during the ''Power Rangers Zeo'' series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nMahan initially used a gruff, growling voice for Goldar's, but he could not sustain the voice which eventually took a toll on his vocal chords; while experimenting with different voices, he came up with a voice that was more low-pitched and grumbly.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Mahan's original high pitched voice for Goldar can still be heard in later episodes, particularly in recycled scenes where Goldar would fight or grow to giant size, as the showrunners did not re-dub any recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n \n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nGoldar led Rita Repulsa's first invasion against Earth. However, he was soon faced the Power Rangers and was beaten by their Megazord after an intense fight. Ever since then, Goldar is a recurring opponent of the Rangers and their Zords, developing a particular vendetta for [[Jason Lee Scott]] and [[Tommy Oliver]], the Red and Green Rangers respectively.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> In the first season he is often berated by Rita for his failures, who calls him by a variety of derogatory names. This pattern also happened when [[Lord Zedd]] was introduced as well; in addition to insulting the now apparently incompetent golden warrior, he often blamed Goldar for his ''own'' failures, and had a habit of silencing him frequently. Goldar also pilots a [[Zord]] known as Cyclopsis, an ancient war machine owned by Rita, but the Zord was defeated by the Rangers' Ultrazord after a prolonged battle.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He was also one of [[Bulk and Skull]]'s more memorable encounters with a monster, where he picked up a bus with the duo inside while giant-sized.\n\nWhen [[Lord Zedd]] arrived on Rita's Moon palace in the second season, Goldar eagerly defected and regained his wings in the process. As Zedd's right hand man, Goldar led many missions for him, repeatedly encountering Tommy (now the White Ranger). Each time they fought, the White Ranger would best him, sending Goldar back to Zedd in disgrace. Rita later returned to the Moon and successfully seduced Zedd into marrying her as part of her plan of usurping Zedd. When he later discovered it was a cover for Rita's plot, he immediately made [[List_of_Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_characters#Finster|Finster]] create an antidote for the love spell that Rita used.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Goldar discovered to his dismay that Zedd had come to love Rita on his own, even after the antidote has been applied. In the third season, Goldar is often paired with Rita's brother [[Rito Revolto]], and is often disgusted by his buffoonish behaviour. Goldar was also essential in Lord Zedd's powering of the [[Shogun Zords]], as he defeated [[Ninjor]], allowing Zedd to capture and use him as a power source for the Zords.\n\n=== In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nIn the ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'' mini series, which sets up the transition from ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' to ''Power Rangers Zeo'', Goldar and Rito plants a bomb outside of the Command Center, but it is defused by Alpha 5.  Goldar also played a role in the destruction of the Ninja power coins. Later, Goldar and Rito were sent to the Command Center, having been given a map of the Command Center's basement, and attempted to destroy the Command Center with an implosion device. The bomb went off and destroyed the Command Center. Just before the implosion device went off, Goldar steals the Zeo Crystal with the help of Rito. \n\n=== In ''Power Rangers Zeo'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nIn ''Power Rangers Zeo'', the Rangers discovered the Zeo Crystal in the ruins of the Command Center, surmising that Rito and Goldar must have dropped it. An amnesiac Goldar, who also lost his wings along with his memories, is later seen wandering around [[Angel Grove]] along with Rito; as Zedd and Rita flee from the Machine Empire, one of their Tenga Warriors is seen carrying Goldar's detached wings after his failure to destroy the Rangers, despite successfully blowing up the Command Center.<ref name=Screenrant/> They eventually encountered Bulk and Skull, and ended up becoming their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. Zedd and Rita eventually found them and restored their memories. They returned to their masters and helped them in their quest to destroy the [[Machine Empire]].\n\n=== In ''Power Rangers in Space'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers in Space}}\nGoldar's final appearance was in the final episode of ''Power Rangers in Space'', \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes| Countdown to Destruction]]\". Unlike Rito, Goldar went with Zedd and Rita to the Cimmerian Planet for Dark Specter's conference, where he was responsible for revealing Andros' identity as a Power Ranger by removing his cloak.  He was later present in their invasion of the Vica Galaxy, helping to subdue the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Ranger]]. Goldar's final fate remains unknown, as he was not shown among the other villains who were either destroyed or purified following Zordon's destruction as the subsequent energy wave.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n==Reception==\nGoldar is considered to be one of the ''Power Ranger'' franchise's most notable villains, and his original iteration's appearance is considered to be recognizable.<ref name=Screenrant/><ref name=\"Player\"/><ref name=Spin/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin magazine]]'' described the character as a \"big freak with wings\" in their 1995 coverage of the franchise and the then-upcoming ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''.<ref name=Spin/> Joe Otterson from ''[[The Wrap]]'' described Goldar as a \"gargoyle-type beast covered in gold armor\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Justin Harp from ''Digital Spy'' remembered the character as a \"hulking baboon-type creature with gold armour and a penchant for sassy comebacks\".<ref name=\"Digital\"/> Eric Francisco from Inverse said Goldar \"strongly resembled a [[Flying Monkey]] from [[The Wizard of Oz]] on steroids\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and Blair Marnell from ''The Nerdist'' opined that Goldar looks like an \"anthropomorphic ape-wolf with wings\".<ref name=Nerdist/> Loryn Stone from ''Nerdbot'' was of the view that Goldar stood out from the rest of the ''Power Ranger's'' ensemble cast of characters as a \"legitimately terrifying\" antagonist. She praised Goldar's characterization and depiction in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', and considered him to be the show's most definitive villain.<ref name=Nerdbot/> \n\n== In Other Media ==\n===Movies===\n==== In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n[[File:MovieGoldar1.jpg|left|thumb|Goldar in the 1995 film ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''.]]\n\nGoldar appears as a thoroughly bumbling sidekick who serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, and does not carry a sword unlike his television counterpart. His suit was specifically created for the movie and was of much higher quality than the ones seen in the show, as it allowed the character's face to be more expressive and had increased flexibility that allowed the actor to move naturally.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/>\n\nGoldar accompanies Zedd and Rita to Earth, where they release the sorcerer Ivan Ooze from his egg-like prison. Goldar and his cohort Mordant defects to Ooze immediately after he traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe and deprive them of the their powers. He serves Ooze as his right hand man while the sorcerer terrorizes Angel Grove. He flees Earth for the Moon after Ivan Ooze merges with one of his monsters in an attempt to defeat the resurgent Power Rangers. In a mid-credits scene, Goldar had taken over the Moon palace and calls himself King Goldar. He lounges on Zedd's throne being served by Mordant, only to panic when Zedd and Rita unexpectedly appears to punish both him and Mordant.\n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n[[File:GoldarMovie2.jpg|left|thumb|A Goldar action figure, released to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I said with my production designer language lets sort of push the envelope on him. And it seemed to start ... and I said, we always have to go back to the mythology we're creating. And the mythology that we are creating is that Rita can ... has control over elements around her. And if she has control over the elements around her that's how she physicalizes and creates the Putties that are then made out of whatever environment is around her and that logic should hold true to Goldar and Goldar then should then come out of this debunked gold mine that the whole movie is set around.\" |source = \u2014 Dean Israelite, \"Power Rangers Director Explains Goldar's Redesign\".<ref name=\"Director\"/>}}\n\nGoldar is a secondary antagonist in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 movie reboot]] with his vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]. He appears as a giant [[gargoyle]]-like monster made purely out of gold.<ref name=\"NYCC\"/> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, director [[Dean Israelite]] envisioned Goldar to be a [[kaiju]]-like beast that would be a physical manifestation of Rita\u2019s evil, as opposed to an individual with a distinct personality.<ref name=\"EW\"/>  Israelite and production designer Andrew Menzies said Goldar is a faceless and intimidating extension of Rita which is nigh unstoppable, and designed the creature's look after a [[chocolate fountain]] with a melting form that never takes shape.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Menzies commented, \"I think as humans we always search for character in a face, and if it\u2019s always shifting and changing, it becomes scary\".<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nIn the film's narrative, Goldar was created by Rita to penetrate the force field that protects the Zeo crystal. Goldar's molecular essence was scattered after he was vaporized by Zordon into a cloud of microscopic gold particles during the opening action sequence on Ancient Earth.<ref name=Wrap/> Rita reconstitutes Goldar by stealing gold from jewelry stores, buildings, and even dental implants to manifest the monster. As Rita orders Goldar to retrieve the Zeo Crystal from underneath the local [[Krispy Kreme]] shop, the Rangers confront him with their zords for the first time, which culminates in them assembling the Megazord. Rita attempts to counter them by merging herself with Goldar directly, but the Rangers are able to destroy the monster.\n\nA preview of Goldar's appearance, in the form of a tie-in action figure for the 2017 film has generated commentary about the film's visual direction, with various sources noting his gold-centric character design as one of the biggest departures from the 1990's series. Otterson described the iteration as \"someone took an old Goldar action figure and put it through a few popcorn cycles on a microwave\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Other sources have described his appearance as a \"melting candle of gold\",<ref name=Nerdist/> \"a giant chocolate fountain\",<ref name=\"Digital\"/> \"a golem formed out of molten, melted gold\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and \"someone took the classic Goldar and drowned him in [[nacho cheese]].\"<ref name=\"Slash\"/>\n\n===Comics===\nGoldar appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/> The comic series revealed that Goldar once had a brother named Silverback, and they both served Lord Zedd as the emperor.<ref name=Screenrant/> At one point, Silverback tries to overthrow Zedd, who gravely wounds his traitor subordinate and instructs Goldar to finish off his own brother with his sword, who complies without much hesitation.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|List of Power Rangers video games}}\nGoldar has appeared in multiple iterations of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' video games. He serves as the main villain in the Mighty Morphin' section of the game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]''.  He is first seen complaining about Rita making him do her dirty work. Lord Zedd then appears in a time hole and tells him to contaminate Angel Grove's water supply, zombifying everyone there to form an army of Z-Putties.  Goldar follows Zedd's demands, however the Power Rangers are hot on his tail.  The \"chase\" ends at Angel Grove, where Goldar is ready to contaminate the water supply, however the Power Rangers stop him and he is forced to grow. He is defeated in the [[Megazord]] battle.\n\n===Stage play===\nGoldar appeared in ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Live'', a traveling stage show featuring voice recordings of the entire cast of the TV series for their lines and scenes, with different actors playing all the characters on stage.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Promotion and merchandise===\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise. An exclusive figure to video game retailer [[GameStop]] was released as part of the Power Rangers Lightning Collection.

He also starred in multiple comedic films, including playing Luther Heggs in ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966) and Henry Limpet in ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). In 1979 ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked him #27 on its 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time list.<ref>{{cite book |title = TV Guide Guide to TV |year = 2004 |publisher = Barnes and Noble |isbn = 0-7607-5634-1 |page = [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/596 596] |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780760756348/page/596 }}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nJesse Donald Knotts was born in [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], the youngest of four sons born to farmer William Jesse Knotts and his wife, Elsie Luzetta Knotts (''n\u00e9e'' Moore). His parents were married in [[Spraggs, Pennsylvania]]. His [[English people|English]] paternal ancestors emigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph.\n\nDon's mother was 40 at the time of his birth and his father suffered from mental illness; he had a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stress of Don's birth. Afflicted with [[schizophrenia]] and [[alcoholism]], he sometimes terrorized Don with a knife,<ref>{{cite book |last = de Vis\u00e9 |first = Daniel |date = 2015 |title = Andy and Don: The Making of a Friendship and a Classic American TV Show |page = 5 |location = New York |publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn = 1-4767-4773-3 }}</ref> causing Don to turn inward at an early age. The elder Knotts died of [[pneumonia]] when Don was 13 years old. Don and his three brothers were then raised by their mother, who ran a [[boarding house]] in Morgantown. She died in 1969 at age 84. Her son William preceded her in death in 1941 at age 31. They are buried in the family plot at Beverly Hills Memorial Park in Morgantown. Don graduated from [[Morgantown High School]].

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit.\n\n=== ''The Andy Griffith Show'' ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Don Knotts 1960.JPG|thumb|As Barney Fife, Knotts gets the help of Sheriff Taylor when his gun gets stuck on his finger]]\n[[File:DonKnotts1961.jpg|thumb|Knotts receives his first [[Emmy Award]] for ''The Andy Griffith Show'', 1961]]\nIn 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own [[sitcom]], ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960\u20131968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy]], three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character.<ref>{{cite book |last = Monush |first = Barry |title = Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965 |volume = 1 |year = 2003 |publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn = 1-55783-551-9 |page = 397 }}</ref>\n\nA summary of the show from the website of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] describes Deputy Barney Fife:\n\n{{quote|Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry RFD]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] and [[Helen Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Norman Fell]] and [[Audra Lindley]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series (''[[The Ropers]]'').\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''.

He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''.

He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry RFD]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] and [[Helen Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Audra Lindley]] and [[Norman Fell]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series (''[[The Ropers]]'').\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

Firpo has the fourth highest total of major honours won by a Salvadoran club. The club's most successful period was between 1988 and 2000, when they won the El Salvadoran title seven times.\n\nFirpo's historical rivals are C.D. \u00c1guila, Alianza F.C. and C.D. FAS. The Derby de Oriente (vs C.D. \u00c1guila) is the most important game out of all three matches. These four clubs are considered the \"best 4\" of El Salvador football.\n\nThe club's traditional kit colours are white and red, blue is also used but it is less predominant. The colours were adopted from the Argentinian side [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], of which [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]] was a supporter.\n\n==Overview==\nClub Deportivo Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo is the second-oldest club in El Salvador.  The club was founded on September 17, 1923, by a group of local citizens.  Originally named ''Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n'', the club was soon renamed in honor of [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]], a famous [[Argentine]] [[Boxing|boxer]], who almost became the first [[Latin America]]n heavyweight champion by knocking [[Jack Dempsey]] out of the ring on September 24, 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/teams-shipwrecked-stands-knowledge|title=Which club were shipwrecked on their way to a game?|date=12 September 2012|author=John Ashdown|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nSome of the greatest Salvadoran football players, including [[Mauricio Cienfuegos]] and [[Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce]], have played for L.A. Firpo at some point in their careers.  The team has won a total of ten {{lang|es|Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional}} championships, the first coming in 1988\u201389 and the most recent in the 2013 Clausura.\n\nThe team plays its home games at [[Estadio Sergio Torres]] in [[Usulut\u00e1n]]. The team's mascot is the bull, a reference to Firpo, who was known as the Wild Bull of the Pampas.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nOn September 17, 1923, a group of Usulut\u00e1n citizens, mostly of European descent, decided to form a team which represented their community passion for football. The club elected Gustavo Denys as their first club chairman. They decided to choose red and blue as their team's colours. Originally named ''Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n'', the club was soon renamed in honor of [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]], a famous Argentine [[Boxing|boxer]].\n\nThe members of CD Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo acquired land near Sergio Torres creek to develop and build a stadium.  Their first [[Manager (football)|football manager]] was Manuel \"El Zancudo\" Segurado.  Slowly but surely the team gained prestige.  In 1941\u201342, they were named the best team in eastern El Salvador and were allowed to challenge for the national title.  A year later, [[Luis Antonio Regalado|Luis \"El Loco\" Regalado]] brought the club further prestige when he was chosen for the [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador's national football team]].  After him came the Zamora brothers (Ricardo and Miguel), the Quinteros brothers (Leonidas and L\u00e1zaro), and Ram\u00f3n and Mario \u00c1guila.\n\nFinancial instability plagued Firpo in the 1950s and 1960s, and they dropped out of the top flight on three separate occasions.  They could still discover great talent, like F\u00e9lix Quinteros and Roberto Aguila, but they could not afford to keep them and had to sell them on.  It was not until 1972 that Firpo became a permanent top-flight fixture.\n\n===Golden generation===\nThe team's first great joy came in the 1988\u201389 season, when they hoisted the league title for the first time.  The team finished third in the regular season, an impressive effort, but the club nonetheless dismissed Argentinian coach [[Juan Quarterone]] before the playoffs.  In his place, they hired former player Julio Escobar.  Escobar justified the club's faith by leading the team through the championship round and into the finals.  Their match against [[Cojutepeque F.C.|Cojutepeque]] was drawn 2\u20132 after extra time, setting up a penalty shootout.  Firpo prevailed 4\u20133, with [[Leonel Carcamo]] scoring the winning penalty.\n\nIt was the beginning of a golden age for Firpo.  They lost to [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza]] in the 1990 final, but won their second crown in three years in 1991.  That season saw Firpo go on a 30 match unbeaten streak and defeat [[C.D. \u00c1guila|Aguila]] 1\u20130 in the finals. [[Marlon Menj\u00edvar]] scored the only goal.\n\nThe very next year, Macedonian [[Kiril Doj\u010dinovski]] took over the coaching [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] of Firpo and led them to back to back titles.  The stars of this run were Ra\u00fal Toro, [[Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce]], [[Mauricio Cienfuegos]], [[Celio Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Leonel C\u00e1rcamo]] and Fernando de Moura.  They defeated Alianza in both finals, giving the club four championships in five years.\n\nTheir dominance continued as the 1990s wore on.  Leonal Carcamo donned the captain's armband and the club continued to play at a high level.  They reached either the semi-finals or finals every year from 1994 to 1997, then won the championship again in 1998.  That win came over [[C.D. FAS|FAS]] 2\u20130, with the goals being scored by Firpo legendary players [[Ra\u00fal Toro Bas\u00e1ez|Ra\u00fal Toro]] and [[Abraham Monterrosa]].\n\nFirpo won another championship in 1999, beating FAS 5\u20134 on penalty kicks.  The glory years concluded with an emotional championship in 2000.  Club president and owner Sergio Torres died the week before the final match against [[ADET]], and the players dedicated the match to his memory.  They went on to win, bringing home their 7th title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lafirpo.fanspace.com/Archivo.htm#LA|title=Ever's Applets\\LA Firpo Page\\Archivo|first=Ever|last=Guandique|date=|work=FanSpace.com|access-date=April 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\nAfter 2000, Firpo's success began to decline.  The stars of the golden years were retiring, moving abroad, or being sold onto other clubs.  The death of Sergio Torres cost the team their primary sponsor and led the club into an era of financial instability.  As a result, performances declined.  Firpo reached the grand final repeatedly, but could not win another title for seven years.\n\nThe drought finally ended with the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional Apertura 2007|2007 Apertura]].  Argentinian coach [[Horacio Cordero]] guided the team to another final, and they defeated [[C.D. FAS|FAS]] 5\u20133 in a penalty shootout. \nThe next season saw the club hoist the crown again, winning the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008]].  They beat FAS again, 1\u20130, and celebrated their third repeat championship.\n\nThe team won their tenth title in the 2013 Clausura under the direction of Argentinian coach [[Roberto Gamarra (coach)|Roberto Gamarra]] with another win over their rivals from FAS.\n\nOn May 5, 2014, after 32 years of top-flight football, Firpo were relegated to the second division after a 1\u20131 draw with [[C.D. Drag\u00f3n|Drag\u00f3n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elgrafico.com/2014/05/04/el-firpo-vuelve-a-segunda-despues-de-32-aos|title=El Firpo vuelve a segunda despu\u00e9s de 32 a\u00f1os|first=El|last=Gr\u00e1fico|date=|work=ElGrafico.com|access-date=April 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the relegation didn't stick, as Firpo purchased [[Juventud Independiente]]'s license.\n\nOn May 27, 2019, the club achieved a record sixth relegation from the Primera Division, after the team lost 3\u20131 against [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elgrafico.com/futbol/Firpo-pierde-y-dice-adios-a-la-Primera-Division-20190427-0004.html|title=Firpo pierde y dice adi\u00f3s a la Primera Divisi\u00f3n|first=El|last=Gr\u00e1fico|date=|work=ElGrafico.com|access-date=April 28, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\nFirpo has won primera division ten times, which ranks tied for fourth in Salvadoran football history.\n\n===Domestic honours===\n====League====\n* '''[[Salvadoran Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] and predecessors''' \n** Champions (10): 1988\u201389, 1990\u201391, 1991\u201392, 1992\u201393, 1997\u201398, 1999 Clausura, 2000 Clausura, [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional Apertura 2007|Apertura 2007]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional Clausura 2008|Clausura 2008]], [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional&nbsp;\u2013 Clausura 2013|Clausura 2013]]\n* '''[[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Salvadore\u00f1o|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Salvadorean]] and predecessors''' \n** Champions: [[TBD]]\n* '''[[Tercera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Salvadore\u00f1o|Tercera Divisi\u00f3n Salvadorean]] and predecessors''' \n** Champions: [[TBD]]\n\n====Cups====\n* '''[[Copa El Salvador|Copa President]] and predecessors''' \n** Runners-up (1) : 2000\n\n====CONCACAF====\n* '''[[CONCACAF Cup Winners Cup]]''' \n** Runners up (1) : 1995\n\n==Club statistics and records==\n{{Main|List of Luis Angel Firpo records and statistics}}\n\n[[TBD]] holds the records for both total appearances and Primera Division appearances for Firpo, with TBD official games played in total and TBD in Primera Division.\n\n[[Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce]] is Firpo's all-time top goalscorer, with 119 goals in 000 games.

Located in the Barrio La Parroquia, the stadium is an exception in El Salvador's professional football: As Firpo is the only team in the First Division that plays in its own stadium. Firpo's first president, Mr. Gustavo Demis, bought two thirds of the stadium and, in 1950, the then president, Mr. Juan Boillat, bought the other third. In 1987, the stadium was renamed after the legendary former owner and president of the team. The stadium known as Usulut\u00e1n Stadium became known as Sergio Torres Rivera Stadium.\n\nHowever the club has moved games to [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] for big clashes.\n\n===Home stadium===\n* [[Estadio Sergio Torres]] (1950\u2013present)\n* [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] (2002\u2013present) (big game venue)\n\n==Fan Culture==\n=== Club badge and colours ===\nLuis Angel Firpo's home colours are white, blue and red. Traditional away [[kit (football)|kit]] colours have been either red or white and blue; however, in recent years several different colours have been used.\n\nTheir first logo contained a figure of a bull in honor of the \"toro de las pampas\" of the boxer Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo. However, later the board of Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo decided to replace the bull with the official coat of arms of Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo which consisted of a triangle with two half circles which contained the blue and white letters of the club. On top of the coat of arms contains stars which indicate the number of titles the team has won, which currently is at ten.\n\n=== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ===\nLuis Angel Firpo's shirts have been sponsored by [[Pilsener]] since 2017. Previous sponsors have been Tapachulteca (1988\u20131999), [[TACA Airlines|TACA]] (1992), [[Pepsi]] (1999), Diana (2007\u20132013), Pilsener (2007\u20132013), Burger King (2013) and [[Tigo]] (2009).

Firpo has the fourth highest total of major honours won by a Salvadoran club. The club's most successful period was between 1988 and 2000, when they won the El Salvadoran title seven times.\n\nFirpo's historical rivals are C.D. \u00c1guila, Alianza F.C. and C.D. FAS. The Derby de Oriente (vs C.D. \u00c1guila) is the most important game out of all three matches. These four clubs are considered the \"best 4\" of El Salvador football.\n\nThe club's traditional kit colours are white and red, blue is also used but it is less predominant. The colours were adopted from the Argentinian side [[San Lorenzo de Almagro]], of which [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]] was a supporter.\n\n==Overview==\nClub Deportivo Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo is the second-oldest club in El Salvador.  The club was founded on September 17, 1923, by a group of local citizens.  Originally named ''Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n'', the club was soon renamed in honor of [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]], a famous [[Argentine]] [[Boxing|boxer]], who almost became the first [[Latin America]]n heavyweight champion by knocking [[Jack Dempsey]] out of the ring on September 24, 1923.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/sep/12/teams-shipwrecked-stands-knowledge|title=Which club were shipwrecked on their way to a game?|date=12 September 2012|author=John Ashdown|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nSome of the greatest Salvadoran football players, including [[Mauricio Cienfuegos]] and [[Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce]], have played for L.A. Firpo at some point in their careers.  The team has won a total of ten {{lang|es|Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional}} championships, the first coming in 1988\u201389 and the most recent in the 2013 Clausura.\n\nThe team plays its home games at [[Estadio Sergio Torres]] in [[Usulut\u00e1n]]. The team's mascot is the bull, a reference to Firpo, who was known as the Wild Bull of the Pampas.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nOn September 17, 1923, a group of Usulut\u00e1n citizens, mostly of European descent, decided to form a team which represented their community passion for football. The club elected Gustavo Denys as their first club chairman. They decided to choose red and blue as their team's colours. Originally named ''Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n'', the club was soon renamed in honor of [[Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo]], a famous Argentine [[Boxing|boxer]].\n\nThe members of CD Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo acquired land near Sergio Torres creek to develop and build a stadium.  Their first [[Manager (football)|football manager]] was Manuel \"El Zancudo\" Segurado.  Slowly but surely the team gained prestige.  In 1941\u201342, they were named the best team in eastern El Salvador and were allowed to challenge for the national title.  A year later, [[Luis Antonio Regalado|Luis \"El Loco\" Regalado]] brought the club further prestige when he was chosen for the [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador's national football team]].  After him came the Zamora brothers (Ricardo and Miguel), the Quinteros brothers (Leonidas and L\u00e1zaro), and Ram\u00f3n and Mario \u00c1guila.\n\nFinancial instability plagued Firpo in the 1950s and 1960s, and they dropped out of the top flight on three separate occasions.  They could still discover great talent, like F\u00e9lix Quinteros and Roberto Aguila, but they could not afford to keep them and had to sell them on.  It was not until 1972 that Firpo became a permanent top-flight fixture.\n\n===Golden generation===\nThe team's first great joy came in the 1988\u201389 season, when they hoisted the league title for the first time.  The team finished third in the regular season, an impressive effort, but the club nonetheless dismissed Argentinian coach [[Juan Quarterone]] before the playoffs.  In his place, they hired former player Julio Escobar.  Escobar justified the club's faith by leading the team through the championship round and into the finals.  Their match against [[Cojutepeque F.C.|Cojutepeque]] was drawn 2\u20132 after extra time, setting up a penalty shootout.  Firpo prevailed 4\u20133, with [[Leonel Carcamo]] scoring the winning penalty.\n\nIt was the beginning of a golden age for Firpo.  They lost to [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza]] in the 1990 final, but won their second crown in three years in 1991.  That season saw Firpo go on a 30 match unbeaten streak and defeat [[C.D. \u00c1guila|Aguila]] 1\u20130 in the finals. [[Marlon Menj\u00edvar]] scored the only goal.\n\nThe very next year, Macedonian [[Kiril Doj\u010dinovski]] took over the coaching [[Rein#In popular expression|reins]] of Firpo and led them to back to back titles.  The stars of this run were Ra\u00fal Toro, [[Ra\u00fal D\u00edaz Arce]], [[Mauricio Cienfuegos]], [[Celio Rodr\u00edguez]], [[Leonel C\u00e1rcamo]] and Fernando de Moura.  They defeated Alianza in both finals, giving the club four championships in five years.\n\nTheir dominance continued as the 1990s wore on.  Leonal Carcamo donned the captain's armband and the club continued to play at a high level.  They reached either the semi-finals or finals every year from 1994 to 1997, then won the championship again in 1998.  That win came over [[C.D. FAS|FAS]] 2\u20130, with the goals being scored by Firpo legendary players [[Ra\u00fal Toro Bas\u00e1ez|Ra\u00fal Toro]] and [[Abraham Monterrosa]].\n\nFirpo won another championship in 1999, beating FAS 5\u20134 on penalty kicks.  The glory years concluded with an emotional championship in 2000.  Club president and owner Sergio Torres died the week before the final match against [[ADET]], and the players dedicated the match to his memory.  They went on to win, bringing home their 7th title.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lafirpo.fanspace.com/Archivo.htm#LA|title=Ever's Applets\\LA Firpo Page\\Archivo|first=Ever|last=Guandique|date=|work=FanSpace.com|access-date=April 23, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Modern era===\nAfter 2000, Firpo's success began to decline.  The stars of the golden years were retiring, moving abroad, or being sold onto other clubs.  The death of Sergio Torres cost the team their primary sponsor and led the club into an era of financial instability.  As a result, performances declined.  Firpo reached the grand final repeatedly, but could not win another title for seven years.\n\nThe drought finally ended with the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n de F\u00fatbol Profesional Apertura 2007|2007 Apertura]].  Argentinian coach [[Horacio Cordero]] guided the team to another final, and they defeated [[C.D.

Behind him, in second place, is [[TBD]] with 000 goals in 000 games, and [[TBD]] in third place, with 000 goals over 000 games.\n\n[[TBD]] had the longest reign as Inter coach, with nine years (eight consecutive) in charge, and is the most successful coach in Firpo history with three Primera division wins.\n\n==Stadium==\nCD Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo plays most of its home games at [[Estadio Sergio Torres]] in Usulut\u00e1n, better known throughout Central America as the '''Devil's Cauldron''' because it is close to impossible to defeat Firpo there. Located in the Barrio La Parroquia, the stadium is an exception in El Salvador's professional football: As Firpo is the only team in the First Division that plays in its own stadium. Firpo's first president, Mr. Gustavo Demis, bought two thirds of the stadium and, in 1950, the then president, Mr. Juan Boillat, bought the other third. In 1987, the stadium was renamed after the legendary former owner and president of the team. The stadium known as Usulut\u00e1n Stadium became known as Sergio Torres Rivera Stadium.\n\nHowever the club has moved games to [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] for big clashes.\n\n===Home stadium===\n* [[Estadio Sergio Torres]] (1950\u2013present)\n* [[Estadio Cuscatl\u00e1n]] (2002\u2013present) (big game venue)\n\n==Fan Culture==\n=== Club badge and colours ===\nLuis Angel Firpo's home colours are white, blue and red. Traditional away [[kit (football)|kit]] colours have been either red or white and blue; however, in recent years several different colours have been used.\n\nTheir first logo contained a figure of a bull in honor of the \"toro de las pampas\" of the boxer Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo. However, later the board of Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo decided to replace the bull with the official coat of arms of Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo which consisted of a triangle with two half circles which contained the blue and white letters of the club. On top of the coat of arms contains stars which indicate the number of titles the team has won, which currently is at ten.\n\n=== Kit manufacturers and shirt sponsors ===\nLuis Angel Firpo's shirts have been sponsored by [[Pilsener]] since 2017. Previous sponsors have been Tapachulteca (1988\u20131999), [[TACA Airlines|TACA]] (1992), [[Pepsi]] (1999), Diana (2007\u20132013), Pilsener (2007\u20132013), Burger King (2013) and [[Tigo]] (2009). Their kits have been manufactured by Aviva (since 2018). Prior manufacturers have been Galaxia (1999\u20132007, 2018), [[Kelme (company)|Kelme]] (2017) and [[Joma]] (2009\u20132013).\n\n===Anthem===\n:Ah\u00ed viene el Firpo.\n:Hoy vibran los estadios en todo El Salvador.\n:Oriente hace al Firpo el equipo ganador,\n:\u00a1Viva el Firpo, Viva el Firpo!\n:La garra y el coraje del buen usuluteco,\n:Se siente cuando el Firpo comienza a golear.\n:\u00a1Viva el Firpo, Viva el Firpo!\n:Firpo es el equipo ganador\n:Orgullo de mi patria El Salvador.\n:\u00a1Viva el Firpo!\n\n===Rivalries===\n*Luis \u00c1ngel Firpo v.

After a series of skills test qualifications, experience, leadership, and oral review boards lasting up to three years, the Night Stalker is designated Fully Mission Qualified (FMQ). After three to five years as an FMQ, the Night Stalker may try out for flight lead qualification.\n\n==History==\n===1980s and 1990s===\nAfter the 1980 [[Operation Eagle Claw]] attempt to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages]] held in [[Tehran]], Iran, failed, President [[Jimmy Carter]] ordered former [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]] to figure out how the U.S. military could best mount another attempt. At the time there were no U.S. helicopter units trained in this kind of stealthy, short-notice Special Operations mission.\n\nThe Army looked to the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault), which had the most diverse operating experience of the service's helicopter units, and selected elements of the 158th Aviation Battalion, 101st Aviation Battalion, 229th Aviation Battalion, and the 159th Aviation Battalion. The chosen pilots immediately entered intensive training in night flying.\n\nThis provisional unit was dubbed Task Force 158, since most of its pilots were Black Hawk aviators detached from the 158th. Their distinctive 101st \"Screaming Eagle\" patches remained on their uniforms. The Black Hawks and Chinooks continued to operate around Campbell Army Airfield at the north of post, and Saber Army Heliport at the south. The [[OH-6 Cayuse]]s, aircraft that had vanished from the division's regular inventory after Vietnam, were hidden on base in an ammunition holding area still known as the \"SHOC Pad\", for \"Special Helicopter Operations Company\".\n\nAs the first batch of pilots completed training in the fall of 1980, a second attempt to rescue the hostages was planned for early 1981. Dubbed [[Operation Honey Badger]], it was called off when the hostages were [[October Surprise|released]] on the morning of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration.\n\nTask Force 158 was the Army's only special operations aviation unit, and its members had already become recognized as the Army's premier aviation night fighters. Their capability was judged too useful to lose, and so instead of returning to the 101st, the pilots and modified aircraft became a new unit. (Original members of the Night Stalkers refer to it as \"the day the Eagles came off\".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}) The unit was officially established on 16 October 1981, when it was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion.\n\nThe 160th first saw combat during 1983's [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]].\n\nIn 1986, it was renamed the 160th Aviation Group (Airborne); and in May 1990, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As demand for highly trained special operations aviation assets bloomed, the regiment activated three battalions, a separate detachment, and incorporated one [[Army National Guard]] unit, the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation (OK ARNG).\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, its pilots took part in [[Operation Earnest Will]], the protection of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. They flew from [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warships and leased oil barges in a secret sub-part called [[Operation Prime Chance]], and became the first helicopter pilots to use [[night vision device|night vision goggles]] and [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) devices in night combat.\n\n[[File:US Army 160th SOAR(A) CH-47 sling-load a Mi-24 out of Chad-Operation Mount Hope III.jpg|thumb|left|The Regiment's Company E fly the slingloaded [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24 Hind]] out of Chad, known as [[Operation Mount Hope III]]]]\nIn June 1988, the unit received a short-notice directive to recover a Soviet made [[Mi-24 Hind]] attack helicopter from a remote location in [[Chad]]. The Mi-24 was abandoned by the Libyans after 15 years of fighting, and was of great intelligence value to the U.S. In April 1988, two CH-47 Chinooks, a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]], and 75 maintenance personnel and crew flew to [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands AFB]], [[New Mexico]] to rehearse the mission. In late May of that year an advance team went to [[Ndjamena]], Chad, to await their aircraft. Two weeks later two Chinooks and 76 crew members and maintenance personnel arrived by C-5. At midnight on 11 June 1988, two MH-47s flew 490 miles at night without outside navigational aids to the target location, the Ouadi Doum Airfield in northern Chad. The first Chinook landed and configured the Mi-24, while the second hovered overhead and sling loaded it for return to Ndjamena. A surprise sandstorm slowed the return trip, but less than 67 hours after the arrival of the C-5 in Chad, the ground crew had the Mi-24 and Chinooks aboard and ready for return to the U.S.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/USASOAC/photos/a.251685494936578/526484250790033/?type=3&theater This date in ARSOA history: OPERATION MOUNT HOPE, U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command Facebook page, dated 11 June 2014, last accessed 9 June 2019]</ref>\n\nThe Night Stalkers spearheaded [[Operation Just Cause]], the 1989 invasion of [[Panama]], and they were also used in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n[[File:S64-Crew.gif|thumb|Super 6-4 one month before the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].

After a series of skills test qualifications, experience, leadership, and oral review boards lasting up to three years, the Night Stalker is designated Fully Mission Qualified (FMQ). After three to five years as an FMQ, the Night Stalker may try out for flight lead qualification.\n\n==History==\n===1980s and 1990s===\nAfter the 1980 [[Operation Eagle Claw]] attempt to rescue [[Iran hostage crisis|American hostages]] held in [[Tehran]], Iran, failed, President [[Jimmy Carter]] ordered former [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Adm. [[James L. Holloway III]] to figure out how the U.S. military could best mount another attempt. At the time there were no U.S. helicopter units trained in this kind of stealthy, short-notice Special Operations mission.\n\nThe Army looked to the 101st Aviation Group, the air arm of the [[101st Airborne Division]] (Air Assault), which had the most diverse operating experience of the service's helicopter units, and selected elements of the 158th Aviation Battalion, 101st Aviation Battalion, 229th Aviation Battalion, and the 159th Aviation Battalion. The chosen pilots immediately entered intensive training in night flying.\n\nThis provisional unit was dubbed Task Force 158, since most of its pilots were Black Hawk aviators detached from the 158th. Their distinctive 101st \"Screaming Eagle\" patches remained on their uniforms. The Black Hawks and Chinooks continued to operate around Campbell Army Airfield at the north of post, and Saber Army Heliport at the south. The [[OH-6 Cayuse]]s, aircraft that had vanished from the division's regular inventory after Vietnam, were hidden on base in an ammunition holding area still known as the \"SHOC Pad\", for \"Special Helicopter Operations Company\".\n\nAs the first batch of pilots completed training in the fall of 1980, a second attempt to rescue the hostages was planned for early 1981. Dubbed [[Operation Honey Badger]], it was called off when the hostages were [[October Surprise|released]] on the morning of President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration.\n\nTask Force 158 was the Army's only special operations aviation unit, and its members had already become recognized as the Army's premier aviation night fighters. Their capability was judged too useful to lose, and so instead of returning to the 101st, the pilots and modified aircraft became a new unit. (Original members of the Night Stalkers refer to it as \"the day the Eagles came off\".{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}) The unit was officially established on 16 October 1981, when it was designated as the 160th Aviation Battalion.\n\nThe 160th first saw combat during 1983's [[Operation Urgent Fury]], the U.S. invasion of [[Grenada]].\n\nIn 1986, it was renamed the 160th Aviation Group (Airborne); and in May 1990, the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (Airborne). As demand for highly trained special operations aviation assets bloomed, the regiment activated three battalions, a separate detachment, and incorporated one [[Army National Guard]] unit, the 1st Battalion, 245th Aviation (OK ARNG).\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, its pilots took part in [[Operation Earnest Will]], the protection of re-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]] during the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]]. They flew from [[United States Navy|US Navy]] warships and leased oil barges in a secret sub-part called [[Operation Prime Chance]], and became the first helicopter pilots to use [[night vision device|night vision goggles]] and [[forward looking infrared]] (FLIR) devices in night combat.\n\n[[File:US Army 160th SOAR(A) CH-47 sling-load a Mi-24 out of Chad-Operation Mount Hope III.jpg|thumb|left|The Regiment's Company E fly the slingloaded [[Mil Mi-24|Mi-24 Hind]] out of Chad, known as [[Operation Mount Hope III]]]]\nIn June 1988, the unit received a short-notice directive to recover a Soviet made [[Mi-24 Hind]] attack helicopter from a remote location in [[Chad]]. The Mi-24 was abandoned by the Libyans after 15 years of fighting, and was of great intelligence value to the U.S. In April 1988, two CH-47 Chinooks, a [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy|C-5 Galaxy]], and 75 maintenance personnel and crew flew to [[White Sands Missile Range|White Sands AFB]], [[New Mexico]] to rehearse the mission. In late May of that year an advance team went to [[Ndjamena]], Chad, to await their aircraft. Two weeks later two Chinooks and 76 crew members and maintenance personnel arrived by C-5. At midnight on 11 June 1988, two MH-47s flew 490 miles at night without outside navigational aids to the target location, the Ouadi Doum Airfield in northern Chad. The first Chinook landed and configured the Mi-24, while the second hovered overhead and sling loaded it for return to Ndjamena. A surprise sandstorm slowed the return trip, but less than 67 hours after the arrival of the C-5 in Chad, the ground crew had the Mi-24 and Chinooks aboard and ready for return to the U.S.<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/USASOAC/photos/a.251685494936578/526484250790033/?type=3&theater This date in ARSOA history: OPERATION MOUNT HOPE, U.S. Army Special Operations Aviation Command Facebook page, dated 11 June 2014, last accessed 9 June 2019]</ref>\n\nThe Night Stalkers spearheaded [[Operation Just Cause]], the 1989 invasion of [[Panama]], and they were also used in [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991.\n\n[[File:S64-Crew.gif|thumb|Super 6-4 one month before the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]].
