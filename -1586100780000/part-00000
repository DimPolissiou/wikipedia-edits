[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] was the first member of the recently-established [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] elected to the presidency. He was succeeded by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]]. Lincoln presided over the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory in the [[American Civil War]], which dominated his presidency.\n\nLincoln took office following the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], in which he won a plurality of the popular vote in a four-candidate field. Almost all of Lincoln's votes came from the [[Northern United States]], as the Republicans held little appeal to voters in the [[Southern United States]]. A former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], Lincoln ran on a political platform opposed to the expansion of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the [[United States territories|territories]]. His election served as the immediate impetus for the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. After being sworn in as president, Lincoln refused to accept any resolution that would result in Southern secession from the Union. The Civil War began weeks into Lincoln's presidency with the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], a federal installation located within the boundaries of the Confederacy.\n\nLincoln was called on to handle both the political and military aspects of the Civil War, facing challenges in both spheres. As commander-in-chief, he ordered the suspension of the constitutionally-protected right to [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] in the state of [[Maryland]] in order to suppress Confederate sympathizers. He also became the first president to institute a military draft. As the Union faced several early defeats in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]], Lincoln cycled through numerous military commanders during the war, finally settling on General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who had led the Union to several victories in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]]. Lincoln's 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] freed about 20,000 of slaves in Confederate-held territory, and established emancipation as a Union war goal. In 1865, Lincoln was instrumental in the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made slavery unconstitutional. Lincoln also presided over the passage of important domestic legislation, including the first of the [[Homestead Acts]], the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], and the [[Pacific Railroad Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]]. He ran for re-election in [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] ticket, which was supported by [[War Democrats]] in addition to Republicans. Though Lincoln feared he might lose the contest, he defeated his former subordinate, General [[George B. McClellan]] of the Democratic Party, in a [[landslide election|landslide]]. Months after the election, Grant would essentially end the war by defeating the Confederate army led by General [[Robert E. Lee]]. Lincoln's [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] in April 1865, five days after the surrender of Lee, left the final challenge of [[Reconstruction Era|reconstructing]] the nation to others.\n\nFollowing his death, Lincoln was portrayed as the liberator of the slaves, the savior of the Union, and a martyr for the cause of freedom. Political historians have long held Lincoln in high regard for his accomplishments and personal characteristics. Alongside [[George Washington]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], he has been consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars and the public as one of the top three greatest presidents, often as number one.\n\n==Election of 1860==\n[[File:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|alt=Lincoln being carried by two men on a long board.|\"The Rail Candidate\"\u2014Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue\u2014a slave on the left and party organization on the right.]]\n\nLincoln, a former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Congressman, emerged as a major Republican presidential candidate following his narrow loss to Democrat [[Stephen A.

Lincoln spent much of 1859 and 1860 building support for his candidacy, and his [[Cooper Union speech]] was well-received by eastern elites. Lincoln positioned himself in the \"moderate center\" of his party; he opposed the expansion of [[slavery]] into the territories but did not favor the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of slavery in [[slave state]]s.<ref>White (2009), pp. 307\u2013316.</ref> On the first ballot of the May [[1860 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln finished second to Seward, but Seward was unable to clinch the nomination.

A second convention met in June and nominated Stephen Douglas as the presidential nominee, but several pro-slavery Southern delegations refused to support Douglas, as they demanded a strongly pro-slavery nominee. These Southern Democrats held a separate convention that nominated incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky for president. A group of former Whigs and [[Know Nothings]] formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] for president. Breckinridge and Bell would primarily contest the South, while Lincoln and Douglas would compete for votes in the North. Republicans were confident after these party conventions, with Lincoln predicting that the fractured Democrats stood little chance of winning the election.<ref name=\"White 2009, pp. 325\u2013329\"/>\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1860.svg|thumb|right|1860 electoral vote results.]]\n\nLincoln carried all but one Northern state to win an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] majority with 180 votes to 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas.

Lincoln was not scheduled to take office until March 1861, leaving incumbent Democratic President [[James Buchanan]], a \"[[doughface]]\" from Pennsylvania who had been favorable to the South, to preside over the country until that time.<ref name=\"White 2009, pp. 351\u2013354\">White (2009), pp. 351\u2013354.</ref> President Buchanan declared that secession was illegal while denying that the government had any power to resist it. Lincoln had no official power to act while the secession crisis escalated.<ref>McPherson (2008) p. 9; Thomas (1952) p. 229.</ref> Nonetheless, Lincoln was barraged with advice. Many wanted him to provide reassurances to the South that their interests were not being threatened.<ref>Thomas (1952) p. 226; Holzer (2008) p. 68.</ref> Realizing that soothing words on the rights of slaveholders would alienate the Republican base, while taking a strong stand on the indestructibility of the Union would further inflame Southerners, Lincoln chose a policy of silence. He believed that, given enough time without any overt acts or threats to the South, Southern unionists would carry the day and bring their states back into the Union.<ref>Holzer (2008) p. 69; Gienapp (2002) pp. 74\u201375; Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 p. 702. Burlingame writes, \"Lincoln's unwillingness to make a public declaration may have been a mistake. Such a document might have allayed fears in the Upper South and Border States and predisposed them to remain in the Union when hostilities broke out. But it might also have wrecked the Republican coalition and doomed his administration to failure before it began.\"</ref> At the suggestion of a Southern merchant who contacted him, Lincoln did make an indirect appeal to the South by providing material for Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] to insert into his own public address. Republicans praised Trumbull's address, Democrats assailed it, and the South largely ignored it.<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 701\u2013702; Thomas (1952) p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn December 1860, both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] formed special committees to address the unfolding crisis. Lincoln communicated with various Congressmen that there was room for negotiation on issues such as fugitive slaves, slavery in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the domestic slave trade. However he made it clear that he was unalterably opposed to anything which would allow the expansion of slavery into any new states or territories.<ref>Thomas (1952) pp. 229\u2013230.</ref> On December 6, Lincoln wrote to Congressman [[Orlando Kellogg]], a Republican on the special House committee, saying that Kellogg should \"entertain no proposition for a compromise in regard to the extension of slavery. The instant you do, they have us under again; all our labor is lost, and sooner or later must be done over. Douglas is sure to be again trying to bring in his [popular sovereignty]. Have none of it. The tug has to come & better now than later.\"<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 708\u2013709.</ref>\n\nIn mid-December, Senator [[John J. Crittenden]] of Kentucky, the chairman of the special Senate committee, proposed a package of six constitutional amendments, known as the [[Crittenden Compromise]]. The compromise would protect slavery in federal territories south of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]] and prohibit it in territories north of that latitude, with newly admitted states deciding on the status of slavery within their borders. Congress would be forbidden from abolishing slavery in any state (or the District of Columbia) or interfering with the domestic slave trade. Despite pressure from Seward, Lincoln refused to support the compromise.<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 712\u2013718.</ref> Still opposed to the expansion of slavery into the territories, Lincoln privately asked Republican Senators to oppose the compromise, and it failed to pass Congress.<ref name=\"White 2009, pp. 351\u2013354\"/>\n\n===Deepening crisis===\n[[File:US SlaveFree1861.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb|Following the admission of Kansas in 1861, there were 19 free states and 15 slave states]]\n\nLincoln believed that Southern threats of secession were mostly bluster and that the sectional crisis would be defused, as it had in 1820 and 1850.<ref name=white361369/> However, many Southerners were convinced that assenting to Lincoln's presidency and the restriction of slavery in the territories would ultimately lead to the extinction of slavery in the United States.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 33\u201335</ref> On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] voted to secede, and six other Southern states [[Ordinance of Secession|seceded]] in the next forty days. In February, these Southern states formed the [[Confederated States of America]] (CSA) and elected [[Jefferson Davis]] as provisional president. Despite the formation of the CSA, the [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states]] of Arkansas, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri still remained part of the union.<ref name=white361369>White (2009), pp. 361\u2013369.</ref>\n\nIn February 1861, two final political efforts were made to preserve the Union. The first was made by a group of 131 delegates sent by 21 states to a [[Peace Conference of 1861|Peace Conference]], held at the [[Willard InterContinental Washington|Willard's Hotel]] in the nation's capital.<ref>Klein p. 239.</ref> The convention submitted to Congress a seven-point constitutional amendment proposal similar in content to the earlier Crittenden Compromise.

Commonly known as the [[Corwin Amendment]], the measure was approved by Congress and sent to the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] for ratification.<ref name=\"Morison p. 609\"/> While only ratified by a few states, Congress did not set a [[Article Five of the United States Constitution#Deadlines|time limit]] for its ratification, thus the amendment is still technically pending.{{sfn|Smith|1975|pp=152-160}}\n\n===Arrival in Washington, D.C.===\nOn February 11, 1861, Lincoln boarded a special train that over the course of the next two weeks would take him to the nation's capital.<ref>Gienapp (2002) pp. 76\u201377.</ref> Lincoln spoke several times each day during the train trip. While his speeches were mostly extemporaneous, his message was consistent: he had no hostile intentions towards the South, disunion was not acceptable, and he intended to enforce the laws and protect property.<ref>Gienapp (2002) p. 77.</ref>\n\nRumors abounded during the course of the trip of various plots to kill Lincoln. [[Samuel Morse Felton, Sr.|Samuel Felton]], president of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad]], hired detective [[Allan Pinkerton]] to investigate reports that secessionists might try to sabotage the railroad along the route. In conducting his investigation Pinkerton obtained information that indicated to him that an [[Baltimore Plot|attempt on Lincoln's life would be made in Baltimore]].<ref>Holzer (2008) p. 378.</ref> As a result of the threat, the travel schedule was altered, tracks were closed to other traffic, and the telegraph wires even cut to heighten security. Lincoln and his entourage passed through Baltimore's waterfront at around 3 o'clock in the early morning of February 23, and arrived safely in the nation's capital a few hours later. The unannounced departure from the published schedule, along with the unconventional attire Lincoln wore to keep a low profile, led to critics and cartoonists accusing him of sneaking into Washington in disguise.<ref>Gienapp (2002) p. 77; Thomas (1952) pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> Lincoln met with Buchanan and Congressional leaders shortly after arriving in Washington.

Among those whose counsel Lincoln sought was [[Orville Hickman Browning|Orville Browning]], who advised Lincoln to omit the phrase \"to reclaim the public property and places which have fallen\". He also asked his former rival (and Secretary of State-designate) William Seward to review it. Seward exercised his due diligence by presenting Lincoln with a six-page analysis of the speech in which he offered some 49 suggested changes, of which the president-elect incorporated 27 into the final draft.<ref>White (2005) pp. 67\u201370.</ref>\n\nLincoln's first presidential inauguration occurred on March 4, 1861 on the East Portico of the [[United States Capitol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/19th-inaugural-ceremonies/|title=The 19th Presidential Inauguration: Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1861|publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref> Prior to taking the oath, Lincoln delivered his [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|inaugural address]]. He opened by attempting to reassure the South that he had no intention or constitutional authority to interfere with slavery in states where it already existed. He promised to enforce the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|fugitive slave law]] and spoke favorably about a pending constitutional amendment that would preserve slavery in the states where it currently existed. He also assured the states that had already seceded that the federal government would not \"assail\" (violently attack) them.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) p. 60; Gienapp (2002) p. 78.</ref><ref name=LincolnDA>{{cite web|url= https://millercenter.org/president/lincoln/domestic-affairs|title= Abraham Lincoln:Domestic Affairs|publisher= Miller Center of Public Affairs, University of Virginia|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref> After these assurances, however, Lincoln declared that secession was \"the essence of anarchy\" and it was his duty to \"hold, occupy, and possess the property belonging to the government\".<ref>Gienapp (2002) p. 78; Miller (2008) pp. 9\u201310.</ref> Focusing on those within the South who were still on the fence regarding secession, Lincoln contrasted \"persons in one section or another who seek to destroy the Union as it exists\" versus \"those, however, who really love the Union.\"<ref>White (2005) p. 85.</ref> In his closing remarks Lincoln spoke directly to the secessionists, and asserted that no state could secede from the Union \"upon its own mere motion\" and emphasized the moral commitment that he was undertaking to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the laws of the land.<ref>Miller (2008) p. 25.</ref> He then concluded the address with a firm but conciliatory message:\n{{Quote|We are not enemies, but friends.

It was tradition for the president-elect to offer this, the most senior cabinet post, to the leading (best-known and most popular) person of his political party. William Seward was that man and in mid-December 1860, Vice President-elect Hamlin, acting on Lincoln's behalf, offered the position to him.<ref name=\"Stahr 2012 pp. 214-217\">Stahr (2012) pp. 214-217.</ref> Seward had been deeply disappointed by his failure to win the 1860 Republican presidential nomination, but he agreed to serve as Lincoln's Secretary of State.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 37\u201338</ref> By the end of 1862, Seward had emerged as the dominant figure in Lincoln's cabinet, though the Secretary of State's conservative policies on abolition and other issues alienated many within the Republican Party.

[[Montgomery Blair]] of Maryland, who was popular among anti-slavery and border state Democrats, became Lincoln's first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. Blair came from a prominent political family, as his father, [[Francis Preston Blair]], had served as an adviser to President [[Andrew Jackson]], while his younger brother, [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.]], was a major Unionist leader in Missouri.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 41\u201342</ref> Blair's Postal Service aptly responded to the challenges posed by the Civil War, but the Blair family alienated key Northern and border state leaders during the war.

His critics faulted him for some of his railroad ventures, accused him of being a Doughface, and questioned his intellectual capacity for a high government position. In the end, Smith's selection for Secretary of the Interior had much to do with his campaign efforts on behalf of Lincoln and their friendship.<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 739\u2013742; Paludan (1994) p. 42.</ref> Smith would serve less than two years before resigning due to poor health.<ref name=\"doi.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.doi.gov/whoweare/past-secretaries|title=Past Secretaries|date=July 1, 2015|website=www.doi.gov}}</ref> He was replaced by [[John Palmer Usher]].<ref name=\"doi.gov\"/>\n\n==Judicial appointments==\n{{CSS image crop|Image = CHASE, Samuel P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|bSize = 325|cWidth = 255|cHeight = 277|oTop = 55|oLeft = 45|Location = right|Description = <center>[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] engraved portrait of [[Salmon P.

Two more vacancies arose in early 1861 due to the death of [[John McLean]] and the resignation of [[John Archibald Campbell]]. Despite the vacancies, Lincoln did not nominate a replacement for any of the justices until January 1862. [[Noah Haynes Swayne]], [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], and [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] were all nominated by Lincoln and confirmed by the Senate in 1862. Congress added a tenth seat on the Court through the passage of the [[Tenth Circuit Act of 1863]], and Lincoln appointed a War Democrat, [[Stephen Johnson Field]], to fill that seat. After [[Roger Taney]] died in 1864, Lincoln appointed former Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase to the position of Chief Justice.

Totten]], the army's chief engineer, said that simply reinforcing the fort was not possible, although Secretary of the Navy Welles disagreed. Scott advised Lincoln that it would take a large fleet, 25,000 troops, and several months of training in order to defend the fort. On March 13, Postmaster General Blair, the strongest proponent in the cabinet for standing firm at Fort Sumter, introduced Lincoln to his brother-in-law, [[Gustavus Fox|Gustavus V. Fox]]. Fox presented a plan for a naval resupply and reinforcement of the fort. The plan had been approved by Scott during the last month of the previous administration, but Buchanan had rejected it.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) pp. 99-101.</ref> On March 15, Lincoln asked each cabinet member to provide a written answer to the question, \"Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort-Sumter, under all circumstances, is it wise to attempt it?\" Only Blair gave his unconditional approval to the plan. No decision was reached, but Lincoln personally dispatched Fox, [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]], and [[Ward Hill Lamon|Ward Lamon]] to South Carolina to assess the situation. The recommendations that came back were that reinforcement was both necessary, since secessionist feeling ran high and threatened the fort, and feasible, despite Anderson's misgivings.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) pp. 102\u2013107.</ref>\n\nOn March 28, Scott recommended that both Pickens and Sumter be abandoned, basing his decision more on political than military grounds. The next day a deeply agitated Lincoln presented Scott's proposal to the cabinet. Blair was now joined by Welles and Chase in supporting reinforcement. Bates was non-committal, Cameron was not in attendance, and Seward and Smith opposed resupply. Later that day Lincoln gave Fox the order to begin assembling a squadron to reinforce Fort Sumter.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) pp. 108\u2013110.</ref> Lincoln's policy of re-supplying the Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens was designed to deny the right of secession without resorting to violence, which he hoped would allow the administration maintain support among both Northerners and Southern Unionists.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 64\u201366</ref>\n\nWith the Fort Sumter mission ready to go, Lincoln sent State Department clerk Robert S. Chew to inform South Carolina Governor [[Francis W. Pickens]] of the impending re-supply of the fort.<ref>Current (1963) p. 108</ref> The message was delivered to Governor Pickens on April 8.<ref>Current (1963) p. 123.</ref> The information was telegraphed that night to Confederate President Jefferson Davis in Richmond.

The relief expedition sent by the Union arrived too late to intervene.<ref>White (2009), pp. 406\u2013407.</ref>\n\n===Early war===\n\nOn April 15, following the Attack on Fort Sumter, Lincoln declared that a state of rebellion existed and called up a force of seventy-five thousand state militiamen to serve three-month terms. While Northern states rallied to the request, border states such as Missouri refused to provide soldiers. Lincoln also called Congress into a special session to begin in July. Though an in-session Congress could potentially affect his freedom of action, Lincoln needed Congress to authorize funds to fight the war against the Confederacy. On the advice of Winfield Scott, Lincoln asked a political ally to offer General [[Robert E. Lee]] command of the Union forces, but Lee ultimately chose to serve the Confederacy. Union soldiers in Southern states burned federal facilities to prevent Southern forces from taking control of them, while Confederate sympathizers led a [[Baltimore riot of 1861|riot]] in Baltimore. To ensure the security of the capital, Lincoln suspended [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] in Maryland, and ignored a [[Ex parte Merryman|court order]] ordering him to release a detained prisoner. While Lincoln struggled to maintain order in Maryland and other border states, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee all seceded from the Union. North Carolina was the last state to secede, doing so on May 20.<ref>White (2009), pp. 408\u2013417.</ref>\n\nWith the secession of several states, Lincoln's Republicans enjoyed large majorities in both houses of Congress. [[War Democrats]] such as [[Andrew Johnson]] of Tennessee also provided support for many of Lincoln's policies, though [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead]] Democrats advocated peace with the Confederacy.<ref>White (2009), pp. 424\u2013425.</ref> From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any action, such as the appointment of generals, could alienate factions on both sides of the aisle.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331\u2013333, 338\u2013339, 417.</ref> Lincoln appointed several [[political general]]s to curry favor with various groups, but especially Democrats.<ref>White (2009), pp. 444\u2013445.</ref> On its return in July 1861, Congress supported Lincoln's war proposals, providing appropriations for the expansion of the army to 500,000 men.<ref>White (2009), pp. 427\u2013428.</ref> Organizing the army would prove to be a challenge for Lincoln and the War Department, as many professional officers resisted civilian control, while many state militias sought to act autonomously. Knowing that success in the war required the support of local officials in mobilizing soldiers, Lincoln used patronage powers and personal diplomacy to ensure that Northern leaders remained devoted to the war effort.<ref>White (2009), pp. 443\u2013445.</ref><ref>Mark E. Neely Jr, ''Lincoln and the Democrats: The Politics of Opposition in the Civil War'' (2017) pp 45-84.</ref>\n\nHaving succeeded in rallying the North against secession, Lincoln next determined to attack the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], which was located just one hundred miles from Washington. Lincoln was disappointed by the state of the War Department and Navy Department, and Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, but Lincoln nonetheless ordered an offensive. As the aged Scott was unable to lead the army himself, General [[Irvin McDowell]] led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met a force led by Confederate General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]]. At the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], the Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.<ref>White (2009), pp. 429\u2013435.</ref>\n\n[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of men sitting at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine.|\"Running the 'Machine'&nbsp;\": An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln's administration\u2014featuring [[William Fessenden]], [[Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln and others.]]\n\nFollowing the secession of four states after the Battle of Fort Sumter, one of Lincoln's major concerns was that the slave-holding [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri would join the Confederacy. Of these four states, Lincoln was least concerned about Delaware, which had a proportionally large pro-Union population. Due to its location, [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]] remained a critical part of the Union. Lincoln continued to suppress Southern sympathizers in the state, but historian Ronald White also notes Lincoln's forbearance in refusing to take harsher measures. Maryland's election of Unionist Governor [[Augustus Bradford]] in November 1861 ensured that Maryland would remain part of the Union. Perhaps even more critical than Maryland was [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]], which provided access to key rivers and served as a gateway to Tennessee and the Midwest. Hoping to avoid upsetting the delicate balance in the state, Lincoln publicly ordered military leaders to respect Kentucky's declared neutrality, but quietly provided support to Kentucky Unionists. The Confederates were the first to violate this neutrality, seizing control of the town of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], while the Union would capture the important town of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]]. Like Kentucky, [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]] controlled access to key rivers and had a large pro-Confederate population. Lincoln appointed General [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] to ensure Union control of the area, but Fr\u00e9mont alienated many in the state by declaring martial law and issuing a proclamation freeing slaves that belonged to rebels. Lincoln removed Fr\u00e9mont and reversed the order, but Missouri emerged as the most problematic of the border states for Lincoln.<ref>White (2009), pp. 448\u2013456.</ref>\n\n===Eastern Theater to 1864===\n{{Further|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\n====1861 and the Peninsula campaign====\n\nAfter the defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, Lincoln summoned Major General [[George B. McClellan]] to replace McDowell. McClellan had won minor battles in the [[Western Virginia campaign]], and those victories had allowed Unionist [[West Virginia]] to hold the [[Wheeling Convention]] and eventually secede from Virginia.<ref>White (2009), pp. 438\u2013439.</ref> With Lincoln's support, McClellan rejected Scott's [[Anaconda Plan]], instead proposing a strike against Virginia which would end the war with one climactic battle.<ref>White (2009), pp. 440\u2013441.</ref> After Scott retired in late 1861, Lincoln appointed McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 318\u2013319.</ref> McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his [[Peninsula campaign]]. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the [[Army of the Potomac]] by boat to the [[Virginia Peninsula]] and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 349\u2013352.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lincoln and McClellan 1862-10-03.jpg|alt=Photograph of Lincoln and McClellan sitting at a table in a field tent|thumb|Lincoln and [[George B.

Congressional Democrats, on the other hand, tended to oppose Lincoln's policies regarding both the war and slavery.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nIn January 1862, Lincoln, frustrated by months of inaction, ordered McClellan to begin the offensive by the end of February.<ref>White (2009), pp. 471\u2013472.</ref> When McClellan still failed to launch his attack, members of Congress urged Lincoln to replace McClellan with McDowell or Fr\u00e9mont, but Lincoln decided to retain McClellan as commander of Army of the Potomac over either potential replacement. He did, however, remove McClellan as general-in-chief of the army in May, leaving the office vacant. McClellan moved against Confederate forces in March, and the Army of Potomac fought the bloody-but-inconclusive [[Battle of Seven Pines]] at the end of May. Following the battle, Robert E. Lee took command of Confederate forces in Virginia, and he led his forces to victory in the [[Seven Days Battles]], which effectively brought the Peninsula Campaign to a close.<ref>White (2009), pp. 481\u2013486.</ref>\n\n====Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg====\n\nIn late June 1862, while the Army of the Potomac was fighting the Seven Days Battles, Lincoln appointed [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] to command the newly-formed [[Army of Virginia]]. On July 11, Lincoln summoned [[Henry Halleck]] from the Western Theater of the war to take command as general-in-chief of the army. Shortly thereafter, Lincoln asked [[Ambrose Burnside]] to replace McClellan as commander of the Army of the Potomac, but Burnside, who was close friends with McClellan, declined the post.<ref>White (2009), pp. 496\u2013497.</ref> Pope's forces moved South towards Richmond, and in late August, the Army of Virginia met the Confederate army in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], which was another major Union defeat. Following the battle, Lincoln turned to McClellan again, placing him in command of the Army of Virginia as well as the Army of Potomac.<ref>White (2009), pp. 505\u2013508.</ref>\n\nShortly after McClellan's return to command, General Lee's forces crossed the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland, leading to the [[Battle of Antietam]] in September 1862.<ref>Goodwin, pp. 478\u2013480.</ref> The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in January.<ref>Goodwin, p. 481.</ref> Following the battle, McClellan resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 389\u2013390.</ref> The mid-term elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of ''habeas corpus,'' the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nevins vol 6 pp. 318\u2013322</ref> After the 1862 mid-term elections, Lincoln, frustrated with McClellan's continued inactivity, replaced McClellan with Burnside.<ref>White (2009), pp. 518\u2013521.</ref>\n\nAgainst the advice of the president, Burnside prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly defeated by Lee at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 429\u2013431.</ref> The defeat also amplified the criticisms of Radical Republicans such as Lyman Trumbull and [[Benjamin Wade]], who believed that Lincoln had mishandled the war, particularly with regards to his selection of generals.<ref>White (2009), pp. 525\u2013527.</ref>\n\n====Gettysburg Campaign====\n{{Further|Gettysburg campaign|Gettysburg Address}}\n{{Quote box\n|title = The [[Gettysburg Address]]\n|quote    =  \"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

In April 1863, Hooker began his offensive towards Richmond, and his army encountered Lee's at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. Despite possessing a larger army, the Union suffered another major loss at Chancellorsville, though the Confederates also suffered a high number of casualties, including the death of General [[Stonewall Jackson]].<ref>White (2009), pp. 557\u2013561.</ref> Following the Confederate victory, Lee decided to take the offensive, launching the [[Gettysburg campaign]] in June 1863. Lee hoped that Confederate victories in the offensive would empower Lincoln's political opponents and convince the North that the Union could not win the war. After Hooker failed to stop Lee in the early stages of his advance, Lincoln replaced Hooker with General [[George Meade]]. Lee led his army into Pennsylvania, and was followed by Meade's Army of the Potomac. While many in the North fretted over Lee's advance, Lincoln saw the offensive as an opportunity to destroy a Confederate army.<ref>White (2009), pp. 571\u2013576.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate and Union armies met at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 1. The battle, fought over three days, resulted in the highest number of casualties in the war. Along with the Union victory in the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], the Battle of Gettysburg is often referred to as a turning point in the war. Though the battle ended with a Confederate retreat, Lincoln was dismayed that Meade had failed to destroy Lee's army. Feeling that Meade was a competent commander despite his failure to pursue Lee, Lincoln allowed Meade to remain in command of the Army of the Potomac. The Eastern Theater would be locked in a stalemate for the remainder of 1863.<ref>White (2009), pp. 576\u2013581.</ref>\n\nIn November 1863, Lincoln was invited to Gettysburg to dedicate the first national cemetery and honor the soldiers who had fallen. His Gettysburg Address became a core statement of American political values. Defying Lincoln's prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.<ref name=\"Bulla\">Bulla (2010), p. 222.</ref> In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, following ratification of the [[United States Constitution]], but with the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. He defined the war as an effort dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 460\u2013466.</ref><ref>Wills, pp. 20, 27, 105, 146.</ref>\n\n===Western Theater and naval blockade===\n{{Further|Western Theater of the American Civil War|Union blockade}}\n[[File:American Civil War - Map Overview 1863.svg|right|400px|thumb|Despite several defeats in the Eastern Theater, the Union experienced success in the Western Theater, taking control of Tennessee and the Mississippi River by the end of 1863]]\n\nCompared to the Eastern Theater of the war, Lincoln exercised less direct control over operations that took place West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].

The South blundered in embargoing cotton exports in 1861 before the blockade was effective; by the time they realized the mistake, it was too late. \"[[King Cotton]]\" was dead, as the South could export less than 10 percent of its cotton.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}} The Confederate Navy briefly challenged Union naval supremacy by building an [[ironclad warship]] known as the [[CSS Virginia]], but the Union responded by building its own ship, the [[USS Monitor]], which effectively neutralized the Confederate naval threat.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 120\u2013121</ref> The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston.

Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85\u2013107}}</ref> The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it.

Nonetheless, Lincoln came to appreciate the battlefield exploits of Grant.<ref>White (2009), pp. 547\u2013549.</ref> Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can't spare this man.

This campaign is often characterized as a [[attrition warfare|war of attrition]], given high Union losses at battles such as the [[Battle of the Wilderness]] and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had a similarly high level of casualties.<ref>McPherson (2009), p. 113.</ref> The high casualty figures alarmed many in the North,<ref>Donald (1996), p. 501.</ref> but, despite the heavy losses, Lincoln continued to support Grant.<ref>White (2009), pp. 631\u2013632.</ref>\n\nWhile Grant's campaign continued, General Sherman led Union forces from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. Sherman's victory in the September 2 [[Battle of Atlanta]] boosted Union morale, breaking the pessimism that had set in throughout 1864.<ref>White (2009), pp. 640\u2013641.</ref> Hood's forces left the Atlanta area to menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin-Nashville Campaign]]. General [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and General Thomas dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=812\u201315}} Lincoln authorized the Union army to target the Confederate infrastructure\u2014such as plantations, railroads, and bridges\u2014hoping to shatter the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Leaving Atlanta, and his base of supplies, Sherman's army marched east with an unknown destination, laying waste to about 20 percent of the farms in Georgia in his \"[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]\". He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia in December 1864. Following the March to the Sea, Sherman turned North through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Lee's army from the south.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825\u201330}}\n\nDuring the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]], Confederate general [[Jubal Early]] crossed the Potomac River, and advanced into Maryland. On July 11, two days after defeating Union forces under General [[Lew Wallace]] in the [[Battle of Monocacy]], Early attacked [[Battle of Fort Stevens|Fort Stevens]], an outpost on the defensive perimeter of Washington. Lincoln watched the combat from an exposed position; at one point during the skirmish Captain [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] shouted at him, \"Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\"<ref>Thomas (2008), p. 434.</ref> Afterward, Grant created the [[Union Army of the Shenandoah|Army of the Shenandoah]] and put Sheridan in command.

Chase emerged as the most prominent potential intra-party challenger, and Senator [[Samuel C. Pomeroy]] led a covert campaign for Chase's nomination.<ref>White (2009), pp. 614\u2013615.</ref> Much of the support for Chase came from abolitionists who were frustrated by Lincoln's unwillingness to push for the immediate end of slavery and his willingness to work with conservative Unionist leaders in the South.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 261\u2013262</ref> Pomeroy's attempts to galvanize support for Chase backfired as they generated a groundswell of support for Lincoln's re-nomination, and Chase announced in early 1864 that he was not a candidate for the presidential nomination.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 268\u2013269</ref> After Chase decided not to run, anti-slavery activists cast about for a new candidate. In May 1864, a group led by [[Wendell Phillips]] nominated John C. Fr\u00e9mont for president. Most abolitionist leaders and Radical Republicans, including [[William Lloyd Garrison]], Frederick Douglass, and Charles Sumner, decided to support Lincoln over Fr\u00e9mont, as they believed that Fr\u00e9mont's candidacy would ultimately help Democrats more than the abolitionist cause.<ref name=\"Paludan 1993, pp. 270\u2013273\">Paludan (1993), pp. 270\u2013273</ref> Fr\u00e9mont himself eventually endorsed this view, and he withdrew from the race in favor of Lincoln in September 1864.<ref name=\"Paludan 1993, pp. 270\u2013273\"/>\n\nDespite recent setbacks in the Western Theater of the war, the June [[1864 National Union National Convention]] nominated Lincoln for president. Though Hamlin hoped to be re-nominated as vice president, the convention instead nominated Andrew Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee.

Due to the city's important location, the fall of Petersburg would likely lead to the fall of Richmond, but Grant feared that Lee would decide to move South and link up with other Confederate armies.

On April 2, Grant launched an attack that became known as the [[Third Battle of Petersburg]], which ended with Lee's retreat from Petersburg and Richmond.

Seward]], [[Montgomery Blair]] and [[Edward Bates]]]]\n\n===Early actions on slavery===\nThroughout the first year and a half of his presidency, Lincoln made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union and not to end slavery. Though unwilling to publicly declare the abolition of slavery as a war goal, Lincoln considered various plans that would provide for the eventual abolition of slavery and explored the idea of compensated emancipation, including one proposed test case which would have seen all Delaware slaves freed by 1872.<ref>White (2009), pp. 458\u2013459.</ref> He also met with [[Fredrick Douglass]] and other black leaders, discussing the possibility of a colonization project in [[Central America]].<ref>White (2009), pp. 509\u2013511.</ref> Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his slowness in moving from his initial position of non-interference with slavery to one of emancipation. In an August 1862 letter to anti-slavery journalist [[Horace Greeley]], Lincoln explained:\n{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be \"the Union as it was\". ... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.<ref>[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm Letter to Horace Greeley], August 22, 1862.</ref>}}\n\nAs the Civil War continued, freeing the slaves became an important wartime measure for weakening the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. In August 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which authorized court proceedings to confiscate the slaves of anyone who participated in or aided the Confederate war effort. The act however, did not specify whether the slaves were free.<ref>McPherson (1988), p. 356</ref> In April 1862, Lincoln signed a law abolishing slavery in Washington, D.C., and, in June, he signed another law abolishing slavery in all federal territories. The following month, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]], which declared that all Confederate slaves taking refuge behind Union lines were to be set free.<ref>White (2009), pp. 492\u2013493.</ref>\n\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n\nUnion victories in 1861 and 1862 secured the border states, which in turn freed Lincoln's hand to pursue more aggressive anti-slavery policies.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 125\u2013126</ref> Additionally, many Northerners came to support abolition during the war due to the influence of religious leaders like [[Henry Ward Beecher]] and journalists like Horace Greeley.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 144\u2013145</ref> The same month that Lincoln signed the Second Confiscation Act, he also privately decided that he would pursue emancipation as a war goal. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln read to his cabinet a preliminary draft of a proclamation calling for emancipation of all slaves in the Confederacy. As the Union had suffered several defeats in the early part of the war, Seward convinced Lincoln to announce this emancipation plan after a significant Union victory so that it would not seem like a move of desperation.<ref>White (2009), pp. 495\u2013496.</ref> Lincoln was forced to wait several months until the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam.<ref>White (2009), pp. 516\u2013517.</ref>\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put in effect January 1, 1863, applied in the eleven states that were still in rebellion in 1863. The proclamation did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding border states that had remained in the Union, nor did it apply to Tennessee or West Virginia, both of which were largely under the control of Union forces.<ref>{{cite book|author=Freedmen and Southern Society Project|title=Freedom: a documentary history of emancipation 1861\u20131867 : selected from the holdings of the National Archives of the United States.

Louisiana, which had a larger slave population than other Confederate state occupied early in the war, became the center of discussion regarding Reconstruction under Lincoln and military governor [[Benjamin Butler]].<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 238\u2013239</ref> Butler and his successor, [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], implemented a labor system in which free blacks worked as laborers on white-owned plantations. This model, which paid blacks wages but also represented a continuation of plantation agriculture, was adopted throughout much of the occupied South.<ref>Foner (1988), pp. 55\u201360</ref> Banks also presided over the ratification of a new state constitution that banned slavery, but did not guarantee free blacks the right to vote.<ref>Foner (1988), pp. 48\u201350</ref>\n\nAfter 1862, Democrats like [[Reverdy Johnson]] sought the withdrawal of the Emancipation Proclamation and amnesty for the Confederates. By contrast, Radical Republicans like Sumner argued that rebel Southerners had lost all rights by attempting to secede from the Union. In his [[ten percent plan]], Lincoln sought to find a middle ground, calling for the emancipation of Confederate slaves and the re-integration of Southern states once ten percent of voters in a state took an oath of allegiance to the U.S. and pledged to respect emancipation.<ref>White (2009), pp. 611\u2013613.</ref> Radical Republicans countered with the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], a Reconstruction plan that included protections for the rights of freed African Americans and required fifty percent of voters to swear the \"[[Ironclad Oath]]\" indicating that they had never and never would support a rebellion against the United States. As the Wade\u2013Davis Bill interfered with Lincoln's plans for the readmission of Louisiana and Arkansas, Lincoln [[pocket veto]]ed the bill in late 1864.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 280\u2013282</ref>\n\n[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''.

Many in Congress sought far-reaching reforms to Southern society that went beyond the abolition of slavery, and they refused to recognize Lincoln's reconstituted Southern governments. Disagreements within Congress prevented the passage of any Reconstruction bill or the recognition of governments in Arkansas and Louisiana.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 302\u2013303</ref> As the war came to a close, Lincoln indicated an openness to some of the proposals of the Radical Republicans, and he signed a bill creating the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 306\u2013309</ref> Established as a temporary institution, the Freedmen's Bureau was designed to provide food and other supplies to free blacks in the South, and was also authorized to grant confiscated land to former slaves.<ref>Foner (1988), pp. 68\u201369</ref> Lincoln did not take a definitive stand on [[black suffrage]], stating only that \"very intelligent blacks\" and those that had served in the military should be granted the right to vote.<ref>White (2009), pp. 671\u2013672.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] notes that no one knows what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction had he served out his second term, but writes,\n{{Quote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land.

He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates.

Rather than waiting for the [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] to convene in March, Lincoln pressed the lame duck session of the [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment as soon as possible. After an extensive lobbying campaign by Lincoln and Seward, the House narrowly cleared the two-thirds threshold in a 119-56 vote.<ref name=\"White 2009, pp. 653\u2013654\"/> The Thirteenth Amendment was sent to the states for ratification, and Secretary of State Seward proclaimed its adoption on December 18, 1865.

The act created a flat tax of three percent on incomes above $800 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|800|1861|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms). This taxation of income reflected the increasing amount of wealth held in stocks and bonds rather than property, which the federal government had taxed in the past.<ref>Weisman (2002), pp. 30\u201335.</ref> As the average urban worker made approximately $600 per year, the income tax burden fell primarily on the rich.<ref name=\"Paludan 1993, pp. 111\u2013112\">Paludan (1993), pp. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nLincoln also signed the second and third [[Morrill Tariff]]s, the first having become law in the final months of Buchanan's tenure. These tariff acts raised import duties considerably compared to previous tariff rates, and they were designed to both raise revenue and protect domestic manufacturing against foreign competition. During the war, the tariff also helped manufacturers off-set the burden of new taxes. Compared to pre-war levels, the tariff would remain relatively high for the remainder of the 19th century.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 113\u2013114</ref> Throughout the war, members of Congress would debate whether to raise further revenue primarily through increased tariff rates, which most strongly affected rural areas in the West, or increased income taxes, which most strongly affected wealthier individuals in the Northeast.<ref>Weisman (2002), p. 85.</ref>\n\nThe revenue measures of 1861 proved inadequate for the funding of the war, forcing Congress to pass further bills designed to generate revenue.<ref>Weisman (2002), pp. 37\u201338.</ref> In February 1862, Congress passed the [[Legal Tender Act]], which authorized the minting of $150 million of \"[[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]].\" Greenbacks were the first [[banknote]]s issued by the federal government of the United States since the end of the [[American Revolution]].

Those acts established the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] to oversee \"national banks,\" which would be subject to federal, rather than state, regulation. In return for investing a third of their capital in federal bonds, these national banks were authorized to issue federal banknotes.<ref name=\"weisman8182\"/> After Congress imposed a tax on private banknotes in March 1865, federal banknotes would become the dominant form of paper currency in the United States.<ref name=\"Paludan 1993, pp. 111\u2013112\"/>\n\n===Reforms===\n\nMany of the bills passed by the 37th and 38th Congress were designed at least in part to pay for the war, but other bills instituted long-term reforms in areas unrelated to revenue.<ref>Paludan (1993), p. 113</ref> Congress passed the [[Homestead Act]] in May 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost.

In 1861, Seward set up a special office in the State Department designed to monitor internal security, and the federal government and local police officers worked together to suppress those suspected of actively supporting the Confederacy.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 70\u201375</ref> Among those imprisoned was [[John Merryman]], an officer of the Maryland militia who had cut telegraph lines leading to Washington. In the subsequent case of ''[[Ex parte Merryman]],'' Chief Justice Taney asserted that only Congress had the right to suspend habeas corpus. In a message to Congress delivered in July 1861, Lincoln responded by arguing that his actions had been constitutional and necessary given the threat posed by the Confederacy.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 75\u201378</ref> Congress later passed the [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1863]], which provided congressional authorization to the president to suspend habeas corpus and placed limits on the administration's ability to indefinitely hold prisoners.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 191\u2013192</ref>\n\nAs the war continued, many in the North came to resist the sacrifices required by the war, and recruiting declined.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 190\u2013191</ref> After state and local efforts failed to furnish the troops necessary for the war, Congress instituted a draft through passage of the March 1863 Enrollment Act. The conscription act included various exemptions and allowed potential draftees to pay for substitutes, but it nonetheless proved unpopular in many communities and among many state and local leaders.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 192\u2013195</ref> Opposition to the draft was especially strong among [[Irish Americans|Irish American]]s, urban laborers, and others who could not afford to pay for substitutes. The [[New York City draft riots]] of July 1863 saw mobs attack soldiers, policemen, and African Americans, and was only subdued after Lincoln diverted soldiers from the Gettysburg Campaign. Rejecting calls to institute martial law in the city, Lincoln appointed [[John Adams Dix]] to oversee New York City, and Dix allowed the city hold civilian trials on those who had participated in the riots.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\n[[Clement Vallandigham]], a Copperhead Democrat from Ohio, emerged as one of the most prominent critics of the war. General Ambrose Burnside arrested Vallandigham in May 1863 after the latter strongly criticized the draft and other wartime policies. A military commission subsequently sentenced Vallandigham to imprisonment until the end of the war, but Lincoln intervened to have Vallandigham released into Confederate territory. Ohio Democrats nonetheless nominated Vallandigham for governor in June 1863.<ref>Paludan (1993), p. 199</ref> Vallandigham's defeat in the 1863 election, along with Democratic electoral defeats elsewhere in 1863, represented a major victory for Lincoln and the Republicans as it signified public support for the war.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 226\u2013227</ref>\n\n===Conflicts with Native Americans===\n{{Further|Native Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\nConflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on the [[American frontier]] continued during the Civil War, as American settlers continued to push west.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 117\u2013118</ref> In 1862, Lincoln sent General Pope to put down the \"[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Is\u00e1\u014byathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).<ref>Cox, p. 182.</ref> In his final two [[State of the Union|annual messages to Congress]] Lincoln called for reform of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and federal Indian policy. However, as the war to preserve the Union was Lincoln's primary concern, he simply allowed the system to function unchanged for the balance of his presidency.<ref>Nichols, pp. 207\u2013232.</ref>\n\n===States admitted to the Union===\n{{Further|Nevada in the American Civil War|West Virginia in the American Civil War}}\n\nTwo new states were [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] while Lincoln was in office. The first such state, West Virginia, had been part of Virginia before the start of the American Civil War. In the June 1861 Wheeling Convention, delegates from several counties in western Virginia formed the [[Restored Government of Virginia]], ostensibly as the legitimate government of Virginia. In the following year, the people of West Virginia voted to secede from Virginia, and a new state constitution was written.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> Despite the opposition of some cabinet members who believed that the partition of Virginia posed constitutional issues, Lincoln decided to support the actions of West Virginia Unionists and he signed a bill admitting West Virginia as a state.<ref name=\"Paludan 1993, pp. 111\u2013112\"/> West Virginia was admitted to the union on June 20, 1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in History - June 20: Mountaineers Always Freemen|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun20.html|website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref> Later, through its ruling in the 1871 case of ''[[Virginia v.

European leaders saw the division of the United States as having the potential to eliminate, or at least greatly weaken, a growing rival. They looked for ways to exploit the inability of the U.S. to enforce the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. [[Spain]] invaded the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1861, while France established a puppet regime in [[Mexico]].<ref>Herring, pp. 224-229</ref> However, many in Europe also hoped for a quick end to the civil war, for both humanitarian purposes and due to the economic disruption caused by the war.<ref>Herring, pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nLincoln's foreign policy was deficient in 1861 in terms of appealing to European public opinion. The European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed.\" Diplomats had to explain that United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesman, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy.<ref name=\"donhdoyle1\">Don H. Doyle,  ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War '' (2014) pp 8 (quote), 69-70</ref> However, the Confederacy's hope that cotton exports would compel European interference did not come to fruition, as Britain found alternative sources of cotton and experienced economic growth in industries that did not rely on cotton.<ref>Herring, pp. 235-236</ref> Though the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation did not immediately end the possibility of European intervention, it rallied European public opinion to the Union by adding abolition as a Northern war goal. Any chance of a European intervention in the war ended with the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, as European leaders came to believe that the Confederate cause was doomed.<ref>Herring, pp. 242-246</ref>\n\n===Britain===\n{{Further|United Kingdom and the American Civil War}}\n\nElite opinion in Britain tended to favor the Confederacy, but public opinion tended to favor the United States. Large scale trade continued in both directions with the United States, with the Americans shipping grain to Britain while Britain exported manufactured items and munitions. British trade with the Confederacy was limited, with a trickle of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small blockade runners.<ref name=\"hjones\"/> The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South, but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics.<ref>Kinley J.

The Union Navy intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys ''en route'' to Europe. The incident aroused public outrage in Britain; the government of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] protested vehemently, while the American public cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis, known as the [[Trent Affair]], by releasing the two diplomats, who had been seized illegally.<ref>Stahr (2012) pp. 307-323.</ref>\n\nBritish financiers built and operated most of the [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runner]]s, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on them; but that was legal and not the cause of serious tension. They were staffed by sailors and officers on leave from the Royal Navy. When the U.S. Navy captured one of the fast blockade runners, it sold the ship and cargo as prize money for the American sailors, then released the crew. A British shipyard, [[Cammell Laird|John Laird and Sons]], built two warships for the Confederacy, including the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], over vehement protests from the United States. The controversy would ultimately be resolved after the Civil War in the form of the [[Alabama Claims]], in which the United States finally was given $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by British-built warships.<ref>Frank J. Merli,  ''The Alabama, British Neutrality, and the American Civil War.''

In December 1861, France [[French intervention in Mexico|invaded]] Mexico. While the official justification was the collection of debts, France eventually established a puppet state under the rule of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]. In October 1862, fearing that a re-unified United States would threaten his restored French empire, Napoleon III proposed an armistice and joint mediation of the American Civil War by France, Britain, and Russia. However, this proposal was declined by the other European powers, who feared alienating the North. Napoleon's bellicose stance towards Russia in the 1863 [[January Uprising]] divided the powers and greatly diminished any chance of a joint European intervention.<ref>Herring, pp. 225, 243-244</ref> The United States refused to recognize Maximilian's government and threatened to drive France out of the country by force, but did not become directly involved in the conflict even as Mexican resistance to Maximilian's rule grew. With the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the U.S. increased pressure on France to withdraw from Mexico, and the French presence in the Western hemisphere would be a major foreign policy issue for Lincoln's successor.<ref>Herring, pp. 252-253</ref>\n\n==Assassination==\n\n{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[File:The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln by Alonzo Chappel, 1868.jpg|thumb|380px|''The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln'', designed by John B.

They hoped to revive the Confederate cause by creating chaos through destabilizing the federal government. Although Booth succeeded in killing Lincoln, the larger plot failed. Seward was attacked, but recovered from his wounds, and Johnson's would-be assassin fled Washington upon losing his nerve.

[[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] was the first member of the recently-established [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] elected to the presidency. He was succeeded by [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Andrew Johnson]]. Lincoln presided over the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] victory in the [[American Civil War]], which dominated his presidency.\n\nLincoln took office following the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], in which he won a plurality of the popular vote in a four-candidate field. Almost all of Lincoln's votes came from the [[Northern United States]], as the Republicans held little appeal to voters in the [[Southern United States]]. A former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]], Lincoln ran on a political platform opposed to the expansion of [[slavery in the United States|slavery]] in the [[United States territories|territories]]. His election served as the immediate impetus for the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. After being sworn in as president, Lincoln refused to accept any resolution that would result in Southern secession from the Union. The Civil War began weeks into Lincoln's presidency with the Confederate attack on [[Fort Sumter]], a federal installation located within the boundaries of the Confederacy.\n\nLincoln was called on to handle both the political and military aspects of the Civil War, facing challenges in both spheres. As commander-in-chief, he ordered the suspension of the constitutionally-protected right to [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] in the state of [[Maryland]] in order to suppress Confederate sympathizers. He also became the first president to institute a military draft. As the Union faced several early defeats in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]], Lincoln cycled through numerous military commanders during the war, finally settling on General [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who had led the Union to several victories in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]]. Lincoln's 1863 [[Emancipation Proclamation]] freed about 20,000 of slaves in Confederate-held territory, and established emancipation as a Union war goal. In 1865, Lincoln was instrumental in the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], which made slavery unconstitutional. Lincoln also presided over the passage of important domestic legislation, including the first of the [[Homestead Acts]], the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862]], and the [[Pacific Railroad Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]]. He ran for re-election in [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]] on the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] ticket, which was supported by [[War Democrats]] in addition to Republicans. Though Lincoln feared he might lose the contest, he defeated his former subordinate, General [[George B. McClellan]] of the Democratic Party, in a [[landslide election|landslide]]. Months after the election, Grant would essentially end the war by defeating the Confederate army led by General [[Robert E. Lee]]. Lincoln's [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|assassination]] in April 1865, five days after the surrender of Lee, left the final challenge of [[Reconstruction Era|reconstructing]] the nation to others.\n\nFollowing his death, Lincoln was portrayed as the liberator of the slaves, the savior of the Union, and a martyr for the cause of freedom. Political historians have long held Lincoln in high regard for his accomplishments and personal characteristics. Alongside [[George Washington]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], he has been consistently [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States#Scholar survey results|ranked]] both by scholars and the public as one of the top three greatest presidents, often as number one.\n\n==Election of 1860==\n[[File:The Rail Candidate.jpg|thumb|alt=Lincoln being carried by two men on a long board.|\"The Rail Candidate\"\u2014Lincoln's 1860 candidacy is depicted as held up by the slavery issue\u2014a slave on the left and party organization on the right.]]\n\nLincoln, a former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] Congressman, emerged as a major Republican presidential candidate following his narrow loss to Democrat [[Stephen A.

Lincoln spent much of 1859 and 1860 building support for his candidacy, and his [[Cooper Union speech]] was well-received by eastern elites. Lincoln positioned himself in the \"moderate center\" of his party; he opposed the expansion of [[slavery]] into the territories but did not favor the [[abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] of slavery in [[slave state]]s.<ref>White (2009), pp. 307\u2013316.</ref> On the first ballot of the May [[1860 Republican National Convention]], Lincoln finished second to Seward, but Seward was unable to clinch the nomination.

A second convention met in June and nominated Stephen Douglas as the presidential nominee, but several pro-slavery Southern delegations refused to support Douglas, as they demanded a strongly pro-slavery nominee. These Southern Democrats held a separate convention that nominated incumbent Vice President [[John C. Breckinridge]] of Kentucky for president. A group of former Whigs and [[Know Nothings]] formed the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] and nominated [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] for president. Breckinridge and Bell would primarily contest the South, while Lincoln and Douglas would compete for votes in the North.

Many wanted him to provide reassurances to the South that their interests were not being threatened.<ref>Thomas (1952) p. 226; Holzer (2008) p. 68.</ref> Realizing that soothing words on the rights of slaveholders would alienate the Republican base, while taking a strong stand on the indestructibility of the Union would further inflame Southerners, Lincoln chose a policy of silence. He believed that, given enough time without any overt acts or threats to the South, Southern unionists would carry the day and bring their states back into the Union.<ref>Holzer (2008) p. 69; Gienapp (2002) pp. 74\u201375; Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 p. 702. Burlingame writes, \"Lincoln's unwillingness to make a public declaration may have been a mistake. Such a document might have allayed fears in the Upper South and Border States and predisposed them to remain in the Union when hostilities broke out. But it might also have wrecked the Republican coalition and doomed his administration to failure before it began.\"</ref> At the suggestion of a Southern merchant who contacted him, Lincoln did make an indirect appeal to the South by providing material for Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] to insert into his own public address. Republicans praised Trumbull's address, Democrats assailed it, and the South largely ignored it.<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 701\u2013702; Thomas (1952) p. 27.</ref>\n\nIn December 1860, both the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]] formed special committees to address the unfolding crisis. Lincoln communicated with various Congressmen that there was room for negotiation on issues such as fugitive slaves, slavery in the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and the domestic slave trade. However he made it clear that he was unalterably opposed to anything which would allow the expansion of slavery into any new states or territories.<ref>Thomas (1952) pp. 229\u2013230.</ref> On December 6, Lincoln wrote to Congressman [[Orlando Kellogg]], a Republican on the special House committee, saying that Kellogg should \"entertain no proposition for a compromise in regard to the extension of slavery. The instant you do, they have us under again; all our labor is lost, and sooner or later must be done over. Douglas is sure to be again trying to bring in his [popular sovereignty]. Have none of it. The tug has to come & better now than later.\"<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 708\u2013709.</ref>\n\nIn mid-December, Senator [[John J. Crittenden]] of Kentucky, the chairman of the special Senate committee, proposed a package of six constitutional amendments, known as the [[Crittenden Compromise]]. The compromise would protect slavery in federal territories south of the [[Parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north|36\u00b030\u2032 parallel]] and prohibit it in territories north of that latitude, with newly admitted states deciding on the status of slavery within their borders. Congress would be forbidden from abolishing slavery in any state (or the District of Columbia) or interfering with the domestic slave trade. Despite pressure from Seward, Lincoln refused to support the compromise.<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 712\u2013718.</ref> Still opposed to the expansion of slavery into the territories, Lincoln privately asked Republican Senators to oppose the compromise, and it failed to pass Congress.<ref name=\"White 2009, pp. 351\u2013354\"/>\n\n===Deepening crisis===\n[[File:US SlaveFree1861.gif|upright=1.40|right|thumb|Following the admission of Kansas in 1861, there were 19 free states and 15 slave states]]\n\nLincoln believed that Southern threats of secession were mostly bluster and that the sectional crisis would be defused, as it had in 1820 and 1850.<ref name=white361369/> However, many Southerners were convinced that assenting to Lincoln's presidency and the restriction of slavery in the territories would ultimately lead to the extinction of slavery in the United States.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 33\u201335</ref> On December 20, 1860, [[South Carolina]] voted to secede, and six other Southern states [[Ordinance of Secession|seceded]] in the next forty days.

[[Samuel Morse Felton, Sr.|Samuel Felton]], president of the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad]], hired detective [[Allan Pinkerton]] to investigate reports that secessionists might try to sabotage the railroad along the route. In conducting his investigation Pinkerton obtained information that indicated to him that an [[Baltimore Plot|attempt on Lincoln's life would be made in Baltimore]].<ref>Holzer (2008) p. 378.</ref> As a result of the threat, the travel schedule was altered, tracks were closed to other traffic, and the telegraph wires even cut to heighten security. Lincoln and his entourage passed through Baltimore's waterfront at around 3 o'clock in the early morning of February 23, and arrived safely in the nation's capital a few hours later. The unannounced departure from the published schedule, along with the unconventional attire Lincoln wore to keep a low profile, led to critics and cartoonists accusing him of sneaking into Washington in disguise.<ref>Gienapp (2002) p. 77; Thomas (1952) pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> Lincoln met with Buchanan and Congressional leaders shortly after arriving in Washington.

Among those whose counsel Lincoln sought was [[Orville Hickman Browning|Orville Browning]], who advised Lincoln to omit the phrase \"to reclaim the public property and places which have fallen\". He also asked his former rival (and Secretary of State-designate) William Seward to review it. Seward exercised his due diligence by presenting Lincoln with a six-page analysis of the speech in which he offered some 49 suggested changes, of which the president-elect incorporated 27 into the final draft.<ref>White (2005) pp. 67\u201370.</ref>\n\nLincoln's first presidential inauguration occurred on March 4, 1861 on the East Portico of the [[United States Capitol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inaugural.senate.gov/about/past-inaugural-ceremonies/19th-inaugural-ceremonies/|title=The 19th Presidential Inauguration: Abraham Lincoln, March 4, 1861|publisher=Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}</ref> Prior to taking the oath, Lincoln delivered his [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|inaugural address]].

Goodwin writes, \"Every member of this administration was better known, better educated, and more experienced in public life than Lincoln.\" Burlingame quotes Lincoln as saying, after he was advised not to select someone to a cabinet post that was \"a great deal bigger\" than Lincoln, \"Well, do you know of any other men who think they are bigger than I am?

It was tradition for the president-elect to offer this, the most senior cabinet post, to the leading (best-known and most popular) person of his political party. William Seward was that man and in mid-December 1860, Vice President-elect Hamlin, acting on Lincoln's behalf, offered the position to him.<ref name=\"Stahr 2012 pp. 214-217\">Stahr (2012) pp. 214-217.</ref> Seward had been deeply disappointed by his failure to win the 1860 Republican presidential nomination, but he agreed to serve as Lincoln's Secretary of State.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 37\u201338</ref> By the end of 1862, Seward had emerged as the dominant figure in Lincoln's cabinet, though the Secretary of State's conservative policies on abolition and other issues alienated many within the Republican Party. Despite pressure from some congressional leaders to fire Seward, Lincoln retained his Secretary of State for the duration of his presidency.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 169\u2013176</ref>\n\nLincoln's choice for Secretary of the Treasury was Ohio Senator [[Salmon P.

Cameron was one of the most influential public leaders in the crucial political state of Pennsylvania, but he was also alleged to be one of the most corrupt.<ref>Paludan (1994) p. 43.</ref> He was opposed within his own state by the faction led by Governor-elect [[Andrew G.

[[Montgomery Blair]] of Maryland, who was popular among anti-slavery and border state Democrats, became Lincoln's first [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. Blair came from a prominent political family, as his father, [[Francis Preston Blair]], had served as an adviser to President [[Andrew Jackson]], while his younger brother, [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.]], was a major Unionist leader in Missouri.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 41\u201342</ref> Blair's Postal Service aptly responded to the challenges posed by the Civil War, but the Blair family alienated key Northern and border state leaders during the war.

His critics faulted him for some of his railroad ventures, accused him of being a Doughface, and questioned his intellectual capacity for a high government position. In the end, Smith's selection for Secretary of the Interior had much to do with his campaign efforts on behalf of Lincoln and their friendship.<ref>Burlingame (2008) vol. 1 pp. 739\u2013742; Paludan (1994) p. 42.</ref> Smith would serve less than two years before resigning due to poor health.<ref name=\"doi.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.doi.gov/whoweare/past-secretaries|title=Past Secretaries|date=July 1, 2015|website=www.doi.gov}}</ref> He was replaced by [[John Palmer Usher]].<ref name=\"doi.gov\"/>\n\n==Judicial appointments==\n{{CSS image crop|Image = CHASE, Samuel P-Treasury (BEP engraved portrait).jpg|bSize = 325|cWidth = 255|cHeight = 277|oTop = 55|oLeft = 45|Location = right|Description = <center>[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing|BEP]] engraved portrait of [[Salmon P.

Two more vacancies arose in early 1861 due to the death of [[John McLean]] and the resignation of [[John Archibald Campbell]].

[[Noah Haynes Swayne]], [[Samuel Freeman Miller]], and [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] were all nominated by Lincoln and confirmed by the Senate in 1862. Congress added a tenth seat on the Court through the passage of the [[Tenth Circuit Act of 1863]], and Lincoln appointed a War Democrat, [[Stephen Johnson Field]], to fill that seat. After [[Roger Taney]] died in 1864, Lincoln appointed former Secretary of the Treasury Salmon Chase to the position of Chief Justice.

Totten]], the army's chief engineer, said that simply reinforcing the fort was not possible, although Secretary of the Navy Welles disagreed. Scott advised Lincoln that it would take a large fleet, 25,000 troops, and several months of training in order to defend the fort. On March 13, Postmaster General Blair, the strongest proponent in the cabinet for standing firm at Fort Sumter, introduced Lincoln to his brother-in-law, [[Gustavus Fox|Gustavus V. Fox]]. Fox presented a plan for a naval resupply and reinforcement of the fort. The plan had been approved by Scott during the last month of the previous administration, but Buchanan had rejected it.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) pp. 99-101.</ref> On March 15, Lincoln asked each cabinet member to provide a written answer to the question, \"Assuming it to be possible to now provision Fort-Sumter, under all circumstances, is it wise to attempt it?\" Only Blair gave his unconditional approval to the plan. No decision was reached, but Lincoln personally dispatched Fox, [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]], and [[Ward Hill Lamon|Ward Lamon]] to South Carolina to assess the situation. The recommendations that came back were that reinforcement was both necessary, since secessionist feeling ran high and threatened the fort, and feasible, despite Anderson's misgivings.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) pp. 102\u2013107.</ref>\n\nOn March 28, Scott recommended that both Pickens and Sumter be abandoned, basing his decision more on political than military grounds. The next day a deeply agitated Lincoln presented Scott's proposal to the cabinet. Blair was now joined by Welles and Chase in supporting reinforcement. Bates was non-committal, Cameron was not in attendance, and Seward and Smith opposed resupply. Later that day Lincoln gave Fox the order to begin assembling a squadron to reinforce Fort Sumter.<ref>Burlingame vol. 2 (2008) pp. 108\u2013110.</ref> Lincoln's policy of re-supplying the Fort Sumter and Fort Pickens was designed to deny the right of secession without resorting to violence, which he hoped would allow the administration maintain support among both Northerners and Southern Unionists.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 64\u201366</ref>\n\nWith the Fort Sumter mission ready to go, Lincoln sent State Department clerk Robert S.

While Northern states rallied to the request, border states such as Missouri refused to provide soldiers. Lincoln also called Congress into a special session to begin in July. Though an in-session Congress could potentially affect his freedom of action, Lincoln needed Congress to authorize funds to fight the war against the Confederacy. On the advice of Winfield Scott, Lincoln asked a political ally to offer General [[Robert E. Lee]] command of the Union forces, but Lee ultimately chose to serve the Confederacy. Union soldiers in Southern states burned federal facilities to prevent Southern forces from taking control of them, while Confederate sympathizers led a [[Baltimore riot of 1861|riot]] in Baltimore. To ensure the security of the capital, Lincoln suspended [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]] in Maryland, and ignored a [[Ex parte Merryman|court order]] ordering him to release a detained prisoner. While Lincoln struggled to maintain order in Maryland and other border states, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee all seceded from the Union. North Carolina was the last state to secede, doing so on May 20.<ref>White (2009), pp. 408\u2013417.</ref>\n\nWith the secession of several states, Lincoln's Republicans enjoyed large majorities in both houses of Congress. [[War Democrats]] such as [[Andrew Johnson]] of Tennessee also provided support for many of Lincoln's policies, though [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperhead]] Democrats advocated peace with the Confederacy.<ref>White (2009), pp. 424\u2013425.</ref> From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any action, such as the appointment of generals, could alienate factions on both sides of the aisle.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 315, 331\u2013333, 338\u2013339, 417.</ref> Lincoln appointed several [[political general]]s to curry favor with various groups, but especially Democrats.<ref>White (2009), pp. 444\u2013445.</ref> On its return in July 1861, Congress supported Lincoln's war proposals, providing appropriations for the expansion of the army to 500,000 men.<ref>White (2009), pp. 427\u2013428.</ref> Organizing the army would prove to be a challenge for Lincoln and the War Department, as many professional officers resisted civilian control, while many state militias sought to act autonomously. Knowing that success in the war required the support of local officials in mobilizing soldiers, Lincoln used patronage powers and personal diplomacy to ensure that Northern leaders remained devoted to the war effort.<ref>White (2009), pp. 443\u2013445.</ref><ref>Mark E. Neely Jr, ''Lincoln and the Democrats: The Politics of Opposition in the Civil War'' (2017) pp 45-84.</ref>\n\nHaving succeeded in rallying the North against secession, Lincoln next determined to attack the Confederate capital of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], which was located just one hundred miles from Washington. Lincoln was disappointed by the state of the War Department and Navy Department, and Scott counseled that the army needed more time to train, but Lincoln nonetheless ordered an offensive. As the aged Scott was unable to lead the army himself, General [[Irvin McDowell]] led a force of 30,000 men south, where he met a force led by Confederate General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]]. At the [[First Battle of Bull Run]], the Confederate army dealt the Union a major defeat, ending any hope of a quick end to the war.<ref>White (2009), pp. 429\u2013435.</ref>\n\n[[File:RunningtheMachine-LincAdmin.jpg|thumb|alt=A group of men sitting at a table as another man creates money on a wooden machine.|\"Running the 'Machine'&nbsp;\": An 1864 political cartoon takes a swing at Lincoln's administration\u2014featuring [[William Fessenden]], [[Edwin Stanton]], [[William H. Seward|William Seward]], [[Gideon Welles]], Lincoln and others.]]\n\nFollowing the secession of four states after the Battle of Fort Sumter, one of Lincoln's major concerns was that the slave-holding [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]] of Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri would join the Confederacy. Of these four states, Lincoln was least concerned about Delaware, which had a proportionally large pro-Union population. Due to its location, [[Maryland in the American Civil War|Maryland]] remained a critical part of the Union. Lincoln continued to suppress Southern sympathizers in the state, but historian Ronald White also notes Lincoln's forbearance in refusing to take harsher measures. Maryland's election of Unionist Governor [[Augustus Bradford]] in November 1861 ensured that Maryland would remain part of the Union. Perhaps even more critical than Maryland was [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky]], which provided access to key rivers and served as a gateway to Tennessee and the Midwest. Hoping to avoid upsetting the delicate balance in the state, Lincoln publicly ordered military leaders to respect Kentucky's declared neutrality, but quietly provided support to Kentucky Unionists. The Confederates were the first to violate this neutrality, seizing control of the town of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]], while the Union would capture the important town of [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]]. Like Kentucky, [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]] controlled access to key rivers and had a large pro-Confederate population. Lincoln appointed General [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] to ensure Union control of the area, but Fr\u00e9mont alienated many in the state by declaring martial law and issuing a proclamation freeing slaves that belonged to rebels. Lincoln removed Fr\u00e9mont and reversed the order, but Missouri emerged as the most problematic of the border states for Lincoln.<ref>White (2009), pp. 448\u2013456.</ref>\n\n===Eastern Theater to 1864===\n{{Further|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\n====1861 and the Peninsula campaign====\n\nAfter the defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, Lincoln summoned Major General [[George B. McClellan]] to replace McDowell.

Congressional Democrats, on the other hand, tended to oppose Lincoln's policies regarding both the war and slavery.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 142\u2013143</ref>\n\nIn January 1862, Lincoln, frustrated by months of inaction, ordered McClellan to begin the offensive by the end of February.<ref>White (2009), pp. 471\u2013472.</ref> When McClellan still failed to launch his attack, members of Congress urged Lincoln to replace McClellan with McDowell or Fr\u00e9mont, but Lincoln decided to retain McClellan as commander of Army of the Potomac over either potential replacement. He did, however, remove McClellan as general-in-chief of the army in May, leaving the office vacant. McClellan moved against Confederate forces in March, and the Army of Potomac fought the bloody-but-inconclusive [[Battle of Seven Pines]] at the end of May. Following the battle, Robert E. Lee took command of Confederate forces in Virginia, and he led his forces to victory in the [[Seven Days Battles]], which effectively brought the Peninsula Campaign to a close.<ref>White (2009), pp. 481\u2013486.</ref>\n\n====Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg====\n\nIn late June 1862, while the Army of the Potomac was fighting the Seven Days Battles, Lincoln appointed [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]] to command the newly-formed [[Army of Virginia]]. On July 11, Lincoln summoned [[Henry Halleck]] from the Western Theater of the war to take command as general-in-chief of the army. Shortly thereafter, Lincoln asked [[Ambrose Burnside]] to replace McClellan as commander of the Army of the Potomac, but Burnside, who was close friends with McClellan, declined the post.<ref>White (2009), pp. 496\u2013497.</ref> Pope's forces moved South towards Richmond, and in late August, the Army of Virginia met the Confederate army in the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], which was another major Union defeat.

The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Nevins vol 6 pp. 318\u2013322</ref> After the 1862 mid-term elections, Lincoln, frustrated with McClellan's continued inactivity, replaced McClellan with Burnside.<ref>White (2009), pp. 518\u2013521.</ref>\n\nAgainst the advice of the president, Burnside prematurely launched an offensive across the [[Rappahannock River]] and was stunningly defeated by Lee at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg.<ref>Donald (1996), pp. 429\u2013431.</ref> The defeat also amplified the criticisms of Radical Republicans such as Lyman Trumbull and [[Benjamin Wade]], who believed that Lincoln had mishandled the war, particularly with regards to his selection of generals.<ref>White (2009), pp. 525\u2013527.</ref>\n\n====Gettysburg Campaign====\n{{Further|Gettysburg campaign|Gettysburg Address}}\n{{Quote box\n|title = The [[Gettysburg Address]]\n|quote    =  \"Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

In April 1863, Hooker began his offensive towards Richmond, and his army encountered Lee's at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. Despite possessing a larger army, the Union suffered another major loss at Chancellorsville, though the Confederates also suffered a high number of casualties, including the death of General [[Stonewall Jackson]].<ref>White (2009), pp. 557\u2013561.</ref> Following the Confederate victory, Lee decided to take the offensive, launching the [[Gettysburg campaign]] in June 1863. Lee hoped that Confederate victories in the offensive would empower Lincoln's political opponents and convince the North that the Union could not win the war. After Hooker failed to stop Lee in the early stages of his advance, Lincoln replaced Hooker with General [[George Meade]]. Lee led his army into Pennsylvania, and was followed by Meade's Army of the Potomac. While many in the North fretted over Lee's advance, Lincoln saw the offensive as an opportunity to destroy a Confederate army.<ref>White (2009), pp. 571\u2013576.</ref>\n\nThe Confederate and Union armies met at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] on July 1. The battle, fought over three days, resulted in the highest number of casualties in the war. Along with the Union victory in the [[Siege of Vicksburg]], the Battle of Gettysburg is often referred to as a turning point in the war. Though the battle ended with a Confederate retreat, Lincoln was dismayed that Meade had failed to destroy Lee's army. Feeling that Meade was a competent commander despite his failure to pursue Lee, Lincoln allowed Meade to remain in command of the Army of the Potomac. The Eastern Theater would be locked in a stalemate for the remainder of 1863.<ref>White (2009), pp. 576\u2013581.</ref>\n\nIn November 1863, Lincoln was invited to Gettysburg to dedicate the first national cemetery and honor the soldiers who had fallen. His Gettysburg Address became a core statement of American political values. Defying Lincoln's prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.<ref name=\"Bulla\">Bulla (2010), p. 222.</ref> In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, following ratification of the [[United States Constitution]], but with the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. He defined the war as an effort dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".

Seward]], [[Montgomery Blair]] and [[Edward Bates]]]]\n\n===Early actions on slavery===\nThroughout the first year and a half of his presidency, Lincoln made it clear that the North was fighting the war to preserve the Union and not to end slavery. Though unwilling to publicly declare the abolition of slavery as a war goal, Lincoln considered various plans that would provide for the eventual abolition of slavery and explored the idea of compensated emancipation, including one proposed test case which would have seen all Delaware slaves freed by 1872.<ref>White (2009), pp. 458\u2013459.</ref> He also met with [[Fredrick Douglass]] and other black leaders, discussing the possibility of a colonization project in [[Central America]].<ref>White (2009), pp. 509\u2013511.</ref> Abolitionists criticized Lincoln for his slowness in moving from his initial position of non-interference with slavery to one of emancipation. In an August 1862 letter to anti-slavery journalist [[Horace Greeley]], Lincoln explained:\n{{quote|I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be \"the Union as it was\". ... My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that.<ref>[http://showcase.netins.net/web/creative/lincoln/speeches/greeley.htm Letter to Horace Greeley], August 22, 1862.</ref>}}\n\nAs the Civil War continued, freeing the slaves became an important wartime measure for weakening the rebellion by destroying the economic base of its leadership class. In August 1861, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1861]], which authorized court proceedings to confiscate the slaves of anyone who participated in or aided the Confederate war effort. The act however, did not specify whether the slaves were free.<ref>McPherson (1988), p. 356</ref> In April 1862, Lincoln signed a law abolishing slavery in Washington, D.C., and, in June, he signed another law abolishing slavery in all federal territories. The following month, Lincoln signed the [[Confiscation Act of 1862]], which declared that all Confederate slaves taking refuge behind Union lines were to be set free.<ref>White (2009), pp. 492\u2013493.</ref>\n\n===Emancipation Proclamation===\n{{Main|Emancipation Proclamation}}\n\nUnion victories in 1861 and 1862 secured the border states, which in turn freed Lincoln's hand to pursue more aggressive anti-slavery policies.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 125\u2013126</ref> Additionally, many Northerners came to support abolition during the war due to the influence of religious leaders like [[Henry Ward Beecher]] and journalists like Horace Greeley.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 144\u2013145</ref> The same month that Lincoln signed the Second Confiscation Act, he also privately decided that he would pursue emancipation as a war goal. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln read to his cabinet a preliminary draft of a proclamation calling for emancipation of all slaves in the Confederacy. As the Union had suffered several defeats in the early part of the war, Seward convinced Lincoln to announce this emancipation plan after a significant Union victory so that it would not seem like a move of desperation.<ref>White (2009), pp. 495\u2013496.</ref> Lincoln was forced to wait several months until the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam.<ref>White (2009), pp. 516\u2013517.</ref>\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation, announced on September 22 and put in effect January 1, 1863, applied in the eleven states that were still in rebellion in 1863. The proclamation did not cover the nearly 500,000 slaves in the slave-holding border states that had remained in the Union, nor did it apply to Tennessee or West Virginia, both of which were largely under the control of Union forces.<ref>{{cite book|author=Freedmen and Southern Society Project|title=Freedom: a documentary history of emancipation 1861\u20131867 : selected from the holdings of the National Archives of the United States.

Louisiana, which had a larger slave population than other Confederate state occupied early in the war, became the center of discussion regarding Reconstruction under Lincoln and military governor [[Benjamin Butler]].<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 238\u2013239</ref> Butler and his successor, [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], implemented a labor system in which free blacks worked as laborers on white-owned plantations. This model, which paid blacks wages but also represented a continuation of plantation agriculture, was adopted throughout much of the occupied South.<ref>Foner (1988), pp. 55\u201360</ref> Banks also presided over the ratification of a new state constitution that banned slavery, but did not guarantee free blacks the right to vote.<ref>Foner (1988), pp. 48\u201350</ref>\n\nAfter 1862, Democrats like [[Reverdy Johnson]] sought the withdrawal of the Emancipation Proclamation and amnesty for the Confederates. By contrast, Radical Republicans like Sumner argued that rebel Southerners had lost all rights by attempting to secede from the Union. In his [[ten percent plan]], Lincoln sought to find a middle ground, calling for the emancipation of Confederate slaves and the re-integration of Southern states once ten percent of voters in a state took an oath of allegiance to the U.S. and pledged to respect emancipation.<ref>White (2009), pp. 611\u2013613.</ref> Radical Republicans countered with the [[Wade\u2013Davis Bill]], a Reconstruction plan that included protections for the rights of freed African Americans and required fifty percent of voters to swear the \"[[Ironclad Oath]]\" indicating that they had never and never would support a rebellion against the United States. As the Wade\u2013Davis Bill interfered with Lincoln's plans for the readmission of Louisiana and Arkansas, Lincoln [[pocket veto]]ed the bill in late 1864.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 280\u2013282</ref>\n\n[[File:Lincoln and Johnsond.jpg|alt=Cartoon of Lincoln and Johnson attempting to stitch up the broken Union|thumb|A political cartoon of Vice President Andrew Johnson (a former tailor) and Lincoln, 1865, entitled ''The 'Rail Splitter' At Work Repairing the Union''.

Many in Congress sought far-reaching reforms to Southern society that went beyond the abolition of slavery, and they refused to recognize Lincoln's reconstituted Southern governments. Disagreements within Congress prevented the passage of any Reconstruction bill or the recognition of governments in Arkansas and Louisiana.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 302\u2013303</ref> As the war came to a close, Lincoln indicated an openness to some of the proposals of the Radical Republicans, and he signed a bill creating the [[Freedmen's Bureau]].<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 306\u2013309</ref> Established as a temporary institution, the Freedmen's Bureau was designed to provide food and other supplies to free blacks in the South, and was also authorized to grant confiscated land to former slaves.<ref>Foner (1988), pp. 68\u201369</ref> Lincoln did not take a definitive stand on [[black suffrage]], stating only that \"very intelligent blacks\" and those that had served in the military should be granted the right to vote.<ref>White (2009), pp. 671\u2013672.</ref>\n\nHistorian [[Eric Foner]] notes that no one knows what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction had he served out his second term, but writes,\n{{Quote|Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that the voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates.

Rather than waiting for the [[39th United States Congress|39th Congress]] to convene in March, Lincoln pressed the lame duck session of the [[38th United States Congress|38th Congress]] to ratify the Thirteenth Amendment as soon as possible. After an extensive lobbying campaign by Lincoln and Seward, the House narrowly cleared the two-thirds threshold in a 119-56 vote.<ref name=\"White 2009, pp. 653\u2013654\"/> The Thirteenth Amendment was sent to the states for ratification, and Secretary of State Seward proclaimed its adoption on December 18, 1865.

These tariff acts raised import duties considerably compared to previous tariff rates, and they were designed to both raise revenue and protect domestic manufacturing against foreign competition. During the war, the tariff also helped manufacturers off-set the burden of new taxes.

Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates.<ref name=\"Donald 1996, p. 471\"/>\n\n===Domestic dissent and Confederate sympathizers===\n{{see also|Opposition to the American Civil War|American Civil War spies}}\n\nIn the aftermath of the attack on Fort Sumter, Lincoln suspended habeas corpus and began to imprison suspected Confederate sympathizers. In 1861, Seward set up a special office in the State Department designed to monitor internal security, and the federal government and local police officers worked together to suppress those suspected of actively supporting the Confederacy.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 70\u201375</ref> Among those imprisoned was [[John Merryman]], an officer of the Maryland militia who had cut telegraph lines leading to Washington. In the subsequent case of ''[[Ex parte Merryman]],'' Chief Justice Taney asserted that only Congress had the right to suspend habeas corpus. In a message to Congress delivered in July 1861, Lincoln responded by arguing that his actions had been constitutional and necessary given the threat posed by the Confederacy.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 75\u201378</ref> Congress later passed the [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act 1863]], which provided congressional authorization to the president to suspend habeas corpus and placed limits on the administration's ability to indefinitely hold prisoners.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 191\u2013192</ref>\n\nAs the war continued, many in the North came to resist the sacrifices required by the war, and recruiting declined.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 190\u2013191</ref> After state and local efforts failed to furnish the troops necessary for the war, Congress instituted a draft through passage of the March 1863 Enrollment Act. The conscription act included various exemptions and allowed potential draftees to pay for substitutes, but it nonetheless proved unpopular in many communities and among many state and local leaders.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 192\u2013195</ref> Opposition to the draft was especially strong among [[Irish Americans|Irish American]]s, urban laborers, and others who could not afford to pay for substitutes. The [[New York City draft riots]] of July 1863 saw mobs attack soldiers, policemen, and African Americans, and was only subdued after Lincoln diverted soldiers from the Gettysburg Campaign. Rejecting calls to institute martial law in the city, Lincoln appointed [[John Adams Dix]] to oversee New York City, and Dix allowed the city hold civilian trials on those who had participated in the riots.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 213\u2013214</ref>\n\n[[Clement Vallandigham]], a Copperhead Democrat from Ohio, emerged as one of the most prominent critics of the war. General Ambrose Burnside arrested Vallandigham in May 1863 after the latter strongly criticized the draft and other wartime policies. A military commission subsequently sentenced Vallandigham to imprisonment until the end of the war, but Lincoln intervened to have Vallandigham released into Confederate territory. Ohio Democrats nonetheless nominated Vallandigham for governor in June 1863.<ref>Paludan (1993), p. 199</ref> Vallandigham's defeat in the 1863 election, along with Democratic electoral defeats elsewhere in 1863, represented a major victory for Lincoln and the Republicans as it signified public support for the war.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 226\u2013227</ref>\n\n===Conflicts with Native Americans===\n{{Further|Native Americans in the American Civil War}}\n\nConflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] on the [[American frontier]] continued during the Civil War, as American settlers continued to push west.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 117\u2013118</ref> In 1862, Lincoln sent General Pope to put down the \"[[Dakota War of 1862|Sioux Uprising]]\" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted [[Sioux#Santee (Is\u00e1\u014byathi or Eastern Dakota)|Santee Dakota]] who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).<ref>Cox, p. 182.</ref> In his final two [[State of the Union|annual messages to Congress]] Lincoln called for reform of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and federal Indian policy. However, as the war to preserve the Union was Lincoln's primary concern, he simply allowed the system to function unchanged for the balance of his presidency.<ref>Nichols, pp. 207\u2013232.</ref>\n\n===States admitted to the Union===\n{{Further|Nevada in the American Civil War|West Virginia in the American Civil War}}\n\nTwo new states were [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] while Lincoln was in office. The first such state, West Virginia, had been part of Virginia before the start of the American Civil War. In the June 1861 Wheeling Convention, delegates from several counties in western Virginia formed the [[Restored Government of Virginia]], ostensibly as the legitimate government of Virginia. In the following year, the people of West Virginia voted to secede from Virginia, and a new state constitution was written.<ref>Paludan (1993), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> Despite the opposition of some cabinet members who believed that the partition of Virginia posed constitutional issues, Lincoln decided to support the actions of West Virginia Unionists and he signed a bill admitting West Virginia as a state.<ref name=\"Paludan 1993, pp. 111\u2013112\"/> West Virginia was admitted to the union on June 20, 1863.<ref>{{cite web|title=Today in History - June 20: Mountaineers Always Freemen|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jun20.html|website=loc.gov|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref> Later, through its ruling in the 1871 case of ''[[Virginia v.

Nebraska's constitutional convention voted against statehood, while voters in Colorado rejected the proposed state constitution, so of those three territories, only [[Nevada]] became a state during Lincoln's presidency.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Colorado History|edition=10th|last1=Benson|first1=Maxine|last2=Smith|first2=Duane A.|last3=Ubbelohde|pages=145\u2013148|isbn=978-0-87108-323-4|url= https://books.google.com/?id=g9ctCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=Enabling+acts+for+three+territories,+Colorado,+Nebraska,+and+Nevada#v=onepage|series= The Pruett Series|date=4 December 2015|publisher=WestWinds Press An imprint of Graph Arts Books|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Civil War history and the birth of Nevada|publisher=Elko Daily Free Press|location=Elko, Nevada|date=April 14, 2011|url=http://elkodaily.com/news/opinion/civil-war-history-and-the-birth-of-nevada/article_40b07c92-670c-11e0-a8fd-001cc4c002e0.html|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}</ref> It did so on October 31, 1864.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nevada Statehood|encyclopedia=The Online Nevada Encyclopedia|publisher=Nevada Humanities|url=http://www.onlinenevada.org/articles/nevada-statehood|date=October 21, 2009|last=Edwards|first=Jerome|accessdate=February 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Foreign policy==\n{{Further|Diplomacy of the American Civil War|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1861\u20131897}}\n\nThe U.S. and the CSA both recognized the potential importance of foreign powers in the Civil War, as a European intervention could greatly aid the Confederate cause, much as [[France|French]] intervention in the [[American Revolutionary War]] had helped the United States gain its independence.<ref>Herring, pp. 226-227</ref> At the start of the war, [[Russia]] was the lone [[great power]] to offer full support to the Union, while the other European powers had varying degrees of sympathy for the Confederacy.<ref>Herring, pp. 228-229</ref> Nonetheless, foreign nations were officially neutral throughout the Civil War, and none recognized the Confederacy, marking a major diplomatic achievement for Secretary Seward and the Lincoln Administration.\n\nAlthough they remained out of the war, the European powers, especially France and [[United Kingdom|Britain]], factored into the American Civil War in various ways. European leaders saw the division of the United States as having the potential to eliminate, or at least greatly weaken, a growing rival. They looked for ways to exploit the inability of the U.S. to enforce the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. [[Spain]] invaded the [[Dominican Republic]] in 1861, while France established a puppet regime in [[Mexico]].<ref>Herring, pp. 224-229</ref> However, many in Europe also hoped for a quick end to the civil war, for both humanitarian purposes and due to the economic disruption caused by the war.<ref>Herring, pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nLincoln's foreign policy was deficient in 1861 in terms of appealing to European public opinion. The European aristocracy (the dominant factor in every major country) was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed.\" Diplomats had to explain that United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead they repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate spokesman, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy.<ref name=\"donhdoyle1\">Don H. Doyle,  ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War '' (2014) pp 8 (quote), 69-70</ref> However, the Confederacy's hope that cotton exports would compel European interference did not come to fruition, as Britain found alternative sources of cotton and experienced economic growth in industries that did not rely on cotton.<ref>Herring, pp. 235-236</ref> Though the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation did not immediately end the possibility of European intervention, it rallied European public opinion to the Union by adding abolition as a Northern war goal. Any chance of a European intervention in the war ended with the Union victories at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, as European leaders came to believe that the Confederate cause was doomed.<ref>Herring, pp. 242-246</ref>\n\n===Britain===\n{{Further|United Kingdom and the American Civil War}}\n\nElite opinion in Britain tended to favor the Confederacy, but public opinion tended to favor the United States. Large scale trade continued in both directions with the United States, with the Americans shipping grain to Britain while Britain exported manufactured items and munitions. British trade with the Confederacy was limited, with a trickle of cotton going to Britain and some munitions slipped in by numerous small blockade runners.<ref name=\"hjones\"/> The British textile industry depended on cotton from the South, but it had stocks to keep the mills operating for a year and in any case the industrialists and workers carried little weight in British politics.<ref>Kinley J. Brauer, \"British Mediation and the American Civil War: A Reconsideration,\" ''Journal of Southern History,'' (1972) 38#1 pp.&nbsp;49\u201364 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2206653 in JSTOR]</ref> With the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in September 1862, the Civil War became a war against slavery that most British supported.<ref name=\"hjones\">Howard Jones, ''Abraham Lincoln and a New Birth of Freedom: the Union and Slavery in the Diplomacy of the Civil War,'' (1999)</ref>\n\nA serious diplomatic dispute between the U.S. and Great Britain arose late in 1861. The Union Navy intercepted a British mail ship, the ''Trent'', on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys ''en route'' to Europe. The incident aroused public outrage in Britain; the government of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] protested vehemently, while the American public cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis, known as the [[Trent Affair]], by releasing the two diplomats, who had been seized illegally.<ref>Stahr (2012) pp. 307-323.</ref>\n\nBritish financiers built and operated most of the [[Blockade runners of the American Civil War|blockade runner]]s, spending hundreds of millions of pounds on them; but that was legal and not the cause of serious tension. They were staffed by sailors and officers on leave from the Royal Navy. When the U.S. Navy captured one of the fast blockade runners, it sold the ship and cargo as prize money for the American sailors, then released the crew. A British shipyard, [[Cammell Laird|John Laird and Sons]], built two warships for the Confederacy, including the [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], over vehement protests from the United States. The controversy would ultimately be resolved after the Civil War in the form of the [[Alabama Claims]], in which the United States finally was given $15.5 million in arbitration by an international tribunal for damages caused by British-built warships.<ref>Frank J. Merli,  ''The Alabama, British Neutrality, and the American Civil War.'' (2004)</ref>\n\n===France===\n{{Further|France and the American Civil War}}\n\nEmperor [[Napoleon III]] of France sought to re-establish a French empire in North America, with Mexico at the center of an empire that he hoped would eventually include a canal across [[Central America]]. In December 1861, France [[French intervention in Mexico|invaded]] Mexico. While the official justification was the collection of debts, France eventually established a puppet state under the rule of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]]. In October 1862, fearing that a re-unified United States would threaten his restored French empire, Napoleon III proposed an armistice and joint mediation of the American Civil War by France, Britain, and Russia. However, this proposal was declined by the other European powers, who feared alienating the North. Napoleon's bellicose stance towards Russia in the 1863 [[January Uprising]] divided the powers and greatly diminished any chance of a joint European intervention.<ref>Herring, pp. 225, 243-244</ref> The United States refused to recognize Maximilian's government and threatened to drive France out of the country by force, but did not become directly involved in the conflict even as Mexican resistance to Maximilian's rule grew. With the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the U.S. increased pressure on France to withdraw from Mexico, and the French presence in the Western hemisphere would be a major foreign policy issue for Lincoln's successor.<ref>Herring, pp. 252-253</ref>\n\n==Assassination==\n\n{{Main|Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|Funeral and burial of Abraham Lincoln}}\n[[File:The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln by Alonzo Chappel, 1868.jpg|thumb|380px|''The Last Hours of Abraham Lincoln'', designed by John B.

They hoped to revive the Confederate cause by creating chaos through destabilizing the federal government. Although Booth succeeded in killing Lincoln, the larger plot failed.

With the failure of the plot to assassinate Johnson, Johnson succeeded Lincoln, becoming the 17th President of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/presidents/andrew-johnson/|title=Andrew Johnson|website=The White House|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nLincoln's body [[Lying in state|lay in state]] in the [[East Room]] of the White House and then in the [[United States Capitol rotunda|Capitol Rotunda]] through April 21, when his coffin was taken to the [[New Jersey Avenue Station|B&O Station]].<ref>{{cite web| title=The Lincoln Catafalque at the U.S. Capitol| date=April 15, 2015| last=Wolanin| first=Barbara| url=https://www.aoc.gov/blog/lincoln-catafalque-us-capitol| publisher=Architect of the Capitol| location=Washington, D.C.| accessdate=April 21, 2017}}</ref> Funeral services were held in Washington, D.C., and then at additional locations as the [[funeral train]] retraced, with a few alterations, Lincoln's {{convert|1654|mi|km}} 1861 journey as president-elect.<ref>{{cite web| title=President Abraham Lincoln's White House Funeral| url=http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/education/whfuneral.htm| publisher=Abraham Lincoln Online| accessdate=April 21, 2017}}</ref> He was buried at [[Oak Ridge Cemetery]] in Springfield on May 4.\n\n==Historical reputation and legacy==\n\n{{see also|Abraham Lincoln cultural depictions}}\n[[File:Head of Abraham Lincoln at Mount Rushmore.jpg|thumb|Lincoln's image is carved into the stone of [[Mount Rushmore]].]]\n\nIn [[Historical rankings of Presidents of the United States|surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents]]<!--Lincoln is first in 9 of 17 on that page--> conducted since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one.<ref name=\"Ranking Our Presidents\">[http://history-world.org/pres.pdf \"Ranking Our Presidents\"].

As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself.\"<ref>Diggins, p. 307.</ref> His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms.<ref>Foner (2010), p. 215.</ref> Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state.<ref>Jaffa, p. 263.</ref> Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.<ref>Orville Vernon Burton, ''The Age of Lincoln'' (2008) p 243</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book| ref= harv |last=Anderson |first= Bern|title=By Sea and By River: The naval history of the Civil War |publisher= Da Capo Press|year= 1989|location= New York, New York |isbn= 978-0-306-80367-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hoCK_yzA8xkC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n*{{Cite journal|first=Roy P.|last=Basler|title=Abraham Lincoln: His Speeches and Writings|year=1946}}\n*{{Cite book|first=Roy P.|last=Basler|title=Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln (9 vols.)|location=[[New Brunswick, New Jersey|New Brunswick, NJ]]|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|year=1953}}\n*{{cite book| last=Burlingame| first=Michael| authorlink=Michael Burlingame (historian)| title=Abraham Lincoln: A Life.| volume=vol. 1| date=2008| isbn=978-0-8018-8993-6|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}\n*Current, Richard N.

In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

The ''Kickoff'' pre-show began as a 30-minute show<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/extremerules/2014/extreme-rules-on-wwe-network-26270262|title=Extreme Rules 2014|publisher=}}</ref> before expanding to 1 hour, beginning with [[Night of Champions (2014)|Night of Champions]] in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Night of Champions 2014|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nightofchampions/2014/christian-peep-show-kickoff-26656371|publisher=WWE}}</ref> The \"Big Four\" ''Kickoff'' shows are the longest, at 2 hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=LL Cool J To Open WrestleMania, 2-Hour ''Kickoff'' Show - SEScoops|url=http://www.sescoops.com/ll-cool-jay-to-open-wrestlemania-31-2-hour-kickoff-show/|date=16 March 2015|publisher=}}</ref> WWE occasionally airs a post-show after some Network events.

Each TakeOver pre-show includes interviews and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up.

In 2019, the [[WrestleMania 35|35th]] edition took place at [[MetLife Stadium]] and attracted 82,265 spectators.]]\n\nThis is a '''list of WWE pay-per-view and WWE Network events''', detailing all [[professional wrestling]] cards promoted on [[pay-per-view]] (PPV) and the [[WWE Network]] by [[WWE]].\n\nWWE has been broadcasting PPV events since the 1980s, when its classic \"Big Four\" events ([[Royal Rumble]], [[WrestleMania]], [[SummerSlam]], and [[Survivor Series]]) were first established. The company's PPV lineup expanded to a monthly basis in the mid-1990s before expanding even further in the early-2000s. Aside from its standard monthly schedule, WWE produced additional international PPVs between 1997 and 2003. These events were not available in the United States and coincided with overseas tours in the United Kingdom. Following WWE's original [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] in 2002, the company promoted two touring rosters representing its [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] television programs. The traditional \"Big Four\" continued to showcase the entire roster, while the remaining PPV events alternated between Raw and SmackDown cards. A special [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] PPV in 2005 led to the creation of an [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW brand]] in 2006, which also received its own dedicated PPV events. In March 2007, WWE announced that all subsequent PPV events would feature performers from all brands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |accessdate=December 1, 2007 |title=WWE Pay-Per-Views to follow WrestleMania formula |publisher=WWE |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319234707/http://corporate.wwe.com/news/2007/2007_03_14.jsp |archivedate=March 19, 2007 |df= }}</ref> In 2008, all WWE PPV events began broadcasting in [[High-definition television|high-definition]].\n\nThe company's PPV business began to drastically change with the launch of the WWE Network on February 24, 2014. While most of the WWE events still air in many parts of the world on traditional PPV channels, WWE's focus has shifted away from delivering their events on PPV channels. Their main focus now is delivering all of the events on the WWE Network, including some that are exclusively on the Network. WWE has pushed the Network's launching price of [[United States dollar|US$]]9.99 monthly<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/wwenetwork|title=WWE Network Subscription - Free Trial|website=www.wwe.com}}</ref> as a way to lure potential customers away from traditional PPV which, on average, costs five to six times as much (in the United States) as the Network. The WWE Network also features the back catalog of WWE, [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]], and ECW PPV events, as well as all WWE Network exclusive events from [[NXT Arrival]] onwards in their on-demand section. All WWE Network events that have aired since the launch of the Network have been broadcast in high-definition.<ref name=LATIMES>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-wwe-network-20140108,0,2623775.story#axzz2ps4J4oVv|title=WWE launching over-the-top network|last=Flint|first=Joe|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 8, 2014|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref> Since the second brand extension in July 2016, brand-exclusive PPVs returned with only the \"Big Four\" as the only PPVs to feature both Raw and SmackDown brands. Just like the previous brand extension, brand exclusive PPVs ended after [[WrestleMania 34]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wwe.com/article/wwe-2018-pay-per-view-schedule|title=WWE pay-per-views just got bigger for 2018!|work=WWE|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the WWE Network, WWE PPVs are still made available on traditional PPV outlets in the United States by [[In Demand]]. In Canada, WWE PPVs are available through (depending on service provider) [[Vu!]], [[Shaw PPV]], or [[SaskTel|SaskTel PPV]], and can be seen in movie theatres in HD through selected locations of the [[Cineplex Entertainment]] chain, a practice dating to the [[Famous Players]] ownership by [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]. In Australia, WWE's pay-per-views are shown on [[Main Event]]. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, all PPVs are shown on Sky Sports Box Office. In India and South Asia, a single broadcaster (currently [[Sony TEN]]) generally holds the rights to all WWE programming,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222151034/http://www.wwe.com/schedules/television/india |archivedate=December 22, 2015 |df= }}</ref> including PPVs, and they are broadcast for no additional charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/howtowatch|title=WWE.com: The Official Site of the WWE Universe|author=|date=|work=WWE}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, WWE PPV events are typically 3\u00bd hours to 4 hours in length, while WWE's WrestleMania events are approximately 5 to 5\u00bd hours in length.

Each TakeOver pre-show includes interviews and a panel of experts previewing the upcoming line-up.

The blowpipe is being held in the glassblower's left hand. The glass is glowing yellow.]]\n\n'''Glassblowing''' is a glassforming technique that involves inflating molten [[glass]] into a bubble (or parison) with the aid of a [[Blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] (or blow tube). A person who blows glass is called a ''glassblower'', ''glassmith'', or ''gaffer''. A ''[[lampworking|lampworker]]'' (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of [[borosilicate glass]].\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Principles===\nAs a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the 1st century BC, glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network,<ref name=\"Frank\">Frank, S 1982. Glass and Archaeology.

With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from [[Sepphoris]] of Israel, Fischer and McCray<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0398|title=Glass Production Activities as Practiced at Sepphoris, Israel (37 ?\u2013? 1516)|year=1999|last1=Fischer|first1=A|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|pages=893|issue=8|last2=McGray|first2=W.Patrick}}</ref> postulated that the concentration of [[natron]], which acts as [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.\n\nDuring blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers.\n\nA full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing.\n\n====Free-blowing====\n[[File:Glassblowing demo at Norcal Ren Faire 2010-09-19 20.JPG|alt=Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010|thumb|Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010]]\nThis method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a \"gather\" which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.<ref name=\"Cummings\"/><ref name=\"Mariacher\">{{cite book|last1=Mariacher|first1=G|title=Glass: from Antiquity to the Renaissance|isbn=0600012506|date=1970|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=Middlesex|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gothicilluminate00coen}} (apparently out of print)</ref><ref name=\"Zerwick\">{{cite book|author1=Chloe Zerwick|author2=Corning Museum of Glass|title=A short history of glass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1ZQAAAAMAAJ|date=May 1990|publisher=H.N.

They can produce a great variety of glass objects, ranging from drinking cups to window glass.\n\nAn outstanding example of the free-blowing technique is the [[Portland Vase]], which is a cameo manufactured during the Roman period. An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse<ref name=\"Gudnerath\">{{cite journal |last1=Gudenrath |first1=W. |last2=Whitehouse |first2=D. |year=1990 |title= The Manufacture of the Vase of its Ancient Repair |journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume= 32 |pages= 108\u2013121 |jstor=24188035}}</ref> with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass.

The glass is then left to \"fine out\" (allowing the [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around {{convert|2000|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between {{convert|1600|and|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|order=flip}}, \"soda-lime\" glass remains somewhat plastic and workable at as low as {{convert|1350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Annealing is usually done between {{convert|700|and|900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|order=flip}}.\n\n{{anchor|glory hole|lehr|annealer}}\nGlassblowing involves three [[furnace]]s. The first, which contains a [[crucible]] of molten glass, is simply referred to as \"the furnace\". The second is called the \"glory hole\", and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the \"lehr\" or \"annealer\", and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to [[thermal stress]]. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.\n\n{{anchor|punty|pontil|blowpipe|marver}}\nThe major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), ''punty'' (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.\n\nThe tip of the [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is \"gathered\" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous honey is picked up on a [[honey dipper]]. This glass is then rolled on the [[marver]], which was traditionally a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called \"marvering\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153111/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/269.html Marvering]. glassonline.com</ref> forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a \"punty\"  for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and to finalize the top.\n\nThe ''bench'' is a glassblower's workstation, and has a place for the glassblower to sit, a place for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. ''Blocks'' are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked [[fruitwood]], and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation.  In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly {{cvt|6|in|cm|order=flip}} square, {{convert|0.5|to|1|in|cm|order=flip}} thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece.  ''Jacks'' are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. ''Paddles'' are flat pieces of wood or [[graphite]] used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.\n\nThere are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called \"[[frit]]\". Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of [[caneworking|cane]] (rods of colored glass) and [[murrine]] (rods cut in cross-sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then \"picked up\" by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is \"reticello\", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.\n\n[[lampworking|Lampworker]]s, usually operating on a much smaller scale, historically used alcohol lamps and breath- or [[bellows]]-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as [[laboratory glassware]], beads, and durable scientific \"specimens\"\u2014miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by [[Hans Godo Frabel]] (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today.

Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists studios([http://www.handblownglass.com/Modern-Hand-Blown-Glass]).

Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.\n\nWorking with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex [[choreography]] of precisely timed movements.

A person who blows glass is called a ''glassblower'', ''glassmith'', or ''gaffer''. A ''[[lampworking|lampworker]]'' (often also called a glassblower or glassworker) manipulates glass with the use of a torch on a smaller scale, such as in producing precision laboratory glassware out of [[borosilicate glass]].\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Principles===\nAs a novel glass forming technique created in the middle of the 1st century BC, glassblowing exploited a working property of glass that was previously unknown to glassworkers; inflation, which is the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network,<ref name=\"Frank\">Frank, S 1982. Glass and Archaeology.

With reference to their studies of the ancient glass assemblages from [[Sepphoris]] of Israel, Fischer and McCray<ref name=\"Fischer\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1006/jasc.1999.0398|title=Glass Production Activities as Practiced at Sepphoris, Israel (37 ?\u2013? 1516)|year=1999|last1=Fischer|first1=A|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=26|pages=893|issue=8|last2=McGray|first2=W.Patrick}}</ref> postulated that the concentration of [[natron]], which acts as [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in glass, is slightly lower in blown vessels than those manufactured by casting. Lower concentration of natron would have allowed the glass to be stiffer for blowing.\n\nDuring blowing, thinner layers of glass cool faster than thicker ones and become more viscous than the thicker layers. That allows production of blown glass with uniform thickness instead of causing blow-through of the thinned layers.\n\nA full range of glassblowing techniques was developed within decades of its invention.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The two major methods of glassblowing are free-blowing and mold-blowing.\n\n====Free-blowing====\n[[File:Glassblowing demo at Norcal Ren Faire 2010-09-19 20.JPG|alt=Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010|thumb|Glassblowing demo at North California Renaissance Fair in 2010]]\nThis method held a pre-eminent position in glassforming ever since its introduction in the middle of the 1st century BC until the late 19th century, and is still widely used as a glassforming technique, especially for artistic purposes. The process of free-blowing involves the blowing of short puffs of air into a molten portion of glass called a \"gather\" which has been spooled at one end of the blowpipe. This has the effect of forming an elastic skin on the interior of the glass blob that matches the exterior skin caused by the removal of heat from the furnace. The glassworker can then quickly inflate the molten glass to a coherent blob and work it into a desired shape.<ref name=\"Cummings\"/><ref name=\"Mariacher\">{{cite book|last1=Mariacher|first1=G|title=Glass: from Antiquity to the Renaissance|isbn=0600012506|date=1970|publisher=The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=Middlesex|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/gothicilluminate00coen}} (apparently out of print)</ref><ref name=\"Zerwick\">{{cite book|author1=Chloe Zerwick|author2=Corning Museum of Glass|title=A short history of glass|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G1ZQAAAAMAAJ|date=May 1990|publisher=H.N.

An experiment was carried out by Gudenrath and Whitehouse<ref name=\"Gudnerath\">{{cite journal |last1=Gudenrath |first1=W. |last2=Whitehouse |first2=D. |year=1990 |title= The Manufacture of the Vase of its Ancient Repair |journal=Journal of Glass Studies |volume= 32 |pages= 108\u2013121 |jstor=24188035}}</ref> with the aim of re-creating the Portland Vase. A full amount of blue glass required for the body of the vase was gathered on the end of the blowpipe and was subsequently dipped into a pot of hot white glass.

The glass is then left to \"fine out\" (allowing the [[liquid bubble|bubbles]] to rise out of the mass), and then the working temperature is reduced in the furnace to around {{convert|2000|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. At this stage, the glass appears to be a bright orange color. Though most glassblowing is done between {{convert|1600|and|1900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|order=flip}}, \"soda-lime\" glass remains somewhat plastic and workable at as low as {{convert|1350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Annealing is usually done between {{convert|700|and|900|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|order=flip}}.\n\n{{anchor|glory hole|lehr|annealer}}\nGlassblowing involves three [[furnace]]s. The first, which contains a [[crucible]] of molten glass, is simply referred to as \"the furnace\". The second is called the \"glory hole\", and is used to reheat a piece in between steps of working with it. The final furnace is called the \"lehr\" or \"annealer\", and is used to slowly cool the glass, over a period of a few hours to a few days, depending on the size of the pieces. This keeps the glass from cracking or shattering due to [[thermal stress]]. Historically, all three furnaces were contained in one structure, with a set of progressively cooler chambers for each of the three purposes.\n\n{{anchor|punty|pontil|blowpipe|marver}}\nThe major tools used by a glassblower are the blowpipe (or blow tube), ''punty'' (or punty rod, pontil, or mandrel), bench, marver, blocks, jacks, paddles, tweezers, newspaper pads, and a variety of shears.\n\nThe tip of the [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] is first preheated; then dipped in the molten glass in the furnace. The molten glass is \"gathered\" onto the end of the blowpipe in much the same way that viscous honey is picked up on a [[honey dipper]]. This glass is then rolled on the [[marver]], which was traditionally a flat slab of marble, but today is more commonly a fairly thick flat sheet of steel. This process, called \"marvering\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100118153111/http://www.glassonline.com/infoserv/dictionary/269.html Marvering]. glassonline.com</ref> forms a cool skin on the exterior of the molten glass blob, and shapes it. Then air is blown into the pipe, creating a bubble. Next, the glassworker can gather more glass over that bubble to create a larger piece. Once a piece has been blown to its approximate final size, the bottom is finalized. Then, the molten glass is attached to a stainless steel or iron rod called a \"punty\"  for shaping and transferring the hollow piece from the blowpipe to provide an opening and to finalize the top.\n\nThe ''bench'' is a glassblower's workstation, and has a place for the glassblower to sit, a place for the handheld tools, and two rails that the pipe or punty rides on while the blower works with the piece. ''Blocks'' are ladle-like tools made from water-soaked [[fruitwood]], and are used similarly to the marver to shape and cool a piece in the early steps of creation.  In similar fashion, pads of water-soaked newspaper (roughly {{cvt|6|in|cm|order=flip}} square, {{convert|0.5|to|1|in|cm|order=flip}} thick), held in the bare hand, can be used to shape the piece.  ''Jacks'' are tools shaped somewhat like large tweezers with two blades, which are used for forming shape later in the creation of a piece. ''Paddles'' are flat pieces of wood or [[graphite]] used for creating flat spots such as a bottom. Tweezers are used to pick out details or to pull on the glass. There are two important types of shears, straight shears and diamond shears. Straight shears are essentially bulky scissors, used for making linear cuts. Diamond shears have blades that form a diamond shape when partially open. These are used for cutting off masses of glass.\n\nThere are many ways to apply patterns and color to blown glass, including rolling molten glass in powdered color or larger pieces of colored glass called \"[[frit]]\". Complex patterns with great detail can be created through the use of [[caneworking|cane]] (rods of colored glass) and [[murrine]] (rods cut in cross-sections to reveal patterns). These pieces of color can be arranged in a pattern on a flat surface, and then \"picked up\" by rolling a bubble of molten glass over them. One of the most exacting and complicated caneworking techniques is \"reticello\", which involves creating two bubbles from cane, each twisted in a different direction and then combining them and blowing out the final form.\n\n[[lampworking|Lampworker]]s, usually operating on a much smaller scale, historically used alcohol lamps and breath- or [[bellows]]-driven air to create a hot flame at a workbench to manipulate preformed glass rods and tubes. These stock materials took form as [[laboratory glassware]], beads, and durable scientific \"specimens\"\u2014miniature glass sculpture. The craft, which was raised to an art form in the late 1960s by [[Hans Godo Frabel]] (later followed by lampwork artists such as Milon Townsend and Robert Mickelson), is still practiced today. The modern lampworker uses a flame of oxygen and propane or natural gas. The modern torch permits working both the soft glass from the furnace worker and the [[borosilicate glass]] (low-expansion) of the [[scientific glassblowing|scientific glassblower]]. This latter worker may also have multiple headed torches and special [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]s to help form the glass or [[fused quartz]] used for special projects.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\n\nThe earliest evidence of glassblowing comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a [[mikvah]], a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of [[Jerusalem]], dated from 37 to 4 BC.<ref name=\"Stern\"/><ref name=\"Tattona\"/><ref name=\"Avigad\">Avigad, N (1983). ''Discovering Jerusalem''. Nashville. {{ISBN|0-8407-5299-7}}</ref> Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form of blowpipe.<ref name=\"Gudnerath\"/>\n\nHence, tube blowing not only represents the initial attempts of experimentation by glassworkers at blowing glass, it is also a revolutionary step that induced a change in conception and a deep understanding of glass.<ref name=\"Israeli\">Israeli, Y.

Littleton promoted the use of small furnaces in individual artists studios([http://www.handblownglass.com/Modern-Hand-Blown-Glass]). This approach to glassblowing blossomed into a worldwide movement, producing such flamboyant and prolific artists as [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Dante Marioni]], Fritz Driesbach and [[Marvin Lipofsky]] as well as [chronicglass] and scores of other modern glass artists. Today there are many different institutions around the world that offer glassmaking resources for training and sharing equipment.\n\nWorking with large or complex pieces requires a team of several glassworkers, in a complex [[choreography]] of precisely timed movements.  This practical requirement has encouraged collaboration among glass artists, in both semi-permanent and temporary working groups.\n\n===In literature===\nThe writer [[Daphne du Maurier]] was descended from a family of glass-blowers in 18th century France, and she wrote about her forebears in the 1963 [[historical novel]] ''The Glass-Blowers''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/382723.The_Glass_Blowers|title=The Glass-Blowers|website=www.goodreads.com}}</ref>\n\nThe subject of mystery novelist [[Donna Leon]]'s ''Through a Glass, Darkly'' is the investigation of a crime in a Venetian glassworks on the island of [[Murano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/donna-leon/through-a-glass-darkly/|title=THROUGH A GLASS DARKLY by Donna Leon - Kirkus Reviews|publisher=|via=www.kirkusreviews.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Angel gilding]]\n*[[Crown glass (window)]]\n*[[Flat glass]]\n*[[Fused glass|Glassfusing]]\n*[[Glass art]]\n*[[Glass beadmaking]]\n*[[Glass tiles]]\n*[[Glass sculpture]]\n*[[List of glass artists]]\n*[[Mosaic]]\n*[[Paperweight]]\n*[[Stained glass]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{curlie|Arts/Crafts/Glass/Blowing|Glassblowing}}\n*{{curlie|Arts/Crafts/Glass/Education|Glass Education}} contains additional glassblowing informational links\n*[http://www.ecu.edu/glassblowing/gb.htm Scientific Glassblowing Basics] a tutorial\n\n{{Glass forming}}\n{{Decorative arts}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:History of glass]]\n[[Category:Glass production]]\n[[Category:Glass art]]\n[[Category:Firing techniques]]\n", "name_user": "Temple29", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRecent developments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing"}
