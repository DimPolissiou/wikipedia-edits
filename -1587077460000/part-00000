The movement that eventually led to the project's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.\n\nThe dam was proposed for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been {{convert|180|MW}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/professor-west-reminds-tasmania-that-hydro-past-constrains-future/ |title=Professor West reminds Tasmania that hydro past constrains future |work=Tasmanian Times |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive [[Franklin River]], which joins the Gordon nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area]] register.\n\nThe campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the [[non-violent protest]]{{verify source|date=June 2015}} campaign against the building of three dams on [[Lake Pedder]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.\n\nIn December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer [[Peter Dombrovskis]], helped bring down the government of [[Malcolm Fraser]] at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. The new government, under [[Bob Hawke]], had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and [[Tasmanian Government]] followed, resulting in a landmark [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruling in the federal government's favour.<ref name=hca/>\n\n== Announcement of the plans ==\n{{Location map+ | Tasmania\n| caption = Original locations of the proposed dams in Tasmania\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n \u00a0{{Location map~ | Tasmania\n \u00a0 \u00a0| label = Gordon below Franklin \n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = -42.584\n    | lon_deg = 145.732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Dam #2\n    | position = right\n    | lat_deg = -42.376\n    | lon_deg = 145.757 }}\n}}\n\nIn 1978, the Tasmanian [[Hydro Electric Commission]] (HEC) announced intentions to construct the dam.

It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.\n\nHowever, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]], and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, [[Olegas Truchanas]], attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, ''The Last Wild River'', was shown on Tasmania's two commercial television stations.\n\nIn June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stephen  | first = Sarah  | title = 10th anniversary of the Franklin blockade  | magazine = Green Left Weekly  | issue= 80 | location = Sydney  | date = 18 November 1992  | url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2601 | accessdate = 9 August 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts at compromise ==\nThe [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] state government, under premier [[Doug Lowe (Australian politician)|Doug Lowe]], backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park|Wild Rivers National Park]]. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme.<ref>For maps of the proposed schemes see - Thompson, Peter (1981) ''Power In Tasmania'' ACF {{ISBN|0858020645}}  pp.36 noting the potential confusion for which schemes was what -''Integrated'' meant damming the King and Franklin as one, and the Lower Franklin and Oga rivers as the other.  ''Separate'' meant Gordon above the Olga, and The King  and Fraklin dammed the same as in the  Integrated scheme</ref> While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.\n\nIn July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative dominated Legislative Council then blocked the [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] government's 'Gordon-above-Olga' compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/history-franklin-river-campaign-1976-83|title=History of the Franklin River Campaign 1976-83 {{!}} The Wilderness Society|date=15 June 2001|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|access-date=13 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==\nIn 1981, [[Australian Democrats]] Senator [[Don Chipp]] initiated a Senate inquiry into \"the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world\" and \"the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance\".\n\nFrom early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years BP in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by [[geomorphology]] student Kevin Kieran in January 1977,<ref name =Griffiths/> and he first named it [[Fraser Cave]] by after the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]], because ''...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...'''.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_iceage_walktotasmania/index1.htm AUSTRALIA, An Ice Age - Walk to Tasmania]</ref> It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]].

In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" /> There had been a significant campaign for voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" />\n\nThe ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by [[Harry Holgate]], a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and [[Mary Willey]], another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. [[Norm Sanders]], an [[Australian Democrats]] MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]]. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== The campaigns broadens ==\nDuring 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states. The iconic \"No Dams\" triangle sticker was printed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.australiaforvisitors.com/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park.html | title=Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park | publisher=Australia for Visitors | date=2005\u20132011 | accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> Rallies and events were held in cities around Australia.  Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam's construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor [[David Bellamy]] addressed 5,000{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} people at a Melbourne rally.\n\nBy the end of 1982, any perception that \"greenies\" equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, [[Bob Brown]] and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet,<ref>The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column plugged this dinner a couple of days before.</ref><ref>Tim Lamble[?spelling] operated his programmed slide show with dual projectors fading in and out 35mm slides of Tasmanian wilderness photographs, set to recorded music.</ref> ABC's classical music radio station featured a \"Concert for the Franklin\", and electronics entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.\n\nIn the federal [[1982 Lowe by-election|Lowe by-election]] in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers<ref>Volunteers were co-opted from the Australian Conservation Foundation by the NSW South West Tasmania Committee.</ref> at every polling booth encouraged voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper, and 9% did so.<ref>Scrutineers issued this figure in a press release, suggesting a headline like \"Franklin River comes 3rd in by-election\". The following day's [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column reported this as 91% of voters refusing to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper.</ref> At that first 'Write-in' campaign, few people knew that they could write a message on their federal ballot paper without invalidating their vote.<ref>The federal law was that as long as additional writing on a ballot paper does not identify the voter or obscure their validly expressed intentions, then the vote remains valid.</ref> In the [[Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly|ACT House of Assembly]] mid-1982 election, 25% of voters wrote \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the federal Flinders by-election in Victoria in December 1982, 42% of voters wrote \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== Blockade ==\n[[Image:Rock island bend.jpg|300px|thumb|The photograph ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'', by [[Peter Dombrovskis]] was used by the [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] in advertising against the dam's construction ]]\nIn November 1982, the conflict stepped up a notch when Brown announced that a blockade of the dam site would begin on 14 December. On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at \"Warners Landing\" ({{coord|42|34|7|S|145|41|24|E|type:mountain_region:AU-TAS}}) drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in [[Hobart]] also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] to contest a seat in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was replaced in the Assembly by [[Bob Brown]], who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.\n\nThroughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist [[David Bellamy]] was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security [[HM Prison Risdon|Risdon Prison]] for a night, as there was nowhere else to hold him.\n\nIn February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled 'G-Day'. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.\n\nOn 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph:<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/63/p08a02.html Pictures Collection: Peter Dombrovskis Wilderness Images], National Library of Australia. \"The photograph made the Franklin River a household word, and became an icon of the environmentalist cause.\"</ref> ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'' by [[Peter Dombrovskis]].

The new [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], had vowed to stop the dam from being built,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://envlaw.com.au/tasmanian-dam-case/|title=Environmental Law Australia {{!}}   Tasmanian Dam Case|website=envlaw.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke's majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke's government first passed regulations under the existing ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' 1975, and then passed the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. The issue was brought before the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the 'external affairs' provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam's construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'', Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe resulting court case became known as [[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government's favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since.

He said the campaign to protect the [[Franklin River]] had important lessons for the struggle against [[global warming]]:\n\n{{quote|...I just want to really round off by saying how relevant, today, is the experience of that time 25 years ago - because we are now faced with unprecedented environmental challenge. The Gordon Below Franklin was, of course, a major issue. But, relatively speaking, it pales into insignificance, against the massive challenge that we as a world are facing now. The very question of survivability is at stake.\n\nAnd as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The [[conservatives]]: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost [[economic growth]]. You can't do it, you mustn't do it.\n\nWhat's the argument today? No, we now see, at a time where we have a Labor Government in power, which is committed to take all the decisions that need to be taken to meet this historically unparalleled challenge of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. As we have a government committed to action in that regard, we have the conservatives now playing politics on this issue. \n\nI want to say, I want to plead with the conservatives... Now, the conservatives, what do they go on about? They are always talking about family values... What is the greatest obligation that politicians of every party have towards their families now? To their kids, their grandkids and their kids? It is that we take action to pass on to them a planet which is inhabitable, viable and enjoyable. And we must challenge them, and say 'Are you serious about family values? Are you serious about putting family first? If you are, you have no alternative but to join with government and to join with organisations who are committed to bringing about that result'.\n\nI want to conclude by saying this to you all. We can best celebrate this great occasion, the great achievement of [[Bob Brown]] and those who he led, the great achievement of saving the Franklin. We can best celebrate that occasion, best honour those who worked to achieve that result, if we commit ourselves unequivocally... to persuading our society, to persuade our communities, but most of all to persuade our politicians in all political parties to commit themselves to taking action, here within [[Australia]], and combining to ensure that international action is taken to bring about that situation, which I say that we can pass on to our children, our grandchildren and their children, a planet which is safe, inhabitable and enjoyable.\" <ref>Former PM Bob Hawke.

The movement that eventually led to the project's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.\n\nThe dam was proposed for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been {{convert|180|MW}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/professor-west-reminds-tasmania-that-hydro-past-constrains-future/ |title=Professor West reminds Tasmania that hydro past constrains future |work=Tasmanian Times |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive [[Franklin River]], which joins the Gordon nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area]] register.\n\nThe campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the [[non-violent protest]]{{verify source|date=June 2015}} campaign against the building of three dams on [[Lake Pedder]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.\n\nIn December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer [[Peter Dombrovskis]], helped bring down the government of [[Malcolm Fraser]] at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. The new government, under [[Bob Hawke]], had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and [[Tasmanian Government]] followed, resulting in a landmark [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruling in the federal government's favour.<ref name=hca/>\n\n== Announcement of the plans ==\n{{Location map+ | Tasmania\n| caption = Original locations of the proposed dams in Tasmania\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n \u00a0{{Location map~ | Tasmania\n \u00a0 \u00a0| label = Gordon below Franklin \n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = -42.584\n    | lon_deg = 145.732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Dam #2\n    | position = right\n    | lat_deg = -42.376\n    | lon_deg = 145.757 }}\n}}\n\nIn 1978, the Tasmanian [[Hydro Electric Commission]] (HEC) announced intentions to construct the dam.

It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.\n\nHowever, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]], and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, [[Olegas Truchanas]], attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, ''The Last Wild River'', was shown on Tasmania's two commercial television stations.\n\nIn June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stephen  | first = Sarah  | title = 10th anniversary of the Franklin blockade  | magazine = Green Left Weekly  | issue= 80 | location = Sydney  | date = 18 November 1992  | url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2601 | accessdate = 2011-08-09}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts at compromise ==\nThe [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] state government, under premier [[Doug Lowe (Australian politician)|Doug Lowe]], backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park|Wild Rivers National Park]]. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme.<ref>For maps of the proposed schemes see - Thompson, Peter (1981) ''Power In Tasmania'' ACF {{ISBN|0858020645}}  pp.36 noting the potential confusion for which schemes was what -''Integrated'' meant damming the King and Franklin as one, and the Lower Franklin and Oga rivers as the other.  ''Separate'' meant Gordon above the Olga, and The King  and Fraklin dammed the same as in the  Integrated scheme</ref> While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.\n\nIn July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative dominated Legislative Council then blocked the [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] government's 'Gordon-above-Olga' compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/history-franklin-river-campaign-1976-83|title=History of the Franklin River Campaign 1976-83 {{!}} The Wilderness Society|date=2001-06-15|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==\nIn 1981, [[Australian Democrats]] Senator [[Don Chipp]] initiated a Senate inquiry into \"the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world\" and \"the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance\".\n\nFrom early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years BP in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by [[geomorphology]] student Kevin Kieran in January 1977,<ref name =Griffiths/> and he first named it [[Fraser Cave]] by after the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]], because ''...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...'''.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_iceage_walktotasmania/index1.htm AUSTRALIA, An Ice Age - Walk to Tasmania]</ref> It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]].

In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" /> There had been a significant campaign for voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" />\n\nThe ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by [[Harry Holgate]], a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and [[Mary Willey]], another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. [[Norm Sanders]], an [[Australian Democrats]] MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]]. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== The campaigns broadens ==\nDuring 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states.

Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam's construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor [[David Bellamy]] addressed 5,000{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} people at a Melbourne rally.\n\nBy the end of 1982, any perception that \"greenies\" equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, [[Bob Brown]] and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet,<ref>The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column plugged this dinner a couple of days before.</ref><ref>Tim Lamble[?spelling] operated his programmed slide show with dual projectors fading in and out 35mm slides of Tasmanian wilderness photographs, set to recorded music.</ref> ABC's classical music radio station featured a \"Concert for the Franklin\", and electronics entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.\n\nIn the federal [[1982 Lowe by-election|Lowe by-election]] in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers<ref>Volunteers were co-opted from the Australian Conservation Foundation by the NSW South West Tasmania Committee.</ref> at every polling booth encouraged voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper, and 9% did so.<ref>Scrutineers issued this figure in a press release, suggesting a headline like \"Franklin River comes 3rd in by-election\".

On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at \"Warners Landing\" ({{coord|42|34|7|S|145|41|24|E|type:mountain_region:AU-TAS}}) drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in [[Hobart]] also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] to contest a seat in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was replaced in the Assembly by [[Bob Brown]], who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.\n\nThroughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist [[David Bellamy]] was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security [[HM Prison Risdon|Risdon Prison]] for a night, as there was nowhere else to hold him.\n\nIn February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled 'G-Day'. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.\n\nOn 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph:<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/63/p08a02.html Pictures Collection: Peter Dombrovskis Wilderness Images], National Library of Australia. \"The photograph made the Franklin River a household word, and became an icon of the environmentalist cause.\"</ref> ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'' by [[Peter Dombrovskis]].

The new [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], had vowed to stop the dam from being built,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://envlaw.com.au/tasmanian-dam-case/|title=Environmental Law Australia {{!}}   Tasmanian Dam Case|website=envlaw.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke's majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke's government first passed regulations under the existing ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' 1975, and then passed the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. The issue was brought before the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the 'external affairs' provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam's construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'', Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe resulting court case became known as [[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government's favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since. Justice [[Lionel Murphy]] wrote most broadly of the Franklin Dam decision's broader environmental and social implications in terms of the [[UNESCO]] Convention's [[common heritage of humanity]] principle, stating that \"The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war...[t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity.\"<ref>Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.</ref> The High Court ruling ended the dam's construction, and the plans have never been revived.\n\nThe demise of plans for the Franklin Dam also largely ended the building of dams for the generation of hydroelectricity in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |author=Harries, David |title=Hydroelectricity in Australia: past, present and future |date=March 2011 |journal=ecogeneration |publisher=Great Southern Press |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706183448/http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, dam-building by the Hydro was not finished. The corporation was still able to construct a 'compromise' power development scheme on the nearby [[King River, Tasmania|King River]] and [[Henty River]] to compensate for the loss of the potential power generation from the Franklin scheme. Further on in time, the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] - the reconstruction of the old Mount Lyell Abt Railway between [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] and Regatta point, was mainly financed by compensation funds allocated to the Tasmanian Government for the \"loss\" of the Franklin River or Gordon River dams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Postscript==\n\nIn April 1983 the Australian Government sent a [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage jet]] and later an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RF-111]],<ref>[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=158 Second \u2018spy\u2019 mission to Tasmania], 08 Apr 1983, Air Power Development Centre,Department of Defence</ref> from the Royal Australian Air Force, to undertake a reconnaissance mission over the dam to gather evidence that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Lowe, Doug |subject-link=Doug Lowe (Australian politician) |subject2=Brown, Bob |subject-link2=Bob Brown |subject3=Gray, Robin |subject-link3=Robin Gray (Australian politician) |subject4=Holgate, Harry |subject-link4=Harry Holgate |subject5=others |interviewer=Maura Angle |title=We look back at one of Tasmania's most defining periods in history, the Franklin dam dispute |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2003/s890008.htm |type=Interview: Transcript |work=[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] |publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] |location=[[Tasmania]] |date=27 June 2003 |year= |page= |pages= |access-date=11 July 2015  |quote=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf Papers on Parliament 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001024544/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf |date=1 October 2009 }} ''\"In preparing the Commonwealth's case for the inevitable High Court challenge by Tasmania, Evans earned the popular title of 'Biggles' for arranging to have Royal Australian Air Force planes fly 'spy flights' over the dam site to collect court evidence.\"'' (p27)</ref> One of the reconnaissance photographs showing the continuing work on the site is displayed at College of Law staff library in the [[Australian National University]].\n\nOn 1 July 2008, former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] spoke at Hobart's [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart|Grand Chancellor Hotel]] at a dinner to mark the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision on the [[Tasmanian Dam Case]]. He said the campaign to protect the [[Franklin River]] had important lessons for the struggle against [[global warming]]:\n\n{{quote|...I just want to really round off by saying how relevant, today, is the experience of that time 25 years ago - because we are now faced with unprecedented environmental challenge. The Gordon Below Franklin was, of course, a major issue. But, relatively speaking, it pales into insignificance, against the massive challenge that we as a world are facing now. The very question of survivability is at stake.\n\nAnd as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The [[conservatives]]: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost [[economic growth]]. You can't do it, you mustn't do it.\n\nWhat's the argument today? No, we now see, at a time where we have a Labor Government in power, which is committed to take all the decisions that need to be taken to meet this historically unparalleled challenge of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. As we have a government committed to action in that regard, we have the conservatives now playing politics on this issue. \n\nI want to say, I want to plead with the conservatives... Now, the conservatives, what do they go on about? They are always talking about family values... What is the greatest obligation that politicians of every party have towards their families now? To their kids, their grandkids and their kids? It is that we take action to pass on to them a planet which is inhabitable, viable and enjoyable. And we must challenge them, and say 'Are you serious about family values? Are you serious about putting family first? If you are, you have no alternative but to join with government and to join with organisations who are committed to bringing about that result'.\n\nI want to conclude by saying this to you all. We can best celebrate this great occasion, the great achievement of [[Bob Brown]] and those who he led, the great achievement of saving the Franklin. We can best celebrate that occasion, best honour those who worked to achieve that result, if we commit ourselves unequivocally... to persuading our society, to persuade our communities, but most of all to persuade our politicians in all political parties to commit themselves to taking action, here within [[Australia]], and combining to ensure that international action is taken to bring about that situation, which I say that we can pass on to our children, our grandchildren and their children, a planet which is safe, inhabitable and enjoyable.\" <ref>Former PM Bob Hawke.

This was fourteen days after the surrender at Appomattox, and therefore quite late enough after a cessation of hostilities.

The Battle of Munford and a minor action at Hendersonville, North Carolina on the same day were the last battles of the [[American Civil War]] in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War]] (east of the [[Mississippi River]]).\n\nThe [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] soldiers in the battle were described as convalescents, home guards, and pardoned deserters, while the Union cavalry was a veteran force armed with 7-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer repeating carbines]]. The Confederate forces were commanded by General [[Benjamin Jefferson Hill]]. Confederate Lieutenant [[Lewis E. Parsons]] had two cannons which fired several rounds before they were overrun. The Union troops won the brief battle.

This was fourteen days after the surrender at Appomattox, and therefore quite late enough after a cessation of hostilities.

The film stars [[Edward Norton]] and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries. The movie has also been used as a an instrument of de-radicalisation on white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. \n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a past student of Sweeney's and former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26. The inspiration for the story came from his childhood, where he grew up in a [[Punk rock|punk-rock]] scene, often witnessing violent behavior. \"I saw a lot of bigotry growing up, and it made me think about writing something about the world of hate-mongers. The point I tried to make in the script is that a person is not born a racist. It is learned through environment and the people that surround you.

The film stars [[Edward Norton]] and [[Edward Furlong]], as two brothers from Los Angeles who are involved in the [[white supremacist]] and [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] movements. The older brother (Norton) serves three years in prison for [[voluntary manslaughter]], and during this time, he is rehabilitated, and then tries to prevent his brother from going down the same path. The supporting cast includes [[Fairuza Balk]], [[Stacy Keach]], [[Elliott Gould]], [[Avery Brooks]], [[Ethan Suplee]] and [[Beverly D'Angelo]]. \n\nThe story is fictional, but the characters are based on McKenna's childhood and experiences of growing up in San Diego. Eager to adapt it into a film, he then sold the script to [[New Line Cinema]], who were impressed by the writing. ''American History X'' was Kaye's first directorial role in a feature film. Budgeted at $20 million, filming took place in 1997. Before the film's release, Kaye and the film studio were hampered by a number of disputes about the final cut of the film. The final version was longer than Kaye intended, which resulted in him publicly disowning the film, and hurting his own career in Hollywood.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on October 30, 1998 and distributed by New Line Cinema. Despite lukewarm success at the box office, grossing only $24 million worldwide, ''American History X'' was acclaimed by critics. In particular, Norton was praised for his compelling and realistic performance, which earned him an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]]. The film has stayed relevant over the years, especially because of the rise of [[white nationalism]] and [[Far-right politics|far-right]] movements. The film has also been used for educational purposes in the United States and in other countries.\n\n==Plot==\nHigh school student Danny Vinyard antagonizes his [[Jewish]] history teacher Mr. Murray by choosing to write a civil rights essay on ''[[Mein Kampf]]''. [[African-American]] principal and [[outreach]] worker Dr. Bob Sweeney tells Danny that he will study history through [[current event]]s under Sweeney's direction or be expelled, calling their class ''American History X''. Danny's first assignment is a paper on his older brother Derek, a past student of Sweeney's and former [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] leader released from prison that day. In the bathroom, Danny finds three African-American students bullying a white student and intervenes, openly disrespecting the black students.\n\nDr. Sweeney meets with police officers being briefed on Derek's release. Years earlier, Danny and Derek's father, a [[firefighter]], was shot and killed by African-American drug dealers while putting out a fire at their home. In a television interview after his father's death, Derek erupts in a racist tirade. High-profile racist Cameron Alexander becomes Derek's [[mentor]] and they form their own violent white supremacist gang called the Disciples of Christ (D.O.C.), in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice Beach]]. A skilled basketball player, Derek is dragged into a game against several [[Crips]], winning control of the local courts. Derek leads a violent attack on a supermarket owned by a Korean man employing [[Illegal immigration from Mexico to the United States|illegal Mexican immigrants]], which Danny records on a [[camcorder]].\n\nDerek's mother Doris, invites Murray, her boyfriend, for dinner where a heated argument about [[Rodney King]] and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] occurs. Derek assaults his sister Davina, and Doris tells Derek to leave home. That night, the same group of Crips that Derek had beaten in the basketball game earlier attempt to steal his truck. Derek shoots and kills one of them and [[curb stomp]]s another. He is sentenced to three years in the [[California Institution for Men]] for [[voluntary manslaughter]].\n\nIn prison, Derek joins the [[Aryan Brotherhood]] and works in the laundry, partnered with Lamont, an African-American. Derek is initially unfriendly, but develops rapport with him over their shared interest of basketball. Derek becomes disillusioned by [[prison gang]] politics; he believes in the ideology, but disapproves of his gang's dealings with non-white gangs. Turning his back on them, he is beaten and [[prison rape|raped]] in the shower by the Aryan Brotherhood. Derek is visited in the hospital wing by Sweeney, with whom he pleads for help to get out of prison. Sweeney warns that Danny has become involved with the D.O.C. gang. Derek ignores the Aryan Brotherhood, and Lamont warns that he may be targeted by African-American gangs. An attack never comes, and Derek spends the remainder of his sentence alone, reading books from Sweeney. Upon his release, he says goodbye to Lamont, deducing he was the reason Derek was not attacked.\n\nReturning home, Derek finds Danny emulating him, sporting a D.O.C. [[tattoo]] and a [[White power skinhead|skinhead]]. Derek tries to persuade him to leave the gang, but Danny feels betrayed. Derek's best friend Seth, also a D.O.C. member, frequently disrespects Derek's mother and sister, while grooming Danny for the gang; Seth and Danny are closely controlled by Cameron. At a neo-Nazi party, Derek confronts Cameron for his manipulative behavior, and says that he and Danny will no longer be associated with the movement. Cameron, Derek's former girlfriend Stacy, and the others turn on Derek, who assaults Cameron for insisting Danny will remain under his influence. Seth holds Derek at gunpoint, but Derek disarms him and flees. \n\nAfterwards, Derek tells Danny about his experience in prison, which seems to prompt a change in Danny. The pair return home and remove hateful posters from their shared bedroom. The next morning, Danny completes his paper, reflecting on his reasons for adopting white supremacist values, and their flaws. He says that although Derek's racist views may seem to have arisen from anger over his father's death, Danny believes that the seed for his brother's views was planted years earlier; his father often delivered racist rants and [[epithet]]<nowiki/>s, and his death misdirected Derek's anger into racism. Derek walks Danny to school, stopping at a [[diner]] for breakfast.\n\nSweeney and a police officer inform Derek that Seth and Cameron are in [[intensive care unit]] after an attack. Derek reluctantly agrees to talk with the people he denounced; walking Danny to school, Derek notices a car may be following him. At school, Danny is shot dead by an African-American student from the previous day's incident. Derek runs to the school and cradles Danny's bloodied body, blaming himself for influencing Danny's views that led him to a conflict with the student. In a [[narration|voiceover]], Danny reads the final lines of his paper for Dr. Sweeney, quoting the final stanza of [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Edward Norton]] as Derek Vinyard\n* [[Edward Furlong]] as Danny Vinyard\n* [[Beverly D'Angelo]] as Doris Vinyard\n* [[Jennifer Lien]] as Davina Vinyard\n* [[Ethan Suplee]] as Seth Ryan\n* [[Fairuza Balk]] as Stacey\n* [[Avery Brooks]] as Dr. Bob Sweeney\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as Murray\n* [[Stacy Keach]] as Cameron Alexander\n* [[William Russ]] as Dennis Vinyard\n* [[Guy Torry]] as Lamont \n* [[Joseph Cortese]] as Rasmussen\n* Antonio David Lyons as Lawrence\n* [[Keram Malicki-S\u00e1nchez]] as Chris\n* [[Giuseppe Andrews]] as Jason\n* [[Christopher Masterson]] as Daryl Dawson\n* [[Paul Le Mat]] as McMahon\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n=== Development ===\n[[File:Michael De Luca 2012.jpg|alt=Michael De Luca, former president of productions at New Line Cinema|thumb|187x187px|[[Michael De Luca]], former production president at New Line Cinema.]]\nScreenwriter [[David McKenna (writer)|David McKenna]] wrote the screenplay for ''American History X'' and sold the rights to it when he was 26.

This was made possible by making a stretched upper deck (SUD), previously an option on the {{not a typo|747-200}}, a standard feature.<ref>[http://www.airliners.net/aircraft-data/stats.main?id=99 Boeing 747-300]. Airliners.net</ref> The SUD was almost twice as long as the original 747 upper deck. Besides increased capacity, the 747-300 did not offer any increase in range, nor did it include improvements in flight deck technology or construction materials.<ref name=\"n74\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=74.}}</ref> At the same time, 747s were becoming more costly to operate due to a number of factors, notably conventional flight control systems, three-person flight crews, and fuel costs.<ref name=\"d23\" />\n\nIn 1982, Boeing introduced a two-crew glass cockpit, new engines, and advanced materials on its 757 and 767 twinjets.<ref name=n74/> At the same time, combined sales of the {{not a typo|747-100}}, \u2212200, and \u2212300 models (collectively referred to as the 747 \"Classics\") neared 700, but new orders slowed precipitously.<ref name=d24>{{harvnb|Dorr|2002|p=24.}}</ref> The introduction of the 747-300 did little to stem the decline, and itself faced potential competition from more modern designs. As a result, Boeing began considering a more significant upgrade for its largest passenger jet.<ref name=n74/>\n\nBy early 1984, company officials had identified five development objectives for the latest 747 upgrade: new technologies, an enhanced interior, a {{Convert|1000|nmi|km|lk=in}} range increase, more efficient engines, and a 10 percent reduction in operating cost.<ref name=n74/> In September 1984, Boeing announced development of the newest 747 derivative, the \"Advanced Series 300\", at the [[Farnborough Airshow]].<ref name=n74/> On October 22, 1985, the type was officially launched when Northwest Airlines became the first 747-400 customer, with an order for 10 aircraft.<ref name=d25/> [[Cathay Pacific]], [[KLM]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Singapore Airlines]], and [[British Airways]] also announced orders several months later, followed by [[United Airlines]], [[Air France]], and [[Japan Airlines]].<ref name=d25>{{harvnb|Dorr|2002|p=25.}}</ref>\n\n===Design effort===\n[[File:JAL Boeing 747-446 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The computerized [[glass cockpit]] of the Boeing 747-400|alt=Cockpit of modern jet airliner, showcasing digital displays and instruments.

The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data. [[Continental Airlines]] tested jatropha oil in one of its airliners on January 7, 2009.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

Winglets would provide minimal benefits on short-haul routes while adding extra weight and cost. The -400D may be converted to the long-range version if needed. The 747-400D can be distinguished from the otherwise similar-looking 747-300 by the extra windows on the upper deck.

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional {{cvt|3240|USgal|L}} body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however, Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by [[Marshall Aerospace]], these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks feature a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing P-8A Poseidon]]. Other changes to the 747-400ER include the relocation of oxygen system components and the [[potable water]] system tanks and pumps, since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.<ref name=\"auto\">Boeing Field Service Introduction Data 2012</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER.

The flight test airplane was later refurbished, repainted in standard QANTAS livery, and registered as VH-OEE. Qantas was the only customer for the passenger version of the 747-400ER, chosen by the airline to allow for full loads between Melbourne and Los Angeles, particularly in the western direction.

The next month, the extended range (ER) passenger version entered service with [[Qantas]], the only airline ever to order the passenger version of the 747-400ER. Qantas initially used the 747-400ER for the Melbourne to Los Angeles and Dallas to Sydney route allowing the completion of the flight with full passenger load and cargo. Prior to the 747-400ER, Qantas would complete such flights by blocking out 'E' zone of the cabin and limiting passenger numbers and cargo. The 747-400ER featured the ''Boeing Signature Interior'', which was later made available on the 747-400 (either as a retrofit on existing 747-400s or factory installation on new frames).\n\nThe 747-400ER also introduced some flight deck enhancements, including [[liquid-crystal display]]s (LCDs), which replaced the six [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) displays found on the Boeing {{not a typo|747-400}}. LCDs later became standard on the 747-400 as well, and could be retrofitted to earlier aircraft. The three standby flight displays found on the 747-400 were also replaced by a single combined LCD, the integrated standby flight display (ISFD), which also became standard on the 747-400 in late 2003.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/aero_21/747ER.pdf | title=Introducing the 747ER and 747 | date= January 2003 | publisher=Boeing Aero magazine}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2000s, as part of an effort to promote sustainable and alternative fuel development, as well as lower emissions, several 747-400 operators studied the use of oil extracted from the [[jatropha]] plant. [[Air New Zealand]] carried out the first commercial flight using jatropha oil for fuel; the airline's 747-400 had one engine burning a mix of 50% [[jatropha oil]] and 50% jet fuel for two hours during the flight while engineers collected data.

As most 747-400s are now more than 20 years old, airlines are beginning to replace them. Airlines using the 747-400 have been retiring the model, replacing it with more fuel efficient aircraft. The main appeal of the 747-400 like its predecessors was its range rather than its capacity, and in most cases it has been replaced by wide-body twin-engine aircraft of similar range, such as the [[Boeing 777]] and [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The change in emphasis from hub and spoke operations to point-to-point flights has also reduced the need for jumbo jets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/boeing-747-heading-retirement/any-other-business/article/1360694|title=The Boeing 747 is heading for retirement|publisher=}}</ref> Airlines such as British Airways and Qantas that plan to maintain the same capacity on routes currently served by 747-400s ordered the [[Airbus A380]] rather than the updated [[Boeing 747-8|747-8]].\n\nFor example, Delta Air Lines reduced the number of flights it operated from the United States to [[Narita International Airport]] that were intended to transfer passengers to other destinations in Asia, switching to twin-engine widebody aircraft operating from an expanded hub at [[Seattle-Tacoma International Airport]].<ref>Schofield, Adriean, et al., Jumbos bow out, Aviation Week and Space Technology, September 15, 2014, pp. 21-22</ref> Total capacity was cut, but load factors improved. In April 2015, Delta announced it would accelerate the retirement of its 747-400s and replace them either with [[Airbus A330]] or [[Airbus A350 XWB|Airbus A350]] aircraft (both of which are twinjets). Delta could not keep the 747s full without deeply discounting ticket prices; the discounts and increased maintenance required of a four-engine aircraft led to a drag on profits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/stock-analysis/042415/deltas-boeing-747s-are-flying-sunset-ba-dal-ual.aspx|title=Delta's Boeing 747s Are Flying Off Into the Sunset|publisher=Investopedia|date=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, economic weakness in air cargo markets has slowed demand for cargo conversions. Since the cost of replacing a 747-400 is high (an airline must purchase or lease another wide-body), some operators choose to fly the {{not a typo|747-400}} to the conclusion of its accepted useful life and then scrap it. The current parts resale value for this aircraft has been reduced to its engines. When a 26-year-old 747-400 owned by Delta flew through a violent hailstorm, the company indicated it was likely the aircraft would be scrapped. George Dimitroff, head of valuations for FlightGlobal, estimated the aircraft's value before the incident at about $8 million.

The 747-400ER included the option of one or two additional {{cvt|3240|USgal|L}} body fuel tanks in the forward cargo hold, however, Qantas was the only customer that ordered the single body tank configuration, and no airplanes were delivered with dual body fuel tanks. Manufactured by [[Marshall Aerospace]], these tanks utilized metal to metal honeycomb-bonded technology to achieve a high fuel volume-to-dry weight ratio. The tanks feature a double wall, integrated venting system, and achieve fuel control via a modified Fuel System Management Card (FSMC) which optimizes fuel transfer into the Center Wing Tank (CWT) in flight along with the fuel transfer from the Horizontal Stabiliser Tank (HST). The tank is removable using tooling that interfaces with the cargo loading system. Similar technology has been used by Marshall in the development of body fuel tanks for the [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200LR]] and [[Boeing P-8A Poseidon]]. Other changes to the 747-400ER include the relocation of oxygen system components and the [[potable water]] system tanks and pumps, since the body fuel tanks prevent access to the standard locations.<ref name=\"auto\">Boeing Field Service Introduction Data 2012</ref>{{nonspecific|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe first 747-400ER was used as a test flight airplane and painted in Boeing colours, registration N747ER.

The flight test airplane was later refurbished, repainted in standard QANTAS livery, and registered as VH-OEE.
