Inside the convention center, which requires a badge to visit during the convention, includes artists alley and the main exhibitor hall. Artist Alley is for up and coming artists who are new to the pop culture world by selling their new books, comics, toys, and or services. They range from local companies and businesses in Southern California to international ones, but are mainly private endeavors. Artist Alley is usually located in Hall G of the convention center. Spaces for these exhibitors are highly sought after and are on a lottery and need-based system.<ref>https://www.comic-con.org/cci/2018/exhibitors</ref>\n\nThe main exhibit hall, which includes larger well-recognized companies, takes up halls F through A. These companies sell or promote new and up comping movies, television shows, and video games as well as featuring toys and exclusives with many selling for hundreds or even thousands on the secondary markets outside the convention. Some notable recurring companies include [[Lego]], [[Hasbro]], [[Funko]], [[Hallmark Cards]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], and [[Blizzard Entertainment]].\n\n===Off site===\nThe other type of exhibitors include offsite exhibitors, booths and events which are located outside the convention center. These locations are usually within walking distance of the convention center but have been moving into nearby parks in recent years. Some notable examples include [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego]], [[Petco Park]], and [[Children's Park (San Diego)]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Carr |first=Stephanie |date=July 23, 2018 |title=Get an inside look at some of Comic-Con's lesser-known activities |url=https://www.kshb.com/entertainment/get-an-inside-look-at-some-of-comic-cons-lesser-known-activities |work=KSHB |location=Kansas City |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Alvarez |first=Elizabeth |date=July 21, 2018 |title=Comic-Con Day 3: A look at the fans and events outside the convention center |url=https://www.kusi.com/comic-con-day-3-a-look-at-the-fans-and-events-outside-the-convention-center/ |work=KUSI |location=San Diego |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In recent years, these offsite events have no connection to SDCC.<ref>{{cite news |last=Batcha |first=Sarah |date=July 17, 2018 |title=18 San Diego Comic-Con 2018 events you can enjoy without buying a badge |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/06/28/18-san-diego-comic-con-2018-events-you-can-enjoy-without-buying-a-badge/ |work= Orange County Register |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In the past, most sites have not required a Comic-Con badge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gaslamp.org/2018/07/no-badge-required-comic-con-events-specials-gaslamp-quarter/ |title=No Badge Required Comic-Con Events and Specials in the Gaslmap Quarter! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 2018 |website=Gaslamp.org |publisher=Gaslamp Quarter Association |access-date=August 4, 2018}}<br/>{{cite magazine |last=Scheinbaum |first=Chase |date=July 14, 2018 |title=4 Fun Things to Do at Comic-Con 2018, No Badge Required |url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/Cityfiles/Summer-2018/4-Fun-Things-to-Do-at-Comic-Con-2018-No-Badge-Required/ |magazine=San Diego Magazine |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2018 }}</ref> In 2017, one example was a virtual reality and immersive set based on the movie ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yamato |first=Jen |date=July 20, 2017 |title=Are you a replicant?

In response, for 2007, Comic-Con introduced a new three-day membership that did not include Saturday. Nevertheless, the 2007 show went on to sell out Saturday, as well as Friday and Sunday for the first time. Additionally, both the four-day and three-day memberships sold out for the first time. For 2008, the three-day memberships were abandoned and the convention decided to sell memberships only in advance, with no on-site registration.<ref>[http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_reg.shtml Comic-COn 2008 registration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011033223/http://www.comic-con.org/cci/cci_reg.shtml |date=October 11, 2007 }}</ref> In 2008, all memberships were sold out before the convention for the first time.

I certainly don't. It's a perfect fit for us.

Inside the convention center, which requires a badge to visit during the convention, includes artists alley and the main exhibitor hall. Artist Alley is for up and coming artists who are new to the pop culture world by selling their new books, comics, toys, and or services. They range from local companies and businesses in Southern California to international ones, but are mainly private endeavors. Artist Alley is usually located in Hall G of the convention center. Spaces for these exhibitors are highly sought after and are on a lottery and need-based system.<ref>https://www.comic-con.org/cci/2018/exhibitors</ref>\n\nThe main exhibit hall, which includes larger well-recognized companies, takes up halls F through A. These companies sell or promote new and up comping movies, television shows, and video games as well as featuring toys and exclusives with many selling for hundreds or even thousands on the secondary markets outside the convention. Some notable recurring companies include [[Lego]], [[Hasbro]], [[Funko]], [[Hallmark Cards]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[The Walt Disney Company]], and [[Blizzard Entertainment]].\n\n===Off site===\nThe other type of exhibitors include offsite exhibitors, booths and events which are located outside the convention center. These locations are usually within walking distance of the convention center but have been moving into nearby parks in recent years. Some notable examples include [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego]], [[Petco Park]], and [[Children's Park (San Diego)]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Carr |first=Stephanie |date=July 23, 2018 |title=Get an inside look at some of Comic-Con's lesser-known activities |url=https://www.kshb.com/entertainment/get-an-inside-look-at-some-of-comic-cons-lesser-known-activities |work=KSHB |location=Kansas City |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}<br/>{{cite news |last=Alvarez |first=Elizabeth |date=July 21, 2018 |title=Comic-Con Day 3: A look at the fans and events outside the convention center |url=https://www.kusi.com/comic-con-day-3-a-look-at-the-fans-and-events-outside-the-convention-center/ |work=KUSI |location=San Diego |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In recent years, these offsite events have no connection to SDCC.<ref>{{cite news |last=Batcha |first=Sarah |date=July 17, 2018 |title=18 San Diego Comic-Con 2018 events you can enjoy without buying a badge |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2018/06/28/18-san-diego-comic-con-2018-events-you-can-enjoy-without-buying-a-badge/ |work= Orange County Register |access-date=July 26, 2018 }}</ref> In the past, most sites have not required a Comic-Con badge.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gaslamp.org/2018/07/no-badge-required-comic-con-events-specials-gaslamp-quarter/ |title=No Badge Required Comic-Con Events and Specials in the Gaslmap Quarter! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 2018 |website=Gaslamp.org |publisher=Gaslamp Quarter Association |access-date=August 4, 2018}}<br/>{{cite magazine |last=Scheinbaum |first=Chase |date=July 14, 2018 |title=4 Fun Things to Do at Comic-Con 2018, No Badge Required |url=http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/Cityfiles/Summer-2018/4-Fun-Things-to-Do-at-Comic-Con-2018-No-Badge-Required/ |magazine=San Diego Magazine |publisher= |access-date=August 4, 2018 }}</ref> In 2017, one example was a virtual reality and immersive set based on the movie ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yamato |first=Jen |date=July 20, 2017 |title=Are you a replicant?

In response, for 2007, Comic-Con introduced a new three-day membership that did not include Saturday. Nevertheless, the 2007 show went on to sell out Saturday, as well as Friday and Sunday for the first time. Additionally, both the four-day and three-day memberships sold out for the first time.

Baxley]], and starring [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Brian Benben]], [[Betsy Brantley]] and [[Matthias Hues]]. The film was released in the United States on September 28, 1990. The film is about a rule-breaking [[vice squad|vice]] cop who becomes involved in the investigation of mysterious drug-related murders on the streets of [[Houston]], [[Texas]].\n\nThe original title is ''Dark Angel''; the film was planned to be released under the same title in the United States (which had the latest release) but was renamed by Triumph Releasing to ''I Come in Peace'' because of two other movies entitled ''The Dark Angel'' (from [[The Dark Angel (1925 film)|1925]] and [[The Dark Angel (1935 film)|1935]]), according to executive producer [[Mark Damon]] (in a 1993 interview with UK magazine Impact), who preferred the original title.\n\n== Plot ==\nHouston police officer Jack Caine will not let police procedure prevent him from pursuing his mission to wipe out the White Boys, a gang of [[white-collar worker|white collar]] [[illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] who killed his partner while Caine was stopping a [[convenience store]] robbery.\n\nThe White Boys disguise their [[illegal drug trade|narcotics trafficking]] behind rows of expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys operate above accusation but not suspicion. When the White Boys steal a shipment of [[heroin]] from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide evidence of their involvement by  blowing up the facility, killing or injuring numerous people. This brings in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and Caine is partnered with a by-the-book agent Arwood \"Larry\" Smith. They investigate the drug theft and the later murder of several key White Boys soldiers by a hyper fast spinning disk. At the same time, Caine is made aware - via his girlfriend, [[coroner]] Diane Pallone - of a series of drug-related deaths. The corpses are full of heroin, but the cause of death is a puncture wound to the forehead. Unknown to Caine and the police officers, the deaths are caused by an alien who is extracting something from the victims, but is being pursued by Azeck, a similar alien to himself.\n\nAzeck soon tracks Talec to a supermarket where a battle ensues. After being severely injured in the fight, Azeck is able to sneak into Caine's car as Caine and Smith investigate the bloody scene left at the super market. After Cane and Smith are ordered off the investigation by their superiors, they discover the mortally wounded Azeck. Azeck explains that he is a police officer from his own home planet, and that Talec shoots his victims full of synthetic heroin and then uses alien technology to extract the resulting [[endorphins]] from their brains, synthesizing them into a drug called \"Barsi\" to be used by addicts on his home planet. He warns Caine and Smith that if Talec is not stopped, thousands of intergalactic drug dealers will start to come to Earth to slaughter its population, as Earth is a cheap source of Barsi which is extremely rare in the rest of the galaxy. Azeck dies and his body cremates itself - but Smith has retained Azeck's powerful hand-gun and intends to pass it onto his FBI superior to prove that the aliens exist. Cain warns that Switzer should not be trusted and wants to give the gun to his own Chief Malone. The two disagree and separate.\n\nSmith gives the weapon to Inspector Switzer, who reveals that they already know about the aliens and intend on opening dialogue with Talec in order to gain technological and weapon advantages. He then attempts to shoot Smith, but Caine saves him at the last moment. Thanks to information from Azeck, they track Talec down to an industrial complex but are waylaid by the White Boys who believe Caine to be behind the deaths of their soldiers. Talec arrives in the middle of the standoff and kills the remaining White Boys before being forced to retreat after Smith uses Azeck's weapon against him.\n\nAt the complex, Azeck's weapon runs out of charge and Talec attempts to kill Caine using his drug harpoon. While fending off the harpoon Caine grabs a vial of the synthesized Barsi drug and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat over the vial, resulting in Talec being impaled on a steel spar. Cain retrieves Talec's gun - a similar weapon to Azeck's - and shoots nearby drums of fuel, killing Talec in the resulting explosion.\n\nWith Talec dead, Caine and Smith realize that they have completed Azeck's mission: Talec won't return to his home planet, so no one from his home planet knows about Earth.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Detective Jack Caine, a Houston police detective investigating a string of drug-related murders.\n* [[Brian Benben]] as Special Agent Arwood \"Larry\" Smith, an FBI agent and Caine's new partner.\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Diane Pallone, a coroner and Caine's girlfriend.\n* [[Matthias Hues]] as Talec, an extraterrestrial drug dealer.\n* [[Jay Bilas]] as Azeck, an extraterrestrial police officer. Unlike Talec, he is fluent in English.\n* Jim Haynie as Captain Malone, Caine's boss.\n* [[David Ackroyd]] as Inspector Switzer, Smith's boss.\n* [[Sherman Howard]] as Victor Manning, a white collar drug dealer and boss of the White Boys.\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Warren, [[underboss]] of the White Boys.\n* [[Alex Morris]] as Detective Ray Turner, Caine's original partner. He is killed by the White Boys during a [[sting operation]].\n\nThe film also stars Mark Lowenthal as Bruce, an eccentric and paranoid scientist; [[Michael J. Pollard]] as Boner, a petty criminal; [[Jesse Vint]] as McMurphy, Talec's first victim; Mimi Cochran as a car mechanic; Jack Willis as a liquor store owner; Tony Brubaker as a garage sweeper; Brandon Smith as a market clerk; and [[Al Leong]] (credited as Albert Leong) as a luggage salesman who tries to rip-off the White Boys.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n{{expand section|date=September 2017}}\nScreenwriter [[David Koepp]] was credited as Leonard Maas Jr. Vision PDG was the only credited production company.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In April 1989, after filming went two weeks over its deadline, the film's principal photography wrapped in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].<ref name=Rory>{{cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Rory|title=Dark Angel: Muscleman Dolph Lundgren in stunt action as a cop after a drug dealer from outer space.|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=July 1990|volume=21|issue=1|page=6|accessdate=September 1, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tiwnAQAAIAAJ&dq}}</ref> Although the film was planned for release for August 3, 1990,<ref name=Rory/> it was eventually pushed back to September 28.\n\n== Release ==\n''I Come In Peace'' was released in the United States on September 28, 1990.

Baxley]], and starring [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Brian Benben]], [[Betsy Brantley]] and [[Matthias Hues]]. The film was released in the United States on September 28, 1990. The film is about a rule-breaking [[vice squad|vice]] cop who becomes involved in the investigation of mysterious drug-related murders on the streets of [[Houston]], [[Texas]].\n\nThe original title is ''Dark Angel''; the film was planned to be released under the same title in the United States (which had the latest release) but was renamed by Triumph Releasing to ''I Come in Peace'' because of two other movies entitled ''The Dark Angel'' (from [[The Dark Angel (1925 film)|1925]] and [[The Dark Angel (1935 film)|1935]]), according to executive producer [[Mark Damon]] (in a 1993 interview with UK magazine Impact), who preferred the original title.\n\n== Plot ==\nHouston police officer Jack Caine will not let police procedure prevent him from pursuing his mission to wipe out the White Boys, a gang of [[white-collar worker|white collar]] [[illegal drug trade|drug dealers]] who killed his partner while Caine was stopping a [[convenience store]] robbery.\n\nThe White Boys disguise their [[illegal drug trade|narcotics trafficking]] behind rows of expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys operate above accusation but not suspicion. When the White Boys steal a shipment of [[heroin]] from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide evidence of their involvement by  blowing up the facility, killing or injuring numerous people. This brings in the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and Caine is partnered with a by-the-book agent Arwood \"Larry\" Smith. They investigate the drug theft and the later murder of several key White Boys soldiers by a hyper fast spinning disk. At the same time, Caine is made aware - via his girlfriend, [[coroner]] Diane Pallone - of a series of drug-related deaths. The corpses are full of heroin, but the cause of death is a puncture wound to the forehead. Unknown to Caine and the police officers, the deaths are caused by an alien who is extracting something from the victims, but is being pursued by Azeck, a similar alien to himself.\n\nAzeck soon tracks Talec to a supermarket where a battle ensues. After being severely injured in the fight, Azeck is able to sneak into Caine's car as Caine and Smith investigate the bloody scene left at the super market. After Cane and Smith are ordered off the investigation by their superiors, they discover the mortally wounded Azeck. Azeck explains that he is a police officer from his own home planet, and that Talec shoots his victims full of synthetic heroin and then uses alien technology to extract the resulting [[endorphins]] from their brains, synthesizing them into a drug called \"Barsi\" to be used by addicts on his home planet. He warns Caine and Smith that if Talec is not stopped, thousands of intergalactic drug dealers will start to come to Earth to slaughter its population, as Earth is a cheap source of Barsi which is extremely rare in the rest of the galaxy. Azeck dies and his body cremates itself - but Smith has retained Azeck's powerful hand-gun and intends to pass it onto his FBI superior to prove that the aliens exist. Cain warns that Switzer should not be trusted and wants to give the gun to his own Chief Malone. The two disagree and separate.\n\nSmith gives the weapon to Inspector Switzer, who reveals that they already know about the aliens and intend on opening dialogue with Talec in order to gain technological and weapon advantages. He then attempts to shoot Smith, but Caine saves him at the last moment. Thanks to information from Azeck, they track Talec down to an industrial complex but are waylaid by the White Boys who believe Caine to be behind the deaths of their soldiers. Talec arrives in the middle of the standoff and kills the remaining White Boys before being forced to retreat after Smith uses Azeck's weapon against him.\n\nAt the complex, Azeck's weapon runs out of charge and Talec attempts to kill Caine using his drug harpoon. While fending off the harpoon Caine grabs a vial of the synthesized Barsi drug and the two engage in hand-to-hand combat over the vial, resulting in Talec being impaled on a steel spar. Cain retrieves Talecs gun - a similar weapon to Azeck's - and shoots nearby drums of fuel, killing Talec in the resulting explosion.\n\nWith Talec dead, Caine and Smith realize that they have completed Azeck's mission: Talec won't return to his home planet, so no one from his home planet knows about Earth.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Dolph Lundgren]] as Detective Jack Caine, a Houston police detective investigating a string of drug-related murders.\n* [[Brian Benben]] as Special Agent Arwood \"Larry\" Smith, an FBI agent and Caine's new partner.\n* [[Betsy Brantley]] as Diane Pallone, a coroner and Caine's girlfriend.\n* [[Matthias Hues]] as Talec, an extraterrestrial drug dealer.\n* [[Jay Bilas]] as Azeck, an extraterrestrial police officer. Unlike Talec, he is fluent in English.\n* Jim Haynie as Captain Malone, Caine's boss.\n* [[David Ackroyd]] as Inspector Switzer, Smith's boss.\n* [[Sherman Howard]] as Victor Manning, a white collar drug dealer and boss of the White Boys.\n* [[Sam Anderson]] as Warren, [[underboss]] of the White Boys.\n* [[Alex Morris]] as Detective Ray Turner, Caine's original partner. He is killed by the White Boys during a [[sting operation]].\n\nThe film also stars Mark Lowenthal as Bruce, an eccentric and paranoid scientist; [[Michael J. Pollard]] as Boner, a petty criminal; [[Jesse Vint]] as McMurphy, Talec's first victim; Mimi Cochran as a car mechanic; Jack Willis as a liquor store owner; Tony Brubaker as a garage sweeper; Brandon Smith as a market clerk; and [[Al Leong]] (credited as Albert Leong) as a luggage salesman who tries to rip-off the White Boys.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development and writing===\n{{expand section|date=September 2017}}\nScreenwriter [[David Koepp]] was credited as Leonard Maas Jr. Vision PDG was the only credited production company.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In April 1989, after filming went two weeks over its deadline, the film's principal photography wrapped in [[Houston]], [[Texas]].<ref name=Rory>{{cite journal|last1=Harper|first1=Rory|title=Dark Angel: Muscleman Dolph Lundgren in stunt action as a cop after a drug dealer from outer space.|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=July 1990|volume=21|issue=1|page=6|accessdate=September 1, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tiwnAQAAIAAJ&dq}}</ref> Although the film was planned for release for August 3, 1990,<ref name=Rory/> it was eventually pushed back to September 28.\n\n== Release ==\n''I Come In Peace'' was released in the United States on September 28, 1990.

She won a blue ribbon for her art in the Junior Section at the Sears-Allstate Tidewater Arts Festival. She received two Virginia Museum Fellowships and studied at [[Virginia Commonwealth University|Richmond Professional Institute]] (VCU) in Richmond, earning a BFA in 1967<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carolsutton.net/text/curriculum_vitae_sutton.html|title=Short Curriculum Vitae of artist Carol Sutton|website=www.carolsutton.net|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref> along with a Gold Key and Art Achievement Award and a scholarship to attend the 'School of Visual Arts' in New York City.\n\nSutton received two teaching fellowships which allowed her to attend the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] (UNCG),<ref>Reed Publishing Who's Who in American Art, 1990</ref> where her professors introduced her to the work of [[Morris Louis]] and [[Kenneth Noland]].  In 1969 she graduated with a Masters of Fine Art degree.\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1967, when Sutton was twenty-two, her work entered the Jacob Kainen Collection, of the Smithsonian Museum of American Art with a portfolio of sixteen serigraphs titled 'The Artist As A Young Woman - Picabia'. Thinking that her artistic goals and the materials she used were similar to those of [[Eva Hesse]],  Will Insley, Sutton's professor at UNCG, introduced the two women in 1969 in his New York loft. That year a large scale sculpture she created was purchased by 'Weatherspoon Art Gallery', Greensboro, N.C.\n\nWorking on large sculpture in the isolation of her studio in Greensboro, North Carolina Sutton was offered a solo show of these works at The [[OK Harris Gallery|O.K. Harris Gallery]] in New York. However, she instead moved to Canada and married the sculptor [[Andr\u00e9 Fauteux]] with whom she has two children, Viva-Laura Sutton-Fauteux (1980-2016) and Yale Sutton-Fauteux.\n\nWhile working in Canada, Sutton was awarded Ontario Arts Council grants in  1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. She received a bursary and two travel grants from the Canada Council for the Arts between 1983 and 1992.\n\nIn Canada Sutton produced multiple exhibitions across Canada and showed with the Theo Waddington Galleries, and later at Gallery One in Toronto.  In Toronto, Sutton also did sculpture collaborations with contemporary electronic music composers. In Canada Sutton's work received positive reviews from critics Clement Greenberg and [[Karen Wilkin]], and was influenced by the artists [[Anthony Caro]] and [[Helen Frankenthaler]], all of whom regularly came to her Toronto studio. Fauteux introduced Sutton to [[Jack Bush]] in 1974 and has been included in a number of exhibitions related to Bush's influence.\n\nIn 1977, Sutton presented her first Canadian exhibition at the A.C.T. Gallery. In 1978 Sutton held her first New York one-woman show at the William Edward O'Reilly Gallery. In the U.S.A. Sutton's work was noted by critic Kenworth Moffett, the Contemporary Curator of The [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], who purchased her work 'Alvertie' for their collection and included her in the [[Andr\u00e9 Emmerich]] Gallery touring show, The New Generation: A Curator's Choice.\n\nEight years after she left, Sutton returned to New York to show as an artist, this time as a painter not a sculptor. There she received an [[Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation]] grant.\n\n==Later career==\n\nSutton became known for her large scale abstract acrylic paintings, which she painted with canvas laid directly on the floor.<ref>{{cite book|title=Artmagazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VfrAAAAMAAJ|volume=13, Issues 55-59|year=1981|publisher=Art Magazine, Incorporated|pages=65\u201366}}</ref> Related to the tradition of [[Color Field]] Painting her art has been linked by critics to the art movement called [[Lyrical Abstraction]]. Her smaller paper works often take on unusual structural forms and have widely extended edges, sometimes cut in wave shapes. Sutton was encouraged by critic [[Michael Fried]] whom she met 1n 1986 at [[Triangle Arts Trust|Triangle Artist Workshop]].<ref>Fried, Michael, Triangle Artists' Workshop, published catalog, 1986, Triangle Arts Trust</ref> In 1987 Sutton was invited to participate in the Art Triangle Workshop in Barcelona, her third Triangle workshop. Two years later a [[Canada Council]] Grant allowed her to again travel to Europe to photograph and study ironwork throughout Spain and France. The experience resulted in a series of paintings titled 'THE SPIRIT BALCONY PAINTINGS'.  Roald Nasgaard, in his book 'Abstract Painting in Canada', writes of the artist, \"Always a fluid and luscious painter of great gusto, comfortable with intimacy as well as the grand scale.\"<ref>Abstract Painting in Canada, Publisher: Douglas & McIntyre, pages Pages: 261, 262, and 124, 2007</ref>\n\n==Major group exhibitions==\n* 1968 Gallery of Contemporary Art, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, now called South Eastern Center for Contemporary Art - SECCA' -The Curator and Director then was Ted Potter: sculpture.

Later, it was included in the [[Dacian Kingdom]] formed by the King [[Burebista]] when the mining exploration began, as the area is rich in [[gold]] and [[silver]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Middle Ages}}\nBaia Mare is first mentioned in written documents released by [[Charles I of Hungary]] in 1328 under the name of ''Rivulus Dominarum'' ({{lang-en|Ladies' River}}). In 1347 the town was identified in documents by [[Louis I of Hungary]] as an important [[medieval]] town with a prosperous [[mining industry]].  Its rules of organisation were characteristic of the \"free towns\" of that time.  In 1411 the town and its surrounding areas, including the mines, were transferred into the property of the [[Hunyadi family]] by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor), who recognised [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]]'s contribution to stop the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] invasion of Europe.\n\nThe town entered into a period of prosperity, during which the [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]] [[Cathedral]] was built. Today the cathedral tower is one of the best-known of the town's historic landmarks (see [[Stephen's Tower (Baia Mare)|Stephen's Tower]]).  The first [[school]], named ''Schola Rivulina'', was opened in Baia Mare in 1547 by the [[Reformed Church]] following the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{See also|Modern history of Transylvania|Modern history of Romania}}\n\n[[File:Centrul Vechi Baia Mare.jpg|thumb|The city centre]]\n\nIn 1703 [[Pintea Viteazul]] and his band managed to free the town for a short period of time from the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Imperial]] rule, under which it belonged the royal treasury. Since then Pintea is considered an important figure in the town's history, representing the idea of freedom. The Bude\u0219ti Church has Pintea's chain mail shirt and a helmet, reportedly worn by him in his battles.  The Museum of Baia Mare displays his weapons and their harness.\n\nIn 1748 the city's [[mining industry]] made a leap forward when the [[Austria]]n authorities created the headquarters of \"Superior Mining\".\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, [[Simon Holl\u00f3sy]], [[Istv\u00e1n R\u00e9ti]], [[J\u00e1nos Thorma]], [[B\u00e9la Iv\u00e1nyi-Gr\u00fcnwald]], and [[K\u00e1roly Ferenczy]] were among numerous young Hungarians who left the area to study the arts in [[Munich]], as Hungary lacked an academy of art in those times.<ref name=\"munich\">[http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english ''Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630224433/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english |date=30 June 2010 }}, 2 October 2009 - Jan 2010, Hungarian National Gallery</ref> Simon Holl\u00f3sy, the young Hungarian painter, was teaching in his studio new western European techniques.\n\n[[File:BaiaMareFotoThalerTamas.jpg|thumb|Stephen's Tower in the city centre]]\n\nSome of those young painters decided to settle down together in Baia Mare, then called Nagyb\u00e1nya, to work on art. They persuaded Holl\u00f3sy to join them and founded the Nagyb\u00e1nya Artists Colony, working on naturalism and ''[[plein air]]'' painting.

It was re-occupied by Hungary between 1940-1944 under the [[Second Vienna Award]] between Hungary and Germany, during [[World War II]]. Near the end of that period, the city hosted the [[Baia Mare ghetto]]. After the war, the city was returned to Romania. Shortly after World War II in postwar development, the town of Baia Mare started to grow both in population and inhabited area. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, a new [[town centre]] was developed with [[modern architecture]] buildings and structures.\n\nIn 2000, Baia Mare was the site of what has been considered [[2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill|Europe's worst ecological disaster]] since [[Chernobyl]], which took place at gold mining company Aurul, a joint-venture of the Australian company Esmeralda Exploration and the Romanian government.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\">[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/9/1/8/p109181_index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923163426/http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/1/0/9/1/8/p109181_index.html |date=23 September 2009 }}</ref> The tailing dam at the gold processing plant broke and {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} 70 tons of toxic [[cyanide]] and [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]-laced waste water escaped into the River [[Tisza]] and into Hungary, making its way into the Danube and affecting Romania, Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, and Bulgaria.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\"/> More than 1,400 tons of fish, numerous eagles, storks and otters died.<ref name=\"allacademic.com\"/> Scientists fear the release may have led to the ultimate extinction of at least five fish species.<ref>\"Report of the International Task Force for Assessing the Baia Mare Accident\" available at http://www.reliefweb.int/library/documents/eubaiamare.pdf</ref> Despite the accident's happening in Romania, much of the adverse effects were suffered in Hungary.

The crest shows the city's status as a [[Maramure\u0219 County|county]] seat.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Ethnographic Museum in Baia Mare.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Ethnographic Museum]]\n\nThe city is situated in the vicinity of the [[Gut\u00e2i Mountains|Gut\u00e2i]] and Igni\u0219 Mountains. Altitudes reach 1400 meters in some peaks. The area is famous for its outstanding landscapes, and the mountains are easily accessible from the city, famous routes being: Igni\u0219 (1307 m), Mogo\u0219a (1246 m), Gut\u00e2i (1443 m), Creasta Coco\u0219ului (1450 m), Piatra Soimului (839 m), Plestioara (803 m), Dealul Bulat (683 m), Murgau (633 m), Dealul Crucii (500 m) etc.\n\nThe city is situated in the Baia Mare valley and is encircled on all sides by hills and mountains, which makes the climate in the city milder than the rest of the surrounding area. Proof of this is that the outskirts of Baia Mare are the only areas where you can find chestnut trees that usually need [[Mediterranean]] climate to grow. This is the northernmost reach of the [[chestnut tree]].\nHowever, abrupt temperature changes take place and, during the winters, the temperatures may occasionally drop below -20 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe summers are mild, cooler than in the rest of the country. The precipitations in this area are quite high, due to the mountains in the north and east which do not allow the air masses to pass beyond the region's limits, the average rainfall being almost 1000&nbsp;mm/year. The city of Baia Mare is the most populous of northern Romanian cities ([[Satu Mare]], [[Suceava]], and [[Boto\u0219ani]]), with a population of approximately 124,000. It also has a high level of culture and education, being home to theatres, schools, museums and art galleries.\n\nNot far from the city there are a few very important natural reservations, among them Creasta Coco\u0219ului, Cheile T\u0103t\u0103rului, Lacul Albastru etc. Because of its privileged location in the [[Eastern Carpathian]] mountains it is considered one of the most picturesque cities in [[Romania]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |12877\n|1930 |13904\n|1948 |20959\n|1956 |35920\n|1966 |62658\n|1977 |100985\n|1992 |149205\n|2002 |137976\n|2011 |123738\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Baia Mare has a population of 123,738, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/>\nThe ethnic composition of the city is as follows:\n* [[Romanians|Romanian]]: (84.11%)\n* [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]: (12.25%)\n* [[Roma in Romania|Roma]]: (2.76%)\n* [[Germans in Romania|Germans]]: (0.24%)\n* [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]: (0.16%)\n* [[Jew]]s: (0.02%)\n\nand 642 others, including [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Italians]], [[Lippovans]], [[Poles]] and [[Slovaks]].\n\n[[Baia Mare metropolitan area]] has a population of 215,932, an area of 1,395.38 square kilometres (538.76 sq mi), and includes the municipality of Baia Mare, five towns ([[Baia Sprie]], [[Cavnic]], [[Seini]], [[\u0218omcuta Mare]] and [[T\u0103u\u021bii-M\u0103gher\u0103u\u0219]]), and 13 communes ([[Cerne\u0219ti]], [[Cic\u00e2rl\u0103u]], [[Coa\u0219]], [[Colt\u0103u]], [[Copalnic-M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur]], [[Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba, Maramure\u0219|Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba]], [[Gro\u0219i]], [[Mire\u0219u Mare]], [[Recea, Maramure\u0219|Recea]], [[Remetea Chioarului]], [[Satulung]], [[S\u0103c\u0103l\u0103\u0219eni]] and [[Valea Chioarului]]).<ref>[http://www.zmbm.ro/documente/act-constitutiv-zmbm-633.html \"Articles of Incorporation\"] at zmbm.ro</ref>\n\n===Historical population===\nIn 1912, out of the total population of 12,877 people, 9,992 were Hungarians (including Jews), 2,677 Romanians, and 175 Germans.\n\nIn 1920, of the 12,780 inhabitants, 5,005 were Romanians, 4,652 Hungarians, 1,792 Jews, 1,232 Germans and 99 of other ethnicities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.hu/konyvtar/erdely/erd2002/abetn02.pdf|title=ERD\u00c9LY ETNIKAI \u00c9S FELEKEZETI STATISZTIK\u00c1JA\n}}</ref> Many inhabitants declared themselves as Hungarian-speakers during previous censuses, despite not being ethnic Hungarians.\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], Baia Mare had a community of more than 1,000 [[Jews]].

Later, it was included in the [[Dacian Kingdom]] formed by the King [[Burebista]] when the mining exploration began, as the area is rich in [[gold]] and [[silver]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n{{See also|Transylvania in the Middle Ages|Romania in the Middle Ages}}\nBaia Mare is first mentioned in written documents released by [[Charles I of Hungary]] in 1328 under the name of ''Rivulus Dominarum'' ({{lang-en|Ladies' River}}). In 1347 the town was identified in documents by [[Louis I of Hungary]] as an important [[medieval]] town with a prosperous [[mining industry]].  Its rules of organisation were characteristic of the \"free towns\" of that time.  In 1411 the town and its surrounding areas, including the mines, were transferred into the property of the [[Hunyadi family]] by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], King of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor), who recognised [[John Hunyadi|Janos Hunyadi]]'s contribution to stop the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] invasion of Europe.\n\nThe town entered into a period of prosperity, during which the [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]] [[Cathedral]] was built. Today the cathedral tower is one of the best-known of the town's historic landmarks (see [[Stephen's Tower (Baia Mare)|Stephen's Tower]]).  The first [[school]], named ''Schola Rivulina'', was opened in Baia Mare in 1547 by the [[Reformed Church]] following the [[Protestant Reformation]].\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{See also|Modern history of Transylvania|Modern history of Romania}}\n\n[[File:Centrul Vechi Baia Mare.jpg|thumb|The city centre]]\n\nIn 1703 [[Pintea Viteazul]] and his band managed to free the town for a short period of time from the [[Holy Roman Empire|German Imperial]] rule, under which it belonged the royal treasury. Since then Pintea is considered an important figure in the town's history, representing the idea of freedom. The Bude\u0219ti Church has Pintea's chain mail shirt and a helmet, reportedly worn by him in his battles.  The Museum of Baia Mare displays his weapons and their harness.\n\nIn 1748 the city's [[mining industry]] made a leap forward when the [[Austria]]n authorities created the headquarters of \"Superior Mining\".\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, [[Simon Holl\u00f3sy]], [[Istv\u00e1n R\u00e9ti]], [[J\u00e1nos Thorma]], [[B\u00e9la Iv\u00e1nyi-Gr\u00fcnwald]], and [[K\u00e1roly Ferenczy]] were among numerous young Hungarians who left the area to study the arts in [[Munich]], as Hungary lacked an academy of art in those times.<ref name=\"munich\">[http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english ''Munich in Hungarian, Hungarian Artists in Munich 1850-1914''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630224433/http://www.mng.hu/kiallitasok/idoszaki/munchen_english |date=30 June 2010 }}, 2 October 2009 - Jan 2010, Hungarian National Gallery</ref> Simon Holl\u00f3sy, the young Hungarian painter, was teaching in his studio new western European techniques.\n\n[[File:BaiaMareFotoThalerTamas.jpg|thumb|Stephen's Tower in the city centre]]\n\nSome of those young painters decided to settle down together in Baia Mare, then called Nagyb\u00e1nya, to work on art. They persuaded Holl\u00f3sy to join them and founded the Nagyb\u00e1nya Artists Colony, working on naturalism and ''[[plein air]]'' painting.

The area is famous for its outstanding landscapes, and the mountains are easily accessible from the city, famous routes being: Igni\u0219 (1307 m), Mogo\u0219a (1246 m), Gut\u00e2i (1443 m), Creasta Coco\u0219ului (1450 m), Piatra Soimului (839 m), Plestioara (803 m), Dealul Bulat (683 m), Murgau (633 m), Dealul Crucii (500 m) etc.\n\nThe city is situated in the Baia Mare valley and is encircled on all sides by hills and mountains, which makes the climate in the city milder than the rest of the surrounding area. Proof of this is that the outskirts of Baia Mare are the only areas where you can find chestnut trees that usually need [[Mediterranean]] climate to grow. This is the northernmost reach of the [[chestnut tree]].\nHowever, abrupt temperature changes take place and, during the winters, the temperatures may occasionally drop below -20 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe summers are mild, cooler than in the rest of the country. The precipitations in this area are quite high, due to the mountains in the north and east which do not allow the air masses to pass beyond the region's limits, the average rainfall being almost 1000&nbsp;mm/year. The city of Baia Mare is the most populous of northern Romanian cities ([[Satu Mare]], [[Suceava]], and [[Boto\u0219ani]]), with a population of approximately 124,000. It also has a high level of culture and education, being home to theatres, schools, museums and art galleries.\n\nNot far from the city there are a few very important natural reservations, among them Creasta Coco\u0219ului, Cheile T\u0103t\u0103rului, Lacul Albastru etc. Because of its privileged location in the [[Eastern Carpathian]] mountains it is considered one of the most picturesque cities in [[Romania]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |12877\n|1930 |13904\n|1948 |20959\n|1956 |35920\n|1966 |62658\n|1977 |100985\n|1992 |149205\n|2002 |137976\n|2011 |123738\n}}\n\nAs of [[Demographic history of Romania|2011 census]] data, Baia Mare has a population of 123,738, a decrease from the figure recorded at the 2002 census.<ref name=\"INSSER\"/>\nThe ethnic composition of the city is as follows:\n* [[Romanians|Romanian]]: (84.11%)\n* [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]]: (12.25%)\n* [[Roma in Romania|Roma]]: (2.76%)\n* [[Germans in Romania|Germans]]: (0.24%)\n* [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]: (0.16%)\n* [[Jew]]s: (0.02%)\n\nand 642 others, including [[Greeks]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Italians]], [[Lippovans]], [[Poles]] and [[Slovaks]].\n\n[[Baia Mare metropolitan area]] has a population of 215,932, an area of 1,395.38 square kilometres (538.76 sq mi), and includes the municipality of Baia Mare, five towns ([[Baia Sprie]], [[Cavnic]], [[Seini]], [[\u0218omcuta Mare]] and [[T\u0103u\u021bii-M\u0103gher\u0103u\u0219]]), and 13 communes ([[Cerne\u0219ti]], [[Cic\u00e2rl\u0103u]], [[Coa\u0219]], [[Colt\u0103u]], [[Copalnic-M\u0103n\u0103\u0219tur]], [[Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba, Maramure\u0219|Dumbr\u0103vi\u021ba]], [[Gro\u0219i]], [[Mire\u0219u Mare]], [[Recea, Maramure\u0219|Recea]], [[Remetea Chioarului]], [[Satulung]], [[S\u0103c\u0103l\u0103\u0219eni]] and [[Valea Chioarului]]).<ref>[http://www.zmbm.ro/documente/act-constitutiv-zmbm-633.html \"Articles of Incorporation\"] at zmbm.ro</ref>\n\n===Historical population===\nIn 1912, out of the total population of 12,877 people, 9,992 were Hungarians (including Jews), 2,677 Romanians, and 175 Germans.\n\nIn 1920, of the 12,780 inhabitants, 5,005 were Romanians, 4,652 Hungarians, 1,792 Jews, 1,232 Germans and 99 of other ethnicities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kia.hu/konyvtar/erdely/erd2002/abetn02.pdf|title=ERD\u00c9LY ETNIKAI \u00c9S FELEKEZETI STATISZTIK\u00c1JA\n}}</ref> Many inhabitants declared themselves as Hungarian-speakers during previous censuses, despite not being ethnic Hungarians.\n\nBefore the [[Second World War]], Baia Mare had a community of more than 1,000 [[Jews]].

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012\u201313 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |title=Longest serving managers |publisher=League Managers Association |accessdate=14 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207195645/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/managers/longest-current.html |archivedate=7 February 2015 |df=}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, 6 managers have been sacked as of 28 December: [[Javi Gracia]] and [[Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores]] of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]], [[Mauricio Pochettino]] of [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], [[Unai Emery]] of [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Marco Silva]] of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Manuel Pellegrini]] of [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].\n\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the [[University of Liverpool]] and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the [[University of Amsterdam]], performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/us/features/soccernomics-does-sacking-manager-actually-make-difference |title=Soccernomics: Does sacking the manager actually make a difference? |date=13 March 2016 |work=FourFourTwo|access-date=14 December 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Alex Ferguson.jpg|thumb|upright|Former Manchester United manager [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] was the longest serving and most successful manager in Premier League history.|alt=The torso and head of a grey-haired white man in a football stadium.

It is a British-American venture produced by [[StudioCanal]] and [[Working Title Films]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nStarring [[Rowan Atkinson]] in the title role, [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Ben Miller]] and [[John Malkovich]], it is the first instalment of the [[Johnny English (film series)|''Johnny English'' film series]] and serves as a [[parody]]/[[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[spy film|spy genre]], mainly the [[James Bond]] film series as well as Atkinson's [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] character.

After Agent One dies in a [[submarine]] accident unknowingly caused by English, the remaining agents are killed by a bombing at Agent One's funeral, again due to English's incompetence, leaving English as the lone surviving agent capable of finishing Agent One\u2019s mission.\n\nAssigned to thwart a plot to steal the newly restored [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]], English meets the mysterious Lorna Campbell at the jewels' unveiling at the [[Tower of London]]. During a sudden blackout, the jewels are stolen. In the chaotic aftermath, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an imaginary \"assailant\" to cover his mistakes; he makes up a false description of the suspect to MI7 head Pegasus.\n\nEnglish and his assistant Angus Bough discover the jewels were removed via a hole dug beneath their display case. Following the tunnel, they confront the German thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a [[hearse]]. After pursuing the wrong hearse, English gatecrashes a funeral. Bough comes to his rescue, pretending English is an escaped mental patient and posing as a doctor from the \"Lunatic Response Unit\".\n\nEnglish connects the thieves to Pascal Sauvage, a French prison entrepreneur who helped restore the jewels. Pegasus finds English\u2019s claims absurd and warns English not to involve Sauvage, as he is his personal friend. In the car park, English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta but are unharmed. English again encounters Campbell in a [[YO! Sushi]] restaurant, recognising her pink [[motorcycle]]. Having seen her at two crime scenes, English\u2019s suspicions deepen when her records cannot be found on any government computer.\n\nEnglish and Bough parachute into Sauvage's headquarters, but English mistakenly lands on an identical tower, the City Hospital. Reaching the correct building, the two learn that Sauvage, a descendant of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], plans to make himself king, using an impostor to impersonate the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Campbell arrives, revealed to be an [[Interpol]] agent tracking Sauvage. With evidence of Sauvage's involvement, English crashes a reception hosted by Sauvage but is suspended by Pegasus for his clumsy actions.\n\nSauvage scraps his plan to use the fake Archbishop and instead sends his minions to force Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to abdicate by threatening her [[Queen Elizabeth's corgis|corgis]], causing the entire [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] to be swept clean for Sauvage to become king. Campbell, now placed in charge of the assignment by Pegasus, visits the depressed English and convinces him to travel with her to Sauvage's French [[ch\u00e2teau]] to investigate. Eavesdropping on Sauvage's meeting with internationally renowned criminals, English and Campbell learn he plans to transform all of England into the world's biggest prison. The agents are exposed when English accidentally activates a microphone, and they are taken prisoner.\n\nBough rescues English and Campbell and they race to stop Sauvage's coronation. English crashes the coronation and discovers the Archbishop in attendance is genuine. Undeterred, English orders Bough to play the incriminating DVD, only to find it is footage of himself lip-syncing to [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\" in his underclothes; Sauvage had bugged English's flat. Sneaking away, English swings in to steal [[St. Edward\u2019s Crown]] from the Archbishop. Sauvage attempts to kill English, who drops the crown. However, English falls from the wire, lands on the throne, and is crowned instead; the laws of succession mean English is now technically the King of England. In his singular act as king, English has Sauvage arrested and restores the Queen to the throne, simply requesting a [[knighthood]] as a reward.\n\nSauvage is awaiting trial for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], while English and Campbell drive to southern [[France]] for a romantic holiday, only for English to accidentally eject her out of his car while leaning in to kiss her. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Lorna lands in a hotel swimming pool, where Bough is vacationing alongside a man identical to the fictitious assailant English described to Pegasus.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Johnny English\n* [[Natalie Imbruglia]] as Lorna Campbell, an INTERPOL agent\n* [[Ben Miller]] as Angus Bough, English's partner in the field\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Pascal Edward Sauvage, the main antagonist, the distant descendant of [[James II of England|James II]]\n* [[Oliver Ford Davies]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Pegasus\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as the Prime Minister\n* Douglas McFerran as Klaus Vendetta\n* Steve Nicolson as Dieter Klein\n* [[Greg Wise]] as Agent One\n* Tim Berrington as Roger\n* [[Prunella Scales]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n* [[Tasha de Vasconcelos]] as Countess Alexandra\n* [[Nina Young]] as Pegasus' Secretary\n* [[Sam Beazley]] as Elderly Man at the Hospital\n* Kevin Moore as Doctor\n* Jack Raymond as French Reception Waiter\n* [[Jenny Galloway]] as the Foreign Secretary\n* [[Chris Tarrant]] as Radio DJ\n* [[Trevor McDonald]] as Newsreader\n\n== Production ==\nIn March 2000, before the release of ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'', Atkinson signed up to star as a spoof 007, with the news becoming official.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/02/news|title=Rowan Atkinson to star as spoof 007|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2000|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002, ''Johnny English'' [[principal photography]] commenced .

It is a British-American venture produced by [[StudioCanal]] and [[Working Title Films]], and distributed by [[Universal Pictures]].\n\nStarring [[Rowan Atkinson]] in the title role, [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Ben Miller]] and [[John Malkovich]], it is the first instalment of the [[Johnny English (film series)|''Johnny English'' film series]] and serves as a [[parody]]/[[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[spy film|spy genre]], mainly the [[James Bond]] film series as well as Atkinson's [[Mr. Bean (character)|Mr. Bean]] character. The character is also related to Atkinson's bumbling spy character from a series of adverts in the United Kingdom for [[Barclaycard]] in the 1990s.\n\nReleased theatrically in the United States on 18 July 2003, the film met with mixed reviews from critics but was commercially successful, having grossed $160 million worldwide against a budget of $40 million.<ref name=\"boxofficemojo\"/> The film was released in the [[United Kingdom]] on 11 April 2003 and topped the country's box office for the next three weekends, before being overtaken by ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030411|title=Weekend box office 11th April 2003 - 13th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030418|title=Weekend box office 18th April 2003 - 20th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.25thframe.co.uk/charts/chart.php?chart=20030425|title=Weekend box office 25th April 2003 - 27th April 2003|publisher=25thframe.co.uk|accessdate=30 December 2016}}</ref> Due to its commercial success, it was followed by two sequels, ''[[Johnny English Reborn]]'' and ''[[Johnny English Strikes Again]]'', in 2011 and 2018, respectively.\n\n== Plot ==\nJohnny English is a kindhearted but inept [[MI7]] employee, working a desk job while dreaming of being their most trusted agent. After Agent One dies in a [[submarine]] accident unknowingly caused by English, the remaining agents are killed by a bombing at Agent One's funeral, again due to English's incompetence, leaving English as the lone surviving agent capable of finishing Agent One\u2019s mission.\n\nAssigned to thwart a plot to steal the newly restored [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|Crown Jewels]], English meets the mysterious Lorna Campbell at the jewels' unveiling at the [[Tower of London]]. During a sudden blackout, the jewels are stolen. In the chaotic aftermath, English accidentally knocks out the deputy head of security and pretends to fight an imaginary \"assailant\" to cover his mistakes; he makes up a false description of the suspect to MI7 head Pegasus.\n\nEnglish and his assistant Angus Bough discover the jewels were removed via a hole dug beneath their display case. Following the tunnel, they confront the German thieves Dieter Klein and Klaus Vendetta, who escape in a [[hearse]]. After pursuing the wrong hearse, English gatecrashes a funeral. Bough comes to his rescue, pretending English is an escaped mental patient and posing as a doctor from the \"Lunatic Response Unit\".\n\nEnglish connects the thieves to Pascal Sauvage, a French prison entrepreneur who helped restore the jewels. Pegasus finds English\u2019s claims absurd and warns English not to involve Sauvage, as he is his personal friend. In the car park, English and Bough are attacked by Vendetta but are unharmed. English again encounters Campbell in a [[YO! Sushi]] restaurant, recognising her pink [[motorcycle]]. Having seen her at two crime scenes, English\u2019s suspicions deepen when her records cannot be found on any government computer.\n\nEnglish and Bough parachute into Sauvage's headquarters, but English mistakenly lands on an identical tower, the City Hospital. Reaching the correct building, the two learn that Sauvage, a descendant of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], plans to make himself king, using an impostor to impersonate the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Campbell arrives, revealed to be an [[Interpol]] agent tracking Sauvage. With evidence of Sauvage's involvement, English crashes a reception hosted by Sauvage but is suspended by Pegasus for his clumsy actions.\n\nSauvage scraps his plan to use the fake Archbishop and instead sends his minions to force Queen [[Elizabeth II]] to abdicate by threatening her [[Queen Elizabeth's corgis|corgis]], causing the entire [[Succession to the British throne|line of succession]] to be swept clean for Sauvage to become king. Campbell, now placed in charge of the assignment by Pegasus, visits the depressed English and convinces him to travel with her to Sauvage's French [[ch\u00e2teau]] to investigate. Eavesdropping on Sauvage's meeting with internationally renowned criminals, English and Campbell learn he plans to transform all of England into the world's biggest prison. The agents are exposed when English accidentally activates a microphone, and they are taken prisoner.\n\nBough rescues English and Campbell and they race to stop Sauvage's coronation. English crashes the coronation and discovers the Archbishop in attendance is genuine. Undeterred, English orders Bough to play the incriminating DVD, only to find it is footage of himself lip-syncing to [[ABBA]]'s \"[[Does Your Mother Know]]\" in his underclothes; Sauvage had bugged English's flat. Sneaking away, English swings in to steal [[St. Edward\u2019s Crown]] from the Archbishop. Sauvage attempts to kill English, who drops the crown. However, English falls from the wire, lands on the throne, and is crowned instead; the laws of succession mean English is now technically the King of England. In his singular act as king, English has Sauvage arrested and restores the Queen to the throne, simply requesting a [[knighthood]] as a reward.\n\nSauvage is awaiting trial for [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], while English and Campbell drive to southern [[France]] for a romantic holiday, only for English to accidentally eject her out of his car while leaning in to kiss her. In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits scene]], Lorna lands in a hotel swimming pool, where Bough is vacationing alongside a man identical to the fictitious assailant English described to Pegasus.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Rowan Atkinson]] as Johnny English\n* [[Natalie Imbruglia]] as Lorna Campbell, an INTERPOL agent\n* [[Ben Miller]] as Angus Bough, English's partner in the field\n* [[John Malkovich]] as Pascal Edward Sauvage, the main antagonist, the distant descendant of [[James II of England|James II]]\n* [[Oliver Ford Davies]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]\n* [[Tim Pigott-Smith]] as Pegasus\n* [[Kevin McNally]] as the Prime Minister\n* Douglas McFerran as Klaus Vendetta\n* Steve Nicolson as Dieter Klein\n* [[Greg Wise]] as Agent One\n* Tim Berrington as Roger\n* [[Prunella Scales]] as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]\n* [[Tasha de Vasconcelos]] as Countess Alexandra\n* [[Nina Young]] as Pegasus' Secretary\n* [[Sam Beazley]] as Elderly Man at the Hospital\n* Kevin Moore as Doctor\n* Jack Raymond as French Reception Waiter\n* [[Jenny Galloway]] as the Foreign Secretary\n* [[Chris Tarrant]] as Radio DJ\n* [[Trevor McDonald]] as Newsreader\n\n== Production ==\nIn March 2000, before the release of ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'', Atkinson signed up to star as a spoof 007, with the news becoming official.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/02/news|title=Rowan Atkinson to star as spoof 007|work=The Guardian|date=2 March 2000|accessdate=4 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2002, ''Johnny English'' [[principal photography]] commenced .

These are crossed by spirals, of which a subsutural one is beaded, as well as those on the angle of keel ; above this latter are a few faint spirals and more numerous ones on lower part of whorls, 4 on penultimate, about 20 on the body whorl and siphonal canal, faintly beaded or crenuliferous at the points of intercrossing. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is elongately oval, with a rather blunt angle above, ending below in a rather narrow siphonal canal. The [[Peristome (gastropod)|peristome]] is broken. The columellar margin is slightly concave above, straight below and along the siphonal canal, with a thin layer of enamel.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/prosobranchiaofs46sche Schepman, 1913.

The order includes [[tree]]s, [[shrub|bush]]es, [[liana]]s, and [[herbaceous]] plants. Together with ordinary [[Photosynthesis|autophytic]] plants, the Ericales include [[chlorophyll]]-deficient [[mycoheterotrophic]] plants (e.g., ''[[Sarcodes sanguinea]]'') and [[carnivorous plant]]s (e.g., genus ''[[Sarracenia]]'').\n\nMany species have five petals, often grown together. Fusion of the petals as a trait was traditionally used to place the order in the subclass [[Sympetalae]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robyns|first=W.|title=Outline of a New System of Orders and Families of Sympetalae|journal=Bulletin du Jardin Botanique National Belgique|date=31 December 1972|volume=42|issue=4|pages=363\u2013372|jstor=3667661|doi=10.2307/3667661}}<!--|accessdate=23 October 2011--></ref>\n\n[[Mycorrhizal association|Mycorrhiza]] is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of mycorrhiza are found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). In addition, some families among the order are notable for their exceptional ability to accumulate [[aluminum]].<ref>(Jansen et al., 2004).</ref>\n\nEricales are a cosmopolitan order. Areas of distribution of families vary largely - while some are restricted to tropics, others exist mainly in Arctic or temperate regions. The entire order contains over 8,000 species, of which the Ericaceae account for 2,000-4,000 species (by various estimates).\n\n== Economic importance ==\nThe most commercially used plant in the order is [[tea]] (''Camellia sinensis'') from the family [[Theaceae]]. The order also includes some edible fruits, including [[kiwifruit]] (''Actinidia deliciosa''), [[persimmon]] (genus ''Diospyros''), [[blueberry]], [[huckleberry]], [[cranberry]], [[Brazil nut]], and [[Mamey sapote]]. The order also includes [[Vitellaria|shea]] (''Vitellaria paradoxa''), which is the major dietary lipid source for millions of sub-Saharan Africans.  Many Ericales species are cultivated for their showy flowers: well-known examples are [[azalea]], [[rhododendron]], [[camellia]], [[Calluna|heather]], [[Primula|polyanthus]], [[cyclamen]], [[phlox]], and [[busy Lizzie]].\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThese families are recognized in the [[APG III system]]<ref name=APGIII2009/> as members of the Ericales:\n\n* Family [[Actinidiaceae]] ([[kiwifruit]] family)\n* Family [[Balsaminaceae]] ([[Impatiens|balsam]] family)[[File:Balsam I IMG 9566.jpg|thumb|''[[Impatiens balsamina]]'' from the [[Balsaminaceae]] ]]\n* Family [[Clethraceae]] ([[clethra]] family)\n* Family [[Cyrillaceae]] ([[cyrilla]] family)\n* Family [[Diapensiaceae]]\n* Family [[Ebenaceae]] ([[ebony]] and [[persimmon]] family)\n* Family [[Ericaceae]] ([[Erica|heath]], [[rhododendron]], and [[Vaccinium|blueberry]] family)\n* Family [[Fouquieria]]ceae ([[ocotillo]] family)\n* Family [[Lecythidaceae]] ([[Brazil nut]] family)\n* Family [[Marcgraviaceae]]\n* Family [[Mitrastemonaceae]]\n* Family [[Pentaphylacaceae]]\n* Family [[Polemoniaceae]] ([[phlox]] family)\n* Family [[Primulaceae]] ([[Primula|primrose]] and [[Soldanella|snowbell]] family) [[File:Primula rosea I IMG 7210.jpg|thumb|''[[Primula rosea]]'' from the [[Primulaceae]] ]]\n* Family [[Roridula]]ceae\n* Family [[Sapotaceae]] ([[sapodilla]] family)\n* Family [[Sarraceniaceae]] (American [[pitcher plant]] family)\n* Family [[Sladeniaceae]]\n* Family [[Styracaceae]] ([[Halesia|silverbell]] family)\n* Family [[Symplocaceae]] (sapphireberry family)\n* Family [[Tetrameristaceae]]\n* Family [[Theaceae]] ([[Camellia sinensis|tea]] and [[camellia]] family)\n\nThese families are not recognized in the [[APG III system]]<ref name=APGIII2009/> but have been in common use in the recent past:\n\n* Family [[Myrsinaceae]] ([[cyclamen]] and [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] family) \u2192 Primulaceae\n* Family [[Pellicieraceae]] \u2192 Tetrameristaceae\n* Family Maesaceae \u2192 Primulaceae\n* Family Ternstroemiaceae \u2192 Pentaphylacaceae\n* Family [[Theophrastaceae]] \u2192 Primulaceae\n\nThese make up a basal group of [[asterid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bremer|first=Birgitta|author2=K\u00e5re Bremera |author3=Nahid Heidaria |author4=Per Erixona |author5=Richard G.

Together with ordinary [[Photosynthesis|autophytic]] plants, the Ericales include [[chlorophyll]]-deficient [[mycoheterotrophic]] plants (e.g., ''[[Sarcodes sanguinea]]'') and [[carnivorous plant]]s (e.g., genus ''[[Sarracenia]]'').\n\nMany species have five petals, often grown together. Fusion of the petals as a trait was traditionally used to place the order in the subclass [[Sympetalae]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robyns|first=W.|title=Outline of a New System of Orders and Families of Sympetalae|journal=Bulletin du Jardin Botanique National Belgique|date=31 December 1972|volume=42|issue=4|pages=363\u2013372|jstor=3667661|doi=10.2307/3667661}}<!--|accessdate=23 October 2011--></ref>\n\n[[Mycorrhizal association|Mycorrhiza]] is quite common among the order representatives, and three kinds of mycorrhiza can be found exclusively among Ericales (namely, ericoid, arbutoid and monotropoid mycorrhiza). In addition, some families among the order are notable for their exceptional ability to accumulate [[aluminum]].<ref>(Jansen et al., 2004).</ref>\n\nEricales are a cosmopolitan order. Areas of distribution of families vary largely - while some are restricted to tropics, others exist mainly in Arctic or temperate regions. The entire order contains over 8,000 species, of which the Ericaceae account for 2,000-4,000 species (by various estimates).\n\n== Economic importance ==\nThe most commercially used plant in the order is [[tea]] (''Camellia sinensis'') from the family [[Theaceae]]. The order also includes some edible fruits, including [[kiwifruit]] (''Actinidia deliciosa''), [[persimmon]] (genus ''Diospyros''), [[blueberry]], [[huckleberry]], [[cranberry]], [[Brazil nut]], and [[Mamey sapote]]. The order also includes [[Vitellaria|shea]] (''Vitellaria paradoxa''), which is the major dietary lipid source for millions of sub-Saharan Africans.  Many Ericales species are cultivated for their showy flowers: well-known examples are [[azalea]], [[rhododendron]], [[camellia]], [[Calluna|heather]], [[Primula|polyanthus]], [[cyclamen]], [[phlox]], and [[busy Lizzie]].\n\n== Classification ==\n\nThese families are recognized in the [[APG III system]]<ref name=APGIII2009/> as members of the Ericales:\n\n* Family [[Actinidiaceae]] ([[kiwifruit]] family)\n* Family [[Balsaminaceae]] ([[Impatiens|balsam]] family)[[File:Balsam I IMG 9566.jpg|thumb|''[[Impatiens balsamina]]'' from the [[Balsaminaceae]] ]]\n* Family [[Clethraceae]] ([[clethra]] family)\n* Family [[Cyrillaceae]] ([[cyrilla]] family)\n* Family [[Diapensiaceae]]\n* Family [[Ebenaceae]] ([[ebony]] and [[persimmon]] family)\n* Family [[Ericaceae]] ([[Erica|heath]], [[rhododendron]], and [[Vaccinium|blueberry]] family)\n* Family [[Fouquieria]]ceae ([[ocotillo]] family)\n* Family [[Lecythidaceae]] ([[Brazil nut]] family)\n* Family [[Marcgraviaceae]]\n* Family [[Mitrastemonaceae]]\n* Family [[Pentaphylacaceae]]\n* Family [[Polemoniaceae]] ([[phlox]] family)\n* Family [[Primulaceae]] ([[Primula|primrose]] and [[Soldanella|snowbell]] family) [[File:Primula rosea I IMG 7210.jpg|thumb|''[[Primula rosea]]'' from the [[Primulaceae]] ]]\n* Family [[Roridula]]ceae\n* Family [[Sapotaceae]] ([[sapodilla]] family)\n* Family [[Sarraceniaceae]] (American [[pitcher plant]] family)\n* Family [[Sladeniaceae]]\n* Family [[Styracaceae]] ([[Halesia|silverbell]] family)\n* Family [[Symplocaceae]] (sapphireberry family)\n* Family [[Tetrameristaceae]]\n* Family [[Theaceae]] ([[Camellia sinensis|tea]] and [[camellia]] family)\n\nThese families are not recognized in the [[APG III system]]<ref name=APGIII2009/> but have been in common use in the recent past:\n\n* Family [[Myrsinaceae]] ([[cyclamen]] and [[Anagallis arvensis|scarlet pimpernel]] family) \u2192 Primulaceae\n* Family [[Pellicieraceae]] \u2192 Tetrameristaceae\n* Family Maesaceae \u2192 Primulaceae\n* Family Ternstroemiaceae \u2192 Pentaphylacaceae\n* Family [[Theophrastaceae]] \u2192 Primulaceae\n\nThese make up a basal group of [[asterid]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bremer|first=Birgitta|author2=K\u00e5re Bremera |author3=Nahid Heidaria |author4=Per Erixona |author5=Richard G.
