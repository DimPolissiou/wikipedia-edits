{"title_page": "Gaslighting", "text_new": "{{short description|Psychological manipulation via being made to question one's own judgment}}\n{{Other uses|Gaslight (disambiguation)}}\n'''Gaslighting''' is a form of [[psychological manipulation]] in which a person or a group covertly sows seeds of doubt in a targeted individual, making them question their own memory, perception, or judgment, often evoking in them [[cognitive dissonance]] and other changes such as low [[self-esteem]]. Using [[denial]], misdirection, contradiction, and [[misinformation]], gaslighting involves attempts to [[Destabilisation#Psychology|destabilize]] the victim and delegitimize the victim's beliefs. Instances can range from the denial by an [[abuse]]r that previous abusive incidents occurred to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim.\n\nThe term originated from the play ''[[Gas Light]]'' (1938, but originally performed as ''Angel Street'' in the United States) and its [[Gaslight (1940 film)|1940]] and [[Gaslight (1944 film)|1944]] film adaptations (both titled ''Gaslight'').

The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the [[Gas lighting|gas lights]] in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. He further uses the lights in the sealed-off attic to secretly search for jewels belonging to a woman whom he has murdered. He makes loud noises as he searches, including talking to himself. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, noises and voices, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.<ref name=\"Stern\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-khhWM72pC8C|title=The Gaslight Effect: How to Spot and Survive the Hidden Manipulation Others Use to Control Your Life|last=Stern|first=Robin|date=2007-05-01|location=New York|publisher=Morgan Road Books|isbn=9780767924450|oclc=85766223|accessdate=2014-01-06}}</ref>{{rp|8}} He intends on having her assessed and committed to a mental institution, after which he will be able to gain power of attorney over her and search more effectively.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe term \"gaslighting\" has been used colloquially since the 1960s<ref>{{Cite OED|gaslight}} ''1969 S.

The authors explored a variety of reasons why the victims may have \"a tendency to incorporate and assimilate what others externalize and project onto them\", and concluded that gaslighting may be \"a very complex highly structured configuration which encompasses contributions from many elements of the psychic apparatus\".<ref name=\"Calef-Weinshel\" /> \n\nLater, psychiatrist Theodore Dorpat described this \"transfer\" of the victimizer's unconscious psychic contents as an example of [[projective identification]].<ref name=\"Dorpat\">{{cite journal|last=Dorpat|first=Theo.

It becomes destructive when the victim as well [[Identification (psychology)|identifies]] with the contents of the \"transfer\" (what has been projected). These effects however are cancelled when the victim becomes capable of disbelieving and [[wiktionary:disidentify|disidentifying]] with the negative [[Introjection|introjects]] that result from projective identification.\n\n== In personality disorders ==\n[[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|Sociopaths]]<ref name=\"Stout2006\" /> and [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissists]]<ref name=\"Greenberg\">{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-narcissism/201709/are-you-being-gaslighted-the-narcissist-in-your-life|title=Are You Being 'Gaslighted' By the Narcissist in Your Life?|last1=Greenberg|first1=Elinor|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Sussex Publisher|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> frequently use gaslighting tactics to abuse and undermine their victims.
