Maybe it's because of that.

The church, facing the [[Via Giulia]], was built during the [[Italian Baroque|Baroque age]]. San Filippo was supposed to be demolished together with the surrounding neighborhood in the late 1930s, but due to the onset of WWII the demolition was halted. Abandoned and desecrated after the war, it has been restored in 2000, but maintains a secular usage and is not accessible.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Nolli 1748 San Filippo Neri in Via Giulia.JPG|thumb|left|San Filippo Neri (red arrow) and its Oratory (blue arrow) in their original context in the map of Rome of [[Giambattista Nolli]] (1748)]]\nThe church is located in [[Rome]]'s [[Regola]] [[rioni of Rome|rione]], about halfway down [[Via Giulia]] (at the n. 134B), its facade facing west-southwest, in a neighborhood still devastated by the demolitions of the 1930s.\n\n==Denominations==\nThe church, originally dedicated to [[Saint Trophimus]], was then dedicated to Philip Neri and, because of its tiny area, nicknamed by the roman populace \"San Filippino\" (\"Little Saint Philip\").<ref name=arm422/>\n\n==History==\nThe church was erected in 1623 (or, according to another source, in 1603)<ref name=bu705/> along [[via Giulia]].<ref name=pie7916>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 16</ref> The building's client was Rutilio Brandi, a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] glove maker native of [[San Gimignano]].<ref name=pie7916/> Brandi was ''penitente'' of [[Philip Neri]] and  ''Governatore'' of the \"Compagnia delle Santissime Piaghe di Ges\u00f9\" (\"Company of the most holy wounds of [[Jesus]]\"), an institute founded in 1617 and whose members were Florentines living in Rome.<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422>Armellini (1891), p. 422</ref> Since he was ill with [[gout]], Brandi had the church [[dedication|dedicated]] to [[Saint Trophimus]], the protector of the gouties.<ref name=pie7916/> Moreover, in the building which embeds the church Brandi founded two charitable works: a little hospital for priests, and an institute for poor girls, dedicated to Philip Neri.<ref name=pie7918/><ref name=arm422/><ref name=del476>Delli (1988), p. 476</ref> Because of that, the shrine's dedication changed with time to [[San Filippo Neri]], the \"apostle of Rome\".<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nIn 1728 the church was restored by [[Filippo Raguzzini]] on behalf of [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (r. 1724-1730); the main work was the new facade, erected between May and October 1728 with a total expense of 500 ''[[Italian scudo|scudi]]''.<ref name=pie7916/> The church facade was demolished again and rebuilt between 1767 and 1768 according to a project of [[Giovanni Francesco Fiori]], in an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style between [[Roman Baroque|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]].<ref name=dbi>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-francesco-fiori_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Fiori, Giovanni Francesco|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |first=Tommaso|last=Manfredi|volume=48 |year=1997|language=it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1797, when the French because of the [[treaty of Tolentino]] pretended a large amount of money from the Pope, San Filippo was the only church in Rome to keep its silver [[reliquary]], since the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church refused to give it to [[Pius VI]] (r. 1775-1799).<ref name=del476/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nSince it is only about 100 metres from the [[Tiber]], the church was severely damaged during a flood in 1853,<ref name=bu705/> and due to that was restored under [[Pope Pius IX]] (r. 1846-1878) in the same year.<ref name=pie7916/>\n\nAs part of the demolition works ordered by [[Benito Mussolini]] <ref name=bu705/> in 1938 for the construction of a wide avenue between [[Ponte Mazzini]] and the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]],<ref>Mazzotta (2014), pp. 185-187</ref> almost all the buildings around the church were demolished, and the church itself, desecrated, was spared only because of the project stop due to the beginning of WWII.<ref name=pie7916/> After that, the works of art disappeared into hitherto unknown hands or are completely lost.<ref name=bu705/> The building then fell into disrepair:<ref name=bu705/> it served as a wood storage <ref name=bu705/> and as a deposit for the fruit and vegetables street market of nearby ''vicolo della Moretta''.

The church, facing the [[Via Giulia]], was built during the [[Italian Baroque|Baroque age]]. San Filippo was supposed to be demolished together with the surrounding neighborhood in the late 1930s, but due to the onset of WWII the demolition was halted. Abandoned and desecrated after the war, it has been restored in 2000, but maintains a secular usage and is not accessible.\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Nolli 1748 San Filippo Neri in Via Giulia.JPG|thumb|left|San Filippo Neri (red arrow) and its Oratory (blue arrow) in their original context in the map of Rome of [[Giambattista Nolli]] (1748)]]\nThe church is located in [[Rome]]'s [[Regola]] [[rioni of Rome|rione]], about halfway down [[Via Giulia]] (at the n. 134B), its facade facing west-southwest, in a neighborhood still devastated by the demolitions of the 1930s.\n\n==Denominations==\nThe church, originally dedicated to [[Saint Trophimus]], was then dedicated to Philip Neri and, because of its tiny area, nicknamed by the roman populace \"San Filippino\" (\"Little Saint Philip\").<ref name=arm422/>\n\n==History==\nThe church was erected in 1623 (or, according to another source, in 1603)<ref name=bu705/> along [[via Giulia]].<ref name=pie7916>Pietrangeli (1979), p. 16</ref> The building's client was Rutilio Brandi, a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] glove maker native of [[San Gimignano]].<ref name=pie7916/> Brandi was ''penitente'' of [[Philip Neri]] and  ''Governatore'' of the \"Compagnia delle Santissime Piaghe di Ges\u00f9\" (\"Company of the most holy wounds of [[Jesus]]\"), an institute founded in 1617 and whose members were Florentines living in Rome.<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422>Armellini (1891), p. 422</ref> Since he was ill with [[gout]], Brandi had the church [[dedication|dedicated]] to [[Saint Trophimus]], the protector of the gouties.<ref name=pie7916/> Moreover, in the building which embeds the church Brandi founded two charitable works: a little hospital for priests, and an institute for poor girls, dedicated to Philip Neri.<ref name=pie7918/><ref name=arm422/><ref name=del476>Delli (1988), p. 476</ref> Because of that, the shrine's dedication changed with time to [[San Filippo Neri]], the \"apostle of Rome\".<ref name=pie7916/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nIn 1728 the church was restored by [[Filippo Raguzzini]] on behalf of [[Pope Benedict XIII]] (r. 1724-1730); the main work was the new facade, erected between May and October 1728 with a total expense of 500 ''[[Italian scudo|scudi]]''.<ref name=pie7916/> The church facade was demolished again and rebuilt between 1767 and 1768 according to a project of [[Giovanni Francesco Fiori]], in an [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] style between [[Roman Baroque|Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassic]].<ref name=dbi>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-francesco-fiori_(Dizionario-Biografico)/|title=Fiori, Giovanni Francesco|encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |first=Tommaso|last=Manfredi|volume=48 |year=1997|language=it}}</ref>\n\nIn 1797, when the French because of the [[treaty of Tolentino]] pretended a large amount of money from the Pope, San Filippo was the only church in Rome to keep its silver [[reliquary]], since the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of the church refused to give it to [[Pius VI]] (r. 1775-1799).<ref name=del476/><ref name=arm422/>\n\nSince it is only about 100 metres from the [[Tiber]], the church was severely damaged during a flood in 1853,<ref name=bu705/> and due to that was restored under [[Pope Pius IX]] (r. 1846-1878) in the same year.<ref name=pie7916/>\n\nAs part of the demolition works ordered by [[Benito Mussolini]] <ref name=bu705/> in 1938 for the construction of a wide avenue between [[Ponte Mazzini]] and the [[Santa Maria in Vallicella|Chiesa Nuova]],<ref>Mazzotta (2014), pp. 185-187</ref> almost all the buildings around the church were demolished, and the church itself, desecrated, was spared only because of the stop of the project due to the beginning of WWII.<ref name=pie7916/> After that, the works of art disappeared into hitherto unknown hands or are completely lost.<ref name=bu705/> The building then fell into disrepair:<ref name=bu705/> it served as a wood storage <ref name=bu705/> and as a deposit for the fruit and vegetables street market of nearby ''vicolo della Moretta''.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society.

South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Common [[mating]] or [[Reproduction|reproductively]] motivated systems include [[Monogamous pairing in animals|monogamy]], [[polygyny]], [[polyandry]], [[polygamy]] and [[promiscuity]]. Other sexual behaviour may be reproductively motivated (e.g. [[Sexual coercion|sex apparently due to duress or coercion]] and [[situational sexual behaviour]]) or [[Non-reproductive sexual behavior in animals|non-reproductively motivated]] (e.g. [[cross-species sex|interspecific sexuality]], sexual arousal from objects or places, [[Necrophilia in animals|sex with dead animals]], [[Homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual sexual behaviour]], and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] sexual behaviour).\n\nWhen animal sexual behaviour is reproductively motivated, it is often termed ''mating'' or ''[[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]]''; for most non-human [[mammal]]s, mating and copulation occur at [[Estrous cycle|oestrus]] (the most fertile period in the mammalian female's reproductive cycle), which increases the chances of [[internal fertilization|successful impregnation]].<ref name=\"Kent\">{{Cite book |author= Kent, Michael |title= Advanced biology |isbn= 978-0-19-914195-1 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |year= 2000 |pages= 250\u2013253 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=8aw4ZWLABQkC&pg=PA250}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= General Studies Manual |publisher= [[Pearson Education|Pearson Education India]]|year= 2009 |page=17 |isbn= 9788131721339 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oAo1X2eagywC&pg=RA1-PR17 |last=Thorpe |first=Showick |last2=Thorpe |first2=Edgar}}</ref> Some animal sexual behaviour involves [[Competition (biology)|competition]], sometimes fighting, between multiple males. Females often select males for mating only if they appear strong and able to protect themselves. The male that wins a fight may also have the chance to mate with a larger number of females and will therefore pass on his genes to their offspring.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Wickler, Wolfgang |author2=Lorenz |author3=Konrad |author4=Kacher, Hermann |title= The sexual code : the social behaviour of animals and men |year= 1974}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, it was believed that only humans and a small number of other species performed sexual acts other than for reproduction, and that animals' sexuality was instinctive and a simple \"[[stimulus-response]]\" behaviour. However, in addition to homosexual behaviours, a range of species [[masturbate]] and may [[Tool use by animals|use objects as tools]] to help them do so. Sexual behaviour may be tied more strongly to establishment and maintenance of complex social bonds across a population which support its success in non-reproductive ways. Both reproductive and non-reproductive behaviours can be related to expressions of dominance over another animal or survival within a stressful situation (such as sex due to duress or coercion).\n\n==Mating systems==\nIn [[sociobiology]] and [[behavioural ecology]], the term [[Mating systems#In animals|\"mating system\"]] is used to describe the ways in which animal societies are structured in relation to sexual behaviour. The mating system specifies which males mate with which females, and under what circumstances.

According to Ulrich Reichard (2003):\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;\">\nSocial monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g., shared use of a territory, behaviour indicative of a social pair, and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns. In humans, social monogamy takes the form of monogamous marriage. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. Finally, the term genetic monogamy is used when DNA analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. A combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide, e.g., sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual, and social and genetic monogamous relationships, respectively.<ref>Reichard, U.H. (2003). Monogamy: Past and present. In U.H. Reichard and C. Boesch (Eds.), Monogamy: Mating strategies and partnerships in birds, humans, and other mammals, pp. 3\u201325, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521819733}}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWhatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.\n\nSocial monogamy is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. The actual incidence of social monogamy varies greatly across different branches of the evolutionary tree. Over 90% of avian species are socially monogamous.<ref name=\"Reichard, 2002\">{{cite journal|last=Reichard |first=U.H. |year=2002 |title=Monogamy \u2013 a variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62\u201367 |url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514183645/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Barash, Lipton, 2001\">Barash, D.P. & Lipton, J.E.

Many socially monogamous species engage in [[extra-pair copulation]]s, making them sexually non-monogamous. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, \"on average, 30% or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male.\"<ref name=\"NY Times Mating\">{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC143FF932A1575BC0A966958260 |work= The New York Times |title= Mating for Life?

For a few rare species, the incidence of genetic monogamy is 100%, with all offspring genetically related to the socially monogamous pair. But genetic monogamy is strikingly low in other species. Barash and Lipton note:\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;\">\nThe highest known frequency of extra-pair copulations are found among the [[fairy-wren]]s, lovely tropical creatures technically known as ''[[Malurus splendens]]'' and ''[[Malurus cyaneus]]''. More than 65% of all fairy-wren chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding group.<ref name=\"Barash, Lipton, 2001\" />{{sup|p. 12}}\n</blockquote>\n\nSuch low levels of genetic monogamy have surprised biologists and zoologists, forcing them to rethink the role of social monogamy in evolution. They can no longer assume social monogamy determines how genes are distributed in a species. The lower the rates of genetic monogamy among socially monogamous pairs, the less of a role social monogamy plays in determining how genes are distributed among offspring.\n\n===Polygyny===\n{{Main|Polygyny in animals}}\n\n[[Polygyny threshold model|Polygyny]] occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In some species, notably those with [[harem (zoology)|harem]]-like structures, only one of a few males in a group of females will mate. Technically, [[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]] in sociobiology and zoology is defined as a system in which a male has a relationship with more than one female, but the females are predominantly bonded to a single male. Should the active male be driven out, killed, or otherwise removed from the group, in a number of species the new male will ensure that breeding resources are not wasted on another male's young.<ref>This section and examples taken from [[Robert Sapolsky]] (1998) ''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'', W.H.

This is a result of [[anisogamy]], where [[sperm]] are smaller and much less costly (energetically) to produce than [[egg]]s.

In marine species with limited mobility and [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] like [[coral]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[clam]]s, the timing of the common spawning is the only externally visible form of sexual behaviour. In areas with continuously high [[primary production]], some species have a series of breeding seasons throughout the year. This is the case with most primates (who are primarily tropical and subtropical animals). Some animals ([[opportunistic breeders]]) breed dependent upon other conditions in their environment aside from time of year.\n\n===Mammals===\nMating seasons are often associated with changes to herd or group structure, and behavioural changes, including territorialism amongst individuals. These may be annual (e.g. [[Wolves#Reproduction|wolves]]), biannual (e.g. [[canine reproduction|dogs]]) or more frequently (e.g. horses). During these periods, females of most mammalian species are more mentally and physically receptive to sexual advances, a period scientifically described as [[estrous|oestrus]] but commonly described as being \"in season\" or \"in heat\". Sexual behaviour may occur outside oestrus,<ref>For example, masturbation, trial mounting, and other behaviours are regularly seen in male animals out of season</ref> and such acts as do occur are not necessarily harmful.<ref name=\"danish\">Denmark, Det Dyreetiske R\u00e5d, [https://www.justitsministeriet.dk/sites/default/files/media/Pressemeddelelser/pdf/2006/Udtalelse.pdf Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr] (Copenhagen: Justitsministeriet, November 2006), p. 24. \"Slimhinden i hundyrets vagina og dyrets adf\u00e6rd er under indflydelse af dets brunstcyklus.

If the female clownfish is removed from the group, such as by death, one of the largest and most dominant males will become a female. The remaining males will move up a rank in the hierarchy.\n\n==Motivation==\nVarious [[neurohormone]]s stimulate sexual wanting in animals. In general, studies have suggested that [[dopamine]] is involved in sexual incentive motivation, [[oxytocin]] and [[melanocortin]]s in sexual attraction, and [[noradrenaline]] in sexual arousal.<ref name=\"georgiadis\">{{cite journal | author = Georgiadis, J.

In contrast, [[montane vole]]s have a [[polygamous]] mating system. When montane voles mate, they form no strong attachments, and separate after copulation. Studies{{Citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=No citation is given for the study referenced in the text.}} on the brains of these two species have found that it is two neurohormones and their respective receptors that are responsible for these differences in mating strategies. Male prairie voles release vasopressin after copulation with a partner, and an attachment to their partner then develops. Female prairie voles release oxytocin after copulation with a partner, and similarly develop an attachment to their partner.\n\nNeither male nor female montane voles release high quantities of oxytocin or vasopressin when they mate. Even when injected with these neurohormones, their mating system does not change. In contrast, if prairie voles are injected with the neurohormones, they may form a lifelong attachment, even if they have not mated. It's believed{{By whom|date=May 2017}} that the differing response to the neurohormones between the two species is due to a difference in the number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Prairie voles have a greater number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors compared to montane voles, and are therefore more sensitive to those two neurohormones. It's believed that it's the quantity of receptors, rather than the quantity of the hormones, that determines the mating system and bond-formation of either species.\n\n===Oxytocin and rat sexual behaviour===\nMother rats experience a [[Estrous cycle|postpartum estrus]] which makes them highly motivated to mate. However, they also have a strong motivation to protect their newly born pups. As a consequence, the mother rat solicits males to the nest but simultaneously becomes aggressive towards them to protect her young. If the mother rat is given injections of an oxytocin [[receptor antagonist]], they no longer experience these maternal motivations.<ref name=\"Kennet\">{{cite journal|author1=Kennett, J.E. |author2=McKee, D.T.|year=2012|title=Oxytocin: An emerging regulator of prolactin secretion in the female rat|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=403\u2013412|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2011.02263.x|pmc=3288386| pmid= 22129099}}</ref>\n\nProlactin influences social bonding in rats.<ref name=\"Kennet\" />\n\n===Oxytocin and primate sexual behaviour===\nOxytocin plays a similar role in non-human primates as it does in humans.\n\nGrooming, sex, and cuddling frequencies correlate positively with levels of oxytocin. As the level of oxytocin increases so does sexual motivation. While oxytocin plays a major role in parent child relationships, it is also found to play a role in adult sexual relationships. Its secretion affects the nature of the relationship or if there will even be a relationship at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Pieper|first2=Bridget A.|last3=Boe|first3=Carla Y.|last4=Cronin|first4=Katherine A.|last5=Kurian|first5=Aimee V.|last6=Ziegler|first6=Toni E.|title=Variation in oxytocin is related to variation in affiliative behavior in monogamous, pairbonded tamarins|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=58|issue=4|pages=614\u2013618|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.06.014|pmid=20600045|pmc=2933949|year=2010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-2863-F}}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that oxytocin is higher in monkeys in lifelong monogamous relationships compared to monkeys which are single. Furthermore, the oxytocin levels of the couples correlate positively; when the oxytocin secretion of one increases the other one also increases. Higher levels of oxytocin are related to monkeys expressing more behaviours such as cuddling, grooming and sex, while lower levels of oxytocin reduce motivation for these activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nResearch on oxytocin's role in the animal brain suggests that it plays less of a role in behaviours of love and affection than previously believed. \"When oxytocin was first discovered in 1909, it was thought mostly to influence a mother\u2019s labour contractions and milk let-down. Then, in the 1990s, research with prairie voles found that giving them a dose of oxytocin resulted in the formation of a bond with their future mate (Azar, 40).\" Oxytocin has since been treated by the media as the sole player in the \"love and mating game\" in mammals. This view, however, is proving to be false as, \"most hormones don\u2019t influence behaviour directly. Rather, they affect thinking and emotions in variable ways (Azar, 40).\" There is much more involved in sexual behaviour in the mammalian animal than oxytocin and vasopressin can explain.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lambert |first= K. |title= The Lab Rat Chronicles |year= 2011 |publisher= penguin group |location= New York |pages= 151\u2013172}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Azar |first= B. |title= Oxytocin's other side |url= http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/03/oxytocin.aspx |date= March 2011 |volume= 42 |issue= 3 |page= 40 |journal= Science Watch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aubert | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gustison | first2 = M.

It is probable that they mate because they are motivated for the actual copulation, and because this is connected with a positive experience. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is some form of pleasure or satisfaction connected with the act. This assumption is confirmed by the behaviour of males, who in the case of many species are prepared to work to get access to female animals, especially if the female animal is in oestrus, and males who for breeding purposes are used to [[semen collection|having sperm collected]] become very eager, when the equipment they associate with the collection is taken out. . . . There is nothing in [[female mammals]]' anatomy or physiology that contradicts that [[sexual stimulation|stimulation of the sexual organs]] and mating is able to be a positive experience. For instance, the clitoris acts in the same way as with women, and scientific studies have shown that the success of reproduction is improved by stimulation of clitoris on (among other species) cows and mares in connection with insemination, because it improves the transportation of the sperm due to contractions of the inner genitalia. This probably also applies to female animals of other animal species, and contractions in the inner genitals are seen e.g. also during orgasm for women. It is therefore reasonable to assume that sexual intercourse may be linked with a positive experience for female animals.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Koinophilia==\n{{Main|Koinophilia}}\n\n[[Koinophilia]] is the love of the \"normal\" or phenotypically common (from the Greek {{Lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2|size=90%}}, {{Lang|grc-Latn|koin\u00f3s}}, meaning \"usual\" or \"common\").<ref name=Koeslag1990>{{cite journal | last1 = Koeslag | first1 = J.H. | year = 1990 | title = Koinophilia groups sexual creatures into species, promotes stasis, and stabilizes social behaviour | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 15\u201335 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80297-8 | pmid=2200930}}</ref> The term was introduced to scientific literature in 1990, and refers to the tendency of animals seeking a mate to prefer that mate not to have any unusual, peculiar or deviant features.<ref name=Koeslag1990 /> Similarly, animals preferentially choose mates with low [[fluctuating asymmetry]].<ref name=\"Moller\">{{cite journal|author1=Moller, A.P.  |author2=Pomiankowski, A |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and sexual selection|journal=Genetica|volume=89|issue=1\u20133 |pages=267\u2013279|year=1993|doi=10.1007/bf02424520}}</ref> However, animal sexual ornaments can evolve through runaway selection, which is driven by (usually female) selection for non-standard traits.<ref name=Blind>Dawkins, Richard (1986).

According to Ulrich Reichard (2003):\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;\">\nSocial monogamy refers to a male and female's social living arrangement (e.g., shared use of a territory, behaviour indicative of a social pair, and/or proximity between a male and female) without inferring any sexual interactions or reproductive patterns. In humans, social monogamy takes the form of monogamous marriage. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. Finally, the term genetic monogamy is used when DNA analyses can confirm that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. A combination of terms indicates examples where levels of relationships coincide, e.g., sociosexual and sociogenetic monogamy describe corresponding social and sexual, and social and genetic monogamous relationships, respectively.<ref>Reichard, U.H.

Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations.\n\nSocial monogamy is relatively rare in the animal kingdom. The actual incidence of social monogamy varies greatly across different branches of the evolutionary tree. Over 90% of avian species are socially monogamous.<ref name=\"Reichard, 2002\">{{cite journal|last=Reichard |first=U.H. |year=2002 |title=Monogamy \u2013 a variable relationship |journal=Max Planck Research |volume=3 |pages=62\u201367 |url=http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |accessdate=24 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514183645/http://www.mpg.de/1028786/W001_Biology-Medicine_062_067.pdf |archivedate=14 May 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Barash, Lipton, 2001\">Barash, D.P. & Lipton, J.E.

Many socially monogamous species engage in [[extra-pair copulation]]s, making them sexually non-monogamous. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, \"on average, 30% or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male.\"<ref name=\"NY Times Mating\">{{cite news |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CEFDC143FF932A1575BC0A966958260 |work= The New York Times |title= Mating for Life?

For a few rare species, the incidence of genetic monogamy is 100%, with all offspring genetically related to the socially monogamous pair. But genetic monogamy is strikingly low in other species. Barash and Lipton note:\n\n<blockquote style=\"background:none; margin-right:0; margin-left:0; border-left:solid 8px #ccc; padding:.5em 1em;\">\nThe highest known frequency of extra-pair copulations are found among the [[fairy-wren]]s, lovely tropical creatures technically known as ''[[Malurus splendens]]'' and ''[[Malurus cyaneus]]''.

They can no longer assume social monogamy determines how genes are distributed in a species. The lower the rates of genetic monogamy among socially monogamous pairs, the less of a role social monogamy plays in determining how genes are distributed among offspring.\n\n===Polygyny===\n{{Main|Polygyny in animals}}\n\n[[Polygyny threshold model|Polygyny]] occurs when one male gets exclusive mating rights with multiple females. In some species, notably those with [[harem (zoology)|harem]]-like structures, only one of a few males in a group of females will mate. Technically, [[Polygyny in nature|polygyny]] in sociobiology and zoology is defined as a system in which a male has a relationship with more than one female, but the females are predominantly bonded to a single male. Should the active male be driven out, killed, or otherwise removed from the group, in a number of species the new male will ensure that breeding resources are not wasted on another male's young.<ref>This section and examples taken from [[Robert Sapolsky]] (1998) ''[[Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers]]'', W.H.

This is a result of [[anisogamy]], where [[sperm]] are smaller and much less costly (energetically) to produce than [[egg]]s.

In marine species with limited mobility and [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] like [[coral]]s, [[sea urchin]]s and [[clam]]s, the timing of the common spawning is the only externally visible form of sexual behaviour. In areas with continuously high [[primary production]], some species have a series of breeding seasons throughout the year. This is the case with most primates (who are primarily tropical and subtropical animals). Some animals ([[opportunistic breeders]]) breed dependent upon other conditions in their environment aside from time of year.\n\n===Mammals===\nMating seasons are often associated with changes to herd or group structure, and behavioural changes, including territorialism amongst individuals. These may be annual (e.g. [[Wolves#Reproduction|wolves]]), biannual (e.g. [[canine reproduction|dogs]]) or more frequently (e.g. horses). During these periods, females of most mammalian species are more mentally and physically receptive to sexual advances, a period scientifically described as [[estrous|oestrus]] but commonly described as being \"in season\" or \"in heat\". Sexual behaviour may occur outside oestrus,<ref>For example, masturbation, trial mounting, and other behaviours are regularly seen in male animals out of season</ref> and such acts as do occur are not necessarily harmful.<ref name=\"danish\">Denmark, Det Dyreetiske R\u00e5d, [https://www.justitsministeriet.dk/sites/default/files/media/Pressemeddelelser/pdf/2006/Udtalelse.pdf Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr] (Copenhagen: Justitsministeriet, November 2006), p. 24. \"Slimhinden i hundyrets vagina og dyrets adf\u00e6rd er under indflydelse af dets brunstcyklus.

This breeding season is accentuated in temperate regions, in boreal climate the breeding season is typically concentrated to a few short days in the spring.

Clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites, meaning that they develop into males first, and when they mature, they become females. If the female clownfish is removed from the group, such as by death, one of the largest and most dominant males will become a female. The remaining males will move up a rank in the hierarchy.\n\n==Motivation==\nVarious [[neurohormone]]s stimulate sexual wanting in animals.

Male prairie voles release vasopressin after copulation with a partner, and an attachment to their partner then develops. Female prairie voles release oxytocin after copulation with a partner, and similarly develop an attachment to their partner.\n\nNeither male nor female montane voles release high quantities of oxytocin or vasopressin when they mate. Even when injected with these neurohormones, their mating system does not change. In contrast, if prairie voles are injected with the neurohormones, they may form a lifelong attachment, even if they have not mated. It's believed{{By whom|date=May 2017}} that the differing response to the neurohormones between the two species is due to a difference in the number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Prairie voles have a greater number of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors compared to montane voles, and are therefore more sensitive to those two neurohormones. It's believed that it's the quantity of receptors, rather than the quantity of the hormones, that determines the mating system and bond-formation of either species.\n\n===Oxytocin and rat sexual behaviour===\nMother rats experience a [[Estrous cycle|postpartum estrus]] which makes them highly motivated to mate. However, they also have a strong motivation to protect their newly born pups. As a consequence, the mother rat solicits males to the nest but simultaneously becomes aggressive towards them to protect her young. If the mother rat is given injections of an oxytocin [[receptor antagonist]], they no longer experience these maternal motivations.<ref name=\"Kennet\">{{cite journal|author1=Kennett, J.E. |author2=McKee, D.T.|year=2012|title=Oxytocin: An emerging regulator of prolactin secretion in the female rat|journal=Journal of Neuroendocrinology|volume=24|issue=3|pages=403\u2013412|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2826.2011.02263.x|pmc=3288386| pmid= 22129099}}</ref>\n\nProlactin influences social bonding in rats.<ref name=\"Kennet\" />\n\n===Oxytocin and primate sexual behaviour===\nOxytocin plays a similar role in non-human primates as it does in humans.\n\nGrooming, sex, and cuddling frequencies correlate positively with levels of oxytocin. As the level of oxytocin increases so does sexual motivation. While oxytocin plays a major role in parent child relationships, it is also found to play a role in adult sexual relationships. Its secretion affects the nature of the relationship or if there will even be a relationship at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Snowdon|first=Charles T.|last2=Pieper|first2=Bridget A.|last3=Boe|first3=Carla Y.|last4=Cronin|first4=Katherine A.|last5=Kurian|first5=Aimee V.|last6=Ziegler|first6=Toni E.|title=Variation in oxytocin is related to variation in affiliative behavior in monogamous, pairbonded tamarins|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=58|issue=4|pages=614\u2013618|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.06.014|pmid=20600045|pmc=2933949|year=2010|hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0012-2863-F}}</ref>\n\nStudies have shown that oxytocin is higher in monkeys in lifelong monogamous relationships compared to monkeys which are single. Furthermore, the oxytocin levels of the couples correlate positively; when the oxytocin secretion of one increases the other one also increases. Higher levels of oxytocin are related to monkeys expressing more behaviours such as cuddling, grooming and sex, while lower levels of oxytocin reduce motivation for these activities.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nResearch on oxytocin's role in the animal brain suggests that it plays less of a role in behaviours of love and affection than previously believed. \"When oxytocin was first discovered in 1909, it was thought mostly to influence a mother\u2019s labour contractions and milk let-down. Then, in the 1990s, research with prairie voles found that giving them a dose of oxytocin resulted in the formation of a bond with their future mate (Azar, 40).\" Oxytocin has since been treated by the media as the sole player in the \"love and mating game\" in mammals. This view, however, is proving to be false as, \"most hormones don\u2019t influence behaviour directly. Rather, they affect thinking and emotions in variable ways (Azar, 40).\" There is much more involved in sexual behaviour in the mammalian animal than oxytocin and vasopressin can explain.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lambert |first= K. |title= The Lab Rat Chronicles |year= 2011 |publisher= penguin group |location= New York |pages= 151\u2013172}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last= Azar |first= B. |title= Oxytocin's other side |url= http://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/03/oxytocin.aspx |date= March 2011 |volume= 42 |issue= 3 |page= 40 |journal= Science Watch}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aubert | first1 = Y. | last2 = Gustison | first2 = M.

It is probable that they mate because they are motivated for the actual copulation, and because this is connected with a positive experience. It is therefore reasonable to assume that there is some form of pleasure or satisfaction connected with the act. This assumption is confirmed by the behaviour of males, who in the case of many species are prepared to work to get access to female animals, especially if the female animal is in oestrus, and males who for breeding purposes are used to [[semen collection|having sperm collected]] become very eager, when the equipment they associate with the collection is taken out. . . . There is nothing in [[female mammals]]' anatomy or physiology that contradicts that [[sexual stimulation|stimulation of the sexual organs]] and mating is able to be a positive experience. For instance, the clitoris acts in the same way as with women, and scientific studies have shown that the success of reproduction is improved by stimulation of clitoris on (among other species) cows and mares in connection with insemination, because it improves the transportation of the sperm due to contractions of the inner genitalia. This probably also applies to female animals of other animal species, and contractions in the inner genitals are seen e.g. also during orgasm for women. It is therefore reasonable to assume that sexual intercourse may be linked with a positive experience for female animals.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Koinophilia==\n{{Main|Koinophilia}}\n\n[[Koinophilia]] is the love of the \"normal\" or phenotypically common (from the Greek {{Lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2|size=90%}}, {{Lang|grc-Latn|koin\u00f3s}}, meaning \"usual\" or \"common\").<ref name=Koeslag1990>{{cite journal | last1 = Koeslag | first1 = J.H. | year = 1990 | title = Koinophilia groups sexual creatures into species, promotes stasis, and stabilizes social behaviour | url = | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 15\u201335 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-5193(05)80297-8 | pmid=2200930}}</ref> The term was introduced to scientific literature in 1990, and refers to the tendency of animals seeking a mate to prefer that mate not to have any unusual, peculiar or deviant features.<ref name=Koeslag1990 /> Similarly, animals preferentially choose mates with low [[fluctuating asymmetry]].<ref name=\"Moller\">{{cite journal|author1=Moller, A.P.  |author2=Pomiankowski, A |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and sexual selection|journal=Genetica|volume=89|issue=1\u20133 |pages=267\u2013279|year=1993|doi=10.1007/bf02424520}}</ref> However, animal sexual ornaments can evolve through runaway selection, which is driven by (usually female) selection for non-standard traits.<ref name=Blind>Dawkins, Richard (1986).
