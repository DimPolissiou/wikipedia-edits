He was involved in the experimental [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]], working with [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], and [[Ramon Sender]]. Throughout the 1960s he  also traveled frequently in Europe, taking in musical influences and supporting himself by playing in [[piano bar]]s.\n\nHis most influential teacher was [[Pandit Pran Nath]] (1918\u20131996), a master of Indian classical voice who also taught [[La Monte Young]], [[Marian Zazeela]], and [[Michael Harrison (musician)|Michael Harrison]]. Riley made numerous trips to India over the course of their association to study and accompany him on [[tabla]], [[Tanpura|tambura]], and voice. In 1971 he joined the [[Mills College]] faculty to teach Indian classical music. Riley also cites [[John Cage]] and \"the really great [[chamber music]] groups of [[John Coltrane]] and [[Miles Davis]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Gil Evans]]\" as influences on his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluefat.com/0912/Terry_Riley2.htm |title=Like a Rainbow in Curved Air: Terry Riley|website=Bluefat.com}}</ref> He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music at [[Chapman University]] in 2007.\n\nRiley began his long-lasting association with the [[Kronos Quartet]] when he met their founder [[David Harrington (musician)|David Harrington]] while at Mills. Over the course of his career, Riley composed 13 [[string quartet]]s for the ensemble, in addition to other works. He wrote his first orchestral piece, ''Jade Palace'', in 1991, and has continued to pursue that avenue, with several commissioned orchestral compositions following. He is also currently performing and teaching both as an Indian [[raga]] vocalist and as a solo pianist.\n\nRiley continues to perform live, and was part of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2011/05/10-best-moments-all-tomorrows-parties/|title=The 10 Best Moments Of All Tomorrow's Parties|date=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Terry Riley 85.jpg|thumb|Riley at the [[Great American Music Hall]], San Francisco, 1985]]\n\n==Techniques==\nRiley's music is usually based on improvising through a series of [[musical mode|modal]] figures of [[phasing|different lengths]]. Works such as ''[[In C]]'' (1964) and the ''Keyboard Studies'' demonstrate this technique. The first performance of ''In C'' was given by [[Steve Reich]], [[Jon Gibson (minimalist musician)|Jon Gibson]], [[Pauline Oliveros]] and [[Morton Subotnick]]. Its form was an innovation: The piece consists of 53 separate modules of roughly one measure apiece, each containing a different musical pattern but each, as the title implies, in the key of C.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Honigmann|first1=David|title=In C, Barbican, London \u2013 review|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8959b73a-2f30-11e3-ae87-00144feab7de.html#axzz38lf7q1Lq|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=28 August 2016}}</ref> One performer beats a steady pulse of ''C''s on the piano to keep tempo. The others, in any number and on any instrument, perform these musical modules following a few loose guidelines, with the different musical modules interlocking in various ways as time goes on.\n\nIn the 1950s Riley was already working with [[tape loop]]s, a technology still in its infancy at the time; he would later, with the help of a sound engineer, create what he called a \"time-lag accumulator\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Video Art|last=Meigh-Andrews|first=Chris|publisher=Berg (Oxford International Publishers)|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84520-219-4|location=New York, NY and Oxford, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofvideoar0000meig/page/94 94\u201395]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofvideoar0000meig/page/94}}</ref> He has continued manipulating tapes to musical effect, in the studio and in live performances throughout his career.

Riley is credited as inspiring Cale's keyboard part on [[Lou Reed]]'s composition \"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\", which was sung by German actress [[Nico]] and included on the album ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'', recorded in 1966.\n\nRiley's famous overdubbed electronic album ''[[A Rainbow in Curved Air]]'' (recorded 1968, released 1969) inspired many later developments in electronic music. These include [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[organ (music)|organ]] parts on [[The Who]]'s \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" and \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\", the latter named in tribute to Riley as well as to [[Meher Baba]].<ref>This album also produced the name of psychedelic band [[Curved Air]].\n{{cite AV media notes\n |title      = The Who: The Ultimate Collection\n |titlelink  = The Ultimate_Collection (The_Who_album)\n |others   = The Who\n |year       = 2002\n |chapter = \n |url        = \n |first      = \n |last       = \n |pages      = 12\n |publisher  = MCA Records\n}}</ref> Charles Hazlewood, in his BBC documentary on Minimalism (Part 1) suggests that the album 'Tubular Bells' by Mike Oldfield was also inspired by Riley's example.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hazlewood|first1=Charles|title=Tones, Drones and Arpeggios: The Magic of Minimalism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09tbh10/tones-drones-and-arpeggios-the-magic-of-minimalism-series-1-1-california|website=BBC Website|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nRiley's collaborators have included the [[Rova Saxophone Quartet]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], the [[ARTE Quartett]], and, as mentioned, the Kronos Quartet.

He was involved in the experimental [[San Francisco Tape Music Center]], working with [[Morton Subotnick]], [[Steve Reich]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], and [[Ramon Sender]]. Throughout the 1960s he  also traveled frequently in Europe, taking in musical influences and supporting himself by playing in [[piano bar]]s.\n\nHis most influential teacher was [[Pandit Pran Nath]] (1918\u20131996), a master of Indian classical voice who also taught [[La Monte Young]], [[Marian Zazeela]], and [[Michael Harrison (musician)|Michael Harrison]]. Riley made numerous trips to India over the course of their association to study and accompany him on [[tabla]], [[Tanpura|tambura]], and voice. In 1971 he joined the [[Mills College]] faculty to teach Indian classical music. Riley also cites [[John Cage]] and \"the really great [[chamber music]] groups of [[John Coltrane]] and [[Miles Davis]], [[Charles Mingus]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Gil Evans]]\" as influences on his work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluefat.com/0912/Terry_Riley2.htm |title=Like a Rainbow in Curved Air: Terry Riley|website=Bluefat.com}}</ref>He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate Degree in Music at [[Chapman University]] in 2007.\n\nRiley began his long-lasting association with the [[Kronos Quartet]] when he met their founder [[David Harrington (musician)|David Harrington]] while at Mills. Over the course of his career, Riley composed 13 [[string quartet]]s for the ensemble, in addition to other works. He wrote his first orchestral piece, ''Jade Palace'', in 1991, and has continued to pursue that avenue, with several commissioned orchestral compositions following. He is also currently performing and teaching both as an Indian [[raga]] vocalist and as a solo pianist.\n\nRiley continues to perform live, and was part of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2011/05/10-best-moments-all-tomorrows-parties/|title=The 10 Best Moments Of All Tomorrow's Parties|date=16 May 2011}}</ref>\n[[File:Terry Riley 85.jpg|thumb|Riley at the [[Great American Music Hall]], San Francisco, 1985]]\n\n==Techniques==\nRiley's music is usually based on improvising through a series of [[musical mode|modal]] figures of [[phasing|different lengths]]. Works such as ''[[In C]]'' (1964) and the ''Keyboard Studies'' demonstrate this technique. The first performance of ''In C'' was given by [[Steve Reich]], [[Jon Gibson (minimalist musician)|Jon Gibson]], [[Pauline Oliveros]] and [[Morton Subotnick]]. Its form was an innovation: The piece consists of 53 separate modules of roughly one measure apiece, each containing a different musical pattern but each, as the title implies, in the key of C.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Honigmann|first1=David|title=In C, Barbican, London \u2013 review|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8959b73a-2f30-11e3-ae87-00144feab7de.html#axzz38lf7q1Lq|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=28 August 2016}}</ref> One performer beats a steady pulse of ''C''s on the piano to keep tempo. The others, in any number and on any instrument, perform these musical modules following a few loose guidelines, with the different musical modules interlocking in various ways as time goes on.\n\nIn the 1950s Riley was already working with [[tape loop]]s, a technology still in its infancy at the time; he would later, with the help of a sound engineer, create what he called a \"time-lag accumulator\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=A History of Video Art|last=Meigh-Andrews|first=Chris|publisher=Berg (Oxford International Publishers)|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84520-219-4|location=New York, NY and Oxford, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofvideoar0000meig/page/94 94\u201395]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofvideoar0000meig/page/94}}</ref> He has continued manipulating tapes to musical effect, in the studio and in live performances throughout his career. An early tape loop piece titled ''Music for the Gift'' (1963) featured the trumpet playing of [[Chet Baker]].

Riley is credited as inspiring Cale's keyboard part on [[Lou Reed]]'s composition \"[[All Tomorrow's Parties]]\", which was sung by German actress [[Nico]] and included on the album ''[[The Velvet Underground and Nico]]'', recorded in 1966.\n\nRiley's famous overdubbed electronic album ''[[A Rainbow in Curved Air]]'' (recorded 1968, released 1969) inspired many later developments in electronic music. These include [[Pete Townshend]]'s [[organ (music)|organ]] parts on [[The Who]]'s \"[[Won't Get Fooled Again]]\" and \"[[Baba O'Riley]]\", the latter named in tribute to Riley as well as to [[Meher Baba]].<ref>This album also produced the name of psychedelic band [[Curved Air]].\n{{cite AV media notes\n |title      = The Who: The Ultimate Collection\n |titlelink  = The Ultimate_Collection (The_Who_album)\n |others   = The Who\n |year       = 2002\n |chapter = \n |url        = \n |first      = \n |last       = \n |pages      = 12\n |publisher  = MCA Records\n}}</ref> Charles Hazlewood, in his BBC documentary on Minimalism (Part 1) suggests that the album 'Tubular Bells' by Mike Oldfield was also inspired by Riley's example.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hazlewood|first1=Charles|title=Tones, Drones and Arpeggios: The Magic of Minimalism|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09tbh10/tones-drones-and-arpeggios-the-magic-of-minimalism-series-1-1-california|website=BBC Website|accessdate=13 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nRiley's collaborators have included the [[Rova Saxophone Quartet]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], the [[ARTE Quartett]], and, as mentioned, the Kronos Quartet.

As a result, the plant exhibits a reaction of phototropism--directional growth (2.) toward the light stimulus]]\nIn [[physiology]], a '''stimulus''' (plural '''stimuli''' or '''stimuluses''')<ref>[http://www.wordorigins.org/index.php/more/849/ Prescriptivist\u2019s Corner: Foreign Plurals]: \"Biologists use ''stimuli'', but ''stimuluses'' is in general use.\"</ref> is a detectable change in the physical or chemical structure of an organism's internal or external [[Environment (systems)|environment]]. The ability of an [[organism]] or [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity. When a stimulus is applied to a [[sensory receptor]], it normally elicits or influences a [[Reflex action|reflex]] via [[Transduction (physiology)|stimulus transduction]]. These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body, as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye, as well as from inside the body, as in [[chemoreceptors]] and [[mechanoreceptors]]. An internal stimulus is often the first component of a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic control system]]. External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body, as in the [[fight-or-flight response]]. In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability, its level must exceed the [[absolute threshold]]; if a signal does reach threshold, the information is transmitted to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made. Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond, it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Homeostatic imbalances====\n[[Homeostasis|Homeostatic]] outbalances are the main driving force for changes of the body. These stimuli are monitored closely by receptors and sensors in different parts of the body. These sensors are [[mechanoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptors]] and [[thermoreceptors]] that, respectively, respond to pressure or stretching, chemical changes, or temperature changes. Examples of mechanoreceptors include [[baroreceptors]] which detect changes in blood pressure, [[Merkel's discs]] which can detect sustained touch and pressure, and [[hair cell]]s which detect sound stimuli. Homeostatic imbalances that can serve as internal stimuli include nutrient and ion levels in the blood, oxygen levels, and water levels. Deviations from the homeostatic ideal may generate a [[homeostatic emotion]], such as pain, thirst or fatigue, that motivates behavior that will restore the body to stasis (such as withdrawal, drinking or resting).<ref name = Craig>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00123-1 |title=A new view of pain as a homeostatic emotion |year=2003 |last1=Craig |first1=A D |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=303\u20137 |pmid=12798599}}</ref>\n\n====Blood pressure====\nBlood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output are measured by stretch receptors found in the [[Carotid artery|carotid arteries]]. [[Nerve]]s embed themselves within these receptors and when they detect stretching, they are stimulated and fire [[Action Potential|action potentials]] to the [[central nervous system]]. These impulses inhibit the constriction of blood vessels and lower the heart rate. If these nerves do not detect stretching, the body determines perceives low blood pressure as a dangerous stimulus and signals are not sent, preventing the inhibition CNS action; blood vessels constrict and the heart rate increases, causing an increase in blood pressure in the body.<ref name = Nicholls>{{cite book |last1=Nicholls |first1=John |first2=A.

Pain also causes a behavioral change in the body, which is proportional to the intensity of the pain. The feeling is recorded by sensory receptors on the skin and travels to the [[central nervous system]], where it is integrated and a decision on how to respond is made; if it is decided that a response must be made, a signal is sent back down to a muscle, which acts appropriately according to the stimulus.<ref name = Craig /> The postcentral gyrus is the location of the [[primary somatosensory area]], the main sensory receptive area for the [[sense of touch]].<ref name = Purves>{{cite book |last=Purves |first=Dale |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer |edition=5th |year=2012 |location=Sunderland, MA |isbn=978-0-87893-695-3}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nPain receptors are known as [[nociceptors]]. Two main types of [[nociceptors]] exist, A-fiber nociceptors and [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fiber]] nociceptors. [[Type Ia sensory fiber|A-fiber]] receptors are myelinated and conduct currents rapidly. They are mainly used to conduct fast and sharp types of pain. Conversely, C-fiber receptors are unmyelinated and slowly transmit. These receptors conduct slow, burning, diffuse pain.<ref name = Stucky>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.211373398 |title=From the Academy: Mechanisms of pain |year=2001 |last1=Stucky |first1=C.

This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the force exerted by dropping the wing of a bee onto your cheek from a distance of one centimeter. This value will change based on the body part being touched.<ref name = \"Gale\">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3406000012.html |title=Absolute Threshold |encyclopedia=Gale Encyclopedia of Psychology |year=2001 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\n====Vision====\nVision provides opportunity for the [[brain]] to perceive and respond to changes occurring around the body. Information, or stimuli, in the form of [[light]] enters the [[retina]], where it excites a special type of [[neuron]] called a [[photoreceptor cell]]. A local [[Receptor potential|graded potential]] begins in the photoreceptor, where it excites the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] enough for the impulse to be passed along through a track of neurons to the [[central nervous system]]. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, [[Action Potential|action potentials]] must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS.<ref name = Nicholls /> If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not reach [[absolute threshold]], and the body does not react. However, if the stimulus is strong enough to create an action potential in neurons away from the photoreceptor, the body will integrate the information and react appropriately. Visual information is processed in the [[occipital lobe]] of the CNS, specifically in the [[Visual cortex|primary visual cortex]].<ref name = Nicholls />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for vision is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the eye. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the amount of light present from someone holding up a single candle 30 miles away, if one's eyes were [[Adaptation (eye)|adjusted to the dark]].<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Smell====\n[[Olfaction|Smell]] allows the body to recognize chemical molecules in the air through inhalation. [[Olfaction|Olfactory]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] located on either side of the [[nasal septum]] consist of [[olfactory epithelium]] and [[lamina propria]]. The olfactory epithelium, which contains olfactory receptor cells, covers the inferior surface of the [[Cribriform plate|cribiform plate]], the superior portion of the perpendicular plate, the superior nasal concha. Only roughly two percent of airborne compounds inhaled are carried to olfactory organs as a small sample of the air being inhaled. Olfactory receptors extend past the epithelial surface providing a base for many cilia that lie in the surrounding mucus. Odorant-binding proteins interact with these [[Cilium|cilia]] stimulating the receptors. Odorants are generally small organic molecules. Greater water and lipid solubility is related directly to stronger smelling odorants. Odorant binding to G protein coupled receptors activates [[adenylate cyclase]], which converts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to camp. [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], in turn, promotes the opening of sodium channels resulting in a localized potential.<ref name = Martini>{{cite book |last1=Martini |first1=Frederic |first2=Judi |last2=Nath |title=Anatomy & Physiology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |edition=2nd |year=2010 |location=San Frascisco, CA |isbn=978-0-321-59713-7}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for smell is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the nose. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of perfume in a six-room house. This value will change depending on what substance is being smelled.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Taste====\n[[Taste]] records flavoring of food and other materials that pass across the [[tongue]] and through the mouth. Gustatory cells are located on the surface of the [[tongue]] and adjacent portions of the [[pharynx]] and [[larynx]]. Gustatory cells form on [[taste bud]]s, specialized [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]], and are generally turned over every ten days. From each cell, protrudes microvilli, sometimes called taste hairs, through also the taste pore and into the oral cavity. Dissolved chemicals interact with these receptor cells; different tastes bind to specific receptors. Salt and sour receptors are chemically gated ion channels, which depolarize the cell. Sweet, bitter, and umami receptors are called [[gustducin]]s, specialized [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein coupled receptors]]. Both divisions of receptor cells release neurotransmitters to afferent fibers causing [[action potential]] firing.<ref name = Martini />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for taste is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the mouth. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of [[Quinine|quinine sulfate]] in 250 gallons of water.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Sound====\nChanges in pressure caused by [[sound]] reaching the external [[ear]] resonate in the [[Eardrum|tympanic membrane]], which articulates with the auditory ossicles, or the bones of the middle ear. These tiny bones multiply these pressure fluctuations as they pass the disturbance into the cochlea, a spiral-shaped bony structure within the inner ear.  Hair cells in the cochlear duct, specifically the [[organ of Corti]], are deflected as waves of fluid and membrane motion travel through the chambers of the cochlea. Bipolar sensory neurons located in the center of the cochlea monitor the information from these receptor cells and pass it on to the brainstem via the cochlear branch of [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]]. Sound information is processed in the [[Temporal lobe|temporal lobe]] of the CNS, specifically in the [[primary auditory cortex]].<ref name = Martini />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for sound is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the ears. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a watch ticking in an otherwise soundless environment 20 feet away.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Equilibrium====\nSemi circular ducts, which are connected directly to the [[cochlea]], can interpret and convey to the brain information about equilibrium by a similar method as the one used for hearing. [[Hair cell]]s in these parts of the ear protrude kinocilia and stereocilia into a gelatinous material that lines the ducts of this canal. In parts of these semi circular canals, specifically the maculae, calcium carbonate crystals known as statoconia rest on the surface of this gelatinous material. When tilting the head or when the body undergoes linear acceleration, these crystals move disturbing the cilia of the hair cells and, consequently, affecting the release of neurotransmitter to be taken up by surrounding sensory nerves. In other areas of the semi circular canal, specifically the ampulla, a structure known as the cupula\u2014analogous to the gelatinous material in the maculae\u2014distorts hair cells in a similar fashion when the fluid medium that surrounds it causes the cupula itself to move. The ampulla communicates to the brain information about the head's horizontal rotation. Neurons of the adjacent vestibular ganglia monitor the hair cells in these ducts. These sensory fibers form the vestibular branch of the [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]].<ref name = Martini />\n\n==Cellular response==\n{{main|Cell signaling}}\nIn general, cellular response to stimuli is defined as a change in state or activity of a cell in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, or gene expression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/75556 |year=2000 |last1=Botstein |first1=David |last2=Ball |first2=J.

Stimuli are always converted into electrical signals via [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]]. This electrical signal, or [[receptor potential]], takes a specific pathway through the nervous system to initiate a systematic response. Each type of receptor is specialized to respond preferentially to only one kind of stimulus energy, called the [[adequate stimulus]]. Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond, and each is tuned to the particular needs of the organism. Stimuli are relayed throughout the body by mechanotransduction or chemotransduction, depending on the nature of the stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Mechanical===\nIn response to a mechanical stimulus, cellular sensors of force are proposed to be extracellular matrix molecules, cytoskeleton, transmembrane proteins, proteins at the membrane-phospholipid interface, elements of the nuclear matrix, chromatin, and the lipid bilayer. Response can be twofold: the extracellular matrix, for example, is a conductor of mechanical forces but its structure and composition is also influenced by the cellular responses to those same applied or endogenously generated forces.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.bioeng.9.060906.151927 |title=Cell Mechanics: Integrating Cell Responses to Mechanical Stimuli |year=2007 |last1=Janmey |first1=Paul A. |last2=McCulloch |first2=Christopher A. |journal=Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering |volume=9 |pages=1\u201334 |pmid=17461730}}</ref> Mechanosensitive ion channels are found in many cell types and it has been shown that the permeability of these channels to cations is affected by stretch receptors and mechanical stimuli.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.physiol.59.1.575 |title=Tensegrity: The Architectural Basis of Cellular Mechanotransduction |year=1997 |last1=Ingber |first1=D.

[[G protein-coupled receptor]]s in the plasma membrane of these cells can initiate second messenger pathways that cause cation channels to open.\n\nIn response to stimuli, the [[sensory receptor]] initiates sensory transduction by creating graded potentials or action potentials in the same cell or in an adjacent one. Sensitivity to stimuli is obtained by chemical amplification through [[Second messenger system|second messenger pathways]] in which enzymatic cascades produce large numbers of intermediate products, increasing the effect of one receptor molecule.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n==Systematic response==\n\n===Nervous-system response===\nThough receptors and stimuli are varied, most extrinsic stimuli first generate localized graded potentials in the neurons associated with the specific sensory organ or tissue.<ref name = Martini /> In the [[nervous system]], internal and external stimuli can elicit two different categories of responses: an excitatory response, normally in the form of an [[action potential]], and an inhibitory response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1966.tb50176.x |title=The Ionic Mechanisms of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Action |year=1966 |last1=Eccles |first1=J. C. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=137 |issue=2 |pmid=5338549 |pages=473\u201394}}</ref> When a [[neuron]] is stimulated by an excitatory impulse, neuronal [[dendrite]]s are bound by [[neurotransmitter]]s which cause the cell to become permeable to a specific type of ion; the type of neurotransmitter determines to which ion the neurotransmitter will become permeable. In [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s, an excitatory response is generated. This is caused by an excitatory neurotransmitter, normally [[glutamate]] binding to a neuron's dendrites, causing an influx of sodium ions through channels located near the binding site.\n\nThis change in membrane permeability in the dendrites is known as a local graded potential and causes the membrane voltage to change from a negative resting potential to a more positive voltage, a process known as [[depolarization]]. The opening of sodium channels allows nearby sodium channels to open, allowing the change in permeability to spread from the dendrites to the [[Perikaryon|cell body]]. If a graded potential is strong enough, or if several graded potentials occur in a fast enough frequency, the depolarization is able to spread across the cell body to the [[axon hillock]]. From the axon hillock, an action potential can be generated and propagated down the neuron's [[axon]], causing sodium ion channels in the axon to open as the impulse travels. Once the signal begins to travel down the axon, the membrane potential has already passed [[Threshold potential|threshold]], which means that it cannot be stopped. This phenomenon is known as an all-or-nothing response. Groups of sodium channels opened by the change in membrane potential strengthen the signal as it travels away from the axon hillock, allowing it to move the length of the axon. As the depolarization reaches the end of the axon, or the [[axon terminal]], the end of the neuron becomes permeable to calcium ions, which enters the cell via calcium ion channels. Calcium causes the release of neurotransmitters stored in [[synaptic vesicle]]s, which enter the synapse between two neurons known as the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons; if the signal from the presynaptic neuron is excitatory, it will cause the release of an excitatory neurotransmitter, causing a similar response in the postsynaptic neuron.<ref name = Nicholls /> These neurons may communicate with thousands of other receptors and target cells through extensive, complex dendritic networks. Communication between receptors in this fashion enables discrimination and the more explicit interpretation of external stimuli. Effectively, these localized graded potentials trigger action potentials that communicate, in their frequency, along nerve axons eventually arriving in specific cortexes of the brain. In these also highly specialized parts of the brain, these signals are coordinated with others to possibly trigger a new response.<ref name = Martini />\n\nIf a signal from the presynaptic neuron is inhibitory, inhibitory neurotransmitters, normally [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] will be released into the synapse.<ref name = Nicholls /> This neurotransmitter causes an [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]] in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential makes it more difficult for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron. Depending on the type of stimulus, a neuron can be either excitatory or inhibitory.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |pmid=6150966 |year=1984 |last1=Pitman |first1=Robert M |title=The versatile synapse |volume=112 |pages=199\u2013224 |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6150966}}</ref>\n\n===Muscular-system response===\nNerves in the [[peripheral nervous system]] spread out to various parts of the body, including [[muscle fiber]]s.

When muscles receive information from internal or external stimuli, muscle fibers are stimulated by their respective motor neuron. Impulses are passed from the [[central nervous system]] down neurons until they reach the motor neuron, which releases the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] on the surface of the muscle cell and opens ion channels, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out; this ion movement causes a depolarization, which allows for the release of calcium ions within the cell. Calcium ions bind to proteins within the muscle cell to allow for muscle contraction; the ultimate consequence of a stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Endocrine-system response===\n\n====Vasopressin====\nThe [[endocrine system]] is affected largely by many internal and external stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes [[hormone]] release is [[blood pressure]]. [[Hypotension]], or low blood pressure, is a large driving force for the release of [[vasopressin]], a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. This process also increases an individuals thirst. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual's blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. [[Hypovolemia]], or low fluid levels in the body, can also act as a stimulus to cause this response.<ref name = Baylis>{{cite journal |pmid=3318505 |year=1987 |last1=Baylis |first1=PH |title=Osmoregulation and control of vasopressin secretion in healthy humans |volume=253 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=R671\u20138 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1987.253.5.R671 }}</ref>\n\n====Epinephrine====\n[[Epinephrine]], also known as adrenaline, is also used commonly to respond to both internal and external changes. One common cause of the release of this hormone is the [[Fight-or-flight response]]. When the body encounters an external stimulus that is potentially dangerous, epinephrine is released from the [[adrenal glands]].

The ability of an [[organism]] or [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] to respond to external stimuli is called sensitivity. When a stimulus is applied to a [[sensory receptor]], it normally elicits or influences a [[Reflex action|reflex]] via [[Transduction (physiology)|stimulus transduction]]. These sensory receptors can receive information from outside the body, as in touch receptors found in the skin or light receptors in the eye, as well as from inside the body, as in [[chemoreceptors]] and [[mechanoreceptors]]. An internal stimulus is often the first component of a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic control system]]. External stimuli are capable of producing systemic responses throughout the body, as in the [[fight-or-flight response]]. In order for a stimulus to be detected with high probability, its level must exceed the [[absolute threshold]]; if a signal does reach threshold, the information is transmitted to the [[central nervous system]] (CNS), where it is integrated and a decision on how to react is made. Although stimuli commonly cause the body to respond, it is the CNS that finally determines whether a signal causes a reaction or not.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Internal===\n\n====Homeostatic imbalances====\n[[Homeostasis|Homeostatic]] outbalances are the main driving force for changes of the body. These stimuli are monitored closely by receptors and sensors in different parts of the body. These sensors are [[mechanoreceptors]], [[chemoreceptors]] and [[thermoreceptors]] that, respectively, respond to pressure or stretching, chemical changes, or temperature changes. Examples of mechanoreceptors include [[baroreceptors]] which detect changes in blood pressure, [[Merkel's discs]] which can detect sustained touch and pressure, and [[hair cell]]s which detect sound stimuli. Homeostatic imbalances that can serve as internal stimuli include nutrient and ion levels in the blood, oxygen levels, and water levels. Deviations from the homeostatic ideal may generate a [[homeostatic emotion]], such as pain, thirst or fatigue, that motivates behavior that will restore the body to stasis (such as withdrawal, drinking or resting).<ref name = Craig>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00123-1 |title=A new view of pain as a homeostatic emotion |year=2003 |last1=Craig |first1=A D |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=303\u20137 |pmid=12798599}}</ref>\n\n====Blood pressure====\nBlood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output are measured by stretch receptors found in the [[Carotid artery|carotid arteries]]. [[Nerve]]s embed themselves within these receptors and when they detect stretching, they are stimulated and fire [[Action Potential|action potentials]] to the [[central nervous system]]. These impulses inhibit the constriction of blood vessels and lower the heart rate. If these nerves do not detect stretching, the body determines perceives low blood pressure as a dangerous stimulus and signals are not sent, preventing the inhibition CNS action; blood vessels constrict and the heart rate increases, causing an increase in blood pressure in the body.<ref name = Nicholls>{{cite book |last1=Nicholls |first1=John |first2=A.

Pain also causes a behavioral change in the body, which is proportional to the intensity of the pain. The feeling is recorded by sensory receptors on the skin and travels to the [[central nervous system]], where it is integrated and a decision on how to respond is made; if it is decided that a response must be made, a signal is sent back down to a muscle, which acts appropriately according to the stimulus.<ref name = Craig /> The postcentral gyrus is the location of the [[primary somatosensory area]], the main sensory receptive area for the [[sense of touch]].<ref name = Purves>{{cite book |last=Purves |first=Dale |title=Neuroscience |publisher=Sinauer |edition=5th |year=2012 |location=Sunderland, MA |isbn=978-0-87893-695-3}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nPain receptors are known as [[nociceptors]]. Two main types of [[nociceptors]] exist, A-fiber nociceptors and [[Group C nerve fiber|C-fiber]] nociceptors. [[Type Ia sensory fiber|A-fiber]] receptors are myelinated and conduct currents rapidly. They are mainly used to conduct fast and sharp types of pain. Conversely, C-fiber receptors are unmyelinated and slowly transmit.

Information, or stimuli, in the form of [[light]] enters the [[retina]], where it excites a special type of [[neuron]] called a [[photoreceptor cell]]. A local [[Receptor potential|graded potential]] begins in the photoreceptor, where it excites the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] enough for the impulse to be passed along through a track of neurons to the [[central nervous system]]. As the signal travels from photoreceptors to larger neurons, [[Action Potential|action potentials]] must be created for the signal to have enough strength to reach the CNS.<ref name = Nicholls /> If the stimulus does not warrant a strong enough response, it is said to not reach [[absolute threshold]], and the body does not react. However, if the stimulus is strong enough to create an action potential in neurons away from the photoreceptor, the body will integrate the information and react appropriately. Visual information is processed in the [[occipital lobe]] of the CNS, specifically in the [[Visual cortex|primary visual cortex]].<ref name = Nicholls />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for vision is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] in the eye. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be the amount of light present from someone holding up a single candle 30 miles away, if one's eyes were [[Adaptation (eye)|adjusted to the dark]].<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Smell====\n[[Olfaction|Smell]] allows the body to recognize chemical molecules in the air through inhalation. [[Olfaction|Olfactory]] [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] located on either side of the [[nasal septum]] consist of [[olfactory epithelium]] and [[lamina propria]]. The olfactory epithelium, which contains olfactory receptor cells, covers the inferior surface of the [[Cribriform plate|cribiform plate]], the superior portion of the perpendicular plate, the superior nasal concha. Only roughly two percent of airborne compounds inhaled are carried to olfactory organs as a small sample of the air being inhaled. Olfactory receptors extend past the epithelial surface providing a base for many cilia that lie in the surrounding mucus. Odorant-binding proteins interact with these [[Cilium|cilia]] stimulating the receptors. Odorants are generally small organic molecules. Greater water and lipid solubility is related directly to stronger smelling odorants. Odorant binding to G protein coupled receptors activates [[adenylate cyclase]], which converts [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to camp. [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]], in turn, promotes the opening of sodium channels resulting in a localized potential.<ref name = Martini>{{cite book |last1=Martini |first1=Frederic |first2=Judi |last2=Nath |title=Anatomy & Physiology |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |edition=2nd |year=2010 |location=San Frascisco, CA |isbn=978-0-321-59713-7}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for smell is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the nose. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of perfume in a six-room house. This value will change depending on what substance is being smelled.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Taste====\n[[Taste]] records flavoring of food and other materials that pass across the [[tongue]] and through the mouth. Gustatory cells are located on the surface of the [[tongue]] and adjacent portions of the [[pharynx]] and [[larynx]]. Gustatory cells form on [[taste bud]]s, specialized [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]], and are generally turned over every ten days. From each cell, protrudes microvilli, sometimes called taste hairs, through also the taste pore and into the oral cavity. Dissolved chemicals interact with these receptor cells; different tastes bind to specific receptors. Salt and sour receptors are chemically gated ion channels, which depolarize the cell. Sweet, bitter, and umami receptors are called [[gustducin]]s, specialized [[G protein-coupled receptor|G protein coupled receptors]]. Both divisions of receptor cells release neurotransmitters to afferent fibers causing [[action potential]] firing.<ref name = Martini />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for taste is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the mouth. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a single drop of [[Quinine|quinine sulfate]] in 250 gallons of water.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Sound====\nChanges in pressure caused by [[sound]] reaching the external [[ear]] resonate in the [[Eardrum|tympanic membrane]], which articulates with the auditory ossicles, or the bones of the middle ear. These tiny bones multiply these pressure fluctuations as they pass the disturbance into the cochlea, a spiral-shaped bony structure within the inner ear.  Hair cells in the cochlear duct, specifically the [[organ of Corti]], are deflected as waves of fluid and membrane motion travel through the chambers of the cochlea. Bipolar sensory neurons located in the center of the cochlea monitor the information from these receptor cells and pass it on to the brainstem via the cochlear branch of [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]]. Sound information is processed in the [[Temporal lobe|temporal lobe]] of the CNS, specifically in the [[primary auditory cortex]].<ref name = Martini />\n\nThe [[absolute threshold]] for sound is the minimum amount of sensation needed to elicit a response from receptors in the ears. This amount of sensation has a definable value and is often considered to be a watch ticking in an otherwise soundless environment 20 feet away.<ref name = Gale />\n\n====Equilibrium====\nSemi circular ducts, which are connected directly to the [[cochlea]], can interpret and convey to the brain information about equilibrium by a similar method as the one used for hearing. [[Hair cell]]s in these parts of the ear protrude kinocilia and stereocilia into a gelatinous material that lines the ducts of this canal. In parts of these semi circular canals, specifically the maculae, calcium carbonate crystals known as statoconia rest on the surface of this gelatinous material. When tilting the head or when the body undergoes linear acceleration, these crystals move disturbing the cilia of the hair cells and, consequently, affecting the release of neurotransmitter to be taken up by surrounding sensory nerves. In other areas of the semi circular canal, specifically the ampulla, a structure known as the cupula\u2014analogous to the gelatinous material in the maculae\u2014distorts hair cells in a similar fashion when the fluid medium that surrounds it causes the cupula itself to move. The ampulla communicates to the brain information about the head\u2019s horizontal rotation. Neurons of the adjacent vestibular ganglia monitor the hair cells in these ducts. These sensory fibers form the vestibular branch of the [[Vestibulocochlear nerve|cranial nerve VIII]].<ref name = Martini />\n\n==Cellular response==\n{{main|Cell signaling}}\nIn general, cellular response to stimuli is defined as a change in state or activity of a cell in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, or gene expression.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/75556 |year=2000 |last1=Botstein |first1=David |last2=Ball |first2=J.

Stimuli are always converted into electrical signals via [[Transduction (physiology)|transduction]]. This electrical signal, or [[receptor potential]], takes a specific pathway through the nervous system to initiate a systematic response. Each type of receptor is specialized to respond preferentially to only one kind of stimulus energy, called the [[adequate stimulus]]. Sensory receptors have a well-defined range of stimuli to which they respond, and each is tuned to the particular needs of the organism. Stimuli are relayed throughout the body by mechanotransduction or chemotransduction, depending on the nature of the stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Mechanical===\nIn response to a mechanical stimulus, cellular sensors of force are proposed to be extracellular matrix molecules, cytoskeleton, transmembrane proteins, proteins at the membrane-phospholipid interface, elements of the nuclear matrix, chromatin, and the lipid bilayer.

Sensitivity to stimuli is obtained by chemical amplification through [[Second messenger system|second messenger pathways]] in which enzymatic cascades produce large numbers of intermediate products, increasing the effect of one receptor molecule.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n==Systematic response==\n\n===Nervous-system response===\nThough receptors and stimuli are varied, most extrinsic stimuli first generate localized graded potentials in the neurons associated with the specific sensory organ or tissue.<ref name = Martini /> In the [[nervous system]], internal and external stimuli can elicit two different categories of responses: an excitatory response, normally in the form of an [[action potential]], and an inhibitory response.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1966.tb50176.x |title=The Ionic Mechanisms of Excitatory and Inhibitory Synaptic Action |year=1966 |last1=Eccles |first1=J. C. |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=137 |issue=2 |pmid=5338549 |pages=473\u201394}}</ref> When a [[neuron]] is stimulated by an excitatory impulse, neuronal [[dendrite]]s are bound by [[neurotransmitter]]s which cause the cell to become permeable to a specific type of ion; the type of neurotransmitter determines to which ion the neurotransmitter will become permeable. In [[excitatory postsynaptic potential]]s, an excitatory response is generated. This is caused by an excitatory neurotransmitter, normally [[glutamate]] binding to a neuron's dendrites, causing an influx of sodium ions through channels located near the binding site.\n\nThis change in membrane permeability in the dendrites is known as a local graded potential and causes the membrane voltage to change from a negative resting potential to a more positive voltage, a process known as [[depolarization]]. The opening of sodium channels allows nearby sodium channels to open, allowing the change in permeability to spread from the dendrites to the [[Perikaryon|cell body]]. If a graded potential is strong enough, or if several graded potentials occur in a fast enough frequency, the depolarization is able to spread across the cell body to the [[axon hillock]]. From the axon hillock, an action potential can be generated and propagated down the neuron's [[axon]], causing sodium ion channels in the axon to open as the impulse travels. Once the signal begins to travel down the axon, the membrane potential has already passed [[Threshold potential|threshold]], which means that it cannot be stopped. This phenomenon is known as an all-or-nothing response. Groups of sodium channels opened by the change in membrane potential strengthen the signal as it travels away from the axon hillock, allowing it to move the length of the axon. As the depolarization reaches the end of the axon, or the [[axon terminal]], the end of the neuron becomes permeable to calcium ions, which enters the cell via calcium ion channels. Calcium causes the release of neurotransmitters stored in [[synaptic vesicle]]s, which enter the synapse between two neurons known as the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons; if the signal from the presynaptic neuron is excitatory, it will cause the release of an excitatory neurotransmitter, causing a similar response in the postsynaptic neuron.<ref name = Nicholls /> These neurons may communicate with thousands of other receptors and target cells through extensive, complex dendritic networks. Communication between receptors in this fashion enables discrimination and the more explicit interpretation of external stimuli. Effectively, these localized graded potentials trigger action potentials that communicate, in their frequency, along nerve axons eventually arriving in specific cortexes of the brain. In these also highly specialized parts of the brain, these signals are coordinated with others to possibly trigger a new response.<ref name = Martini />\n\nIf a signal from the presynaptic neuron is inhibitory, inhibitory neurotransmitters, normally [[gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] will be released into the synapse.<ref name = Nicholls /> This neurotransmitter causes an [[inhibitory postsynaptic potential]] in the postsynaptic neuron. This response will cause the postsynaptic neuron to become permeable to chloride ions, making the membrane potential of the cell negative; a negative membrane potential makes it more difficult for the cell to fire an action potential and prevents any signal from being passed on through the neuron. Depending on the type of stimulus, a neuron can be either excitatory or inhibitory.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite journal |pmid=6150966 |year=1984 |last1=Pitman |first1=Robert M |title=The versatile synapse |volume=112 |pages=199\u2013224 |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=6150966}}</ref>\n\n===Muscular-system response===\nNerves in the [[peripheral nervous system]] spread out to various parts of the body, including [[muscle fiber]]s.

When muscles receive information from internal or external stimuli, muscle fibers are stimulated by their respective motor neuron. Impulses are passed from the [[central nervous system]] down neurons until they reach the motor neuron, which releases the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) into the neuromuscular junction. ACh binds to [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptors]] on the surface of the muscle cell and opens ion channels, allowing sodium ions to flow into the cell and potassium ions to flow out; this ion movement causes a depolarization, which allows for the release of calcium ions within the cell. Calcium ions bind to proteins within the muscle cell to allow for muscle contraction; the ultimate consequence of a stimulus.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n===Endocrine-system response===\n\n====Vasopressin====\nThe [[endocrine system]] is affected largely by many internal and external stimuli. One internal stimulus that causes [[hormone]] release is [[blood pressure]]. [[Hypotension]], or low blood pressure, is a large driving force for the release of [[vasopressin]], a hormone which causes the retention of water in the kidneys. This process also increases an individuals thirst. By fluid retention or by consuming fluids, if an individual's blood pressure returns to normal, vasopressin release slows and less fluid is retained by the kidneys. [[Hypovolemia]], or low fluid levels in the body, can also act as a stimulus to cause this response.<ref name = Baylis>{{cite journal |pmid=3318505 |year=1987 |last1=Baylis |first1=PH |title=Osmoregulation and control of vasopressin secretion in healthy humans |volume=253 |issue=5 Pt 2 |pages=R671\u20138 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1987.253.5.R671 }}</ref>\n\n====Epinephrine====\n[[Epinephrine]], also known as adrenaline, is also used commonly to respond to both internal and external changes.

Epinephrine causes physiological changes in the body, such as constriction of blood vessels, dilation of pupils, increased heart and respiratory rate, and the metabolism of glucose.

The sight and smell of food are strong enough stimuli to cause salivation, gastric and pancreatic enzyme secretion, and endocrine secretion in preparation for the incoming nutrients; by starting the digestive process before food reaches the stomach, the body is able to more effectively and efficiently metabolize food into necessary nutrients.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.appet.2007.10.006 |title=Anticipatory physiological regulation in feeding biology: Cephalic phase responses |year=2008 |last1=Power |first1=Michael L. |last2=Schulkin |first2=Jay |journal=Appetite |volume=50 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=194\u2013206 |pmid=18045735 |pmc=2297467}}</ref> Once food hits the mouth, taste and information from receptors in the mouth add to the digestive response.

The digestive tract, or [[enteric nervous system]] alone contains millions of neurons. These neurons act as sensory receptors that can detect changes, such as food entering the small intestine, in the digestive tract. Depending on what these sensory receptors detect, certain enzymes and digestive juices from the pancreas and liver can be secreted to aid in metabolism and breakdown of food.<ref name = Nicholls />\n\n==Research methods and techniques==\n\n===Clamping techniques===\n{{main|Voltage clamp|Current clamp}}\nIntracellular measurements of electrical potential across the membrane can be obtained by microelectrode recording.

A [[steering wheel]] was first used in [[Europe]] in 1894 and became standard on French [[Panhard]] cars in 1898. [[Arthur Krebs|Arthur Constantin Krebs]] replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard & Levassor car he designed for the Paris-Amsterdam race which ran from the 7\u201313 July 1898. In the US, [[Packard]] introduced a steering wheel on the second car they built, in 1899. By early in the next century, the steering wheel had nearly replaced the tiller in automobiles. However, some automobiles still used tillers into the teens, such as Rauch & Lang Carriage Co., a manufacturer of electric automobiles in Cleveland, Ohio. [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester]] in England also offered tiller steering later than many car manufacturers.\n\nToday, tractor-drawn semi-trailers for [[Fire apparatus#Tiller ladder|ladder trucks]] use a \"tiller\" (rear steering axle) driver to control the trailer where the aerial ladder is located. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s often use tiller steering. The tiller of the electric threewheeler [[TWIKE]] - called ''Joystick'' - includes buttons for acceleration and electric braking. [[Mobility scooters]] are usually fitted with a tiller.\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[File:tiller1.jpg|Aircraft tiller that will be used by Captain]]\n\nMost large, [[transport category]] airplanes use a device known as a tiller to steer the airplane while [[taxiing]]. This usually takes the form of a small steering wheel or lever in the cockpit, often one for the pilot and one for the co-pilot. However, they differ from the tiller on a ship. Rather than move the rudder, the tiller on an airplane steers by turning the nose wheel, and the tiller is moved in the direction of the turn, rather than opposite the turn as on a ship.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ship's wheel]]\n* [[Steering engine]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Sailing ship elements}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Control devices]]\n[[Category:Sailboat components]]\n[[Category:Sailing ship components]]\n[[Category:Watercraft components]]\n\n[[fr:Barre (bateau)]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the tiller of a vehicle}}\n[[File:Rumpel.JPG|thumb|Tiller blocked by two lines]]\n[[File:Vasa-tiller room-3.jpg|thumb|right|Stern compartment containing the tiller of Swedish 17th century warship ''[[Vasa (ship)|Vasa]]''.]]\nA '''tiller''' or '''till''' is a [[lever]] used to steer a vehicle.

It took two minutes to recognise and correct the error, by which time it was too late to avoid collision with the iceberg.

A [[steering wheel]] was first used in [[Europe]] in 1894 and became standard on French [[Panhard]] cars in 1898. [[Arthur Krebs|Arthur Constantin Krebs]] replaced the tiller with an inclined steering wheel for the Panhard & Levassor car he designed for the Paris-Amsterdam race which ran from the 7\u201313 July 1898. In the USA, [[Packard]] introduced a steering wheel on the second car they built, in 1899. By early in the next century, the steering wheel had nearly replaced the tiller in automobiles. However, some automobiles still used tillers into the teens, such as Rauch & Lang Carriage Co., a manufacturer of electric automobiles in Cleveland, Ohio. [[Lanchester Motor Company|Lanchester]] in England also offered tiller steering later than many car manufacturers.\n\nToday, tractor-drawn semi-trailers for [[Fire apparatus#Tiller ladder|ladder trucks]] use a \"tiller\" (rear steering axle) driver to control the trailer where the aerial ladder is located. [[Recumbent bicycle]]s often use tiller steering. The tiller of the electric threewheeler [[TWIKE]] - called ''Joystick'' - includes buttons for acceleration and electric braking. [[Mobility scooters]] are usually fitted with a tiller.\n\n=== Aircraft ===\n[[File:tiller1.jpg|Aircraft tiller that will be used by Captain]]\n\nMost large, [[transport category]] airplanes use a device known as a tiller to steer the airplane while [[taxiing]]. This usually takes the form of a small steering wheel or lever in the cockpit, often one for the pilot and one for the co-pilot. However, they differ from the tiller on a ship. Rather than move the rudder, the tiller on an airplane steers by turning the nose wheel, and the tiller is moved in the direction of the turn, rather than opposite the turn as on a ship.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ship's wheel]]\n* [[Steering engine]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Sailing ship elements}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Control devices]]\n[[Category:Sailboat components]]\n[[Category:Sailing ship components]]\n[[Category:Watercraft components]]\n\n[[fr:Barre (bateau)]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLandcraft:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: the USA \u2192 the US", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiller"}

This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity.<ref name=pmid2285495/> Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration.<ref name=pmid4150336/> This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium.<ref>Hulting J, Rosenhamer G: Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of disopyramide in patients with ventricular arrhythmia. Acta Med Scand 199:41-51, 1976.</ref> As a result, the use of disopyramide may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure.<ref name=pmid4150336/>\n\nLevites proposed a possible secondary mode of action for disopyramide, against reentrant arrhythmias after an ischemic insult. Disopyramide decreases the inhomogeneity between infarcted and normal myocardium refractory periods; in addition to lengthening the refractory period.<ref name=pmid474380/> This decreases the chance of re-entry depolarization, because signals are more likely to encounter tissue in a refractory state which cannot be excited.<ref>Guyton, Arthur C., Hall, John E. (2006). Textbook of Medical Physiology (11th ed.). Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders.</ref> This provides a possible treatment for atrial and ventricular fibrillation, as it restores pacemaker control of the tissue to the SA and AV nodes.<ref>Katzung, Bertram G., Masters, Susan B., Trevor, Anthony J.

It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) intracavitary obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not reduce resting LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that disopyramide controlled release is the most potent agent available for reducing resting pressure gradients and improving symptoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ball W, Ivanov J, Rakowski H, Wigle ED, Linghorne M, Ralph-Edwards A, Williams WG, Schwartz L, Guttman A, Woo A| year = 2011 | title = Long-term survival in patients with resting obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy comparison of conservative versus invasive treatment | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.040 | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 2313\u20132321 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherrid MV, Barac I, McKenna WJ, Elliott PM, Dickie S, Chojnowska L, Casey S, Maron BJ| year = 2005 | title = Multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of disopyramide in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 45 | issue = 8| pages = 1251\u20131258 | doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2005.01.012 | pmid = 15837258}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elliott PM, Gimeno JR, Thaman R, Shah J, Ward D, Dickie S, Tome Esteban MT, McKenna WJ| year = 2006 | title = Historical trends in reported survival rates in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | url = | journal = Heart | volume = 92 | issue = 6| pages = 785\u2013791 | doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.068577| pmc = 1860645 | pmid=16216855}}</ref><ref name=pmid23704138>{{cite journal | pmid= 23704138| year= 2013| author1= Sherrid| first1= M.

[[Vagal]] blockade predictably causes dry mouth, and in men with [[prostatism]], may cause urinary retention.

Prog Cardiovasc Dis. 2012;54:483-492</ref> This combination increases acceptance of higher disopyramide dosing, important since there is a dose-response correlation in obstructive HCM, higher doses yielding lower gradients.\n\nAnother concern about disopyramide has been the hypothetical potential for inducing sudden death from its type 1 anti-arrhythmic effects. However, a multicenter registry and two recent cohort registries have largely reduced this concern, by showing sudden death rates lower than that observed from the disease itself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=pmid23704138/>\n\nThese concerns about the drug must be viewed from the clinical perspective that disopyramide is generally the last agent that is tried for patients before they are referred for invasive septal reduction with surgical septal myectomy (an open-heart operation) or alcohol septal ablation (a controlled heart attack). Both of these invasive procedures have risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\nFor selected patients, a trial of oral disopyramide is a reasonable approach before proceeding to invasive septal reduction. Patients who respond to disopyramide are continued on the drug. Those who continue to have disabling symptoms or who experience side effects are promptly referred for septal reduction. Using such a stepped strategy, investigators have reported that survival does not differ from that observed in the age-matched normal United States population.<ref name=pmid23704138/>\n\n==Cardiac adverse effects==\n*[[Acute decompensated heart failure|Acute heart failure]] \u2013 Disopyramide should not be given to patients with impaired LV systolic function and low ejection fraction.

This results in an increased threshold for excitation and a decreased upstroke velocity.<ref name=pmid2285495/> Disopyramide prolongs the PR interval by lengthening both the QRS and P wave duration.<ref name=pmid4150336/> This effect is particularly well suited in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia as it slows the action potential propagation through the atria to the ventricles. Disopyramide does not act as a blocking agent for beta or alpha adrenergic receptors, but does have a significant negative inotropic effect on the ventricular myocardium.<ref>Hulting J, Rosenhamer G: Hemodynamic and electrocardiographic effects of disopyramide in patients with ventricular arrhythmia. Acta Med Scand 199:41-51, 1976.</ref> As a result, the use of disopyramide may reduce contractile force up to 42% at low doses and up to 100% in higher doses leading to heart failure.<ref name=pmid4150336/>\n\nLevites proposed a possible secondary mode of action for disopyramide, against reentrant arrhythmias after an ischemic insult. Disopyramide decreases the inhomogeneity between infarcted and normal myocardium refractory periods; in addition to lengthening the refractory period.<ref name=pmid474380/> This decreases the chance of re-entry depolarization, because signals are more likely to encounter tissue in a refractory state which cannot be excited.<ref>Guyton, Arthur C., Hall, John E.

Philadelphia: Elsevier Saunders.</ref> This provides a possible treatment for atrial and ventricular fibrillation, as it restores pacemaker control of the tissue to the SA and AV nodes.<ref>Katzung, Bertram G., Masters, Susan B., Trevor, Anthony J.

It is estimated that there are 600,000 individuals in the United States with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The most common variant of HCM presents with left ventricular (LV) intracavitary obstruction due to systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve, and mitral-septal contact, diagnosed readily with echocardiography. Pharmacologic treatment with negative inotropic drugs is first-line therapy. Beta-blockers are used first, and while they improve symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain and exercise intolerance, they do not reduce resting LV intraventricular pressure gradients and often are inadequate to control symptoms. Many investigators and clinicians believe that disopyramide controlled release is the most potent agent available for reducing resting pressure gradients and improving symptoms.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Ball W, Ivanov J, Rakowski H, Wigle ED, Linghorne M, Ralph-Edwards A, Williams WG, Schwartz L, Guttman A, Woo A| year = 2011 | title = Long-term survival in patients with resting obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy comparison of conservative versus invasive treatment | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2011.08.040 | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 2313\u20132321 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Sherrid MV, Barac I, McKenna WJ, Elliott PM, Dickie S, Chojnowska L, Casey S, Maron BJ| year = 2005 | title = Multicenter study of the efficacy and safety of disopyramide in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 45 | issue = 8| pages = 1251\u20131258 | doi=10.1016/j.jacc.2005.01.012 | pmid = 15837258}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Elliott PM, Gimeno JR, Thaman R, Shah J, Ward D, Dickie S, Tome Esteban MT, McKenna WJ| year = 2006 | title = Historical trends in reported survival rates in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy | url = | journal = Heart | volume = 92 | issue = 6| pages = 785\u2013791 | doi=10.1136/hrt.2005.068577| pmc = 1860645 | pmid=16216855}}</ref><ref name=pmid23704138>{{cite journal | pmid= 23704138| year= 2013| author1= Sherrid| first1= M.

Disopyramide\u2019s particular efficacy is due to its potent negative inotropic effects; in head-to-head comparison, it is more effective for gradient reduction than either beta-blocker or verapamil.<ref>Kajimoto K, Imai T, Minami Y, Kasanuki H.

When used in patients resistant to beta-blockade, disopyramide is effective in 60% of cases, reducing symptoms and gradient to the extent that invasive procedures such as surgical septal myectomy are not required.<ref name=pmid23704138/>\n\nDisopyramide, despite its efficacy, has one main side effect that has limited its use in the US, though it has seen wider application in Canada, UK and Japan. [[Vagal]] blockade predictably causes dry mouth, and in men with [[prostatism]], may cause urinary retention. Teichman et al. showed that [[pyridostigmine]] used in combination with disopyramide substantially alleviates vagolytic side effects without compromising antiarrhythmic efficacy.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Teichman SL, Ferrick A, Kim SG, Matos JA, Waspe LE, Fisher JD| year = 1987 | title = Disopyramide-pyridostigmine interaction: Selective reversal of anticholinergic symptoms with preservation of antiarrhythmic effect | url = | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 633\u2013641 | doi=10.1016/s0735-1097(87)80207-3}}</ref> This combination has also been shown to be effective and safe in obstructive HCM in a large cohort of patients.<ref name=pmid23704138/> Some clinicians prescribe pyridostigmine sustained release (marketed in the US as Mestinon Timespan) to every patient begun on disopyramide.<ref>Sherrid MV, Arabadjian M. A primer of disopyramide treatment of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Prog Cardiovasc Dis. 2012;54:483-492</ref> This combination increases acceptance of higher disopyramide dosing, important since there is a dose-response correlation in obstructive HCM, higher doses yielding lower gradients.\n\nAnother concern about disopyramide has been the hypothetical potential for inducing sudden death from its type 1 anti-arrhythmic effects. However, a multicenter registry and two recent cohort registries have largely reduced this concern, by showing sudden death rates lower than that observed from the disease itself.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/><ref name=pmid23704138/>\n\nThese concerns about the drug must be viewed from the clinical perspective that disopyramide is generally the last agent that is tried for patients before they are referred for invasive septal reduction with surgical septal myectomy (an open-heart operation) or alcohol septal ablation (a controlled heart attack). Both of these invasive procedures have risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\nFor selected patients, a trial of oral disopyramide is a reasonable approach before proceeding to invasive septal reduction. Patients who respond to disopyramide are continued on the drug. Those who continue to have disabling symptoms or who experience side effects are promptly referred for septal reduction. Using such a stepped strategy, investigators have reported that survival does not differ from that observed in the age-matched normal United States population.<ref name=pmid23704138/>\n\n==Cardiac adverse effects==\n*[[Acute decompensated heart failure|Acute heart failure]] \u2013 Disopyramide should not be given to patients with impaired LV systolic function and low ejection fraction.

Its distinct features are two handles counter-rotating around the [[Tang (tools)|tang]] such that, when closed, the blade is concealed within grooves in the handles.

Blunt versions of these knives, called \"trainers\", are for sale to practice tricks without the risk of injury.\n\nThe knife is now illegal or restricted in some countries, often under the same laws and for the same reasons that [[switchblade]]s or concealed weapons are restricted, and in their country of origin they are no longer as common in urban areas as they were.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.butterflyknifebutterflyknife.com/Butterfly_Knife_Legal_Status.html|title=legal possession|last=|first=|date=|website=www.butterflyknifebutterflyknife.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-25}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"balisong\" is likely derived from [[barangay]] (village) Balisong, part of the municipality of [[Taal, Batangas|Taal]], [[Batangas]] province, which along with the neighboring barangay Pandayan, were the original manufacturing centers of the knives in the Philippines.

Other names for the knives in English include \"fan knives\" and \"butterfly knives\" from the motion, and \"click clacks\" from the sound they make when they are opened and closed.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the knives is unclear. Oral histories claim that the knives were first created in the Philippines in 800 AD. However, there is no documentation or archeological evidence to back this. Balisong mass production in the Philippines can only be attested to the early 1900s. Another claim is that balisong were originally an adaptation of a French measuring tool called the ''pied du roi'' (\"foot of the king\"), invented between the 1500s to the late 1700s. However, how it was introduced to the Philippines is unknown. There are theories that it may have been introduced by sailors in the [[Spanish Empire]], which was then allied to France.<ref name=\"brown\"/><ref name=\"Morel\"/>\n\nRegardless of the origin, the modern balisong was perfected in the Philippines, where it became much larger and were predominantly used as a weapon and not just a tool. The quick opening techniques (\"flipping\") were also developed in the Philippines. In contrast, the French ''pied du roi'' was primarily a folding [[ruler]], with the knife only included in some specimens as a novelty. They were cumbersome to open and unlikely to be used for self-defense, especially since they also commonly included a metal tang at the end of the handle to aid in measuring.<ref name=\"brown\">{{cite web|url=https://blademag.com/knife-history/history-the-disputed-origins-of-the-butterfly-knife|title=Butterfly Knife History|last1=Brown|first1=Trevor|date=October 22, 2018|website=[[Blade Magazine]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Morel\">{{cite web |last1=Morel |first1=Guillaume |title=Between myth & reality |url=http://www.balisong.net/en/history.htm |website=Balisong.net |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> There were also very similar designs to the balisong produced in [[England]] in the late 19th century, presumably also derived from the ''pied du roi''. But like the latter they were primarily utilitarian tools.<ref>{{cite web |title=The History of the Balisong: What little I know of it |url=http://www.balisongcollector.com/history.html |website=The Balisong Collector's Page |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nThere are two main types of balisong construction: \"sandwich construction\" and \"channel construction\".\n\nSandwich constructed balisong knives are assembled in layers that are generally pinned or screwed together though may sometimes use a ball-bearing system. They allow the pivot pins to be adjusted more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers.\n\nFor a channel constructed balisong, the main part of each handle is formed from one piece of material. In this handle, a groove is created (either by folding, milling, or being integrally cast) in which the blade rests when the knife is closed. This style is regarded as being stronger than sandwich construction.\n\nSome of the blades of traditional butterfly knives in the Philippines were made from steel taken from railroad tracks thus giving them a decent amount of durability and hardness, while others are made from the recycled [[Leaf spring#By blacksmiths|leaf springs]] of vehicles.\n\nSome balisongs, such as the Benchmade 51, do not use Tang Pins. Instead, it uses \"Zen Pins\", which are two small pins embedded in the handles of the balisong which make contact with the bottom of the blade. A balisong with zen pins negates the problem of having the tang pin fall out (as with some cheaper models).\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Parts of a balisong3.jpg|thumb|Parts of a Benchmade 42.]]\n; Bite handle: The handle that closes on the sharp edge of the blade, and will cut the user if they are holding the handle when they go to close it.

One edge of the blade is sharp and will cut the user if they are not careful, especially when flipping the knife. The other edge, called the swedge, is blunt and won't cut the user. The swedge commonly impacts the user's hand when flipping.\n\n==Legal status==\n{{further|Switchblade#Legality}}\nThe balisong has been outlawed in several countries.\n* In the [[Philippines]], it is now generally illegal to carry one without identification or a proper permit in the streets of [[Metro Manila|the capital]] because of their prevalent use in crimes and altercations.

Other names for the knives in English include \"fan knives\" and \"butterfly knives\" from the motion, and \"click clacks\" from the sound they make when they are opened and closed.\n\n==History==\nThe origin of the knives is unclear. Oral histories claim that the knives were first created in the Philippines in 800 AD. However, there is no documentation or archeological evidence to back this. Balisong mass production in the Philippines can only be attested to the early 1900s. Another claim is that balisong were originally an adaptation of a French measuring tool called the ''pied du roi'' (\"foot of the king\"), invented between the 1500s to the late 1700s. However, how it was introduced to the Philippines is unknown. There are theories that it may have been introduced by sailors in the [[Spanish Empire]], which was then allied to France.<ref name=\"brown\"/><ref name=\"Morel\"/>\n\nRegardless of the origin, the modern balisong was perfected in the Philippines, where it became much larger and were predominantly used as a weapon and not just a tool. The quick opening techniques (\"flipping\") were also developed in the Philippines. In contrast, the French ''pied du roi'' was primarily a folding [[ruler]], with the knife only included in some specimens as a novelty. They were cumbersome to open and unlikely to be used for self-defense, especially since they also commonly included a metal tang at the end of the handle to aid in measuring.<ref name=\"brown\">{{cite web|url=https://blademag.com/knife-history/history-the-disputed-origins-of-the-butterfly-knife|title=Butterfly Knife History|last1=Brown|first1=Trevor|date=October 22, 2018|website=[[Blade Magazine]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Morel\">{{cite web |last1=Morel |first1=Guillaume |title=Between myth & reality |url=http://www.balisong.net/en/history.htm |website=Balisong.net |accessdate=7 January 2019}}</ref> There were also very similar designs to the balisong produced in [[England]] in the late 19th century, presumably also derived from the ''pied du roi''.

They allow the pivot pins to be adjusted more tightly without binding. When the knife is closed, the blade rests between the layers.\n\nFor a channel constructed balisong, the main part of each handle is formed from one piece of material. In this handle, a groove is created (either by folding, milling, or being integrally cast) in which the blade rests when the knife is closed. This style is regarded as being stronger than sandwich construction.\n\nSome of the blades of traditional butterfly knives in the Philippines were made from steel taken from railroad tracks thus giving them a decent amount of durability and hardness, while others are made from the recycled [[Leaf spring#By blacksmiths|leaf springs]] of vehicles.\n\nSome balisongs, such as the Benchmade 51, do not use Tang Pins. Instead, it uses \"Zen Pins\", which are two small pins embedded in the handles of the balisong which make contact with the bottom of the blade. A balisong with zen pins negates the problem of having the tang pin fall out (as with some cheaper models).\n\n==Parts==\n[[File:Parts of a balisong3.jpg|thumb|Parts of a Benchmade 42.]]\n; Bite handle: The handle that closes on the sharp edge of the blade, and will cut the user if they are holding the handle when they go to close it.

One now needs to demonstrate the need in professional livelihood or utilitarian purpose (such as cutting grass, preparing fruits and meats, being a vendor of knives, being [[Filipino Martial Arts|martial arts instructors]], etc.) to be able to walk around with bladed implements in the urban areas.

Australian Legal Definition: A flick knife (or other similar device) that has a blade which opens automatically by gravity or centripetal acceleration or by any pressure applied to a button, spring or device in or attached to the handle of the knife.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* In [[Canada]], although not specified by name as a prohibited weapon, the balisong knife is often considered by courts to fall under the \"[[gravity knife]]\" or a [[centripetal acceleration|centripetal]] classification and is, therefore, prohibited, unless [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in before prohibition.\n* In [[Sweden]], it's illegal to carry, import or trade a balisong; legal to own and collect.\n* In [[Hungary]], balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives, they are legal to possess one regardless of its length, but it\u2019s illegal to carry one that\u2019s longer than 8 cm (3.14 inches) in public.\n* In the United Kingdom, the balisong has been legally classified as an offensive weapon since January 1989.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blades-uk.com/1988ACT.php | title = UK Offensive Weapons Act 1988 | accessdate = 2006-11-05}}</ref> While they are legal to possess, carrying one in public is an offence under the [[Prevention of Crime Act 1953]]. Sale, lending, hiring, giving or importing is prohibited by the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]], as amended by the [[Offensive Weapons Act 1996]]. Any imported are liable to be seized and prosecution may follow. An exception is made for knives of this type over 100 years old, which are classed as antiques.\n* In the [[Czech republic]], balisongs, switchblades and gravity knives are treated like normal knives.\n* In [[Switzerland]], balisongs are illegal to carry, give, lend, buy, or trade.\n* In [[Germany]], the balisong was outlawed when the Waffengesetz (weapons law) was tightened in April 2003 in the aftermath of the [[Erfurt massacre]]. Thus buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and trading it is illegal and is punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the knife and a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] of up to [[Euro|\u20ac]]10,000. Using a butterfly knife for crime of any kind \u2013 as is any illegal weapon \u2013 is punishable by from 1 to 10 years imprisonment.\n* In [[Finland]], balisongs are legal to be purchased, sold and possessed, and are treated just like regular knives and befall under the edged weapons law. Carrying one in public is permitted if the person carrying one can prove it is used as a tool.\n*In the [[Republic of Ireland]], butterfly knives are illegal offensive weapons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/FAQ|title=Frequently Asked Questions|first=The Department of Justice and|last=Equality|website=www.justice.ie}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1991/si/66/made/en/print|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie}}</ref>\n* In [[Lithuania]], balisongs among other knives are legal to possess and carry as they are not considered weapons.
