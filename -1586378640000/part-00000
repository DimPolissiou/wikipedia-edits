However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the issue Free Trade. The official party led by Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] became more and more worried about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National Party]] to more openly support MacDonald's administration. Ramsay became one of the founder members of this group <ref>David Dutton, ''Liberals in Schism: A History of the National Liberal Party''; I B Tauris, 2008 p40</ref> and thereafter sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal National.\n\nHe held his seat at the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] in a straight fight with Moffat-Pender for the Conservatives.<ref>''The Times House of Commons 1931''; Politico\u2019s Publishing 2003 p119</ref>\nAt the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], Ramsay was not opposed by an official Liberal candidate or his Unionist coalition partners, but he was faced by Labour's [[Malcolm Macmillan]] and an Independent candidate representing the [[Scottish National Party]], Sir Alexander MacEwen.

From 1929\u20131931, she served as the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]] in Shropshire.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEdith Picton-Turbervill was born at Lower House, [[Fownhope]], [[Herefordshire]] on 13 June 1872, the twin daughter of John Picton Warlow, then a captain in the Madras Staff Corps, and his wife Eleanor (n\u00e9e Temple) daughter of Sir Grenville Temple, Bt, of Stowe. She changed her name to Picton-Turbervill at the same time as her father, when in 1892 he inherited the Turbervill estate of [[Ewenny Priory]] in [[Glamorgan]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Turbervill, Edith Picton- (1872\u20131960), social reformer {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45465?rskey=EjTT7x&result=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45465}}</ref> The estate was over 3,000 acres and her father was a mine royalty owner and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]; he was a JP and a member of the [[Penybont]] [[Rural District]] Council. Edith was educated at the [[Royal High School, Bath|Royal School]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Both her family environment and her school encouraged her in the belief that life was essentially something active, preferably on the behalf of others; she was also deeply religious.\n\n==Missionary work with the YWCA==\n\nIt was social and philanthropic work which drew her to the labour movement, leading her to conclude that 'fundamental changes in law were necessary to obtain better conditions of life for the people'.<ref>{{cite book | last = Picton-Turbervill | first = Edith | title = [[Life is good: an autobiography]] | year = 1939 | publisher = Morgan & Scott Ltd|location=London, England|page=154}}</ref> She grew up in a family which was aristocratically connected, although not particularly affluent until she was grown up.\n\nHer first experience of social work was among navvies working on the building of the [[Vale of Glamorgan Railway]], near her home. They were living in squalid conditions, isolated from the local community, and Edith attempted their moral improvement through religion<ref name=\":0\" /> and the provision of a reading room. At this time her interests were mainly in evangelical work, and she attended a training school for missionaries in London as a preparation for missionary work in the East. Part of the course consisted of slum visiting, which brought her into contact with the slums of [[Shoreditch]] and the evils of sweated labour.\n\nAs a young woman she had met in America the Hon. [[Emily Kinnaird]], of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA), and it was through her that Edith first developed an interest in that organisation. In 1900 she went to India to work for the YWCA, mainly among Anglo-Indians and Indian women students, until ill health compelled her to return home in 1906. She went back to India after her illness and became travelling secretary of the YWCA Student's department in Southern India, finally leaving in 1908 after a bad case of malaria.<ref name=\":0\" /> She never lost her interest in India, and later was active in Indian debates during her two years in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. On returning home she became Head of the Foreign Department from 1909.\n\nAt this time she was also involved in the campaign for the women's suffrage, but on the suffragist side, regarding [[Millicent Fawcett]] as her leader rather than [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], for whom however, she had a high regard. During the [[First World War]] she was involved in YWCA work to provide hostels and canteens for the [[Munitionette|women munition workers]] and for members of the [[Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (Britain)|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]] in France.<ref name=\":0\" />  She received the [[Order of the British Empire]] (O.B.E.) for this work in 1918.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30460|supp=y |pages=384 |date= 4 January 1918}}</ref> She was, for a time, director of appeal, Munition Workers' Welfare Committee, for the YWCA, and was national vice-president from 1914\u20131920 and from 1922\u20131928.\n\n==Campaigning for women to be priests==\n\nOne of her lifelong wishes was that women should be allowed to take orders and enter the [[Church of England]]. Soon after the end of the [[First World War]] she became the first woman to preach a service at a statutory service in the Church of England, at [[North Somercotes]] in Lincolnshire. She was also one of a number of women who preached at [[St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate|St Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate]], at the invitation of the rector, G. W. Hudson Shaw.\n\nShe held the [[Bishop of London]]'s Inter-Diocesan Diploma for evangelical work; and all her life the place of women in the Church remained a central concern. She wrote books and articles on the subject, always campaigning for women to take up an equal place in the Church hierarchy.\n\n==Labour Party==\nIt was during the war years that she seems to have made her first contact with people from the Labour Party, and amongst them; [[George Lansbury]] and [[Margaret Bondfield]]. Bondfield seems to have especially influenced her, and she was greatly impressed by [[Arthur Henderson]]'s '\u2019The Aims of Labour'\u2019 (1918).\n\nShe joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1919, and became a parliamentary candidate for [[Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington North]] at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]]. [[Maude Royden]] and [[Isabella Ford]] were among those who gave her active support in the campaign, and although she had little hope of winning the seat, she did increase the Labour Party's share of the vote.\n\nAt the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]], she did not stand herself, but worked in [[Port Talbot]] for [[Ramsay MacDonald]], with whom she remained on friendly terms until his death. However, she was critical of his actions in her autobiography.\n\nPicton-Turbervell was the unsuccessful Labour candidate for [[Stroud (UK Parliament constituency)|Stroud]] in [[Gloucestershire]] in 1924 and had some sharp comments on party [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] MacDonald's silence on the [[Zinoviev letter]], which turned out to be a forgery. She noted that MacDonald's lack of comment had \"a devastating effect\" upon Labour candidates at the election. In February 1925 she was again selected as the Stroud Labour candidate<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.Findmypast.com|title=Miss Picton-Turbervill Again Selected|last=|first=|date=28 February 1925|work=Cheltenham Chronicle|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> but she resigned in June 1925 owing to dissention in the local party, following which Tom Langham, Party President along with two vice presidents resigned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.findmypast.com|title=Resignation of Prospective Woman Candidate|last=|first=|date=12 June 1925|work=Gloucester Citizen|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, she was selected as a Labour candidate for a marginal seat, [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], in Shropshire \u2013 like [[Stroud]], a largely rural constituency with a mining community of about four thousand; and she became a close friend of the local miners' agent William (Bill) Latham \u2013 \"A splendid old man, he was a strong chapel man and his speeches full of [[Old Testament]] phraseology and references\".<ref>Life is good (1939:170)</ref>\n\n==Life in Parliament==\nAlthough an [[Anglican]], she was frequently asked to preach in the local chapels of the Wrekin area, and at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] she won the seat by nearly 3,000 votes.<ref>Cheryl Law: Women, A Modern Political Dictionary, p. 125</ref> When the results were announced \"some in the vast crowd, sang the [[doxology]] 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow' \u2013 this was caught up by a large number and swelled into a loud chorus\".<ref>Life is good  (1939:170)</ref>\n\nIn 1929, there were fourteen women in the new House of Commons with just over 600 men; and the account of the 1929\u201331 Parliament in her autobiography is worth reading. She was always concerned with the inferior status of women in society, and always supported reforming measures and successfully introduced the [[Sentence of Death (Expectant Mothers) Act 1931|Sentence of Death (Expectant Mothers) Bill]] to prevent the passing of the death sentence on pregnant women. In her handling of this, she showed her essential humanity and sensitivity. Because of her knowledge of canon law, she was nominated by the Government \u2013 the first woman to be nominated \u2013 to the [[Ecclesiastical Committee]] of Parliament (July 1929).\n\nIn her politics, she was consistently a moderate and an admirer of MacDonald, but in the crisis of 1931, after a period of hesitation \u2013 she abstained from voting on the first vote of confidence asked for by the [[National Government (1931\u20131935)|National Government]] \u2013 she decided to remain with the Labour Party. Henderson and [[William Graham (Edinburgh MP)|William Graham]], especially the latter, were mainly responsible for her decision.\n\nPicton-Turbervill was an enthusistic advocate for [[Women in law enforcement|women in the police]], organising a number of Parliamentary discussions on the issue. Speaking in July 1931, she argued that the \"use of trained policewomen creates a better social order in our cities\",<ref>Hansard, 30 July 1931, col. 2603-20, Vol. 255.</ref> and advocated for more women to be employed by the police.\n\nAt the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], she lost her seat to [[James Baldwin-Webb]] of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].<ref>Law (2001:125)</ref> Edith had fully expected this, and in her own account of these days emphasised the enormous influence of the radio broadcasts of MacDonald and [[Philip Snowden, 1st Viscount Snowden|Philip Snowden]] in winning support for the National Government. As she wrote later: \"The panic, however, that had been created with regard to money was so great that I verily believe if a [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] had stood in that election for the National Government he would in some circumstances have been returned to Parliament.\"<ref>Life is good (1939:268)</ref>\n\n==Her travels and work after Parliament==\nShe had travelled widely all her life, and after losing her seat in Parliament, she travelled to [[Russia]] in 1932 (which did not impress her) and [[Kenya]] in 1933. In 1935, she visited [[Turkey]] as head of the British delegation to the International Congress of Women Citizens, and as such met President [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]]. She visited [[Copenhagen]] in the same capacity in 1939. In 1935, she was a member of the Next Five Years Group and in 1936 was asked to join a Government Commission to Hong Kong and Malaya to inquire into the [[mui tsai]] question. This was a subject on which she had spoken many times while in Parliament. Under this system, young girls were transferred from their birth parents to another household in return for money, to become domestic servants. It was obviously open to abuse, and was in fact, illegal but still widespread.\n\nAn attempt had been made to register and inspect existing mui tsais in 1929, but there was still a good deal of disquiet on the subject. Her investigations led Edith Picton-Turbervill to write a Minority Report. The two other commissioners, Sir Wilfred Woods and C. A. Willis, retired members of the [[Ceylon]] and [[Sudan]] Civil Services respectively, thought that the existing legislation simply needed to be more actively enforced. They thought it politically unwise to do as Edith suggested in her report \u2013 to extend the system of registration and inspection to all transferred children, whether they were called mui tsais or whatever. The Colonial Office published both reports in 1937, and in 1939 the Governments of Hong Kong and Malaya both accepted the principle of the Minority Report.\n\n==Later life ==\n[[File:Edith Picton-Turberville portrait.jpg|thumb|Picton-Turberville portrait from her autobiography (1939)]]\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Edith Picton-Turbervill worked for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] from 1941\u201343. In 1944, she was President of the National Council of Women Citizens. From 1940, she lived in the [[Cheltenham]] area, continued to write, lecture and support the many causes in which she had worked, and also appeared on radio and television. She died on 31 August 1960 at [[Barnwood House Hospital]],<ref name=\":0\"/> aged 88, and left an estate of \u00a325,555.\n\nEdith was an impressive figure physically, tall and strong-featured. Her speeches in Parliament were forthright, and based upon strongly held beliefs and were well argued. She had a wide circle of mostly female friends, including [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] Labourites. Coming as she did from an old and privileged family, her [[socialist]] views were in sharp contrast and at odds with many family members, their friends and neighbours. She went against conformity, never married and without that responsibility had a very full and active public life, which she exploited to the full in her campaign to improve the status of women.\n\n==Books and other writing==\n''The Coming Order in the Church of Christ'', 19th century and after 80, nos. 475 477 (1916) 521\u201330, 1000\u20137<br>\n(with B.H.

From 1929-1931, she served as the [[Member of Parliament]] for [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]] in Shropshire.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEdith Picton-Turbervill was born at Lower House, [[Fownhope]], [[Herefordshire]] on 13 June 1872, the twin daughter of John Picton Warlow, then a captain in the Madras Staff Corps, and his wife Eleanor (n\u00e9e Temple) daughter of Sir Grenville Temple, Bt, of Stowe. She changed her name to Picton-Turbervill at the same time as her father, when in 1892 he inherited the Turbervill estate of [[Ewenny Priory]] in [[Glamorgan]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Turbervill, Edith Picton- (1872\u20131960), social reformer {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45465?rskey=EjTT7x&result=1|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-45465}}</ref> The estate was over 3,000 acres and her father was a mine royalty owner and a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]; he was a JP and a member of the [[Penybont]] [[Rural District]] Council. Edith was educated at the [[Royal High School, Bath|Royal School]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Both her family environment and her school encouraged her in the belief that life was essentially something active, preferably on the behalf of others; she was also deeply religious.\n\n==Missionary work with the YWCA==\n\nIt was social and philanthropic work which drew her to the labour movement, leading her to conclude that 'fundamental changes in law were necessary to obtain better conditions of life for the people'.<ref>{{cite book | last = Picton-Turbervill | first = Edith | title = [[Life is good: an autobiography]] | year = 1939 | publisher = Morgan & Scott Ltd|location=London, England|page=154}}</ref> She grew up in a family which was aristocratically connected, although not particularly affluent until she was grown up.\n\nHer first experience of social work was among navvies working on the building of the [[Vale of Glamorgan Railway]], near her home. They were living in squalid conditions, isolated from the local community, and Edith attempted their moral improvement through religion<ref name=\":0\" /> and the provision of a reading room. At this time her interests were mainly in evangelical work, and she attended a training school for missionaries in London as a preparation for missionary work in the East. Part of the course consisted of slum visiting, which brought her into contact with the slums of [[Shoreditch]] and the evils of sweated labour.\n\nAs a young woman she had met in America the Hon. [[Emily Kinnaird]], of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA), and it was through her that Edith first developed an interest in that organisation. In 1900 she went to India to work for the YWCA, mainly among Anglo-Indians and Indian women students, until ill health compelled her to return home in 1906. She went back to India after her illness and became travelling secretary of the YWCA Student's department in Southern India, finally leaving in 1908 after a bad case of malaria.<ref name=\":0\" /> She never lost her interest in India, and later was active in Indian debates during her two years in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. On returning home she became Head of the Foreign Department from 1909.\n\nAt this time she was also involved in the campaign for the women's suffrage, but on the suffragist side, regarding [[Millicent Fawcett]] as her leader rather than [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], for whom however, she had a high regard. During the [[First World War]] she was involved in YWCA work to provide hostels and canteens for the [[Munitionette|women munition workers]] and for members of the [[Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (Britain)|Women's Army Auxiliary Corps]] in France.<ref name=\":0\" />  She received the [[Order of the British Empire]] (O.B.E.) for this work in 1918.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=30460|supp=y |pages=384 |date= 4 January 1918}}</ref> She was, for a time, director of appeal, Munition Workers' Welfare Committee, for the YWCA, and was national vice-president from 1914\u20131920 and from 1922\u20131928.\n\n==Campaigning for women to be priests==\n\nOne of her lifelong wishes was that women should be allowed to take orders and enter the [[Church of England]]. Soon after the end of the [[First World War]] she became the first woman to preach a service at a statutory service in the Church of England, at [[North Somercotes]] in Lincolnshire. She was also one of a number of women who preached at [[St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate|St Botolph's Church, Bishopsgate]], at the invitation of the rector, G. W. Hudson Shaw.\n\nShe held the [[Bishop of London]]'s Inter-Diocesan Diploma for evangelical work; and all her life the place of women in the Church remained a central concern. She wrote books and articles on the subject, always campaigning for women to take up an equal place in the Church hierarchy.\n\n==Labour Party==\nIt was during the war years that she seems to have made her first contact with people from the Labour Party, and amongst them; [[George Lansbury]] and [[Margaret Bondfield]]. Bondfield seems to have especially influenced her, and she was greatly impressed by [[Arthur Henderson]]'s '\u2019The Aims of Labour'\u2019 (1918).\n\nShe joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 1919, and became a parliamentary candidate for [[Islington North (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington North]] at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]]. [[Maude Royden]] and [[Isabella Ford]] were among those who gave her active support in the campaign, and although she had little hope of winning the seat, she did increase the Labour Party's share of the vote.\n\nAt the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]], she did not stand herself, but worked in [[Port Talbot]] for [[Ramsay MacDonald]], with whom she remained on friendly terms until his death. However, she was critical of his actions in her autobiography.\n\nPicton-Turbervell was the unsuccessful Labour candidate for [[Stroud (UK Parliament constituency)|Stroud]] in [[Gloucestershire]] in 1924 and had some sharp comments on party [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] MacDonald's silence on the [[Zinoviev letter]], which turned out to be a forgery. She noted that MacDonald's lack of comment had \"a devastating effect\" upon Labour candidates at the election. In February 1925 she was again selected as the Stroud Labour candidate<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.Findmypast.com|title=Miss Picton-Turbervill Again Selected|last=|first=|date=28 February 1925|work=Cheltenham Chronicle|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref> but she resigned in June 1925 owing to dissention in the local party, following which Tom Langham, Party President along with two vice presidents resigned.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.findmypast.com|title=Resignation of Prospective Woman Candidate|last=|first=|date=12 June 1925|work=Gloucester Citizen|access-date=2019-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 1925, she was selected as a Labour candidate for a marginal seat, [[The Wrekin (UK Parliament constituency)|The Wrekin]], in Shropshire \u2013 like [[Stroud]], a largely rural constituency with a mining community of about four thousand; and she became a close friend of the local miners' agent William (Bill) Latham \u2013 \"A splendid old man, he was a strong chapel man and his speeches full of [[Old Testament]] phraseology and references\".<ref>Life is good (1939:170)</ref>\n\n==Life in Parliament==\nAlthough an [[Anglican]], she was frequently asked to preach in the local chapels of the Wrekin area, and at the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] she won the seat by nearly 3,000 votes.<ref>Cheryl Law: Women, A Modern Political Dictionary, p. 125</ref> When the results were announced \"some in the vast crowd, sang the [[doxology]] 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow' \u2013 this was caught up by a large number and swelled into a loud chorus\".<ref>Life is good  (1939:170)</ref>\n\nIn 1929, there were fourteen women in the new House of Commons with just over 600 men; and the account of the 1929\u201331 Parliament in her autobiography is worth reading. She was always concerned with the inferior status of women in society, and always supported reforming measures and successfully introduced the [[Sentence of Death (Expectant Mothers) Act 1931|Sentence of Death (Expectant Mothers) Bill]] to prevent the passing of the death sentence on pregnant women. In her handling of this, she showed her essential humanity and sensitivity. Because of her knowledge of canon law, she was nominated by the Government \u2013 the first woman to be nominated \u2013 to the [[Ecclesiastical Committee]] of Parliament (July 1929).\n\nIn her politics, she was consistently a moderate and an admirer of MacDonald, but in the crisis of 1931, after a period of hesitation \u2013 she abstained from voting on the first vote of confidence asked for by the [[National Government (1931\u20131935)|National Government]] \u2013 she decided to remain with the Labour Party.

In 1935, she visited [[Turkey]] as head of the British delegation to the International Congress of Women Citizens, and as such met President [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]]. She visited [[Copenhagen]] in the same capacity in 1939.

He was educated at Menai Bridge Grammar School, [[Anglesey]] and St. Mungo's College of Medicine in Glasgow. In 1931 he married Leila Paget-Marsland, a widow. They never had children.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\">''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>\n\n==Medical career==\nMorris-Jones qualified as a doctor (LRFPS) in 1906 from [[Royal College of Physicians|Glasgow]], gaining a further licence for surgery (LRCP&S) from [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], and was for twenty years a [[general practitioner]] in [[Colwyn Bay]] in North Wales. During the First World War, Morris-Jones served in the 2nd Battalion of the [[Worcestershire Regiment]] as a medical officer in France, during which time he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]. He was later granted the rank of  honorary captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. In 1915 he co-authored an article in the [[British Medical Journal]] with Hugh Lett, ''Surgical Experiences at Wimereux, France'' about his work at the Number 5, British Red Cross Hospital, also known as Lady Hadfield's Hospital. He later  served as Chairman of his division of the [[British Medical Association]] and of the Colwyn Bay Medical Society.<ref>The Times, (Obituary) 11.7.72</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nMorris-Jones took an active part in the public life of the town of Colwyn Bay and the [[County of Denbigh]]. He was elected a member of Colwyn Bay [[Urban District Council]], later becoming its Chairman.  He was [[High Sheriff]] Designate of the County, 1929\u201330, and also served as a member of the County Council. In 1956 he received the [[Freedom of the City|honorary freedom]] of Colwyn Bay. He was also appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Denbighshire and was a [[Justice of the Peace]].<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\nAt the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], Morris-Jones was nominated by the [[Llangollen]] Liberal Association to be the candidate for [[Denbigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Denbigh]]<ref>The Times, 1.4.29</ref> and on 4 April he was selected by the local party to stand in succession to the sitting [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Ellis William Davies]] who was resigning on grounds of ill-health.<ref>The Times, 5.4.29</ref> Morris-Jones had a straight fight against the 32-year-old [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], Captain [[Alan Crosland Graham]] of Clwyd Hall, [[Ruthin]], the political private secretary to [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]].<ref>The Times, 9.4.29</ref> The Liberal party improved its position nationally in 1929, going up from 40 to 59 seats and increasing its share of the vote by nearly 6%. However it did not make the breakthrough it had hoped for against the background of its ambitious and innovative policy programme of social, industrial and economic reform under the leadership of a reinvigorated [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]. In this climate, and without a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] opponent in Denbigh, Morris-Jones was able to increase the Liberal majority from  1,421 to 8,189.<ref>The Times, 17.10.31</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary interests==\nWhile in Parliament, Morris-Jones took a particular interest in [[public health]] and agriculture both nationally and as they affected Denbighshire. He was an honorary Treasurer of the Parliamentary Medical Group from time of election in 1929 and was later appointed as a member of the Committee of Trustees set up under the MPs Pensions Act.<ref>The Times, 11.7.72</ref> In 1938 he was a member of a Parliamentary delegation participating in events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of [[Australia]]. While there he took part in discussions about the development of the [[British Empire|Empire]], measures to stimulate [[immigration to Australia]] and the promoting of Australian trade with the USA.<ref>The Times, 3.2.38</ref> More grimly, he was a member of a Parliamentary Delegation to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] soon after its liberation in April 1945.\n\n==National Liberal==\nIn 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] led by Labour prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the issue OF [[Free Trade]]. The official party led by Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] although agreeing to go into the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] supporting the government became more and more worried about the government's stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald's administration. Morris-Jones, who had been appalled at the economic record of the second Labour Government, joined this group<ref>David Dutton, ''Liberal Civil War: Denbigh, Oldham and the 1935 General Election''; Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56, Autumn 2006, pp 8-16</ref> and thereafter sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal National. At the 1931 general election, Morris-Jones was not opposed in Denbigh either by a Free Trade Liberal or Conservative candidate. Although bitterly opposed to MacDonald's government, Labour did not stand a candidate either, presumably for tactical reasons. So on Friday 16 October Morris-Jones retained his Parliamentary seat as one of 65 MPs returned unopposed.\n\n==Liberal schism==\nAfter the 1931 general election there was a period of uncertainty in Liberal Associations about the development of separate parties in local areas and Liberals of the official and National persuasion were often regarded by local members as legitimate representatives of Liberalism, despite their formal designations. There was a belief in both camps that the split was nominal and temporary. As late as 1934 the Liberal Magazine was asserting that \u2018the Liberal Nationals are bound in the course of time to reunite with the normal Liberal Party\u2019.<ref>Dutton, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56 p.8</ref> This was not the case everywhere however and in Denbigh Morris-Jones faced criticism and some hostility from Liberals not willing to accept his defection to the Liberal Nationals. This became more pressing after the withdrawal of the official party under Samuel from the government when Liberals argued that it had become increasingly clear that the coalition was a National Government in name only and really a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administration, dominated by the massive Conservative strength in Parliament.\n\n==Government office==\nIn 1932, Morris-Jones was appointed an Assistant Government [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] and he held that post until 1935. From 1935 to 1937 he was a [[Lord Commissioner of the Treasury]]. He was knighted in the prime minister's list of the New Year's Honours in January 1937.  In May 1937 when [[Neville Chamberlain]] succeeded [[Stanley Baldwin]] as prime minister, Morris-Jones was offered the position of Chief Whip to the Liberal National group after the formation of the new government but preferred \u2018for personal reasons\u2019 to return to the [[backbenches]].<ref>The Times, 29.5.37</ref>\n\n==1935 General Election==\nAs the prospect of another general election approached the Liberal Party policy of not opposing sitting Liberal National MPs came increasingly under threat, although many local parties did not have the resources to put up independent Liberal candidates against incumbent Liberal Nationals. However, in Denbighshire there was a willingness to challenge Morris-Jones, who was seen more and more as a surrogate Tory. At a meeting of the Liberal Association there on 24 October 1935, as the prospect of a general election loomed, it was agreed to adopt John Cledwyn Davies, the Director of Education for Denbighshire and the Lloyd George coalition Liberal MP for Denbigh from 1922\u201323. Morris-Jones refused to stand down and the two members of the liberal family fought each other in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in November. The Conservatives supported Morris-Jones and the intervention of a Labour candidate helped take votes away from Davies. Across the country the Liberal National vote remained steady and Morris-Jones held the seat with a majority of over 5,000.<ref>Dutton, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56, p12</ref>\n\n==Independent MP==\nFor brief period during the Second World War, commencing in February 1942, Morris-Jones decided to leave the Liberal Nationals. One of his reasons for resigning from the Liberal Nationals may have been a desire to have the freedom to criticise the government over its prosecution of the war, including the need to place war production under the direction of a single minister which Morris-Jones had urged in 1941.<ref>The Times, 26.7.41</ref> In July 1942 he was signatory to a motion which while praising the armed forces indicated a lack of confidence in the government's conduct of the war.<ref>The Times, 1.7.42</ref> It was later recorded that he had rejoined the official Liberals along with two other MPs, [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] and [[Edgar Granville, Baron Granville of Eye|Edgar Granville]].<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party: 1895-1970''; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p244</ref> However at the time Morris-Jones described himself as having become an Independent<ref>The Times, 12.8.42</ref> although his closeness to the official party was evident in his voting record and associations.<ref>The Times, 20.2.43</ref> Perhaps he was already thinking about post-war political alignments and wished to keep his options open. He must have been aware of the feeling that, as in the earlier split in the party between 1916 and 1923, Liberals of whatever stripe had a common Liberalism to bind them. In the end the political and electoral realities overcame the sense of Liberal family and Morris-Jones rejoined the Liberal Nationals in March 1943, presumably sensing or calculating it would be the safest way to enable him to continue as an MP.<ref>The Times, 23.11.43</ref>\n\n==Welsh political and public life==\nIn 1937 Morris-Jones was Honorary Treasurer and Honorary Secretary of the Reception Committee co-ordinating the Royal Visit to North Wales. As part of the coronation celebrations the King and Queen were to visit North Wales in July 1937. They were to open an extension to the [[National Library of Wales]] at [[Aberystwyth]] and make a ceremonial visit to [[Caernarfon Castle]]. At this time Lloyd George was Constable of the Caernarfon Castle and Morris-Jones was involved in discussion and debate with him and others about the arrangements for the visit and some bad-tempered exchanges took place over the  choice of music for the royal programme which Lloyd George felt was not up to the dignity of the occasion.<ref>Colin Cross (ed.) ''Life with Lloyd George: The Diary of A J Sylvester, 1931-45''; MacMillan, 1975 pp179-181</ref>\n\nIn 1941\u20132, Morris-Jones served as Chairman of the Welsh Parliamentary Party. Liberal MPs from Wales had always regarded themselves as separate Parliamentary entity, certainly from as early as 1886. They saw their role as promoting distinctly Welsh causes and being the party of Welsh nationalism.<ref>Alan Butt Philip, ''The Welsh Question: Nationalism in Welsh Politics, 1945-1970''; University of Wales Press, 1975 and [[K O Morgan]], ''Wales in British Politics 1868-1922'', University of Wales Press, 1963</ref> This role diminished with the decline of Liberalism in Wales during the 20th century and establishment of [[Plaid Cymru]] in 1925 but there remained a sentiment at Westminster that Welsh parliamentarians should meet together in the interests of their country and the Welsh Parliamentary Party which Morris-Jones chaired was therefore an informal group of Welsh MPs from all parties which met occasionally from the mid-1930s to discuss issues affecting Wales and its relationship with Whitehall and Westminster.<ref>(https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960311/debtext/60311-16.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Morris-Jones put forward a [[Private Member's Bill]] to create the post of [[Secretary of State for Wales|Secretary of State for Wales and Monmouthshire]] supported by a [[Parliamentary Under Secretary]] and a Department of State to be known as the Welsh Office for which he got a measure of cross-party support although it did not pass into law.<ref>The Times, 19.2.49</ref> Wales had to wait until 1951 for a dedicated minister, 1964 for its own Secretary of State and 1965 before the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]]. The [[National Assembly for Wales]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] followed in 1999.\n\nMorris-Jones was also a member of the [[Gorsedd]], an association of poets, writers, musicians, artists and individuals who have made a significant and distinguished contribution to Welsh language, literature, and culture, under the Bardic title of Rhoslanydd. He also served as a member of the Governing Body of Representative Body of the Church in Wales between 1950 and 1962.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\n==Liberal National after 1945==\nAt the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] Morris-Jones faced official Liberal and Labour opposition in Denbigh but was supported as the government candidate by the Conservatives. In a straight fight against either Liberal or Labour he might well have lost, given the huge anti-government swings recorded at that election. However, with the opposition split, he held on with a majority of 4,922.<ref>(http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i06.htm)</ref> Although he stood down as an MP at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], Morris-Jones thereafter remained loyal to the Liberal Nationals, or National Liberal Party as it became known after 1948. He served as Vice Chairman of the Executive of the National Liberal Party in 1952 and the following year (1953\u201354) he went on to be Chairman.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> The National Liberals again held Denbigh against split opposition in 1950, albeit with a reduced majority.<ref>http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge50/i06.htm)</ref> It remained a National Liberal seat until [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] when a Conservative candidate was put up, successfully retaining it. It then stayed Conservative until the constituency was abolished in 1983.\n\n==Standing down from Parliament==\nAlthough he was 66 years old as the election approached,  Morris-Jones\u2019 decision to step down from Parliament at the 1950 general election may have been influenced by more than just advancing years. He was genuinely pessimistic about the future of the Liberal Party in Wales and the country at large. In a speech in Denbigh he said he doubted there would be more than 20 Independent Liberals in the next House of Commons.<ref>The Times, 20 February 1950</ref> This is a slightly surprising number given that only 12 Liberal MPs had been elected in 1945, a drop of nine on the previous election and since then the party had been experiencing defections \u2013 [[Gwilym Lloyd-George]] was  almost completely associated with the Conservatives by 1950 and [[Tom Horabin]] had taken the Labour whip. In fact the party continued to decline at the 1950 general election, making a net loss of three seats leaving then with only nine. Perhaps Morris-Jones also foresaw the final absorption of the National Liberals into the Conservative Party. The formal merger of the two parties had already taken place in 1948 and from then on, it was only a matter of time before any remaining genuinely Liberal element was subsumed by the overwhelming numbers and philosophy of the Conservatives, something which given his Liberal past and strong convictions,  Morris-Jones may well have regretted. Although, as noted above, once outside Parliament he stuck with the National Liberals, perhaps in the hope of a peerage.\n\n==Morris-Jones and the National Health Service==\nAs a doctor, Morris-Jones took a keen interest in the legislation to set up the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). By and large he was not in favour, usually taking the side of the professional organisations in opposing measures to force doctors into the NHS. By 1948 he was much more closely aligned with the Conservatives and their thinking. That Morris-Jones was a man of traditional views in relation to medical matters can be deduced from his association with the campaign to prevent the sale of contraceptives from slot machines, as a \u2018temptation to youth\u2019.<ref>The Times, 15.9.49</ref>\n\nAn early indication of Morris-Jones's misgivings over a national health scheme came in 1942 in the debate over the Beveridge Report. In a letter to [[The Times]] newspaper he predicted that the setting up of a full-time National Medical Service for the whole population would cut across the traditional relationship between the doctor and patient and would need a great popular mandate. The tone of Morris-Jones's letter made it clear he did not approve of such a scheme and doubted whether it would ever work.<ref>The Times, 4.12.42</ref> Writing again to the Times on 15 March 1948, Morris-Jones identified with the concerns of many doctors about the powers to be conferred on the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and with the doctors\u2019 strong desire to retain their professional freedoms and their livelihoods as well as their fears that the new arrangements would bring about a deterioration in standards of medical and clinical service and professionalism. He ended by writing, \u201cThe mines can be nationalised; the art and science of medicine cannot be\u201d.<ref>The Times, 17.3.48</ref> However, like the doctors, Morris-Jones eventually bowed to the inevitable. Even though there were many doctors who disliked the Act, Morris-Jones felt they had achieved a significant amount though negotiation and should therefore accept the government's offer to join the NHS in July 1948.

He was educated at Menai Bridge Grammar School, [[Anglesey]] and St. Mungo\u2019s College of Medicine in Glasgow. In 1931 he married Leila Paget-Marsland, a widow. They never had children.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\">''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref>\n\n==Medical career==\nMorris-Jones qualified as a doctor (LRFPS) in 1906 from [[Royal College of Physicians|Glasgow]], gaining a further licence for surgery (LRCP&S) from [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], and was for twenty years a [[general practitioner]] in [[Colwyn Bay]] in North Wales. During the First World War, Morris-Jones served in the 2nd Battalion of the [[Worcestershire Regiment]] as a medical officer in France, during which time he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]. He was later granted the rank of  honorary captain in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. In 1915 he co-authored an article in the [[British Medical Journal]] with Hugh Lett, ''Surgical Experiences at Wimereux, France'' about his work at the Number 5, British Red Cross Hospital, also known as Lady Hadfield\u2019s Hospital. He later  served as Chairman of his division of the [[British Medical Association]] and of the Colwyn Bay Medical Society.<ref>The Times, (Obituary) 11.7.72</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nMorris-Jones took an active part in the public life of the town of Colwyn Bay and the [[County of Denbigh]]. He was elected a member of Colwyn Bay [[Urban District Council]], later becoming its Chairman.  He was [[High Sheriff]] Designate of the County, 1929\u201330, and also served as a member of the County Council. In 1956 he received the [[Freedom of the City|honorary freedom]] of Colwyn Bay. He was also appointed a [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Denbighshire and was a [[Justice of the Peace]].<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\nAt the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]], Morris-Jones was nominated by the [[Llangollen]] Liberal Association to be the candidate for [[Denbigh (UK Parliament constituency)|Denbigh]]<ref>The Times, 1.4.29</ref> and on 4 April he was selected by the local party to stand in succession to the sitting [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[Ellis William Davies]] who was resigning on grounds of ill-health.<ref>The Times, 5.4.29</ref> Morris-Jones had a straight fight against the 32-year-old [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], Captain [[Alan Crosland Graham]] of Clwyd Hall, [[Ruthin]], the political private secretary to [[Arthur Balfour|Lord Balfour]].<ref>The Times, 9.4.29</ref> The Liberal party improved its position nationally in 1929, going up from 40 to 59 seats and increasing its share of the vote by nearly 6%. However it did not make the breakthrough it had hoped for against the background of its ambitious and innovative policy programme of social, industrial and economic reform under the leadership of a reinvigorated [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]. In this climate, and without a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] opponent in Denbigh, Morris-Jones was able to increase the Liberal majority from  1,421 to 8,189.<ref>The Times, 17.10.31</ref>\n\n==Parliamentary interests==\nWhile in Parliament, Morris-Jones took a particular interest in [[public health]] and agriculture both nationally and as they affected Denbighshire. He was an honorary Treasurer of the Parliamentary Medical Group from time of election in 1929 and was later appointed as a member of the Committee of Trustees set up under the MPs Pensions Act.<ref>The Times, 11.7.72</ref> In 1938 he was a member of a Parliamentary delegation participating in events to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of [[Australia]]. While there he took part in discussions about the development of the [[British Empire|Empire]], measures to stimulate [[immigration to Australia]] and the promoting of Australian trade with the USA.<ref>The Times, 3.2.38</ref> More grimly, he was a member of a Parliamentary Delegation to [[Buchenwald concentration camp]] soon after its liberation in April 1945.\n\n==National Liberal==\nIn 1931 an economic crisis led to the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] led by Labour prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and initially supported by the Conservative and Liberal parties. However the Liberals were increasingly divided over the issue of the National Government, particularly over the issue OF [[Free Trade]]. The official party led by Sir [[Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel|Herbert Samuel]] although agreeing to go into the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] supporting the government became more and more worried about the government\u2019s stance on Free Trade and worried about the predominance of the Conservatives in the coalition. However a group of Liberal MPs led by [[Sir John Simon]] who were concerned to ensure the National Government had a wide cross-party base formed the Liberal National Party to more openly support MacDonald\u2019s administration. Morris-Jones, who had been appalled at the economic record of the second Labour Government, joined this group<ref>David Dutton, ''Liberal Civil War: Denbigh, Oldham and the 1935 General Election''; Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56, Autumn 2006, pp 8-16</ref> and thereafter sat in the House of Commons as a Liberal National. At the 1931 general election, Morris-Jones was not opposed in Denbigh either by a Free Trade Liberal or Conservative candidate. Although bitterly opposed to MacDonald\u2019s government, Labour did not stand a candidate either, presumably for tactical reasons. So on Friday 16 October Morris-Jones retained his Parliamentary seat as one of 65 MPs returned unopposed.\n\n==Liberal schism==\nAfter the 1931 general election there was a period of uncertainty in Liberal Associations about the development of separate parties in local areas and Liberals of the official and National persuasion were often regarded by local members as legitimate representatives of Liberalism, despite their formal designations. There was a belief in both camps that the split was nominal and temporary. As late as 1934 the Liberal Magazine was asserting that \u2018the Liberal Nationals are bound in the course of time to reunite with the normal Liberal Party\u2019.<ref>Dutton, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56 p.8</ref> This was not the case everywhere however and in Denbigh Morris-Jones faced criticism and some hostility from Liberals not willing to accept his defection to the Liberal Nationals. This became more pressing after the withdrawal of the official party under Samuel from the government when Liberals argued that it had become increasingly clear that the coalition was a National Government in name only and really a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] administration, dominated by the massive Conservative strength in Parliament.\n\n==Government office==\nIn 1932, Morris-Jones was appointed an Assistant Government [[Whip (politics)|Whip]] and he held that post until 1935. From 1935 to 1937 he was a [[Lord Commissioner of the Treasury]]. He was knighted in the prime minister\u2019s list of the New Year\u2019s Honours in January 1937.  In May 1937 when [[Neville Chamberlain]] succeeded [[Stanley Baldwin]] as prime minister, Morris-Jones was offered the position of Chief Whip to the Liberal National group after the formation of the new government but preferred \u2018for personal reasons\u2019 to return to the [[backbenches]].<ref>The Times, 29.5.37</ref>\n\n==1935 General Election==\nAs the prospect of another general election approached the Liberal Party policy of not opposing sitting Liberal National MPs came increasingly under threat, although many local parties did not have the resources to put up independent Liberal candidates against incumbent Liberal Nationals. However, in Denbighshire there was a willingness to challenge Morris-Jones, who was seen more and more as a surrogate Tory. At a meeting of the Liberal Association there on 24 October 1935, as the prospect of a general election loomed, it was agreed to adopt John Cledwyn Davies, the Director of Education for Denbighshire and the Lloyd George coalition Liberal MP for Denbigh from 1922-23. Morris-Jones refused to stand down and the two members of the liberal family fought each other in the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|general election]] in November. The Conservatives supported Morris-Jones and the intervention of a Labour candidate helped take votes away from Davies. Across the country the Liberal National vote remained steady and Morris-Jones held the seat with a majority of over 5,000.<ref>Dutton, Journal of Liberal History, Issue 56, p12</ref>\n\n==Independent MP==\nFor brief period during the Second World War, commencing in February 1942, Morris-Jones decided to leave the Liberal Nationals. One of his reasons for resigning from the Liberal Nationals may have been a desire to have the freedom to criticise the government over its prosecution of the war, including the need to place war production under the direction of a single minister which Morris-Jones had urged in 1941.<ref>The Times, 26.7.41</ref> In July 1942 he was signatory to a motion which while praising the armed forces indicated a lack of confidence in the government\u2019s conduct of the war.<ref>The Times, 1.7.42</ref> It was later recorded that he had rejoined the official Liberals along with two other MPs, [[Leslie Hore-Belisha, 1st Baron Hore-Belisha|Leslie Hore-Belisha]] and [[Edgar Granville, Baron Granville of Eye|Edgar Granville]].<ref>Roy Douglas, ''The History of the Liberal Party: 1895-1970''; Sidgwick & Jackson, 1971 p244</ref> However at the time Morris-Jones described himself as having become an Independent<ref>The Times, 12.8.42</ref> although his closeness to the official party was evident in his voting record and associations.<ref>The Times, 20.2.43</ref> Perhaps he was already thinking about post-war political alignments and wished to keep his options open. He must have been aware of the feeling that, as in the earlier split in the party between 1916 and 1923, Liberals of whatever stripe had a common Liberalism to bind them. In the end the political and electoral realities overcame the sense of Liberal family and Morris-Jones rejoined the Liberal Nationals in March 1943, presumably sensing or calculating it would be the safest way to enable him to continue as an MP.<ref>The Times, 23.11.43</ref>\n\n==Welsh political and public life==\nIn 1937 Morris-Jones was Honorary Treasurer and Honorary Secretary of the Reception Committee co-ordinating the Royal Visit to North Wales. As part of the coronation celebrations the King and Queen were to visit North Wales in July 1937. They were to open an extension to the [[National Library of Wales]] at [[Aberystwyth]] and make a ceremonial visit to [[Caernarfon Castle]]. At this time Lloyd George was Constable of the Caernarfon Castle and Morris-Jones was involved in discussion and debate with him and others about the arrangements for the visit and some bad-tempered exchanges took place over the  choice of music for the royal programme which Lloyd George felt was not up to the dignity of the occasion.<ref>Colin Cross (ed.) ''Life with Lloyd George: The Diary of A J Sylvester, 1931-45''; MacMillan, 1975 pp179-181</ref>\n\nIn 1941-2, Morris-Jones served as Chairman of the Welsh Parliamentary Party. Liberal MPs from Wales had always regarded themselves as separate Parliamentary entity, certainly from as early as 1886. They saw their role as promoting distinctly Welsh causes and being the party of Welsh nationalism.<ref>Alan Butt Philip, ''The Welsh Question: Nationalism in Welsh Politics, 1945-1970''; University of Wales Press, 1975 and [[K O Morgan]], ''Wales in British Politics 1868-1922'', University of Wales Press, 1963</ref> This role diminished with the decline of Liberalism in Wales during the 20th century and establishment of [[Plaid Cymru]] in 1925 but there remained a sentiment at Westminster that Welsh parliamentarians should meet together in the interests of their country and the Welsh Parliamentary Party which Morris-Jones chaired was therefore an informal group of Welsh MPs from all parties which met occasionally from the mid-1930s to discuss issues affecting Wales and its relationship with Whitehall and Westminster.<ref>(https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960311/debtext/60311-16.htm</ref>\n\nIn 1949 Morris-Jones put forward a [[Private Member's Bill]] to create the post of [[Secretary of State for Wales|Secretary of State for Wales and Monmouthshire]] supported by a [[Parliamentary Under Secretary]] and a Department of State to be known as the Welsh Office for which he got a measure of cross-party support although it did not pass into law.<ref>The Times, 19.2.49</ref> Wales had to wait until 1951 for a dedicated minister, 1964 for its own Secretary of State and 1965 before the establishment of the [[Welsh Office]]. The [[National Assembly for Wales]] and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] followed in 1999.\n\nMorris-Jones was also a member of the [[Gorsedd]], an association of poets, writers, musicians, artists and individuals who have made a significant and distinguished contribution to Welsh language, literature, and culture, under the Bardic title of Rhoslanydd. He also served as a member of the Governing Body of Representative Body of the Church in Wales between 1950 and 1962.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/>\n\n==Liberal National after 1945==\nAt the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]] Morris-Jones faced official Liberal and Labour opposition in Denbigh but was supported as the government candidate by the Conservatives. In a straight fight against either Liberal or Labour he might well have lost, given the huge anti-government swings recorded at that election. However, with the opposition split, he held on with a majority of 4,922.<ref>(http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i06.htm)</ref> Although he stood down as an MP at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], Morris-Jones thereafter remained loyal to the Liberal Nationals, or National Liberal Party as it became known after 1948. He served as Vice Chairman of the Executive of the National Liberal Party in 1952 and the following year (1953\u201354) he went on to be Chairman.<ref name=\"Who was Who, OUP 2007\"/> The National Liberals again held Denbigh against split opposition in 1950, albeit with a reduced majority.<ref>http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge50/i06.htm)</ref> It remained a National Liberal seat until [[1959 United Kingdom general election|1959]] when a Conservative candidate was put up, successfully retaining it. It then stayed Conservative until the constituency was abolished in 1983.\n\n==Standing down from Parliament==\nAlthough he was 66 years old as the election approached,  Morris-Jones\u2019 decision to step down from Parliament at the 1950 general election may have been influenced by more than just advancing years. He was genuinely pessimistic about the future of the Liberal Party in Wales and the country at large. In a speech in Denbigh he said he doubted there would be more than 20 Independent Liberals in the next House of Commons.<ref>The Times, 20 February 1950</ref> This is a slightly surprising number given that only 12 Liberal MPs had been elected in 1945, a drop of nine on the previous election and since then the party had been experiencing defections \u2013 [[Gwilym Lloyd-George]] was  almost completely associated with the Conservatives by 1950 and [[Tom Horabin]] had taken the Labour whip. In fact the party continued to decline at the 1950 general election, making a net loss of three seats leaving then with only nine. Perhaps Morris-Jones also foresaw the final absorption of the National Liberals into the Conservative Party. The formal merger of the two parties had already taken place in 1948 and from then on, it was only a matter of time before any remaining genuinely Liberal element was subsumed by the overwhelming numbers and philosophy of the Conservatives, something which given his Liberal past and strong convictions,  Morris-Jones may well have regretted. Although, as noted above, once outside Parliament he stuck with the National Liberals, perhaps in the hope of a peerage.\n\n==Morris-Jones and the National Health Service==\nAs a doctor, Morris-Jones took a keen interest in the legislation to set up the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). By and large he was not in favour, usually taking the side of the professional organisations in opposing measures to force doctors into the NHS. By 1948 he was much more closely aligned with the Conservatives and their thinking. That Morris-Jones was a man of traditional views in relation to medical matters can be deduced from his association with the campaign to prevent the sale of contraceptives from slot machines, as a \u2018temptation to youth\u2019.<ref>The Times, 15.9.49</ref>\n\nAn early indication of Morris-Jones\u2019s misgivings over a national health scheme came in 1942 in the debate over the Beveridge Report. In a letter to [[The Times]] newspaper he predicted that the setting up of a full-time National Medical Service for the whole population would cut across the traditional relationship between the doctor and patient and would need a great popular mandate. The tone of Morris-Jones\u2019s letter made it clear he did not approve of such a scheme and doubted whether it would ever work.<ref>The Times, 4.12.42</ref> Writing again to the Times on 15 March 1948, Morris-Jones identified with the concerns of many doctors about the powers to be conferred on the [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and with the doctors\u2019 strong desire to retain their professional freedoms and their livelihoods as well as their fears that the new arrangements would bring about a deterioration in standards of medical and clinical service and professionalism. He ended by writing, \u201cThe mines can be nationalised; the art and science of medicine cannot be\u201d.<ref>The Times, 17.3.48</ref> However, like the doctors, Morris-Jones eventually bowed to the inevitable. Even though there were many doctors who disliked the Act, Morris-Jones felt they had achieved a significant amount though negotiation and should therefore accept the government\u2019s offer to join the NHS in July 1948. A further justification he made was that this should be done on behalf of patients who would otherwise suffer from a continuing fight between government and medical professionals.<ref>The Times, 23.4.48</ref>\n\nA year after the introduction of the NHS, Morris-Jones was again writing to the Times to highlight what he saw as the decline in status of the General Practitioner, which he described as\u2019 the first line of defence of our health service\u2019. He believed that there was evidence to show that after a year of the NHS there had been a deterioration in the art of medicine as practiced by GPs, an expansion of their workload, an increase in bureaucracy, difficulties in seeing cases through and getting patients into hospitals.<ref>The Times, 31.8.49</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n*''Surgical Experiences at Wimereux, France'' (jointly with Hugh Lett):  British Medical Journal, 1915\n*''Doctor in the Whip\u2019s Room'': published by Robert Hale, London, 1955\n\n==Papers==\nMorris-Jones\u2019 papers are deposited in the Flintshire Record Office, which is located at The Old Rectory, [[Hawarden]].

He was a [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) from 1929 to 1931, and 1940 to 1955.\n\nHe was born, of Irish descent, in [[Grenada]], [[West Indies]] and came to the [[United Kingdom]] to study medicine at [[Glasgow University]] in 1904. while at University he was active in the [[Fabian Society]] and founded the students' Irish Nationalist Club. After qualifying, he worked in a number of Glasgow mental hospitals and then served as a doctor in France during [[World War I]], and then entered general practice in [[London]], initially at [[Greenwich]], later [[Camberwell]] and finally at [[Paddington]].\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Spanish Medical Aid Armband.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spanish Medical Aid]] armband]]\n\nMorgan contested the [[South London]] constituency of the [[Camberwell North West (UK Parliament constituency)|Camberwell North West]] at the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]], but lost by a wide margin to the [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1922)|National Liberal]] MP [[Thomas James Macnamara]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} He stood again at the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 election]], when Macnamara had re-joined the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} and lost by only 80 votes.

As an industrialist, he led many progressive initiatives in the field of labour relations and employment welfare between the Wars. Under his direction, Mander Brothers was the first British company to introduce the 40-hour week through an historic agreement signed and mediated by [[Ernest Bevin]], general secretary of the [[Transport and General Workers' Union]], in September 1931.\n\n== Art patron ==\nHe was an early conservationist.

Like his father, he was born in [[Lossiemouth]], [[Moray]]. He was initially a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), but in 1931 he joined his father to break with the party and join the [[UK National Government|National Government]] and was consequently expelled from the Labour Party.\n\nHe was educated at [[Bedales School]] and [[Queen's College, Oxford]].\n\n==Political career==\nMacDonald was first elected to Parliament for [[Bassetlaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Bassetlaw]] in the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] and proved to be a \"loyal\" son, in contrast to [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s son [[Oliver Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Oliver]] who was also elected a Labour MP. In 1931, the Labour government broke up and MacDonald's father formed the National Government with representatives drawn from all political parties.  Very few Labour members would support it, however, and so Malcolm was appointed to a junior ministerial post as [[Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]].  When the Labour MPs met to discuss the formation of the government, Malcolm was the only one present who spoke in favour of his father's actions and voted against a condemnatory resolution.  MacDonald held his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] as a [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] candidate, and continued to build up a reputation as a highly competent minister. When his father retired in 1935, the new Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, appointed Malcolm to the Cabinet for the first time as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].  His father had become [[Lord President of the Council]] and they became only the third father and son to sit together in the same Cabinet.<ref>The two earlier pairs were the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|14th Earl of Derby]] and his son, [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], and [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph]] and [[Austen Chamberlain]]: see Jenkins, p. 118</ref>\n\nIn the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] held that autumn MacDonald narrowly lost his seat but after some discussion Baldwin decided to retain him in government, albeit moving him to the post of [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] in a direct swap with [[James Henry Thomas]] who had created problems with some Dominion governments.  The following February MacDonald stood for Parliament in a [[1936 Ross and Cromarty by-election|by-election]] at [[Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)|Ross and Cromarty]].  This election proved chaotic as the local Conservative & Unionist Association declined to support him (though the local [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] did) and instead adopted as their candidate [[Randolph Churchill]], son of [[Winston Churchill]] who had emerged as a prominent Conservative critic of the government.  Despite this MacDonald won the by-election and returned to Parliament. MacDonald retained his position after Baldwin and MacDonald's final retirements in 1937, when together with the new Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] he set about negotiating a new set of agreements with the [[Irish Free State]] to resolve disputes over trade, compensation and the Treaty Ports that the United Kingdom still retained.  Although the issue of [[Northern Ireland]] could not be agreed, all other matters were settled and MacDonald won many plaudits.\n\nIn May 1938, Chamberlain moved him back to the Colonial Office \u2013 a move now seen as a promotion due to the increased prominence of the position given the situation in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In October, the new Dominions Secretary, [[Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (politician, born 1894)|Lord Stanley]], died and MacDonald was appointed to succeed him in addition to the Colonies, as the post was in a sensitive period and needed an experienced pair of hands. The following January, he relinquished the Dominions Office.\n\nIn 1939, MacDonald oversaw and introduced the so-called [[White Paper of 1939|MacDonald White Paper]] which aimed at the creation of a unified state, with controls on Jewish immigration. The White Paper argued that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] had now been met and the paper opposed an independent Jewish state. The League of Nations [[Permanent Mandates Commission (Palestine)|Permanent Mandates Commission]] held that the White Paper was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past.{{efn|Of seven members present, four \"did not feel able to state that the policy of the White Paper was in conformity with the Mandate, any contrary conclusion appearing to them to be ruled out by the very terms of the Mandate and by the fundamental intentions of its authors\" and three \"were unable to share this opinion; they consider that existing circumstances would justify the policy of the White Paper, provided that the Council did not oppose it\".}}\nThe outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV] Palestine: Historical Background</ref><ref name=\"Morris2011p159\">{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|page=159|chapter=chp. 4|quote=\"Capping it all, the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Council of the League of Nations rejected the White Paper as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate.\"}}</ref> It has been suggested that MacDonald and Chamberlain took this course of action in order to ensure that the situation in Palestine did not develop into a situation similar to that of [[Ireland]] where two evenly matched communities engaged in bitter ethnic conflict.{{Citation needed|reason=mistake?|date=January 2014}} With [[antisemitism]] rampant in Europe, MacDonald sought to find new settlements, in vain. The White Paper was bitterly opposed by the Jews in Palestine, as well as by many supporting the National Government in Britain. When it was voted on in Parliament many Government supporters abstained or voted against the proposals, including some Cabinet Ministers as well as Winston Churchill. The objections to the 'white paper' were especially raised following the plight of European Jews under Nazi regimes in Germany and Austria, who suffered greatly under the Nazi oppression, but did not have other available goals of immigration, as most states at this point (including the US and Canada), did not accept Jewish refugees. In a UK Parliamentary debate, Lloyd George called the White Paper an act of [[perfidy]] while [[Winston Churchill]] voted against the government.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |date=24 May 1939 |pages=12, 14}}</ref> In a leader the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' called it \"a death sentence on tens of thousands of Central European Jews\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |date=24 May 1939 |page=8}}</ref> The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Armand de Rothschild|James Rothschild]] stated during the parliamentary debate that \"for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction\".<ref>[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Debates, Volume 347 column 1984 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1#column_1984]</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, Chamberlain fell and Winston Churchill formed an all party coalition, bringing the Labour Party into the National Government for the first time. There was some speculation that their hostility might result in MacDonald being amongst the ministers dropped to make way for them (as happened to [[Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr|Earl de la Warr]], the other National Labour minister) but instead MacDonald was retained and became [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]]. In June 1940, he was sent to [[Dublin]] for a series of meetings with [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]: he was authorised to offer the end of the [[Partition of Ireland]] if the Free State would enter the war on the Allied side. De Valera declined the offer. The following year his career took a different turn when he was appointed [[High Commissioner]] to [[Canada]].<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-41680248</ref> Initially special legislation was passed to allow him to retain his seat in Parliament, but in 1945 the National Labour Party dissolved itself and MacDonald decided to retire from British politics.\n\nAfter his term in Canada ended in 1946, MacDonald moved on to serve in other [[British Empire|Imperial]] posts: as [[Governor-General]] of  [[Federation of Malaya|British territories in Southeast Asia from 1946]] to 1948 and then Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia covering regional affairs as well during [[Malayan Emergency|the communist insurrection]];<ref>Christie, Clive J. (1998) ''Southeast Asia in the Twentieth Century: A Reader'' Tauris, London, p. 192 {{ISBN|1-86064-063-X}}</ref> as High Commissioner in [[India]] from 1955 to 1960;<ref>''And Then By Chance'', [[Reginald Second\u00e9]] (2002)</ref> as co-chairman of the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos|Laos Conference]]; and finally as Governor-General of [[Kenya]] between 1963 and 1964.\n\nMacDonald received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>\n\nIn later years (1971\u20131980) he served as Chancellor of the [[Durham University|University of Durham]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/about/governance/senior/chancellor/former/|title=About Durham University : Former Chancellors of the University - Durham University|website=www.dur.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>\n\nMacDonald spent the last eleven years of his life at [[Raspit Hill]], near [[Ightham]] in [[Kent]], where he died in 1981, aged 79.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn December 1946, he married Audrey Marjorie Fellowes Rowley,<ref>http://picclick.co.uk/Engagement-Of-Malcolm-John-MacDonald-Audrey-Marjorie-Rowley-152301922357.html</ref> a Canadian war widow. They had one child, daughter Fiona (married to Bob McElwain). MacDonald also adopted his wife's two children from her first marriage, Bill and Jane Rowley.\n\nHe was a keen ornithologist and, in 1934, published the book ''Bird Watching At Lossiemouth'' privately. It was, as he noted, in a brief foreword, an expanded version of a paper he read to the London Morayshire Club one evening in the autumn of 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Bird Watching At Lossiemouth|date=1934|publisher=Privately Published|location=Elgin}}</ref>\n\nWhile High Commissioner to Canada, MacDonald undertook two extensive journeys, in a [[Grumman Goose]], from Ottawa to the far Northwest of Canada. He was accompanied by three senior Government officials, in August 1942 and March 1943.  He chronicles the trips in a book \"Down North\" (Oxford University Press, Toronto, 1943).  The trips covered remote areas of Alberta, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and British Columbia, going as far north as Aklavik. MacDonald's book gives a perspective of the history, geography and peoples of Canada's northwest.\n\nOn 9 May 2015, his widow Audrey died of natural causes in [[Ottawa]] at the age of 99 years old, three weeks before her 100th birthday.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/facts-and-arguments/lives-lived-audrey-macdonald-99/article26094484/</ref><ref>http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20150513.93360375/BDAStory/BDA/deaths</ref>\n\nMacDonald was a prolific art collector in a range of genres, most notably Chinese ceramics. He sold and donated art collections to museums across the world. His Chinese ceramic collections comprise a total of over 500 pieces with a chronological span of 2000 BCE to circa 1940 CE and incorporating representative examples of most styles of domestic and export ceramic wares. These collections are today split between the Oriental Museum of Durham University, the University of Malaya Museum of Asian Art in Kuala Lumpur and the National University of Singapore Museum in Singapore.<ref>Alexander Nicholas Shaw, 'A Diplomat and a Collector: Malcolm MacDonald's Pursuit of Beauty during the Cold War and End of Empire', ''Journal of the History of Collections'', vol. 30 issue 3, 2018, pp. 511-527</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n\nAs a young man, MacDonald aspired to be a novelist but did not succeed in publishing any of his writings of fiction. He wrote a number of articles for British and Canadian newspapers in the 1920s, including a series describing his travels in Japan, China and Korea in 1929. Following the assumption of his diplomatic career in 1941, MacDonald began writing factual accounts of the people, places and wildlife he encountered. He authored the following published works:\n\n* ''Down North'' (1943: a description of his travels as High Commissioner to Canada)\n* ''Birds of Brewery Creek'' (1947: a bird-watching diary regarded by US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles as one of the best books on the subject of North American ornithology)\n* ''Borneo People'' (1956: an account of MacDonald's friendship with the Dayak peoples of Borneo including Iban leader Temenggong Koh Anak Jubang)\n* ''Angkor'' (1958: one of the first English-language and systematically photographed guides to the Cambodian temple complex at Angkor Wat)\n* ''Birds in My Indian Garden'' (1960: containing many black and white images)\n* ''Birds in the Sun'' (1962: a guide to the birds of South Asia with colour photography by MacDonald's friend Christina Loke)\n* ''Treasure of Kenya'' (1965: another collaboration with Christina Loke which aimed to attract support amongst a British audience for wildlife conservation in Kenya. This book attracted the gratitude of the Kenyan government for MacDonald's ecological commitment)\n* ''People and Places'' (1969: an anecdotal autobiography)\n* ''Titans and Others'' (1972: MacDonald's reflections on his friendships or associations with some of the key figures of the twentieth century including Jomo Kenyatta and Norodom Sihanouk)\n* ''Inside China'' (1980: part an introductory history to China but more an account of his travels through China between the 1920s and 1970s)\n* ''The Pleasures and Pains of Collecting'' (2018: MacDonald's memoir as an art collector, rejected by his publisher in his lifetime but published posthumously by the Friends of the Oriental Museum, Durham University, with an introduction by the MacDonald scholar and Cold War historian Alexander Shaw)<ref>Malcolm J.

life==\nMacDonald was the son of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Margaret MacDonald (wife of Ramsay MacDonald)|Margaret MacDonald]].  Like his father, he was born in [[Lossiemouth]], [[Moray]]. He was initially a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), but in 1931 he joined his father to break with the party and join the [[UK National Government|National Government]] and was consequently expelled from the Labour Party.\n\nHe was educated at [[Bedales School]] and [[Queen's College, Oxford]].\n\n==Political career==\nMacDonald was first elected to Parliament for [[Bassetlaw (UK Parliament constituency)|Bassetlaw]] in the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|1929 general election]] and proved to be a \"loyal\" son, in contrast to [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] leader [[Stanley Baldwin]]'s son [[Oliver Baldwin, 2nd Earl Baldwin of Bewdley|Oliver]] who was also elected a Labour MP. In 1931, the Labour government broke up and MacDonald's father formed the National Government with representatives drawn from all political parties.  Very few Labour members would support it, however, and so Malcolm was appointed to a junior ministerial post as [[Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]].  When the Labour MPs met to discuss the formation of the government, Malcolm was the only one present who spoke in favour of his father's actions and voted against a condemnatory resolution.  MacDonald held his seat in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] as a [[National Labour Organisation|National Labour]] candidate, and continued to build up a reputation as a highly competent minister. When his father retired in 1935, the new Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, appointed Malcolm to the Cabinet for the first time as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]].  His father had become [[Lord President of the Council]] and they became only the third father and son to sit together in the same Cabinet.<ref>The two earlier pairs were the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|14th Earl of Derby]] and his son, [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]], and [[Joseph Chamberlain|Joseph]] and [[Austen Chamberlain]]: see Jenkins, p. 118</ref>\n\nIn the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]] held that autumn MacDonald narrowly lost his seat but after some discussion Baldwin decided to retain him in government, albeit moving him to the post of [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]] in a direct swap with [[James Henry Thomas]] who had created problems with some Dominion governments.  The following February MacDonald stood for Parliament in a [[1936 Ross and Cromarty by-election|by-election]] at [[Ross and Cromarty (UK Parliament constituency)|Ross and Cromarty]].  This election proved chaotic as the local Conservative & Unionist Association declined to support him (though the local [[National Liberal Party (UK, 1931)|National Liberals]] did) and instead adopted as their candidate [[Randolph Churchill]], son of [[Winston Churchill]] who had emerged as a prominent Conservative critic of the government.  Despite this MacDonald won the by-election and returned to Parliament. MacDonald retained his position after Baldwin and MacDonald's final retirements in 1937, when together with the new Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] he set about negotiating a new set of agreements with the [[Irish Free State]] to resolve disputes over trade, compensation and the Treaty Ports that the United Kingdom still retained.  Although the issue of [[Northern Ireland]] could not be agreed, all other matters were settled and MacDonald won many plaudits.\n\nIn May 1938, Chamberlain moved him back to the Colonial Office \u2013 a move now seen as a promotion due to the increased prominence of the position given the situation in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]]. In October, the new Dominions Secretary, [[Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (politician, born 1894)|Lord Stanley]], died and MacDonald was appointed to succeed him in addition to the Colonies, as the post was in a sensitive period and needed an experienced pair of hands. The following January, he relinquished the Dominions Office.\n\nIn 1939, MacDonald oversaw and introduced the so-called [[White Paper of 1939|MacDonald White Paper]] which aimed at the creation of a unified state, with controls on Jewish immigration. The White Paper argued that with over 450,000 Jews having now settled in the mandate, the [[Balfour Declaration, 1917|Balfour Declaration]] had now been met and the paper opposed an independent Jewish state. The League of Nations [[Permanent Mandates Commission (Palestine)|Permanent Mandates Commission]] held that the White Paper was in conflict with the terms of the Mandate as put forth in the past.{{efn|Of seven members present, four \"did not feel able to state that the policy of the White Paper was in conformity with the Mandate, any contrary conclusion appearing to them to be ruled out by the very terms of the Mandate and by the fundamental intentions of its authors\" and three \"were unable to share this opinion; they consider that existing circumstances would justify the policy of the White Paper, provided that the Council did not oppose it\".}}\nThe outbreak of the Second World War suspended any further deliberations.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/angap04.asp Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry - Appendix IV] Palestine: Historical Background</ref><ref name=\"Morris2011p159\">{{cite book|author=Benny Morris|title=Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881-1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGtVsBne7PgC|date=25 May 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-78805-4|page=159|chapter=chp. 4|quote=\"Capping it all, the Permanent Mandates Commission of the Council of the League of Nations rejected the White Paper as inconsistent with the terms of the Mandate.\"}}</ref> It has been suggested that MacDonald and Chamberlain took this course of action in order to ensure that the situation in Palestine did not develop into a situation similar to that of [[Ireland]] where two evenly matched communities engaged in bitter ethnic conflict.{{Citation needed|reason=mistake?|date=January 2014}} With [[antisemitism]] rampant in Europe, MacDonald sought to find new settlements, in vain. The White Paper was bitterly opposed by the Jews in Palestine, as well as by many supporting the National Government in Britain. When it was voted on in Parliament many Government supporters abstained or voted against the proposals, including some Cabinet Ministers as well as Winston Churchill. The objections to the 'white paper' were especially raised following the plight of European Jews under Nazi regimes in Germany and Austria, who suffered greatly under the Nazi oppression, but did not have other available goals of immigration, as most states at this point (including the US and Canada), did not accept Jewish refugees. In a UK Parliamentary debate, Lloyd George called the White Paper an act of [[perfidy]] while [[Winston Churchill]] voted against the government.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |date=24 May 1939 |pages=12, 14}}</ref> In a leader the ''[[The Guardian|Manchester Guardian]]'' called it \"a death sentence on tens of thousands of Central European Jews\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Manchester Guardian |date=24 May 1939 |page=8}}</ref> The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[James Armand de Rothschild|James Rothschild]] stated during the parliamentary debate that \"for the majority of the Jews who go to Palestine it is a question of migration or of physical extinction\".<ref>[[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] Debates, Volume 347 column 1984 [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/may/22/palestine-1#column_1984]</ref>\n\nIn May 1940, Chamberlain fell and Winston Churchill formed an all party coalition, bringing the Labour Party into the National Government for the first time. There was some speculation that their hostility might result in MacDonald being amongst the ministers dropped to make way for them (as happened to [[Herbrand Sackville, 9th Earl De La Warr|Earl de la Warr]], the other National Labour minister) but instead MacDonald was retained and became [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]]. In June 1940, he was sent to [[Dublin]] for a series of meetings with [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]: he was authorised to offer the end of the [[Partition of Ireland]] if the Free State would enter the war on the Allied side. De Valera declined the offer. The following year his career took a different turn when he was appointed [[High Commissioner]] to [[Canada]].<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-41680248</ref> Initially special legislation was passed to allow him to retain his seat in Parliament, but in 1945 the National Labour Party dissolved itself and MacDonald decided to retire from British politics.\n\nAfter his term in Canada ended in 1946, MacDonald moved on to serve in other [[British Empire|Imperial]] posts: as [[Governor-General]] of  [[Federation of Malaya|British territories in Southeast Asia from 1946]] to 1948 and then Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia covering regional affairs as well during [[Malayan Emergency|the communist insurrection]];<ref>Christie, Clive J. (1998) ''Southeast Asia in the Twentieth Century: A Reader'' Tauris, London, p. 192 {{ISBN|1-86064-063-X}}</ref> as High Commissioner in [[India]] from 1955 to 1960;<ref>''And Then By Chance'', [[Reginald Second\u00e9]] (2002)</ref> as co-chairman of the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos|Laos Conference]]; and finally as Governor-General of [[Kenya]] between 1963 and 1964.\n\nMacDonald received an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate]] from [[Heriot-Watt University]] in 1973.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.hw.ac.uk/graduation/honorary-graduates.htm|title=Heriot-Watt University Edinburgh: Honorary Graduates|last=webperson@hw.ac.uk|website=www1.hw.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>\n\nIn later years (1971\u20131980) he served as Chancellor of the [[Durham University|University of Durham]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/about/governance/senior/chancellor/former/|title=About Durham University : Former Chancellors of the University - Durham University|website=www.dur.ac.uk|access-date=2016-04-07}}</ref>\n\nMacDonald spent the last eleven years of his life at [[Raspit Hill]], near [[Ightham]] in [[Kent]], where he died in 1981, aged 79.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn December 1946, he married Audrey Marjorie Fellowes Rowley,<ref>http://picclick.co.uk/Engagement-Of-Malcolm-John-MacDonald-Audrey-Marjorie-Rowley-152301922357.html</ref> a Canadian war widow. They had one child, daughter Fiona (married to Bob McElwain). MacDonald also adopted his wife\u2019s two children from her first marriage, Bill and Jane Rowley.\n\nHe was a keen ornithologist and, in 1934, published the book ''Bird Watching At Lossiemouth'' privately. It was, as he noted, in a brief foreword, an expanded version of a paper he read to the London Morayshire Club one evening in the autumn of 1933.<ref>{{cite book|last1=MacDonald|first1=Malcolm|title=Bird Watching At Lossiemouth|date=1934|publisher=Privately Published|location=Elgin}}</ref>\n\nWhile High Commissioner to Canada, MacDonald undertook two extensive journeys, in a [[Grumman Goose]], from Ottawa to the far Northwest of Canada. He was accompanied by three senior Government officials, in August 1942 and March 1943.  He chronicles the trips in a book \"Down North\" (Oxford University Press, Toronto, 1943).  The trips covered remote areas of Alberta, the Northwest Territories, the Yukon and British Columbia, going as far north as Aklavik. MacDonald's book gives a perspective of the history, geography and peoples of Canada's northwest.\n\nOn 9 May 2015, his widow Audrey died of natural causes in [[Ottawa]] at the age of 99 years old, three weeks before her 100th birthday.<ref>https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/facts-and-arguments/lives-lived-audrey-macdonald-99/article26094484/</ref><ref>http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/Deaths.20150513.93360375/BDAStory/BDA/deaths</ref>\n\nMacDonald was a prolific art collector in a range of genres, most notably Chinese ceramics. He sold and donated art collections to museums across the world. His Chinese ceramic collections comprise a total of over 500 pieces with a chronological span of 2000 BCE to circa 1940 CE and incorporating representative examples of most styles of domestic and export ceramic wares. These collections are today split between the Oriental Museum of Durham University, the University of Malaya Museum of Asian Art in Kuala Lumpur and the National University of Singapore Museum in Singapore.<ref>Alexander Nicholas Shaw, 'A Diplomat and a Collector: Malcolm MacDonald's Pursuit of Beauty during the Cold War and End of Empire', ''Journal of the History of Collections'', vol. 30 issue 3, 2018, pp. 511-527</ref>\n\n==Writings==\n\nAs a young man, MacDonald aspired to be a novelist but did not succeed in publishing any of his writings of fiction. He wrote a number of articles for British and Canadian newspapers in the 1920s, including a series describing his travels in Japan, China and Korea in 1929. Following the assumption of his diplomatic career in 1941, MacDonald began writing factual accounts of the people, places and wildlife he encountered. He authored the following published works:\n\n* ''Down North'' (1943: a description of his travels as High Commissioner to Canada)\n* ''Birds of Brewery Creek'' (1947: a bird-watching diary regarded by US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles as one of the best books on the subject of North American ornithology)\n* ''Borneo People'' (1956: an account of MacDonald's friendship with the Dayak peoples of Borneo including Iban leader Temenggong Koh Anak Jubang)\n* ''Angkor'' (1958: one of the first English-language and systematically photographed guides to the Cambodian temple complex at Angkor Wat)\n* ''Birds in My Indian Garden'' (1960: containing many black and white images)\n* ''Birds in the Sun'' (1962: a guide to the birds of South Asia with colour photography by MacDonald's friend Christina Loke)\n* ''Treasure of Kenya'' (1965: another collaboration with Christina Loke which aimed to attract support amongst a British audience for wildlife conservation in Kenya.
