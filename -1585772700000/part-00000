The Columbia protests erupted over the spring of that year after students discovered links between the university and the institutional apparatus supporting the United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], as well as their concern over an allegedly [[Racial segregation|segregated]] gymnasium to be constructed in the nearby [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]]. The protests resulted in the student occupation of many university buildings and the eventual violent removal of protesters by the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref name=\"40th\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html?scp=1&sq=columbia+1968&st=nyt \"Columbia\u2019s Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion\", NY Times, April 28, 2008]</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nIn early March 1967, a [[Columbia University]] [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] activist named Bob Feldman discovered documents in the International Law Library detailing Columbia's institutional affiliation with the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA), a weapons research [[think tank]] affiliated with the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].  The nature of the association had not been, to that point, publicly announced by the University.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nPrior to March 1967, the IDA had rarely been mentioned in the U.S. media or in the left, underground or campus press.  A few magazine articles on the IDA had appeared between 1956 and 1967 and the IDA had been mentioned in a few books for academic specialists published by university presses.  The [[RAND Corporation]], not the Institute for Defense Analyses, was the military-oriented think tank that had received most of the publicity prior to March 1967.  But after Feldman's name appeared in some leftist publications in reference to the Columbia-IDA revelation, the [[FBI]] opened a file on him and started to investigate, according to Feldman's declassified FBI files.\n\nThe discovery of the IDA documents touched off a Columbia SDS anti-war campaign between April 1967 and April 1968, which demanded the Columbia University administration resign its institutional membership in the Institute for Defense Analyses.  Following a peaceful demonstration inside the [[Low Memorial Library|Low Library]] administration building on March 27, 1968, the Columbia Administration placed on probation six anti-war Columbia student activists, who were collectively nicknamed \"The IDA Six,\" for violating its ban on indoor demonstrations.\n\n===Morningside Park gymnasium and discrimination===\nColumbia's plan to construct what activists described as a segregated gymnasium in city-owned [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]] fueled anger among the nearby Harlem community. Opposition began in 1965 during the mayoral campaign of [[John Lindsay]], who opposed the project. By 1967 community opposition had become more militant.<ref name= \"unc\"/> One of the causes for dispute was the gym's proposed design. Due to the topography of the area, Columbia's campus at [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] to the west was more than {{Convert|100|ft||abbr=}} above the adjacent neighborhood of [[Harlem]] to the east. The proposed design would have an upper level to be used as a Columbia [[gym]], and a lower level to be used as a [[community center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/01/14/archives/columbia-to-build-sports-center-it-will-share-with-neighborhood.html|title=Columbia to Build Sports Center It Will Share With Neighborhood; Site for $6,000,000 Facility to Be Donated by City -- University to Raise Fund|date=1960-01-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By 1968, concerned students and community members saw the planned separate east and west entrances as an attempt to circumvent the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], then a recent federal law that banned racially segregated facilities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/26/archives/gym-controversy-began-in-late-50s-many-columbia-opponents-use-it-as.html|title=GYM CONTROVERSY BEGAN IN LATE 50s; Many Columbia Opponents Use It as a Symbol|last=Millones|first=Peter|date=1968-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  In addition, others were concerned with the appropriation of land from a public park. Harlem activists opposed the construction because, despite being on public land and a park, Harlem residents would get only limited access to the facility. It was for these reasons that the project was labelled by some as \"Gym Crow\".\n\nSince 1958 the University had evicted more than seven thousand Harlem residents from Columbia-controlled properties\u201485 percent of whom were African American or Puerto Rican. Many Harlem residents paid rent to the University.<ref name= \"unc\"/>\n\nBlack students at a 40th anniversary event said their bitterness evolved from discrimination, that unlike white students their identifications were constantly checked, and that black women were told not to register for difficult courses. A \"stacking system\" that put all the former black football players in the same position was described.<ref name=40th/>\n\n==Protests==\n\n===April student strike and occupations===\nThe first protest occurred eight days before the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] In response to the Columbia Administration's attempts to suppress anti-IDA student protest on its campus, and Columbia's plans for the Morningside Park gymnasium, Columbia SDS activists and the student activists who led Columbia's Student Afro Society (SAS) held a second, confrontational demonstration on April 23, 1968.  After the protesting Columbia and [[Barnard College|Barnard]] students were prevented from protesting inside Low Library by Columbia security guards, most of the student protesters marched down to the Columbia gymnasium construction site in [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]], attempted to stop construction of the gymnasium and began to struggle with the [[NYPD|New York City Police]] officers who were guarding the construction site. The [[NYPD]] arrested one protester at the gym site.  The SAS and SDS students then left the gym site at Morningside Park  and returned to Columbia's campus, where they took over [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], a building housing both classrooms and the offices of the [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] Administration.\n\nAn important aspect of the 1968 Columbia University protests was the manner in which activists were separated along racial lines. The morning after the initial takeover of Hamilton Hall, the 60 African-American students involved with the protest asked the predominantly white SDS students to leave. The SAS decision to separate themselves from SDS came as a total surprise to the latter group's members. SAS wanted autonomy in what they were doing at that point in the protest, because their goals and methods diverged in significant ways from SDS.<ref>comments of Ray Brown in the \"What Happened?\" session of the retrospective Columbia 1968 Conference, held in 2008</ref> While both the SAS and the SDS shared the goal of preventing the construction of the new gymnasium, the two groups held different agendas. The overarching goal of the SDS extended beyond the single issue of halting the construction of the gym. SDS wanted to mobilize the student population of Columbia to confront the University's support of the war, while the SAS was primarily interested in stopping the University's encroachment of Harlem, through the construction of the gym. It was of great importance to SAS that there was no destruction of files and personal property in faculty and administrative offices in Hamilton Hall, which would have reinforced negative stereotypes of black protesters destroying property then popular in the media. Having sole occupancy of Hamilton Hall thus allowed SAS to avoid any potential conflict with SDS about destruction of university property, as well as with other issues.  Thus, the members of the SAS requested that the white radicals begin their own, separate protest so that the black students could put all of its focus into preventing the university from building the gym.<ref name=\"Harlem\">{{cite book |title= Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s|last= Bradley|first= Stefan|year= 2009|publisher= University of Illinois|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-252-03452-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHd25eE8Z1UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=5\u201319, 164\u2013191}}</ref> The African-American students said that the European-American students could not understand the protest of the gymnasium as deeply, as its architectural plans were developed in a segregationist fashion. In addition, the African-American students knew that police would not be as violent against a group of black students, to prevent riots due to the fact that [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] had been killed three weeks prior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/4/23/how_black_students_helped_lead_the|title=How Black Students Helped Lead the 1968 Columbia U.

There was minimal communication between the SDS and SAS which led to decreased solidarity between the two forces.<ref name=\"white\">{{cite book |title= White Boy: A Memoir|last= Naison|first= Mark|year= 2002|publisher= Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn= 978-1-56639-941-8 |pages= 90\u201395 }}</ref> An agreement would soon be made between the SDS and the SAS to separate white and black demonstrators.

Accessed November 2, 2009.</ref> Over the next few days, the University President's office in Low Library (but not the remainder of the building, which housed the school switchboard in the basement, and offices elsewhere, but no actual library) and three other buildings, including the [[Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|School of Architecture]], which contained classrooms were also occupied by the student protesters. This separation of the SDS and SAS, with each using different tactics to accomplish its goals, was consistent with the student movement across the country.<ref name=\"Harlem\" /> Only a portion of the occupiers were actual members of the University community. Many outside participants flocked to this newest point of revolution to participate, including students from other colleges, and street people. \n\nIn separating themselves from the white protesters early in the demonstration, the black protesters forced Columbia to address the issue of race. Falling so soon after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which had caused riots in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university, the administrators trod lightly in dealing with the demonstrators of the SAS. University administration seemed helpless against the group of African-American students who controlled the College's most important building and had support from off-campus black activists. Any use of force, officials feared, could incite riots in the neighboring Harlem community. Realizing this, those holed up in Hamilton Hall encouraged neighboring African-Americans to come to the campus and \"recruited famous black militants to speak at their rallies.\"<ref name=\"white\" />  The student-community alliance that forged between students of the SAS and Harlem residents led to widespread growth in white support for the cause.<ref name=\"white\" />\n\nA photo of [[David Shapiro (poet)|David Shapiro]] wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar in Columbia President [[Grayson L.

Coleman]] would be held hostage until the group's demands were met. Though he was not in his office when the takeover was initiated, Coleman made his way into the building past protesters, went into his office and stated that \"I have no control over the demands you are making, but I have no intention of meeting any demand under a situation such as this.\" Along with College administrators William Kahn and Dan Carlinsky, Coleman was detained as a hostage in his office as furniture was placed to keep him from leaving. He had been provided with food while being held and was able to leave 24 hours later, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' describing his departure from the siege as \"showing no sign that he had been unsettled by the experience\"<ref>Martin, Douglas.

To that end, a group of 300  undergraduates calling themselves the \"Majority Coalition\" (intended to portray the students involved in the occupation as not representative of the majority of liberal Columbia and Barnard students) organized after several days of the building occupation, in response to what they perceived as administration inaction. This group was made up of student athletes, fraternity members and members of the general undergraduate population, led by Richard Waselewsky and Richard Forzani. These students were not necessarily opposed to the spectrum of goals enunciated by the demonstrators, but were adamant in their opposition to the unilateral occupation of University buildings. They formed a human blockade around the primary building, Low Library. Their stated mission was to allow anyone who wished to leave Low to do so, with no consequence. However, they also prevented anyone or any supplies from entering the building. After three consecutive days of blockade, a group of protesters attempted on the afternoon of April 29 to forcibly penetrate the line but were repulsed in a quick and violent confrontation. In addition to fearing that Harlem residents would riot or invade Columbia's campus, the Columbia Administration also feared student on student violence. So at 5:00 PM that evening the Coalition was persuaded to abandon its blockade at the request of the faculty committee, who advised coalition leaders that the situation would be resolved by the next morning.\n\nThe protests came to a conclusion in the early morning hours of April 30, 1968, when the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] violently quashed the demonstrations, with tear gas, and stormed both Hamilton Hall and the Low Library.   Hamilton Hall was cleared peacefully as African-American lawyers were outside ready to represent SAS members in court and a tactical squad of African-American police officers with the [[NYPD]] led by Detective Sanford Garelick (the same investigator of the [[Malcolm X]] homicide) had cleared the African-American students out of Hamilton Hall. The buildings occupied by whites however were cleared violently as approximately 132 students, 4 faculty members and 12 police officers were injured, while over 700 protesters were arrested.<ref>McFadden, Robert D.

Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym, building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead. A popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by [[Princeton University]] for the expansion of its athletic facilities, but as [[Jadwin Gymnasium]] was already 50% complete by 1966 (when the Columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct.<ref>Hevesi, Dennis.

Appointed as dean while the protests were continuing, Hovde stated that he felt that the \"sit-ins and the demonstrations were not without cause\" and opposed criminal charges being filed against the students by the university, though he did agree that the protesters \"were acting with insufficient cause\".<ref>Hevesi, Dennis.

The Columbia building occupations and accompanying demonstrations, in which several thousand people participated, paralyzed the operations of the whole university and became \"the most powerful and effective student protest in modern American history,\" although it is very arguable that the protests at UC Berkeley and Kent State had far more sweeping repercussions.<ref name=\"white\"/> A wide variety of effects, both positive and negative, occurred in the wake of the demonstrations, but unfortunately for Columbia, they primarily affected enrollment and alumni donations. Additionally, the \"growing militancy\" Gitlin refers to peaked just a few years later, and while certain new loci of power came into being, in general campus life calmed down significantly. This is due in major part to the ending of the Vietnam War, which historians credit as the underlying and immediate cause of the majority of said movements. This excepts the Civil Rights Movement which was well under way prior to Vietnam. The two issues combined synergistically in the mid/late sixties.\n\nStudents involved in the protests continued their involvement in protest politics in varied forms affecting the movement at large. Their many activities included forming [[commune]]s and creating urban social organizations. Several Columbia SDS members combined with the New York [[Black Panther Party]] to create [[Weatherman (organization)|Weatherman]], a group dedicated to the violent overthrow of the government.<ref name=\"unc\"/>\n\nColumbia became much more liberal in its policies as a result of the student demonstrations and classes were canceled for the rest of the week following the end of the protest. Additionally, a policy was soon established that allowed students to receive passing grades in all classes with no additional work for the remainder of the abridged semester. In the place of traditional class, students held \"liberation classes, rallies, [and] concerts outside\" which included appearances by Allen Ginsberg and the Grateful Dead.<ref name=\"unc\">Slonecker, Blake.

Accessed October 29, 2009.</ref>\n\nColumbia suffered quite a bit in the aftermath of the student protest. Applications, endowments, and grants for the university declined significantly in the following years. \"It took at least 20 years to fully recover.\" <ref name=\"'68\"/> The protests left Columbia in a bad spot financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate any more to the school. Many believe that protest efforts at Columbia were also responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left. These critics, such as Allan Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, believed, \"American universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate, but rather places of 'political correctness' and liberalism.\" <ref name=\"Harlem\"/>\n\nRacial divisions had also been strengthened as a result of the protests, made worse by the separate deal that the administration, to prevent a riot in Harlem, made with the black students of the SAS who had occupied Hamilton Hall. These black activists were permitted to exit the building through tunnels before the New York Police Department came. Black students maintained their own separate organization with a particular agenda: to foster the relationship between Columbia and the Harlem community and modify the curriculum to include black studies courses.<ref name=\"white\"/>\n\nAn [[university senate]] was established as a result of the protests. This council, with representation from the faculty, administration and student population, gave students the opportunity to positively restructure the university. It was a way to produce positive dialogue between students and authority figures.<ref name=\"Harlem\"/> From here on out, university administration would be attentive to student concerns about university policies.<ref name=\"Legacy\">Karaganis, Joseph. [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-4.1/karaganis.html \"Radicalism and Research\"], Accessed October 27, 2009.</ref> Another result of the protests was an improved relationship with the Harlem community. The university was forced to approach neighboring Harlem with a certain respect.<ref name=\"Harlem\"/> Instead of continuing expansion north and east into Harlem, Columbia shifted its focus for expansion west to the Hudson [[Riverside Park, Manhattan|Riverside Park]] area.\n\nColumbia's relationship with the United States military and federal government was changed, a number of years in advance of similar changes for other schools. There would be no more federal sponsorship of classified weapons research and international studies that had been occurring since World War II, as Columbia severed ties to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which had been created in 1955 to foster the connection between Columbia University and the defense establishment.<ref name=\"Legacy\"/> In addition, the ROTC left the Morningside Heights campus as CIA and armed forces recruiters.<ref name=\"'68\"/> As a sign of changing times, however, Columbia announced early in 2013 a renewal of its historic ties to NROTC.\n\nAccording to Stefan Bradley in his book ''Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s'', through the results of the protests, the SAS showed that [[Black Power]], which refers to the ability for African-American students and black working-class community members to work together despite class differences, on an issue affecting African-Americans, could succeed as it had done in the Columbia University protests of 1968.<ref name=\"Harlem\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\n* ''[[The Strawberry Statement]]'' \u2013 by [[James Simon Kunen]].

The Columbia protests erupted over the spring of that year after students discovered links between the university and the institutional apparatus supporting the United States' involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], as well as their concern over an allegedly [[Racial segregation|segregated]] gymnasium to be constructed in the nearby [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]]. The protests resulted in the student occupation of many university buildings and the eventual violent removal of protesters by the [[New York City Police Department]].<ref name=\"40th\">[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html?scp=1&sq=columbia+1968&st=nyt \"Columbia\u2019s Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion\", NY Times, April 28, 2008]</ref>\n\n==Origins==\nIn early March 1967, a [[Columbia University]] [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] activist named Bob Feldman discovered documents in the International Law Library detailing Columbia's institutional affiliation with the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA), a weapons research [[think tank]] affiliated with the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]].  The nature of the association had not been, to that point, publicly announced by the University.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nPrior to March 1967, the IDA had rarely been mentioned in the U.S. media or in the left, underground or campus press.  A few magazine articles on the IDA had appeared between 1956 and 1967 and the IDA had been mentioned in a few books for academic specialists published by university presses.  The [[RAND Corporation]], not the Institute for Defense Analyses, was the military-oriented think tank that had received most of the publicity prior to March 1967.  But after Feldman's name appeared in some leftist publications in reference to the Columbia-IDA revelation, the [[FBI]] opened a file on him and started to investigate, according to Feldman's declassified FBI files.\n\nThe discovery of the IDA documents touched off a Columbia SDS anti-war campaign between April 1967 and April 1968, which demanded the Columbia University administration resign its institutional membership in the Institute for Defense Analyses.  Following a peaceful demonstration inside the [[Low Memorial Library|Low Library]] administration building on March 27, 1968, the Columbia Administration placed on probation six anti-war Columbia student activists, who were collectively nicknamed \"The IDA Six,\" for violating its ban on indoor demonstrations.\n\n===Morningside Park gymnasium and discrimination===\nColumbia's plan to construct what activists described as a segregated gymnasium in city-owned [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]] fueled anger among the nearby Harlem community. Opposition began in 1965 during the mayoral campaign of [[John Lindsay]], who opposed the project. By 1967 community opposition had become more militant.<ref name= \"unc\"/> One of the causes for dispute was the gym's proposed design. Due to the topography of the area, Columbia's campus at [[Morningside Heights, Manhattan|Morningside Heights]] to the west was more than {{Convert|100|ft||abbr=}} above the adjacent neighborhood of [[Harlem]] to the east. The proposed design would have an upper level to be used as a Columbia [[gym]], and a lower level to be used as a [[community center]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/01/14/archives/columbia-to-build-sports-center-it-will-share-with-neighborhood.html|title=Columbia to Build Sports Center It Will Share With Neighborhood; Site for $6,000,000 Facility to Be Donated by City -- University to Raise Fund|date=1960-01-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> By 1968, concerned students and community members saw the planned separate east and west entrances as an attempt to circumvent the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], then a recent federal law that banned racially segregated facilities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/04/26/archives/gym-controversy-began-in-late-50s-many-columbia-opponents-use-it-as.html|title=GYM CONTROVERSY BEGAN IN LATE 50s; Many Columbia Opponents Use It as a Symbol|last=Millones|first=Peter|date=1968-04-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  In addition, others were concerned with the appropriation of land from a public park. Harlem activists opposed the construction because, despite being on public land and a park, Harlem residents would get only limited access to the facility. It was for these reasons that the project was labelled by some as \"Gym Crow\".\n\nSince 1958 the University had evicted more than seven thousand Harlem residents from Columbia-controlled properties\u201485 percent of whom were African American or Puerto Rican. Many Harlem residents paid rent to the University.<ref name= \"unc\"/>\n\nBlack students at a 40th anniversary event said their bitterness evolved from discrimination, that unlike white students their identifications were constantly checked, and that black women were told not to register for difficult courses. A \"stacking system\" that put all the former black football players in the same position was described.<ref name=40th/>\n\n==Protests==\n\n===April student strike and occupations===\nThe first protest occurred eight days before the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] In response to the Columbia Administration's attempts to suppress anti-IDA student protest on its campus, and Columbia's plans for the Morningside Park gymnasium, Columbia SDS activists and the student activists who led Columbia's Student Afro Society (SAS) held a second, confrontational demonstration on April 23, 1968.  After the protesting Columbia and [[Barnard College|Barnard]] students were prevented from protesting inside Low Library by Columbia security guards, most of the student protesters marched down to the Columbia gymnasium construction site in [[Morningside Park (Manhattan)|Morningside Park]], attempted to stop construction of the gymnasium and began to struggle with the [[NYPD|New York City Police]] officers who were guarding the construction site. The [[NYPD]] arrested one protester at the gym site.  The SAS and SDS students then left the gym site at Morningside Park  and returned to Columbia's campus, where they took over [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], a building housing both classrooms and the offices of the [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] Administration.\n\nAn important aspect of the 1968 Columbia University protests was the manner in which activists were separated along racial lines. The morning after the initial takeover of Hamilton Hall, the 60 African-American students involved with the protest asked the predominantly white SDS students to leave. The SAS decision to separate themselves from SDS came as a total surprise to the latter group's members. SAS wanted autonomy in what they were doing at that point in the protest, because their goals and methods diverged in significant ways from SDS.<ref>comments of Ray Brown in the \"What Happened?\" session of the retrospective Columbia 1968 Conference, held in 2008</ref> While both the SAS and the SDS shared the goal of preventing the construction of the new gymnasium, the two groups held different agendas. The overarching goal of the SDS extended beyond the single issue of halting the construction of the gym. SDS wanted to mobilize the student population of Columbia to confront the University's support of the war, while the SAS was primarily interested in stopping the University's encroachment of Harlem, through the construction of the gym. It was of great importance to SAS that there was no destruction of files and personal property in faculty and administrative offices in Hamilton Hall, which would have reinforced negative stereotypes of black protesters destroying property then popular in the media. Having sole occupancy of Hamilton Hall thus allowed SAS to avoid any potential conflict with SDS about destruction of university property, as well as with other issues.  Thus, the members of the SAS requested that the white radicals begin their own, separate protest so that the black students could put all of its focus into preventing the university from building the gym.<ref name=\"Harlem\">{{cite book |title= Harlem vs. Columbia University: Black Student Power in the Late 1960s|last= Bradley|first= Stefan|year= 2009|publisher= University of Illinois|location= New York|isbn= 978-0-252-03452-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHd25eE8Z1UC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|pages=5\u201319, 164\u2013191}}</ref> The African-American students said that the European-American students could not understand the protest of the gymnasium as deeply, as its architectural plans were developed in a segregationist fashion. In addition, the African-American students knew that police would not be as violent against a group of black students, to prevent riots due to the fact that [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] had been killed three weeks prior.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2018/4/23/how_black_students_helped_lead_the|title=How Black Students Helped Lead the 1968 Columbia U.

There was minimal communication between the SDS and SAS which led to decreased solidarity between the two forces.<ref name=\"white\">{{cite book |title= White Boy: A Memoir|last= Naison|first= Mark|year= 2002|publisher= Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn= 978-1-56639-941-8 |pages= 90\u201395 }}</ref> An agreement would soon be made between the SDS and the SAS to separate white and black demonstrators.

This separation of the SDS and SAS, with each using different tactics to accomplish its goals, was consistent with the student movement across the country.<ref name=\"Harlem\" /> Only a portion of the occupiers were actual members of the University community. Many outside participants flocked to this newest point of revolution to participate, including students from other colleges, street people and celebrities such as Jane Fonda's spouse, fresh from UC Berkeley protests, Tom Hayden.\n\nIn separating themselves from the white protesters early in the demonstration, the black protesters forced Columbia to address the issue of race. Falling so soon after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., which had caused riots in the black neighborhoods surrounding the university, the administrators trod lightly in dealing with the demonstrators of the SAS. University administration seemed helpless against the group of African-American students who controlled the College's most important building and had support from off-campus black activists. Any use of force, officials feared, could incite riots in the neighboring Harlem community. Realizing this, those holed up in Hamilton Hall encouraged neighboring African-Americans to come to the campus and \"recruited famous black militants to speak at their rallies.\"<ref name=\"white\" />  The student-community alliance that forged between students of the SAS and Harlem residents led to widespread growth in white support for the cause.<ref name=\"white\" />\n\nA photo of [[David Shapiro (poet)|David Shapiro]] wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigar in Columbia President [[Grayson L.

Though he was not in his office when the takeover was initiated, Coleman made his way into the building past protesters, went into his office and stated that \"I have no control over the demands you are making, but I have no intention of meeting any demand under a situation such as this.\" Along with College administrators William Kahn and Dan Carlinsky, Coleman was detained as a hostage in his office as furniture was placed to keep him from leaving. He had been provided with food while being held and was able to leave 24 hours later, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' describing his departure from the siege as \"showing no sign that he had been unsettled by the experience\"<ref>Martin, Douglas.

To that end, a group of 300  undergraduates calling themselves the \"Majority Coalition\" (intended to portray the students involved in the occupation as not representative of the majority of liberal Columbia and Barnard students) organized after several days of the building occupation, in response to what they perceived as administration inaction. This group was made up of student athletes, fraternity members and members of the general undergraduate population, led by Richard Waselewsky and Richard Forzani. These students were not necessarily opposed to the spectrum of goals enunciated by the demonstrators, but were adamant in their opposition to the unilateral occupation of University buildings. They formed a human blockade around the primary building, Low Library. Their stated mission was to allow anyone who wished to leave Low to do so, with no consequence. However, they also prevented anyone or any supplies from entering the building. After three consecutive days of blockade, a group of protesters attempted on the afternoon of April 29 to forcibly penetrate the line but were repulsed in a quick and violent confrontation. In addition to fearing that Harlem residents would riot or invade Columbia's campus, the Columbia Administration also feared student on student violence. So at 5:00 PM that evening the Coalition was persuaded to abandon its blockade at the request of the faculty committee, who advised coalition leaders that the situation would be resolved by the next morning.\n\nThe protests came to a conclusion in the early morning hours of April 30, 1968, when the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] violently quashed the demonstrations, with tear gas, and stormed both Hamilton Hall and the Low Library.   Hamilton Hall was cleared peacefully as African-American lawyers were outside ready to represent SAS members in court and a tactical squad of African-American police officers with the [[NYPD]] led by Detective Sanford Garelick (the same investigator of the [[Malcolm X]] homicide) had cleared the African-American students out of Hamilton Hall. The buildings occupied by whites however were cleared violently as approximately 132 students, 4 faculty members and 12 police officers were injured, while over 700 protesters were arrested.<ref>McFadden, Robert D.

Columbia disaffiliated from the IDA and scrapped the plans for the controversial gym, building a subterranean physical fitness center under the north end of campus instead. A popular myth states that the gym's plans were eventually used by [[Princeton University]] for the expansion of its athletic facilities, but as [[Jadwin Gymnasium]] was already 50% complete by 1966 (when the Columbia gym was announced) this was clearly not correct.<ref>Hevesi, Dennis.

The Columbia building occupations and accompanying demonstrations, in which several thousand people participated, paralyzed the operations of the whole university and became \"the most powerful and effective student protest in modern American history,\" although it is very arguable that the protests at UC Berkeley and Kent State had far more sweeping repercussions.<ref name=\"white\"/> A wide variety of effects, both positive and negative, occurred in the wake of the demonstrations, but unfortunately for Columbia, they primarily affected enrollment and alumni donations. Additionally, the \"growing militancy\" Gitlin refers to peaked just a few years later, and while certain new loci of power came into being, in general campus life calmed down significantly. This is due in major part to the ending of the Vietnam War, which historians credit as the underlying and immediate cause of the majority of said movements. This excepts the Civil Rights Movement which was well under way prior to Vietnam. The two issues combined synergistically in the mid/late sixties.\n\nStudents involved in the protests continued their involvement in protest politics in varied forms affecting the movement at large. Their many activities included forming [[commune]]s and creating urban social organizations. Several Columbia SDS members combined with the New York [[Black Panther Party]] to create [[Weatherman (organization)|Weatherman]], a group dedicated to the violent overthrow of the government.<ref name=\"unc\"/>\n\nColumbia became much more liberal in its policies as a result of the student demonstrations and classes were canceled for the rest of the week following the end of the protest. Additionally, a policy was soon established that allowed students to receive passing grades in all classes with no additional work for the remainder of the abridged semester. In the place of traditional class, students held \"liberation classes, rallies, [and] concerts outside\" which included appearances by Allen Ginsberg and the Grateful Dead.<ref name=\"unc\">Slonecker, Blake.

Applications, endowments, and grants for the university declined significantly in the following years. \"It took at least 20 years to fully recover.\" <ref name=\"'68\"/> The protests left Columbia in a bad spot financially as many potential students chose to attend other universities and some alumni refused to donate any more to the school. Many believe that protest efforts at Columbia were also responsible for pushing higher education further toward the liberal left. These critics, such as Allan Bloom, a University of Chicago professor, believed, \"American universities were no longer places of intellectual and academic debate, but rather places of 'political correctness' and liberalism.\" <ref name=\"Harlem\"/>\n\nRacial divisions had also been strengthened as a result of the protests, made worse by the separate deal that the administration, to prevent a riot in Harlem, made with the black students of the SAS who had occupied Hamilton Hall. These black activists were permitted to exit the building through tunnels before the New York Police Department came. Black students maintained their own separate organization with a particular agenda: to foster the relationship between Columbia and the Harlem community and modify the curriculum to include black studies courses.<ref name=\"white\"/>\n\nAn [[university senate]] was established as a result of the protests. This council, with representation from the faculty, administration and student population, gave students the opportunity to positively restructure the university.

{"title_page": "Alliterative Revival", "text_new": "The '''Alliterative Revival''' is a term adopted by academics to refer to the resurgence of poetry using the [[alliterative verse]] form in [[Middle English]] between c. 1350 and 1500. Alliterative verse was the traditional verse form of [[Old English poetry]]; the last known alliterative poem prior to the Revival was [[Layamon]]'s ''[[Brut (Layamon)|Brut]]'', which dates from around 1190.\n\nScholarly opinion has been divided on whether the Alliterative Revival represented a conscious revival of an old artistic tradition, or merely signified that despite the tradition continuing in some form between 1200 and 1350, no poems survived in written form. Major works of the Revival include [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', the [[Alliterative Morte Arthure|Alliterative ''Morte Arthure'']], and the works of the [[Gawain Poet]]: ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', ''[[Cleanness]]'', and ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]''.\n\n==History of academic recognition of the Revival==\n\nIt was not until the later 19th century that editors began to consider the problems caused by the chronology of surviving medieval alliterative verse. Although he offered no comment himself, the work of [[Walter William Skeat]] made it apparent to students for the first time that there was a gap during the 13th and 14th centuries when no verse was written using an alliterative stave.<ref name=cornelius72>Cornelius (2017), ''Reconstructing Alliterative Verse: The Pursuit of a Medieval Meter'', CUP, p.72</ref> By 1889 the philologist [[Bernhard Egidius Konrad ten Brink|ten Brink]] spoke of a \"revival of alliterative poetry\" in the later 14th century, and the term was in routine use by the early 20th century.<ref name=cornelius72/>\n\nThe concept was further developed by scholars such as [[Israel Gollancz]], James R. Hulbert, and J. P. Oakden; their work enshrined a regionally based, nativist formulation of alliterative poetry which argued it expressed selfconsciously 'English' and archaic modes, recovered from previous centuries, in opposition to the French-influenced court poetry of the south and east of England.<ref name=cornelius73>Cornelius (2017), p.73</ref>\n\nWhile the arguments of Gollancz and early 20th century academics strongly supposed continuity between Old English verse forms and those of the Revival, academics of the 1960s and 70s increasingly began to stress the discontinuities in the forms, suggesting that 14th century alliterative verse was a purely new invention.<ref name=cornelius74>Cornelius (2017), p.74</ref> Writers such as Elizabeth Salter, David Lawton and Thorlac Turville-Petre notably refused to hypothesise the existence of poetry that had not survived in the written record, preferring instead to seek possible inspiration for the Revival's poetry within rhythmic prose traditions of the 13th and 14th century.<ref name=cornelius74/>\n\n==Verse==\n===Alliterative \"long line\"===\n\nThe rules by which alliterative verse was composed in Middle English are unclear and have been the subject of much debate. No metrical rules were written down at the time, and their details were quickly forgotten once the form died out: [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]], in his 1550 printing of ''Piers Plowman'', simply stated that each line had \"thre wordes at the least [...] whiche beginne with some one letter\", assuring readers that \"this thinge noted, the miter shal be very plesaunt to read\".<ref name=cornelius5>Cornelius, 2017, p.55</ref>\n\nVerse of the Alliterative Revival broadly adheres to the same pattern shown in Old English poetry; a four-stress line, with a rhythmic pause (or [[caesura]]) in the middle, in which three of the stresses [[alliteration|alliterate]], i.e. ''aa / ax''. However, there are very significant differences. Amongst the features differentiating the Middle English alliterative style from its predecessor is that the lines are longer and looser in rhythm, and the medial pause is less strictly observed, or often absent entirely; hundreds of rhythmic variations seem to have been permitted.<ref name=duggan>See Duggan, H. N. 'The Shape of the B-Verse in Middle English Alliterative Poetry', ''Speculum'', 61 (1986), 564</ref> While Old English poetry generally employed a clear syntactic break in the middle of the line, in Middle English the line is generally a complete syntactic unit: some poets composed sentences extending over several lines.<ref name=turville53>Turville-Petre, T. ''The Alliterative Revival'', Boydell & Brewer, 1977, p.53</ref> An example of this style is shown by a few lines from ''Wynnere and Wastoure'':\n\n:Whylome were '''l'''ordes in '''l'''onde that '''l'''oved in thaire hertis\n:To here '''m'''akers of '''m'''yrthes that '''m'''atirs couthe fynde,\n:And now es no '''f'''renchipe in '''f'''ere bot '''f'''ayntnesse of hert,\n:'''W'''yse '''w'''ordes withinn that '''w'''roghte were never,\n:Ne '''r'''edde in no '''r'''omance that ever '''r'''enke herde.(19-23)\n\nThere has been much debate on the subject of how lines containing more than two alliterating syllables before the medial pause, which are common in verse of the Revival, should be read.<ref name=turville54>Turville-Petre, T, 1977, p.54</ref> While some scholars have described these additional syllables as a \"minor chief syllable\" or as having \"secondary stress\", they have also been interpreted as not altering the four-stress pattern while still contributing to the effect of the line.<ref name=turville55>Turville-Petre, 1977, p.55</ref> Some of the most recent analysis proposes that the traditional four-stress model of both Old English and Middle English alliterative verse is a \"misapprehension\"<ref name=cornelius4>Cornelius, 2017, pp.4-5</ref> and that a focus on other apparent rules clarifies the evolution of the form, with Layamon's ''Brut'' emerging as a key text in the development of alliterative verse.<ref name=cornelius4/>\n\n===Stanzaic poems===\n\nA second type of verse combining rhymed [[stanza]]s, usually of thirteen or occasionally fourteen lines, with the basic four-stress line also appeared during the Revival: it appears to have been a new development of the 14th century.<ref name=weiskott103>Weiskott, ''English Alliterative Verse'', 2016, CUP, pp.103-4</ref> Here the alliteration may often follow the pattern ''aa / aa'', ''ax / aa'', or even ''aa / bb'', though lines with four alliterating words are much more common than in verse using the unrhymed long line.\n\nMirroring uncertainty over the evolution of alliterative verse in general, it is still uncertain as to whether this tradition developed from the unrhymed alliterative template or from rhymed verse forms on which the traditional alliterative stave was superimposed. While the poems in the thirteen-line stanza have generally been considered a part of the alliterative tradition, they have also been argued to be a related but distinct offshoot, incorporating elements of rhythm and metre that are in direct conflict with the conventions of unrhymed alliterative verse.<ref name=weiskott103/>\n\nThe surviving stanzaic alliterative poems are generally of northern English provenance; some, such as ''Somer Soneday'' or ''[[The Three Dead Kings]]'', are of very complex form.\n\n==Development of the Revival==\n\nThe dialects shown in the surviving poems often point towards a northern and western provenance. The traditional interpretation of the Revival argues that such verse first began to be produced in the south-west Midlands, perhaps towards the start of the 14th century, and spread gradually northwards and eastwards, eventually becoming limited to the far north and Scotland by the close of the 15th century. This view suggests that the Revival was a largely self-contained movement whose \"contacts with the metropolitan, [[Chaucer]]ian tradition were slight\".<ref name=ttp35>Turville-Petre, T. ''The Alliterative Revival'' Boydell & Brewer, 1977, pp.34-35</ref> The words of the Parson in the prologue to Chaucer's ''[[The Parson's Tale|Parson's Tale]]'', that as a \"Southren man\" he cannot recite alliterative verse - \"I kan nat geeste 'rum, ram, ruf' by lettre\" - have often been taken as supporting evidence that alliterative verse was associated only with the north of the country.<ref name=burrow21>Burrow, ''The Gawain-poet'', 2001, OUP, p.21</ref>\n\nIn more recent years medievalists have begun to challenge the idea that alliterative verse and its \"revival\" was an exclusively regional phenomenon, limited to the north and west of England. Although, as academic Ralph Hanna observes, the records of early alliterative poetry cluster overwhelmingly around the literary communities of [[Worcester]], in the west, and [[York]], in the north, alliterative poetry at least subsequently developed \"as one competing form of a national, not regional, literature\".<ref name=hanna509>Hanna, R. 'Alliterative poetry', in Wallace (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature'', Cambridge: CUP, 2002, p.509</ref> This view interprets alliterative verse as part of the common literary culture of the time: although it was most appreciated in the rural north-west, several poems seem to have a definitely eastern (and in the case of ''The Blacksmiths'', possibly urban) origin. The apparent flowering of the alliterative style in the period may have been due to social changes occurring in the wake of the [[Black Death]], which would have thrown vernacular literary styles into greater prominence, or may simply be the result of the fact that the fifteenth century saw a general uptick in the amount of English-language literature being composed and copied.<ref name=cornelius7>Cornelius, 2017, p.7</ref>\n\nUltimately, changing literary fashions, along with its perhaps old-fashioned and provincial associations, led to the abandonment of the alliterative form. Its use persisted in [[Scotland]] long after it had become a curiosity in an English literary culture totally dominated by the Chaucerian tradition: from 1450 until the following century, every major Scots court poet composed at least one alliterative poem.<ref name=hanna497>Hanna, p.497</ref> It is likely that the move of the court of [[James VI and I]] from [[Edinburgh]] to [[London]] in 1603 finally broke the continuous tradition of alliterative metre: its compositional rules were soon forgotten, following which it became \"as inaccessible as a [[dead language]]\".\n<ref name=cornelius5/>\n\n==Audience and authors==\n\n[[Image:Lady tempt Gawain.jpg|thumb|right|Gawain tempted by Sir Bertilak's wife: an illustration from the manuscript of ''Gawain and the Green Knight''. Several authors of the Alliterative Revival chose to rework [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] stories ]]\n\nThe cultural milieu of the alliterative poets is often described as one more provincial and backward-looking than that of Chaucerian, courtly poetry of the time, with the poems being appreciated by an audience drawn from the [[landed gentry]] of the shires rather than the urban sophisticates of the court. The [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] subjects of many Revival poems have sometimes been taken as evidence of the movement's provincial or antiquarian character or even of nationalism. Most of the authors use language closer to the [[vernacular]], use archaic or dialect terms, and structure their work as if to be read aloud to a mixed group of listeners.<ref name=hanna502>Hanna, p. 502</ref> A more recent interpretation suggests that these qualities are due to alliterative poetry's status as a popular mode closer to the vernacular, or to its tendency to preserve older linguistic forms through poetic formula and convention,<ref name=cornelius6>Cornelius, 2017, p.6</ref> rather than resulting from conscious antiquarianism or cultural [[chauvinism]].\n\nSeveral academics, beginning with James Hulbert, have suggested that the Revival's poets could have had a more noble audience, and were part of a conscious regional identity encouraged by powerful northern and western magnates - the Mortimer [[Earl of March|Earls of March]], the Bohun [[Earl of Hereford|Earls of Hereford]] and the Beauchamp Earls of Warwick - as a political counterweight to the court.<ref name=wurster45>Wurster, J. 'The Audience' in G\u00f6ller (ed.) ''The Alliterative Morte Arthure'', Boydell & Brewer, 1981, p.45</ref> However, as [[Richard II of England]] and [[John of Gaunt]] both had substantial support and connections in the north-west, it is equally possible to argue that the alliterative poets of this period could easily have had courtly connections.\n\nIn comparison to some of the authors of syllabic rhymed verse during this period, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Gower]], and [[John Lydgate]], almost nothing is known about the authors of alliterative poetry. The greatest of them, the [[Gawain Poet]], author of ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'' and ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and that of ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'' are both completely anonymous, though the former has been tentatively identified as a John Massey, member of a [[Cheshire]] landowning family. Even [[William Langland]], the author of the hugely influential ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', has been identified largely through conjecture. The longest poem of the Revival (over 14,000 lines), ''[[The Destruction of Troy]]'', is ascribed to a John Clerk from [[Lancashire]], but little else is known about him. A notable exception to this lack of information is Scottish court poet [[William Dunbar]]; Dunbar generally wrote in syllabic metres, but displays a masterful use of the alliterative line in one poem at the very end of the period.\n\nOne man known to have appreciated alliterative verse during the time it was still being composed was [[Robert Thornton (scribe)|Robert Thornton]], a 15th-century landowner from [[North Yorkshire]]. Thornton's efforts in copying these poems, for the use of himself and his family, resulted in the preservation of several valuable works.\n\n==Chronology==\n\nThe first alliterative poem after the ''Brut'' for which a date can be established is ''[[Wynnere and Wastoure]]'', which from internal evidence is usually dated to around 1352, though the [[Alexander romance#English versions|Alexander A and B fragments]] have been suggested to be as early as 1340. The last, ''[[Scottish Ffielde]]'', was composed in c. 1515. From in between these dates, a number of examples of verse have survived, of which some are listed below:\n\n*c. 1352\n**''[[Wynnere and Wastoure]]'', unrhymed allegorical debate (anonymous; dialect appears to point to a poet from north [[Cheshire]])\n*c. 1360, perhaps revised until the 1390s\n**''[[Piers Plowman]]'', very long allegorical and satirical [[dream vision]] (author conjecturally identified as '''[[William Langland]]''', west or southwest Midland  dialect) \n*c. 1365, though later 14th century also suggested\n** The ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'', unrhymed [[Arthurian romance]] (anonymous; probable dialect of east Midlands)\n*c. 1370\n**''[[The Parlement of the Thre Ages]]'', unrhymed allegorical poem (anonymous, Midland dialect; some commentators have argued it may be written by the author of ''Wynnere and Wastoure'')\n*c. 1380 (works attributed to the [[Gawain Poet]])\n**''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', allegorical poem in rhymed stanza (anonymous; dialect of the [[Gawain Poet]], sometimes identified as a '''John Massey''', is of [[Cheshire]] / [[Staffordshire]])\n**''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', [[Arthurian romance]] in unrhymed stanza with rhymed [[bob and wheel]] (anonymous; generally considered to be the work of the Gawain Poet, above)\n**''[[Cleanness]]'', [[homiletic]] poem in unrhymed verse (anonymous; generally considered to be the work of the Gawain Poet, above)\n**''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', homiletic poem in unrhymed verse (anonymous; generally considered to be the work of the Gawain Poet, above)\n*c. 1385\n**''[[The Destruction of Troy]]'', historical narrative by '''[[John Clerk (poet)|John Clerk]]''' of [[Whalley, Lancashire]]\n*1386\n**''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', saint's life / [[exemplum]] in unrhymed verse (anonymous; similar dialect to Gawain Poet has led to suggestion it may also be by this author)\n*c. 1390\n**''[[Siege of Jerusalem (poem)|The Siege of Jerusalem]]'', historical narrative (anonymous, [[Lancashire]] dialect; may borrow from ''Destruction of Troy'')\n**''[[The Pistel of Swete Susan]]'', biblical story in thirteen-line stanza (anonymous, south [[Yorkshire]] dialect; sometimes attributed to a \"[[Huchoun]]\", or \"Hugh\")\n*c. 1400\n**''[[The Three Dead Kings]]'', moral poem in thirteen-line stanza that has been called the most technically complex in the language (anonymous; sometimes attributed to '''[[John Audelay]]''')\n**''[[Pater Noster]]'', religious poem in rhymed alliterative stanza (anonymous; also possibly by Audelay)\n*c. 1420\n**''[[The Awntyrs off Arthure]]'', [[Arthurian romance]] in thirteen-line stanza (anonymous; probably written by a native of [[Cumberland]])\n*c. 1425\n**''[[The Blacksmiths (poem)|The Blacksmiths]]'', satirical complaint against the noise made by [[blacksmith]]s (anonymous; East Anglian or even London dialect)\n*c. 1450\n**''[[Buke of the Howlat|The Buke of the Howlat]]'', [[Scotland|Scottish]] allegorical poem in rhymed stanza with irregular alliteration; written by '''[[Richard Holland]]'''\n*c. 1500\n**''[[The Tretis of the Twa Mariit Wemen and the Wedo]]'', satirical ''[[chanson d'aventure]]'' in unrhymed long line; written by Scottish poet '''[[William Dunbar]]''' \n*c. 1515\n**''[[Scottish Ffielde]]''; anonymous poem about the [[Battle of Flodden]], composed for the  [[Earl of Derby|Stanley family]].\n\nSome elements of the alliterative technique survived in Scotland until the late 16th century, appearing in ''The Flyting Betwixt Montgomerie and Polwart'' dated around 1580.<ref name=ttp118>Turville-Petre, p.118</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Middle English literature]]\n", "text_old": "The '''Alliterative Revival''' is a term adopted by academics to refer to the resurgence of poetry using the [[alliterative verse]] form in [[Middle English]] between c. 1350 and 1500.

'The Shape of the B-Verse in Middle English Alliterative Poetry', ''Speculum'', 61 (1986), 564</ref> While Old English poetry generally employed a clear syntactic break in the middle of the line, in Middle English the line is generally a complete syntactic unit: some poets composed sentences extending over several lines.<ref name=turville53>Turville-Petre, T. ''The Alliterative Revival'', Boydell & Brewer, 1977, p.53</ref> An example of this style is shown by a few lines from ''Wynnere and Wastoure'':\n\n:Whylome were '''l'''ordes in '''l'''onde that '''l'''oved in thaire hertis\n:To here '''m'''akers of '''m'''yrthes that '''m'''atirs couthe fynde,\n:And now es no '''f'''renchipe in '''f'''ere bot '''f'''ayntnesse of hert,\n:'''W'''yse '''w'''ordes withinn that '''w'''roghte were never,\n:Ne '''r'''edde in no '''r'''omance that ever '''r'''enke herde.(19-23)\n\nThere has been much debate on the subject of how lines containing more than two alliterating syllables before the medial pause, which are common in verse of the Revival, should be read.<ref name=turville54>Turville-Petre, T, 1977, p.54</ref> While some scholars have described these additional syllables as a \"minor chief syllable\" or as having \"secondary stress\", they have also been interpreted as not altering the four-stress pattern while still contributing to the effect of the line.<ref name=turville55>Turville-Petre, 1977, p.55</ref> Some of the most recent analysis proposes that the traditional four-stress model of both Old English and Middle English alliterative verse is a \"misapprehension\"<ref name=cornelius4>Cornelius, 2017, pp.4-5</ref> and that a focus on other apparent rules clarifies the evolution of the form, with Layamon's ''Brut'' emerging as a key text in the development of alliterative verse.<ref name=cornelius4/>\n\n===Stanzaic poems===\n\nA second type of verse combining rhymed [[stanza]]s, usually of thirteen or occasionally fourteen lines, with the basic four-stress line also appeared during the Revival: it appears to have been a new development of the 14th century.<ref name=weiskott103>Weiskott, ''English Alliterative Verse'', 2016, CUP, pp.103-4</ref> Here the alliteration may often follow the pattern ''aa / aa'', ''ax / aa'', or even ''aa / bb'', though lines with four alliterating words are much more common than in verse using the unrhymed long line.\n\nMirroring uncertainty over the evolution of alliterative verse in general, it is still uncertain as to whether this tradition developed from the unrhymed alliterative template or from rhymed verse forms on which the traditional alliterative stave was superimposed. While the poems in the thirteen-line stanza have generally been considered a part of the alliterative tradition, they have also been argued to be a related but distinct offshoot, incorporating elements of rhythm and metre that are in direct conflict with the conventions of unrhymed alliterative verse.<ref name=weiskott103/>\n\nThe surviving stanzaic alliterative poems are generally of northern English provenance; some, such as ''Somer Soneday'' or ''[[The Three Dead Kings]]'', are of very complex form.\n\n==Development of the Revival==\n\nThe dialects shown in the surviving poems often point towards a northern and western provenance. The traditional interpretation of the Revival argues that such verse first began to be produced in the south-west Midlands, perhaps towards the start of the 14th century, and spread gradually northwards and eastwards, eventually becoming limited to the far north and Scotland by the close of the 15th century. This view suggests that the Revival was a largely self-contained movement whose \"contacts with the metropolitan, [[Chaucer]]ian tradition were slight\".<ref name=ttp35>Turville-Petre, T. ''The Alliterative Revival'' Boydell & Brewer, 1977, pp.34-35</ref> The words of the Parson in the prologue to Chaucer's ''[[The Parson's Tale|Parson's Tale]]'', that as a \"Southren man\" he cannot recite alliterative verse - \"I kan nat geeste 'rum, ram, ruf' by lettre\" - have often been taken as supporting evidence that alliterative verse was associated only with the north of the country.<ref name=burrow21>Burrow, ''The Gawain-poet'', 2001, OUP, p.21</ref>\n\nIn more recent years medievalists have begun to challenge the idea that alliterative verse and its \"revival\" was an exclusively regional phenomenon, limited to the north and west of England. Although, as academic Ralph Hanna observes, the records of early alliterative poetry cluster overwhelmingly around the literary communities of [[Worcester]], in the west, and [[York]], in the north, alliterative poetry at least subsequently developed \"as one competing form of a national, not regional, literature\".<ref name=hanna509>Hanna, R. 'Alliterative poetry', in Wallace (ed.) ''The Cambridge History of Medieval English Literature'', Cambridge: CUP, 2002, p.509</ref> This view interprets alliterative verse as part of the common literary culture of the time: although it was most appreciated in the rural north-west, several poems seem to have a definitely eastern (and in the case of ''The Blacksmiths'', possibly urban) origin. The apparent flowering of the alliterative style in the period may have been due to social changes occurring in the wake of the [[Black Death]], which would have thrown vernacular literary styles into greater prominence, or may simply be the result of the fact that the fifteenth century saw a general uptick in the amount of English-language literature being composed and copied.<ref name=cornelius7>Cornelius, 2017, p.7</ref>\n\nUltimately, changing literary fashions, along with its perhaps old-fashioned and provincial associations, led to the abandonment of the alliterative form. Its use persisted in [[Scotland]] long after it had become a curiosity in an English literary culture totally dominated by the Chaucerian tradition: from 1450 until the following century, every major Scots court poet composed at least one alliterative poem.<ref name=hanna497>Hanna, p.497</ref> It is likely that the move of the court of [[James VI and I]] from [[Edinburgh]] to [[London]] in 1603 finally broke the continuous tradition of alliterative metre: its compositional rules were soon forgotten, following which it became \"as inaccessible as a [[dead language]]\".\n<ref name=cornelius5/>\n\n==Audience and authors==\n\n[[Image:Lady tempt Gawain.jpg|thumb|right|Gawain tempted by Sir Bertilak's wife: an illustration from the manuscript of ''Gawain and the Green Knight''. Several authors of the Alliterative Revival chose to rework [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] stories ]]\n\nThe cultural milieu of the alliterative poets is often described as one more provincial and backward-looking than that of Chaucerian, courtly poetry of the time, with the poems being appreciated by an audience drawn from the [[landed gentry]] of the shires rather than the urban sophisticates of the court. The [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] subjects of many Revival poems have sometimes been taken as evidence of the movement's provincial or antiquarian character or even of nationalism. Most of the authors use language closer to the [[vernacular]], use archaic or dialect terms, and structure their work as if to be read aloud to a mixed group of listeners.<ref name=hanna502>Hanna, p. 502</ref> A more recent interpretation suggests that these qualities are due to alliterative poetry's status as a popular mode closer to the vernacular, or to its tendency to preserve older linguistic forms through poetic formula and convention,<ref name=cornelius6>Cornelius, 2017, p.6</ref> rather than resulting from conscious antiquarianism or cultural [[chauvinism]].\n\nSeveral academics, beginning with James Hulbert, have suggested that the Revival's poets could have had a more noble audience, and were part of a conscious regional identity encouraged by powerful northern and western magnates - the Mortimer [[Earl of March|Earls of March]], the Bohun [[Earl of Hereford|Earls of Hereford]] and the Beauchamp Earls of Warwick - as a political counterweight to the court.<ref name=wurster45>Wurster, J. 'The Audience' in G\u00f6ller (ed.) ''The Alliterative Morte Arthure'', Boydell & Brewer, 1981, p.45</ref> However, as [[Richard II of England]] and [[John of Gaunt]] both had substantial support and connections in the north-west, it is equally possible to argue that the alliterative poets of this period could easily have had courtly connections.\n\nIn comparison to some of the authors of syllabic rhymed verse during this period, such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], [[John Gower]], and [[John Lydgate]], almost nothing is known about the authors of alliterative poetry. The greatest of them, the [[Gawain Poet]], author of ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'' and ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', and that of ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'' are both completely anonymous, though the former has been tentatively identified as a John Massey, member of a [[Cheshire]] landowning family. Even [[William Langland]], the author of the hugely influential ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', has been identified largely through conjecture. The longest poem of the Revival (over 14,000 lines), ''[[The Destruction of Troy]]'', is ascribed to a John Clerk from [[Lancashire]], but little else is known about him. A notable exception to this lack of information is Scottish court poet [[William Dunbar]]; Dunbar generally wrote in syllabic metres, but displays a masterful use of the alliterative line in one poem at the very end of the period.\n\nOne man known to have appreciated alliterative verse during the time it was still being composed was [[Robert Thornton (scribe)|Robert Thornton]], a 15th-century landowner from [[North Yorkshire]]. Thornton's efforts in copying these poems, for the use of himself and his family, resulted in the preservation of several valuable works.\n\n==Chronology==\n\nThe first alliterative poem after the ''Brut'' for which a date can be established is ''[[Wynnere and Wastoure]]'', which from internal evidence is usually dated to around 1352, though the [[Alexander romance#English versions|Alexander A and B fragments]] have been suggested to be as early as 1340. The last, ''[[Scottish Ffielde]]'', was composed in c. 1515. From in between these dates, a number of examples of verse have survived, of which some are listed below:\n\n*c. 1352\n**''[[Wynnere and Wastoure]]'', unrhymed allegorical debate (anonymous; dialect appears to point to a poet from north [[Cheshire]])\n*c. 1360, perhaps revised until the 1390s\n**''[[Piers Plowman]]'', very long allegorical and satirical [[dream vision]] (author conjecturally identified as '''[[William Langland]]''', west or southwest Midland  dialect) \n*c. 1365, though later 14th century also suggested\n** The ''[[Alliterative Morte Arthure]]'', unrhymed [[Arthurian romance]] (anonymous; probable dialect of east Midlands)\n*c. 1370\n**''[[The Parlement of the Thre Ages]]'', unrhymed allegorical poem (anonymous, Midland dialect; some commentators have argued it may be written by the author of ''Wynnere and Wastoure'')\n*c. 1380 (works attributed to the [[Gawain Poet]])\n**''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', allegorical poem in rhymed stanza (anonymous; dialect of the [[Gawain Poet]], sometimes identified as a '''John Massey''', is of [[Cheshire]] / [[Staffordshire]])\n**''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'', [[Arthurian romance]] in unrhymed stanza with rhymed [[bob and wheel]] (anonymous; generally considered to be the work of the Gawain Poet, above)\n**''[[Cleanness]]'', [[homiletic]] poem in unrhymed verse (anonymous; generally considered to be the work of the Gawain Poet, above)\n**''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', homiletic poem in unrhymed verse (anonymous; generally considered to be the work of the Gawain Poet, above)\n*c. 1385\n**''[[The Destruction of Troy]]'', historical narrative by '''[[John Clerk (poet)|John Clerk]]''' of [[Whalley, Lancashire]]\n*1386\n**''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', saint's life / [[exemplum]] in unrhymed verse (anonymous; similar dialect to Gawain Poet has led to suggestion it may also be by this author)\n*c. 1390\n**''[[Siege of Jerusalem (poem)|The Siege of Jerusalem]]'', historical narrative (anonymous, [[Lancashire]] dialect; may borrow from ''Destruction of Troy'')\n**''[[The Pistel of Swete Susan]]'', biblical story in thirteen-line stanza (anonymous, south [[Yorkshire]] dialect; sometimes attributed to a \"[[Huchoun]]\", or \"Hugh\")\n*c. 1400\n**''[[The Three Dead Kings]]'', moral poem in thirteen-line stanza that has been called the most technically complex in the language (anonymous; sometimes attributed to '''[[John Audelay]]''')\n**''[[Pater Noster]]'', religious poem in rhymed alliterative stanza (anonymous; also possibly by Audelay)\n*c. 1420\n**''[[The Awntyrs off Arthure]]'', [[Arthurian romance]] in thirteen-line stanza (anonymous; probably written by a native of [[Cumberland]])\n*c. 1425\n**''[[The Blacksmiths (poem)|The Blacksmiths]]'', satirical complaint against the noise made by [[blacksmith]]s (anonymous; East Anglian or even London dialect)\n*c. 1450\n**''[[Buke of the Howlat|The Buke of the Howlat]]'', [[Scotland|Scottish]] allegorical poem in rhymed stanza with irregular alliteration; written by '''[[Richard Holland]]'''\n*c. 1500\n**''[[The Tretis of the Twa Mariit Wemen and the Wedo]]'', satirical ''[[chanson d'aventure]]'' in unrhymed long line; written by Scottish poet '''[[William Dunbar]]''' \n*c. 1515\n**''[[Scottish Ffielde]]''; anonymous poem about the [[Battle of Flodden]], composed for the  [[Earl of Derby|Stanley family]].\n\nSome elements of the alliterative technique survived in Scotland until the late 16th century, appearing in ''The Flyting Betwixt Montgomerie and Polwart'' dated around 1580.<ref name=ttp118>Turville-Petre, p.118</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Middle English literature]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Allierative->Alliterative -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_Revival"}

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh. In 1999 MdHS sent the journal to the Center for Conservation in Philadelphia where it was rebound, deacidified, and given full conservation treatment.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219030526/http://www.mdhs.org/underbelly/2014/02/06/the-dreams-of-benjamin-banneker/|archivedate=2018-02-19}}<br>(2) {{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302003904/http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|archivedate=March 2, 2020|url=http://m60006.eos-intl.net/M60006/OPAC/Details/Record.aspx?SearchType=1&BibCode=MM60006%7C9682055%7C15%7C9318734|title=Banneker Astronomical Journal, 1781; 1790-1802; 1806.|work=[[Maryland Historical Society#Library|H.

Jefferson appointed Andrew Ellicott to conduct the survey; Ellicott made Banneker his assistant for three months in 1791. Benjamin Rush authored the Department of Peace proposal; the confusion arose among earlier biographers because the proposal appeared in Banneker's 1793 almanac.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20171226172141/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 7.] \"The name of Benjamin Banneker, the Afro-American self-taught mathematician and almanac-maker, occurs again and again in the several published accounts of the survey of Washington City begun in 1791, but with conflicting reports of the role which he played. Writers have implied a wide range of involvement, from the keeper of horses or supervisor of the woodcutters, to the full responsibility of not only the survey of the ten mile square but the design of the city as well. None of these accounts has described the contribution which Banneker actually made.\"<br>(2) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/126 Bedini, 1971, p. 126.] \"Benjamin Banneker's name does not appear on any of the contemporary documents or records relating to the selection, planning, and survey of the City of Washington.  An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection. Equally untrue are legends that Thomas Jefferson as Secretary of State invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.  Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital had not yet been built, and there was no White House.\"<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 136.] \"Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred some time late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

The King made Ellen transfer Boller (and Rosenvold) to her sole child and daughter Kirsten Munk in 1630.\nThe so-called \"Legitimised Line\" is an unnecessary creation, suggesting that it was illegitimate before;\nit was begun by the Boller-descendant Holger Rosenkrantz (1599-1634 Venlo), who was a soldier in Danish and Dutch service and apparently had been abroad for so long that no one remembered him so that his sons Ludvig (fief baron of Rosendal in 1678) and Maximilian (at Nyboellegaard) had to prove that Holger's father was Frederick Rosenkrantz (1571-1602 Moravia!) of the Boller line. \n\n===Line III: Arreskov===\nThe Arreskov line descends from the Boller line [[Faaborg Municipality|Faaborg]] on [[Funen]], when in 1558 Erik Rosnkrantz (1520 - 1575) married the heiress of Arreskov: Helvig Jacobsdatter Hardenberg (1540 - 1599). \n\n===Line IV: Rosenholm===\nThe Rosenholm line also descends from the Boller line and consists of descendants of J\u00f8rgen Ottesen Rosenkrantz at Rosenholm (1523 - 1596). This line became extinct in the paternal line in 1802 with the death of [[Frederik Christian Rosenkrantz (1724-1802)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=   http://runeberg.org/dbl/14/0213.html |title=  Rosenkrantz, Frederik Christian, 1724-1802|publisher =   \nDansk biografisk Lexikon |author=    Carl Frederik Bricka |accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Line V: Villestrup (baronial)===\nThe baronial line of Villestrup, a side line of line IV.

This line was founded by Holger Rosenkrantz (1645-1704). Niels Rosenkrantz (1757-1824) of the Brusgaard line had inherited Barritskov from Staatsminister Frederik Christian ROSENKRANTZ   (Barritskov estate near  [[Hedensted]] in [[Region Midtjylland|Midtjylland]], according to whose will it was transferred to the Rosenkrantz family estate. The line became extinct in 1838 with Marcus Gi\u00f8e Rosenkrantz (1762\u20131838).<ref>{{cite web|url=       http://www.danskeherregaarde.dk/27396.aspx |title=  Barritskov \n|publisher =   Danske Herregaarde |accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://snl.no/Marcus_Gj%C3%B8e_Rosenkrantz  |title=  Marcus Gj\u00f8e Rosenkrantz|publisher =   Store norske leksikon |author=    Knut D\u00f8rum|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Line VII: Rydhave===\nRydhave near [[Vinderup]]  in [[Jutland]]descends from Stensballegaard, which in around 1440 descended from Hevringholm.

Among his descendants were Holger Axelsen Rosenkrantz (1586-1647) of [[Glimmingehus]] etc. and Palle Rosenkrantz (1587-1642) of [[Krenkerup]] on [[Lolland]], Noerregaard and Rosenlund.

Oerup was inherited by his son Boerge (died 1614). The family remained on the \u00d8rup estate after [[Sk\u00e5ne]] in 1660 was ceded to [[Sweden]]. Holger Rosenkrantz (1688\u20131758) was in 1752 naturalized as Swedish nobleman under the surname Rosencrantz. They seem to have held Oerup until 1840, the line continuing at least until the end of the 20th century\n<ref>{{cite web|url=    http://runeberg.org/nfcn/0113.html |title=  \u00d6rup  |publisher =Nordisk familjebok |accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Line X: Newer Scanian line===\nThe newer Scanian line, which emanated from line IX in the beginning of the 18th century.

Parts of the tower date back to the 1270s, but have been rebuilt several times. Erik Ottesen Rosenkrantz (1519-1575) was governor of [[Bergenhus Fortress]] from 1560 to 1568. In  1562, Rosenkrantz decided to build a combined defense and residence  tower with five floors and facade towards [[Bryggen]]. The work was carried out by Scottish masons and the finished building had many common features with fortified Scottish towers of the time period. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=      https://lokalhistoriewiki.no/index.php/Rosenkrantzt%C3%A5rnet |title=  Rosenkrantzt\u00e5rnet|publisher =   lokalhistoriewiki.no|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=   https://snl.no/Rosenkrantzt%C3%A5rnet |title=  Rosenkrantzt\u00e5rnet|publisher =   Store norske leksikon|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Erik_Ottesen_Rosenkrantz |title=  Erik Ottesen Rosenkrantz|publisher =   Store norske leksikon |author=   Erik Opsahl|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Barony of Rosendal===\n{{main article|Barony Rosendal}}\n[[File:Rosehagen.jpg|Rose Garden at Rosendal|thumb|250px]]\n\nThe history of Rosendal dates back to the 1650s, when [[Ludwig Holgersen Rosenkrantz]] (1628\u20131685) came to Bergen as commissioner of war for the Danish king. At a ball at the fortress of Bergenhus, he met [[Karen Axelsdatter Mowat]] (1630\u20131675), sole heiress to the largest fortune in the country at the time. Her father [[Axel Mowat]] (1592\u20131661) was a great land-owner, and had more than 550 farms all over Western Norway. They married in 1658, and were subsequently given the farm Hatteberg in [[Rosendal, Norway|Rosendal]] in [[Kvinnherad]] as a wedding present. In 1661, [[Ludwig Rosenkrantz]] started building his own manor at Rosendal. He completed this in 1665. In 1678, King [[Christian V of Denmark]] gave the estate the status of Barony of Rosendal (''Baroniet Rosendal''). It was and remained the only fief barony in Norway.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=     https://nbl.snl.no/Ludvig_Rosenkrantz_Til_Rosendal |title=  Ludvig Rosenkrantz Til Rosendal|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon |author=   Anders Bjarne Fossen|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=      https://nbl.snl.no/Karen_Mowat |title=  Karen Mowat|publisher =   Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=   Anders Bjarne Fossen|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=     https://nbl.snl.no/Axel_Mowat_Til_Hovland |title=  Axel Mowat Til Hovland|publisher =  Norsk biografisk leksikon |author=    Anders Bjarne Fossen |accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=    https://snl.no/Baroniet_Rosendal |title=  Baroniet Rosendal\n|publisher =  Store norske leksikon  |author=    Jon Gunnar Arntzen|accessdate= July 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Ludvig_Holgersen_Rosenkrantz.jpg|Baron [[Ludvig Holgersen Rosenkrantz]]\nFile:Karen_Mowat.jpg|Baroness [[Karen Mowat|Karen Rosenkrantz]], n\u00e9e Mowat\nFile:Rosenkrantz_of_Rosendal.jpg|Coat of arms of the Baron of Rosendal\nFile:Rosenkrantz v\u00e5ben.JPG|Coat of arms of Iver Rosenkrantz (born 1674) \nFile:Anna Beate Rosenkrantz' v\u00e5ben.jpg|Coat of arms of Anne Beate Rosenkrantz  (1707\u20131777) \n</gallery>\n\n==Name==\n''Rosenkrantz'' can be translated as  ''rose wreath''  or ''rosary''.

Above the helm and the wreath of roses, there is ''a peacock feather between two buffalo horns having four ditto feathers each''. The horns are divided into silver and pattern, and pattern and red, respectively. The oldest known illustration of the standard arms is found in the [[Gelre Armorial]] of the 14th century.\n==See also==\n* [[Rosenkrantz]]\n* [[Danish nobility]]\n* [[Norwegian nobility]]\n* [[Swedish nobility]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{commons category|Rosenkrantz family}}\n\n==Literature and sources==\n* Wikipedia, Danish: [[:da:Rosenkrantz|Rosenkrantz]] (Per 11 April 2011.)\n* Wikipedia, Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l & Riksm\u00e5l: [[:no:Rosenkrantz|Rosenkrantz]] (Per 11 April 2011.)\n* Wikipedia, Norwegian Bokm\u00e5l & Riksm\u00e5l: [[:no:Baroniet Rosendal|Baroniet Rosendal]] (Per 11 April 2011.)\n* Wikipedia, English: [[Barony Rosendal]] (Per 11 April 2011.)\n==External links==\n*[http://www.histos.no/bergen/?show=story&id=50& Rosenkrantzt\u00e5rnet] \n*[http://www.baroniet.no/en/ Baroniet Rosendal]\n[[Category:Danish noble families]]\n[[Category:Norwegian noble families]]\n[[Category:Swedish noble families]]\n", "name_user": "Westfalr3", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:add a xref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenkrantz_(noble_family)"}
