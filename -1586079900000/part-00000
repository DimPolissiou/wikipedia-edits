Lin ''et al.'' mimicked these bulges by adding and deleting bases from the sgRNA sequence such that a base deletion in the sgRNA would yield an RNA bulge and a base insertion would yield a DNA bulge.<ref name=\"Lin_2014\" /> By studying the mutation rates via NHEJ, they came to the following results:\n* In case of pure DNA bulges, the mutations were well tolerated (i.e. Cas9 cleavage activity was still prevalent). The regions of bulge tolerance included seven bases from the PAM and the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the seed sequence. This resulted in similar or slightly higher (in some cases) mutations as compared to zero bulges.\n* In case of purely RNA bulges, higher Cas9 activity was induced at many positions as compared to DNA bulges. This characteristic was attributed to the fact that RNA is more flexible than DNA and thus has a smaller binding penalty with RNA bulge resulting in a higher tolerance and higher off target mutations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|last=Alberts B., Johnson A., Lewis J., Raff M., Roberts K., Walter P.|publisher=New York: Garland Science|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Higher GC content of the sgRNA sequence resulted in a higher tolerance and thus, a higher off target mutation rate.\n* Bulges of 2bp-5bp strikingly were more tolerant and mutation inducing than a single 2bp bulge.\n\n== Improvements ==\n[[File:Crispr3.jpg|thumb|upright=3|Visual depiction of CRISPR-cas9 using a wild-type SpCas9 nuclease]]\n[[File:Engcrispcas9.jpg|thumb|upright=3|CRISPR-Cas9 engineering improvements that reduce off-target effects through required i) co-localization (Cas9 nickases), and ii) dimerization (Fok1-dCas9)]]\n\n=== Methods to increase specificity ===\nThe widely used ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease is effective, however it induces unwanted off-target mutations at high frequencies. Several engineering and screening methods have been described in an effort to reduce genome-wide off-target mutations including nuclease mutation, [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) sequence modification, [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) truncation and novel nuclease discovery.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadam US, Shelake RM, Chavhan RL, Suprasanna P | year = 2018 | title = Concerns regarding 'off-target' activity of genome editing endonucleases | url = | journal = ant Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 22\u201330 | doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.03.027 | pmid = 29653762 }}</ref> For example, in 2013, Fu ''et al.'' reported that by truncating the gRNA from <20 bp in length to 17 or 18 bp the target specificity of the nuclease increased up to 5,000 fold and mismatch occurrences above 3 bases rarely, if ever occurred.<ref name=\"Fu_2014b\" />\n\n==== Cas9 nickases ====\nThe spCas9 nuclease can also be mutated in a variety of ways to improve specificity and control. Nuclease domains can be mutated independently of each other into what are known as [[Cas9 nickases]]. These nucleases have one active and inactive nuclease domain which result in a complex that performs single strand cleavage.<ref name=\"Cho_2014\" /> Cas9 nickases can be employed in tandem (known as paired nickases), which perform two single strand 'cuts' on alternate strands.<ref name=\"Cho_2014\" /> Using this strategy both Cas9 nickases must co-localize, bind and cleave their target, which drastically reduces the probability of off-target [[indel]]s.<ref name=\"Cho_2014\" /> Also, the DSBs cleaved by paired nickases have long overhangs instead of blunt ends which provide improved control of targeted insertions.\n\n==== Fok1-dCas9 and dimerization nucleases ====\nAs [[monomer]]ic nucleases often involve high levels of off-target effects, [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]] is an attractive strategy. In a dimer system, both nucleases must bind to their individual targets or \u2018half-sites\u2019 and then interact and dimerize to initiate cleavage which greatly decreases the probability of off-target effects. A method that incorporates the reliability of dimerization-dependent [[FokI]] nuclease domains, used in ZFNs and TALENs, with the simplicity of CRISPR-cas9 has been developed.<ref name=\"Tsai_2014b\" /> The FokI nuclease was originally found in ''[[Flavobacterium okeanokoites]]'', and will only cleave DNA given dimerization activation. Basically, the researchers fused this nuclease to a CRISPR complex with an inactive Cas9 nuclease (Fok1-dCas9).<ref name=\"Tsai_2014b\" /> The gRNA directs the CRISPR complex to the target site but the 'cut' is made by dimerized Fok1. It is estimated that the Fok1-dCas9 strategy reduces detectable off-target effects by 10,000 fold, which makes it effective for applications requiring highly precise and specific genome editing.<ref name=\"Tsai_2014b\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wyvekens N, Topkar VV, Khayter C, Joung JK, Tsai SQ | title = Dimeric CRISPR RNA-Guided FokI-dCas9 Nucleases Directed by Truncated gRNAs for Highly Specific Genome Editing | journal = Human Gene Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 425\u201331 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26068112 | pmc = 4509490 | doi = 10.1089/hum.2015.084 }}</ref>\n\n==== Nuclease mutation ====\nIn addition to a gRNA target, Cas9 requires binding to a specific 2-6 nucleotide sequence PAM. In commonly used SpCas9 systems the PAM motif is 5\u2019 NGG 3\u2019, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity limitations as some regions will not have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. The PAM sequence can be edited to non-canonical NAG and NGA motifs which not only improve the specificity but also reduced off-target effects.<ref name=\"Kleinstiver_2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinstiver BP, Prew MS, Tsai SQ, Topkar VV, Nguyen NT, Zheng Z, Gonzales AP, Li Z, Peterson RT, Yeh JR, Aryee MJ, Joung JK | title = Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with altered PAM specificities | journal = Nature | volume = 523 | issue = 7561 | pages = 481\u20135 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26098369 | pmc = 4540238 | doi = 10.1038/nature14592 }}</ref> A [[D1135E mutant]] appears to alter PAM specificities.

Currently there are plenty of biased and unbiased methods for such a screen and only two ''in vitro'' methods. All of these are listed below:\n\n=== Targeted, exome, and whole genome sequencing ===\n\nIn case of normal targeted sequencing, the biased approach will yield results only for the intended area of capture, which hinders the search as no unexpected mutations will come up on the screen. While it is easy and cheap, it becomes time consuming and expensive once more target sites are added. [[Exome sequencing]] utilizes exome capture to acquire the protein coding regions of the genome. It is unbiased, however, it will not yield off target mutations in the non-coding region of the genome. In case of [[whole genome sequencing]], the entire genome is screened for off target mutations. Currently, this method is expensive and like exome sequencing, whole genome also requires a reference genome to make inferences.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zischewski J, Fischer R, Bortesi L | title = Detection of on-target and off-target mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and other sequence-specific nucleases | journal = Biotechnology Advances | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 95\u2013104 | pmid = 28011075 | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.12.003 | year = 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== BLESS ===\n[[File:Methods_of_detecting_off_target_mutations.jpg|thumb|upright=3|An overview of different methods for detection of off target mutations by genome editing.

Being unbiased in nature, BLESS gives information about site of mutation within the genome rather than the proteins involved or associated with the DSBs. However, BLESS can only detect mutations at the time of experiment and not the ones which were formed earlier and were repaired.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai SQ, Joung JK | title = Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 300\u201312 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27087594 | doi = 10.1038/nrg.2016.28 }}</ref>\n\n=== LAM-HTGTS ===\n\nLinear Amplification Mediated - High Throughput Genome Wide Translocation Sequencing, or LAM-HTGTS, is a method developed to track translocation events caused by joining between DSBs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mallin H, Hestericov\u00e1 M, Reuter R, Ward TR | title = Library design and screening protocol for artificial metalloenzymes based on the biotin-streptavidin technology | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 835\u201352 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27031496 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2016.019 }}</ref> Developed to detect off-target mutations from TALEN and CRISPR-Cas9, this technique is based on DNA repair by end joining in DSBs. Once the nuclease is added, it goes on to produce on- and off-target mutations. Along with this there is a bait sequence which also gets cleaved. Therefore, if another DSB occurs on a chromosome other than the bait sequence chromosome, both of them are joined leading to a translocation. Since the bait sequence is known, this translocated sequence is amplified with primers. In case there is no translocation, there is a restriction site within which gets cleaved in order to prevent amplification of only the bait sequence. The amplified DNA is then sequenced to study large genomic rearrangements due to off-target mutations. One drawback is that it relies on simultaneous presence of bait and another DSB.\n\n=== GUIDE-Seq ===\n\nAnother approach to find off-target mutations due to nuclease activity is the [[GUIDE-Seq]] method. GUIDE-seq or Genome Wide Unbiased Identification of DsBs Enables by Sequencing is based on the incorporation of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) into DSBs via NHEJ. Its amplification is followed by sequencing. Since two primers will be used to sequence the dsODNs, the regions flanking the DSB along with the DSB will be amplified. Thus allowing mapping the off target mutation. This technique has been applied to identify all previously known off-target sites as well as new ones with frequencies as low as 0.03%. Just like BLESS, however, GUIDE-seq can only detect DSBs present at the time of study.\n\n=== Digenome-Seq ===\n\nOne of the current ''in vitro'' methods, Digenome-Seq utilizes Cas9's property of cleaving the genome to get an unbiased profile of the entire genome. In this method, Cas9 is added to gDNA and the after effects are studied using high-throughput sequencing. Since the fragments are formed due to the same nuclease, the ends of these fragments can be mapped aligned. Two big advantages are that it can be used to study up to 10 gRNAs at once and can identify targets to frequencies as low as 0.01%.<ref name=\"Kim_2015\"/> The main advantage, however, is that this method is ''in vitro'' i.e. the DSBs introduced by Cas9 will not be processed by the DNA repair machinery (unlike BLESS and GUIDE-seq) and thus will include all possible off target mutants. However, it might lead to large number of false positives as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu BX, St Onge RP, Fire AZ, Smith JD | title = Distinct patterns of Cas9 mismatch tolerance in vitro and in vivo | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 5365\u201377 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27198218 | pmc = 4914125 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw417 }}</ref>\n\n=== CIRCLE-Seq ===\n\nThe latest addition to the ''in vitro'' methods in detecting off target mutations is CIRCLE-seq.

On cleavage, the target DNA forms a stem loop to which adaptors can be added for sequencing. While this proved possible, the other possibility yielded a fold high difference in detection/. In the second case, the sequence is cleaved using Cas9 and when it is cleaved again at the half site, a circular cut is available(which is the reason for the name CIRCLE-seq). Nearly all sites identified by circularization contain both linear detected sites and newer ones suggesting that CIRCLE-seq does not bias between breaks and obtains strong low frequency breaks as well. It further helps to sequence the break site from both sides of cleavage as compared to other methods which have only one read side.\n\n== Significance ==\n\n=== Gene therapy ===\nIn order for gene editing technologies to make the leap towards safe and widespread use in the clinic, the rate of off-target modification needs to be rendered obsolete. The safety of gene therapy treatment is of utmost concern, especially during clinical trials when off-target modifications can block the further development of a candidate product.<ref name=\"Gautron_2017\" /> Perhaps the most well-known example of modern gene therapy is CAR-T therapy, which is used for the treatment of [[B-cell lymphoma]]. To limit the rate of off-target cleavage, the therapy uses a highly specific and finely tuned TALEN, which has proven to have little-to-no background off-target interaction.<ref name=\"Gautron_2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gautron AS, Juillerat A, Guyot V, Filhol JM, Dessez E, Duclert A, Duchateau P, Poirot L | title = Fine and Predictable Tuning of TALEN Gene Editing Targeting for Improved T Cell Adoptive Immunotherapy | journal = Molecular Therapy.

This strategy, known as a homing drive, can suppress a population by affecting a critical gene or inducing recessive sterility. However, if such a system were released into the wild, the CRISPR-cas9 system would remain function indefinitely. With every subsequent generation, off-target mutations would become increasingly likely and the effects of these mutations on a species would be stochastic. Off-target mutations could disable the suppressive qualities of a gene drive while maintaining the endonuclease expression. In such a situation there would be an increased risk of gene flow between the target species and other species likely leading to undesired outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Webber BL, Raghu S, Edwards OR | title = Opinion: Is CRISPR-based gene drive a biocontrol silver bullet or global conservation threat? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 34 | pages = 10565\u20137 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26272924 | pmc = 4553820 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1514258112 }}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe increased use of genome editing and its eventual translation towards clinical use has evoked controversy surrounding the true off-target burden of the technologies.\n\n=== Schaefer ''et al.'' 2017 ===\nOn May 30, 2017 a two-page correspondence article was published in Nature Methods that reported an unusually high number of off-target [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNV]]s and indels after sequencing mice that were previously involved in an ''[[in vivo]]'' gene repair experiment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer KA, Wu WH, Colgan DF, Tsang SH, Bassuk AG, Mahajan VB | title = Unexpected mutations after CRISPR-Cas9 editing in vivo | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 547\u2013548 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28557981 | pmc = 5796662 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.4293 }}</ref> The previous experiment, completed by the same group, successfully restored the vision of blind mouse strain (''rd1'') by correcting the Y347X mutation in the ''[[PDE6B|Pde6b]]'' gene using a CRISPR-cas9 system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WH, Tsai YT, Justus S, Lee TT, Zhang L, Lin CS, Bassuk AG, Mahajan VB, Tsang SH | title = CRISPR Repair Reveals Causative Mutation in a Preclinical Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1388\u201394 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27203441 | pmc = 5023380 | doi = 10.1038/mt.2016.107 }}</ref> After completing the experiment two genetically corrected mice were whole genome sequenced and compared to control and known mouse strain genomes.

The regions of bulge tolerance included seven bases from the PAM and the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends of the seed sequence. This resulted in similar or slightly higher (in some cases) mutations as compared to zero bulges.\n* In case of purely RNA bulges, higher Cas9 activity was induced at many positions as compared to DNA bulges. This characteristic was attributed to the fact that RNA is more flexible than DNA and thus has a smaller binding penalty with RNA bulge resulting in a higher tolerance and higher off target mutations.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell|last=Alberts B., Johnson A., Lewis J., Raff M., Roberts K., Walter P.|publisher=New York: Garland Science|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Higher GC content of the sgRNA sequence resulted in a higher tolerance and thus, a higher off target mutation rate.\n* Bulges of 2bp-5bp strikingly were more tolerant and mutation inducing than a single 2bp bulge.\n\n== Improvements ==\n[[File:Crispr3.jpg|thumb|upright=3|Visual depiction of CRISPR-cas9 using a wild-type SpCas9 nuclease]]\n[[File:Engcrispcas9.jpg|thumb|upright=3|CRISPR-Cas9 engineering improvements that reduce off-target effects through required i) co-localization (Cas9 nickases), and ii) dimerization (Fok1-dCas9)]]\n\n=== Methods to increase specificity ===\nThe widely used ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' Cas9 (SpCas9) nuclease is effective, however it induces unwanted off-target mutations at high frequencies. Several engineering and screening methods have been described in an effort to reduce genome-wide off-target mutations including nuclease mutation, [[protospacer adjacent motif]] (PAM) sequence modification, [[guide RNA]] (gRNA) truncation and novel nuclease discovery<ref>Kadam US, Shelake RM, Chavhan RL, Suprasanna P (October 2018). \"Concerns regarding 'off-target' activity of genome editing endonucleases\". Plant Physiology and Biochemistry. 131: 22\u201330. doi: [http://10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.03.027 10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.03.027]. {{PMID|29653762}}\" </ref>. For example, in 2013, Fu ''et al.'' reported that by truncating the gRNA from <20 bp in length to 17 or 18 bp the target specificity of the nuclease increased up to 5,000 fold and mismatch occurrences above 3 bases rarely, if ever occurred.<ref name=\"Fu_2014b\" />\n\n==== Cas9 nickases ====\nThe spCas9 nuclease can also be mutated in a variety of ways to improve specificity and control. Nuclease domains can be mutated independently of each other into what are known as [[Cas9 nickases]]. These nucleases have one active and inactive nuclease domain which result in a complex that performs single strand cleavage.<ref name=\"Cho_2014\" /> Cas9 nickases can be employed in tandem (known as paired nickases), which perform two single strand 'cuts' on alternate strands.<ref name=\"Cho_2014\" /> Using this strategy both Cas9 nickases must co-localize, bind and cleave their target, which drastically reduces the probability of off-target [[indel]]s.<ref name=\"Cho_2014\" /> Also, the DSBs cleaved by paired nickases have long overhangs instead of blunt ends which provide improved control of targeted insertions.\n\n==== Fok1-dCas9 and dimerization nucleases ====\nAs [[monomer]]ic nucleases often involve high levels of off-target effects, [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]] is an attractive strategy. In a dimer system, both nucleases must bind to their individual targets or \u2018half-sites\u2019 and then interact and dimerize to initiate cleavage which greatly decreases the probability of off-target effects. A method that incorporates the reliability of dimerization-dependent [[FokI]] nuclease domains, used in ZFNs and TALENs, with the simplicity of CRISPR-cas9 has been developed.<ref name=\"Tsai_2014b\" /> The FokI nuclease was originally found in ''[[Flavobacterium okeanokoites]]'', and will only cleave DNA given dimerization activation. Basically, the researchers fused this nuclease to a CRISPR complex with an inactive Cas9 nuclease (Fok1-dCas9).<ref name=\"Tsai_2014b\" /> The gRNA directs the CRISPR complex to the target site but the 'cut' is made by dimerized Fok1. It is estimated that the Fok1-dCas9 strategy reduces detectable off-target effects by 10,000 fold, which makes it effective for applications requiring highly precise and specific genome editing.<ref name=\"Tsai_2014b\" /><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wyvekens N, Topkar VV, Khayter C, Joung JK, Tsai SQ | title = Dimeric CRISPR RNA-Guided FokI-dCas9 Nucleases Directed by Truncated gRNAs for Highly Specific Genome Editing | journal = Human Gene Therapy | volume = 26 | issue = 7 | pages = 425\u201331 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26068112 | pmc = 4509490 | doi = 10.1089/hum.2015.084 }}</ref>\n\n==== Nuclease mutation ====\nIn addition to a gRNA target, Cas9 requires binding to a specific 2-6 nucleotide sequence PAM. In commonly used SpCas9 systems the PAM motif is 5\u2019 NGG 3\u2019, where N represents any of the four DNA nucleotides. The requirement of the PAM sequence can cause specificity limitations as some regions will not have an available target sequence to make a desired genetic modification. The PAM sequence can be edited to non-canonical NAG and NGA motifs which not only improve the specificity but also reduced off-target effects.<ref name=\"Kleinstiver_2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kleinstiver BP, Prew MS, Tsai SQ, Topkar VV, Nguyen NT, Zheng Z, Gonzales AP, Li Z, Peterson RT, Yeh JR, Aryee MJ, Joung JK | title = Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with altered PAM specificities | journal = Nature | volume = 523 | issue = 7561 | pages = 481\u20135 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26098369 | pmc = 4540238 | doi = 10.1038/nature14592 }}</ref> A [[D1135E mutant]] appears to alter PAM specificities.

Currently there are plenty of biased and unbiased methods for such a screen and only two ''in vitro'' methods. All of these are listed below:\n\n=== Targeted, exome, and whole genome sequencing ===\n\nIn case of normal targeted sequencing, the biased approach will yield results only for the intended area of capture, which hinders the search as no unexpected mutations will come up on the screen. While it is easy and cheap, it becomes time consuming and expensive once more target sites are added. [[Exome sequencing]] utilizes exome capture to acquire the protein coding regions of the genome. It is unbiased, however, it will not yield off target mutations in the non-coding region of the genome. In case of [[whole genome sequencing]], the entire genome is screened for off target mutations. Currently, this method is expensive and like exome sequencing, whole genome also requires a reference genome to make inferences.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zischewski J, Fischer R, Bortesi L | title = Detection of on-target and off-target mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and other sequence-specific nucleases | journal = Biotechnology Advances | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 95\u2013104 | pmid = 28011075 | doi = 10.1016/j.biotechadv.2016.12.003 | year = 2017 }}</ref>\n\n=== BLESS ===\n[[File:Methods_of_detecting_off_target_mutations.jpg|thumb|upright=3|An overview of different methods for detection of off target mutations by genome editing.

This is followed by separation/collection of said ligated ends using streptavidin.

Being unbiased in nature, BLESS gives information about site of mutation within the genome rather than the proteins involved or associated with the DSBs. However, BLESS can only detect mutations at the time of experiment and not the ones which were formed earlier and were repaired.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsai SQ, Joung JK | title = Defining and improving the genome-wide specificities of CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews.

Once the nuclease is added, it goes on to produce on- and off-target mutations. Along with this there is a bait sequence which also gets cleaved. Therefore, if another DSB occurs on a chromosome other than the bait sequence chromosome, both of them are joined leading to a translocation. Since the bait sequence is known, this translocated sequence is amplified with primers. In case there is no translocation, there is a restriction site within which gets cleaved in order to prevent amplification of only the bait sequence. The amplified DNA is then sequenced to study large genomic rearrangements due to off-target mutations. One drawback is that it relies on simultaneous presence of bait and another DSB.\n\n=== GUIDE-Seq ===\n\nAnother approach to find off-target mutations due to nuclease activity is the [[GUIDE-Seq]] method. GUIDE-seq or Genome Wide Unbiased Identification of DsBs Enables by Sequencing is based on the incorporation of double stranded oligodeoxynucleotides (dsODN) into DSBs via NHEJ. Its amplification is followed by sequencing. Since two primers will be used to sequence the dsODNs, the regions flanking the DSB along with the DSB will be amplified. Thus allowing mapping the off target mutation. This technique has been applied to identify all previously known off-target sites as well as new ones with frequencies as low as 0.03%. Just like BLESS, however, GUIDE-seq can only detect DSBs present at the time of study.\n\n=== Digenome-Seq ===\n\nOne of the current ''in vitro'' methods, Digenome-Seq utilizes Cas9's property of cleaving the genome to get an unbiased profile of the entire genome. In this method, Cas9 is added to gDNA and the after effects are studied using high-throughput sequencing. Since the fragments are formed due to the same nuclease, the ends of these fragments can be mapped aligned. Two big advantages are that it can be used to study up to 10 gRNAs at once and can identify targets to frequencies as low as 0.01%.<ref name=\"Kim_2015\"/> The main advantage, however, is that this method is ''in vitro'' i.e. the DSBs introduced by Cas9 will not be processed by the DNA repair machinery (unlike BLESS and GUIDE-seq) and thus will include all possible off target mutants. However, it might lead to large number of false positives as well.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu BX, St Onge RP, Fire AZ, Smith JD | title = Distinct patterns of Cas9 mismatch tolerance in vitro and in vivo | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 44 | issue = 11 | pages = 5365\u201377 | date = June 2016 | pmid = 27198218 | pmc = 4914125 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkw417 }}</ref>\n\n=== CIRCLE-Seq ===\n\nThe latest addition to the ''in vitro'' methods in detecting off target mutations is CIRCLE-seq.

On cleavage, the target DNA forms a stem loop to which adaptors can be added for sequencing. While this proved possible, the other possibility yielded a fold high difference in detection/. In the second case, the sequence is cleaved using Cas9 and when it is cleaved again at the half site, a circular cut is available(which is the reason for the name CIRCLE-seq). Nearly all sites identified by circularization contain both linear detected sites and newer ones suggesting that CIRCLE-seq does not bias between breaks and obtains strong low frequency breaks as well. It further helps to sequence the break site from both sides of cleavage as compared to other methods which have only one read side.\n\n== Significance ==\n\n=== Gene therapy ===\nIn order for gene editing technologies to make the leap towards safe and widespread use in the clinic, the rate of off-target modification needs to be rendered obsolete. The safety of gene therapy treatment is of utmost concern, especially during clinical trials when off-target modifications can block the further development of a candidate product.<ref name=\"Gautron_2017\" /> Perhaps the most well-known example of modern gene therapy is CAR-T therapy, which is used for the treatment of [[B-cell lymphoma]]. To limit the rate of off-target cleavage, the therapy uses a highly specific and finely tuned TALEN, which has proven to have little-to-no background off-target interaction.<ref name=\"Gautron_2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gautron AS, Juillerat A, Guyot V, Filhol JM, Dessez E, Duclert A, Duchateau P, Poirot L | title = Fine and Predictable Tuning of TALEN Gene Editing Targeting for Improved T Cell Adoptive Immunotherapy | journal = Molecular Therapy.

This strategy, known as a homing drive, can suppress a population by affecting a critical gene or inducing recessive sterility. However, if such a system were released into the wild, the CRISPR-cas9 system would remain function indefinitely. With every subsequent generation, off-target mutations would become increasingly likely and the effects of these mutations on a species would be stochastic. Off-target mutations could disable the suppressive qualities of a gene drive while maintaining the endonuclease expression. In such a situation there would be an increased risk of gene flow between the target species and other species likely leading to undesired outcomes.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Webber BL, Raghu S, Edwards OR | title = Opinion: Is CRISPR-based gene drive a biocontrol silver bullet or global conservation threat? | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 112 | issue = 34 | pages = 10565\u20137 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26272924 | pmc = 4553820 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1514258112 }}</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe increased use of genome editing and its eventual translation towards clinical use has evoked controversy surrounding the true off-target burden of the technologies.\n\n=== Schaefer ''et al.'' 2017 ===\nOn May 30, 2017 a two-page correspondence article was published in Nature Methods that reported an unusually high number of off-target [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNV]]s and indels after sequencing mice that were previously involved in an ''[[in vivo]]'' gene repair experiment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schaefer KA, Wu WH, Colgan DF, Tsang SH, Bassuk AG, Mahajan VB | title = Unexpected mutations after CRISPR-Cas9 editing in vivo | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 547\u2013548 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28557981 | pmc = 5796662 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.4293 }}</ref> The previous experiment, completed by the same group, successfully restored the vision of blind mouse strain (''rd1'') by correcting the Y347X mutation in the ''[[PDE6B|Pde6b]]'' gene using a CRISPR-cas9 system.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu WH, Tsai YT, Justus S, Lee TT, Zhang L, Lin CS, Bassuk AG, Mahajan VB, Tsang SH | title = CRISPR Repair Reveals Causative Mutation in a Preclinical Model of Retinitis Pigmentosa | journal = Molecular Therapy | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1388\u201394 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27203441 | pmc = 5023380 | doi = 10.1038/mt.2016.107 }}</ref> After completing the experiment two genetically corrected mice were whole genome sequenced and compared to control and known mouse strain genomes.

Prior to World War II, Kuhn belonged to the [[German minority in Poland]]. His academic work specialized in German minorities outside Germany, particularly in the area of [[Ukraine]], especially [[Volhynia]]. In 1936, Kuhn moved to Germany to take a professorship at the [[University of Breslau]]. In 1940, he joined the [[Nazi party]].{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2005|p=265}} During the war, he was involved as an advisor in various Nazi plans of [[ethnic cleansing]] aimed at Jews, Poles and their replacement by  German settlers from further east. Kuhn continued his academic work post-war in [[West Germany]], becoming a professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] and a recognized expert in the German [[Ostsiedlung]].{{sfn|Angermann}} He retired in 1968, moving to [[Salzburg]], where he died in 1983.

World War II have come under increased scholarly scrutiny since the publication of [[Michael Burleigh]]'s ''Germany Turns Eastward'' (1988).{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|pp=32-33}} Kuhn's pre-war work has been linked to [[anti-Semitism]], [[anti-Slavism]], and the promotion of German superiority.\n\n==Early life and pre-war career==\nKuhn was born in 1903 in the town of Bielitz ([[Bielsko]]) in [[Austrian Silesia]], in a German-speaking enclave surrounded by Polish speakers.{{sfn|Angermann}} Kuhn's parents belonged to the [[Away from Rome!]]-movement and were both supporters of the unification of Austria with Germany.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=34}} As a boy, Kuhn distributed flowers to soldiers guarding against Polish youths who were celebrating the [[Assassination of Franz Ferdinand]], which Michael Burleigh argues shows an early consciousness for national issues.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=105}} After the [[First World War]], this territory was annexed to Poland, confronting Kuhn with the issue of German enclaves in Slavic territory while still young,{{sfn|Angermann}} and Kuhn was, therefore, a Polish citizen in the interwar period.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=78}} Kuhn met several later scholarly collaborators on matters of German minorities in Eastern Europe after joining the [[Wandervogel]] movement in Bielitz in 1919.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=387}} While he initially studied electrical engineering in [[Graz]] till 1927, he later attended universities in [[Vienna]] and [[T\u00fcbingen]].{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=105}}\n\nKuhn began to involved with studying German settlement in Eastern Europe while he was still a student, including undertaking several trips to Poland and [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukraine]] and making several publications.{{sfn|Angermann}} In 1926 Kuhn went to Ukraine ([[Volhynia]]) with several other members from the Wandervogel movement funded by various German agencies where he studied German communities and praised \"the strength and beauty of German [[Volkstum]]\".{{sfn|Wolff|1994|p=336}} While the official purpose of the visit was to study German communities, Michael Burleigh writes that it served mostly to reinforce the participants' notions of German superiority towards Polish people.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=107}} Kuhn wrote five of the eight essays about the expedition that were subsequently published in the journal {{lang|de|Deutsche Bl\u00e4tter in Polen|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Chu|2012|p=109}} Kuhn argued that more recent German enclaves in Eastern Europe, because they felt themselves to be superior to the surrounding Slavs, were less like to intermarry or become \"de-Germanised\", as opposed to older enclaves which were more prone to assimilation.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=106}} Kuhn viewed himself and his colleagues as \"bearers of civilization\" and his goal as \"to transform the instinctive feeling of superiority and pride towards the surrounding peoples (\u2026) into a true national consciousness\".{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=107}} Unlike the formerly Prussian members of the expedition, Kuhn argued that the Volhynian Germans were true Germans and should be allowed to develop on their own under the guidance of more mature linguistic islands, which Winson Chu takes to mean Kuhn's own hometown of Bielitz/Bliesko.{{sfn|Chu|2012|pp=108-110}} Kuhn also secretly worked for the organization {{lang|de|Volksbund f\u00fcr das Deutschtum im Ausland|italics=yes}} to verify the population numbers on the [[German minority in Poland]] given by the Polish government.{{sfn|Haar|2000|p=272}} Kuhn, writing under the pseudonym Andreas M\u00fcckler, claimed in a publication of the Viennese {{lang|de|Institut

his doctoral studies, Kuhn was well known as a scholar of linguistic enclaves.{{sfn|Fielitzh|2008|p=387}} Kuhn received his doctorate in 1931 from the [[University of Vienna]], writing on German linguistic enclaves in Poland.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=105}} Kuhn's first attempt at achieving an academic position was a failure, and he returned to Bielitz,{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2005|p=263}} but Kuhn received a job as an assistant to [[Viktor Kauder]] at the ''Deutsche Kulturbund'' in [[Katowice]] (Kattowitz) in 1932.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|pp=105-106}} He received this job through the help of Otto Ulitz, leader of the German minority in Upper Silesia,{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2005|p=263}} and [[Eduard Pant]], a leading German-Polish politician and member of the [[Sejm]].{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=78}} While

the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi's taking of power]] in 1933.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=40}} Kuhn engaged in many activities in nationalist-conservative and Nazi organizations and participated in numerous Nazi organized conferences.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=42}} Beginning in 1934, Kuhn's work was supported monetarily by {{interlanguage link|Nord- und Ostdeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|de}} (NOFG), a Nazi

He was admitted on February 1, 1940.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=42}} However, in 1941 Kuhn refused to take a position at the [[Reich University of Posen]] (a new German university that replaced the older Polish [[University of Pozna\u0144]]) despite persistent attempts to get him to take the position.{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2005|p=265}} Kuhn himself would later explain his refusal as due to the incompatibility of his research interests with the new position.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=79}}\n\n===Advisor for SS===\n[[Michael Burleigh]] describes Kuhn as one of Nazi ''hack academics'' but also one of the \"finest (historical) minds\" whose expertise was used for ethnic cleansing plans carried by Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=44}}\nIn 1939, Kuhn served as an advisor to the SS for the resettlement of ethnic Germans.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=388}} He returned to German communities in Ukraine to assist in determining their \"racial qualities\" connected to Nazi plans of resettlement; the SS considered his reports in determining which ethnic Germans would be repatriated to Germany.{{sfn|Wolff|1994|p=336}} Kuhn advised the resettlement of German villages as groups to areas of Poland that had similar climatic and soil characteristics to the areas they were taken from, but advised that villages that showed signs of in-breeding, sectarianism, or \"spiritual sickness\" should be broken up.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|pp=177-178}} His other advice was to keep German settlers separated from their non-German farmhands.<ref>Heimat, Region, and Empire: Spatial Identities Under National Socialism  Claus-Christian W. Szejnmann, Maiken Umbach page 150</ref> In practice, the resettlement did not tend to follow Kuhn's suggestions, and regional and social differences between various groups of Polish Germans were ignored.{{sfn|Chu|2012|pp=258-259}}\n\nOn September 29, 1939 Kuhn authored a position paper titled \"German settlement areas beyond the old Reich Borders\" for the German-Soviet Border Commission in which he argued that Germany should annex various areas of Poland that had not belonged to the [[German Empire]] based on their ethnic makeup.{{sfn|Haar|2005|p=14}}{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=176}} On October 11, 1939 the [[Prussian Privy State Archives]] published a memorandum titled \"Germanization of Pozna\u0144 and West Prussia\" ({{lang-de|Eindeutschung Posens und Westpreu\u00dfens|italics=yes}}), authored by several German historians including Walter Kuhn.{{sfn|Haar|2000|p=11}} The memorandum called for the immediate \"resettlement\" ({{lang|de|Umsiedlung|italics=yes}}) of 2.9 million Poles and Jews and their replacement with German settlers \"with a healthy social organization\" ({{lang|de|mit einer gesunden sozialen Ordnung|italics=yes}}), who would maintain the \"national struggle with Polishness\" ({{lang|de|de[r] v\u00f6lkisch[e] Kampf[...] mit dem Polentum|italics=yes}}).{{sfn|Haar|2000|p=11}} The memorandum also called for the \"removal of Jewry\" ({{lang|de|Herausl\u00f6sung des Judentums|italics=yes}}) and of elites, and the \"reduction\" ({{lang|de|Minderung|italics=yes}}) of the total population, in order that the territory could be settled as [[Lebensraum]] by the state.{{sfn|Haar|2000|p=11}} Markus Krzoska characterizes this memorandum as an attempt by scholars such as Kuhn to ingratiate themselves with the Nazi hierarchy responsible for settlement in the occupied territories, as the Nazis relied on the expertise of Kuhn and other [[Ostforschung|Ostforscher]] less and less as the war progressed.{{sfn|Krzoska|2003|p=415}} According to Winston Chu Walter Kuhn was instrumental in making an ethnic argument for Nazi Germany annexing  L\u00f3d\u017a and other parts of Central Poland<ref>German Political Organizations and Regional Particularisms in Interwar Poland (1918-1939)\nWinson W. Chu\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, 2006 page 405</ref>\n\nIn the winter of 1940, Kuhn served as an advisor to the Immigration Headquarters of the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] in Litzmannstadt ([[Lodz]]) for German settlers being resettled out of the Soviet-occupied parts of Poland and the [[General Government]].{{sfn|Michelsen|2003|pp=671-672}} Prior to the resettlement of Germans in these villages and homes, Poles had been deported to the General Government.{{sfn|Burleigh|1992|p=138}} Kuhn also advised on the \"Germanization\" of Slavic groups in Silesia: Kuhn argued that many German-speakers in Silesia were in fact Polish immigrants to the territory who had adopted German and replaced Germans who had moved to the West.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=44}}\n\nKuhn undertook a final trip with a number of students in 1942, to [[Volhynia]], which he had been unable to visit in the 1930s.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=388}}\n\n===Military service===\nIn 1943 he was conscripted into the Wehrmacht and was captured by the British in 1944.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=388}} He remained a prisoner until 1947; according to Kuhn, this was because as the British sent him to a re-education camp.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=79}}\n\n==Postwar career in West Germany==\nKuhn was released from British captivity in 1947.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=388}} Kuhn's wife had fled from Breslau (now [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland) to Magdeburg, but had not brought any of Kuhn's manuscripts, notes, or books with her.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=79}} Kuhn briefly considered emigrating to Chicago in the United States due to financial troubles before Hermann Aubin arranged for him to take a temporary teaching position at the [[University of Hamburg]] that same year.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|pp=247-248}} Although before World War II Kuhn had belonged to a network of German folklorists from Bielitz (Bielsko), he was the only one of them to be able to continue his academic career after the war.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|pp=50-51}} The German linguistic enclaves that Kuhn had studied before the war had been destroyed by the resettlement policy of the Nazis and the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944\u20131950)|expulsion of Germans]] from Eastern Europe after World War II, so Kuhn changed his focus to the history of German settlement in the region ([[Ostsiedlung]]).{{sfn|Angermann}}{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=388}} Kuhn's pre-war work came under critical fire, especially from the folklorist [[Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann]], who accused him of ethnocentrism and of deliberately polarizing the differences between Germans and Poles.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=389}} Kuhn's activities advising the SS during the war were not brought up, however.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=389}} Kuhn himself never acknowledged any wrongdoing, instead bemoaning the loss of his wartime work and framing himself as a victim.{{sfn|Demshuk|2012|pp=71-72}}\n\nIn 1955, Kuhn became professor for the history of German settlement and folklore at the University of Hamburg,{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=389}} a position that was specifically created for him by Hermann Aubin.{{sfn|Michelsen|2003|p=676}} While Kuhn initially focused on German settlement in the modern period, following publications in the mid 1950s, he came to focus more on medieval German settlement, particularly in Silesia and Poland.{{sfn|Angermann}}  Kuhn went on to advise many dissertations, including after his retirement in 1968,{{sfn|Angermann}}{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|pp=79-80}} and frequently functioned as a reviewer of Polish-language scholarly works.{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=632}} He was also involved in various scholarly organisations and received various honors.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|p=389}} He was the head of the {{interlanguage link| Kommission f\u00fcr die Geschichte der Deutschen in Polen|de}} from 1952 until 1964.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=75}} Kuhn retired to Salzburg, where he continued to publish numerous scholarly works.{{sfn|Angermann}} [[Norbert Angermann]] identifies him as \"the most significant historian of the German Ostsieldung\" ({{lang|de|\"bedeutendster Historiker der deutschen Ostsiedlung\"}}) in the period before his death in 1983.{{sfn|Angermann}} Kuhn's connections to National Socialism before and during World War II would not become a topic of discussion until 1988, when [[Michael Burleigh]] published ''Germany Turns Eastward'' (1988).{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|pp=32-33}}\n\n==Scholarly appraisals and reception==\n===Pre-war work===\nWriting in 2010, the Polish scholar Dariusz Chrobak characterizes Kuhn as a \"pioneer\" who founded the study of German linguistic enclaves.{{sfn|Chrobak|2010|p=257}} Referring to the acceptance of Kuhn and Alfred Karasek as scholars after the war, Winson Chu writes \"[t]hat their works remained respectable in the post-1945 period is in part due to the fact that they focused less on the highly politicized and revisionist goals of the interwar period than on broader v\u00f6lkisch und ethnographic concepts.\"{{sfn|Chu|2012|p=174}} Wilhelm Fielitz argues that Kuhn's pre-war work shows [[Social Darwinism|Social Darwin]]ist, ethnocentric tendencies, although he also used modern field-work techniques.{{sfn|Fielitz|2008|pp=387-388}} Alexander Pinwnkler writes that Kuhn's work approached the Nazi concept of a utopian \"racially pure\" state.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=18}} Matthias Weber, Hans Hennig Hahn, and Kurt Dr\u00f6ge write that Kuhn's work on linguistic enclaves was particularly apt to support concepts of imperialistic aggression.{{sfn|Weber|Hahn|Dr\u00f6ge|1999}} His works from this period are described by Zdzis\u0142aw G\u0119bo\u0142y\u015b as belonging to genre that was one-sided favouring the German point of view, were tendentious and often used simplifications.<ref>Biblioteki mniejszo\u015bci niemieckiej w II Rzeczypospolitej  Zdzis\u0142aw G\u0119bo\u0142y\u015b, Uniwersytet \u015al\u0105ski, Katowice 2014, page 33</ref> While former Nazi {{interlanguage link|Gotthold Rhode|de}} argued that no one could find any nationalism in Kuhn's writings from this time and defended Kuhn's focus on German linguistic enclaves as part of the spirit of the time,{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=630}} Christian L\u00fcbke noted a strong similarity the vocabulary of Nazi propaganda and the vocabulary of Kuhn and other contemporary German scholars engaged in studying Eastern Europe: as a specific example, L\u00fcbke notes that Kuhn published an article in 1939 in which he wrote about the \"vital force inherent in German culture in the East\" at a moment in which according to him Germans were engaged in \"ethnic struggle\".{{sfn|L\u00fcbke|2017|p=175}} [[Norbert Angermann]], however, argues that Kuhn's pre-war work was not influenced by the racial theories of the Nazis.{{sfn|Angermann}}\n\nKuhn's focus on linguistic enclaves had mostly been replaced by inter-ethnic studies by 1970, largely through the work of folklorist [[Ingeborg Weber-Kellermann]] and historian [[Walter Schlesinger]].{{sfn|Weber|Hahn|Dr\u00f6ge|1999}}{{sfn|Kalinke|2015}} {{interlanguage link|Hugo Weczerka|de}}, a former of student of Kuhn from Hamburg,{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=75}} writes that Kuhn's pre-war work remains useful in its collection of facts, but less so in their systematic comprehension of the situation of linguistic enclaves.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|pp=80-81}} Although works such as Kuhn's continue to provide the fullest accounts of German minority populations in areas such as [[Volhynia]], Heinke Kalinke writes that their use today \"requires especially careful source criticism and contextualization in academic history\" (\"{{lang|de|bedarf [...] besonders sorgf\u00e4ltiger Quellenkritik und wissenschaftsgeschichtlicher Kontextualisierung|italics=yes}}\").{{sfn|Kalinke|2015}}\n\n===Post-war work===\n====Contemporary reviews====\nKuhn's post-war work was mostly positively reviewed in his lifetime, but received some criticism, particularly from scholars in Poland.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|pp=81-82}} Kuhn's first post-war publication, {{lang|de|Siedlungsgeschichte Oberschlesiens|italics=yes}} (1954) received positive reviews by Gotthold Rhode and John Leighly. Rhode describes Kuhn's engagement and scholarly knowledge as \"masterful\" (\"{{lang|de|meisterhaft|italics=yes}}\") and praises his knowledge of Polish scholarship.{{sfn|Rhode|1956|pp=178-179}} Leighly states that Kuhn's work \"is likely to remain for a long time the best source of information on both the history and geography of settlement in Upper Silesia.\"{{sfn|Leighly|1956|p=437}} A more critical review comes from Stephen Borsody, who while acknowledging Kun's \"outstanding job of research\", his \"great thoroughness\" and diligence,{{sfn|Borsody|1956|p=563}} states that Kuhn's work \"is written in protest against the expulsion of the Germans from Upper Silesia,\"{{sfn|Borsody|1956|p=563}} and that Kuhn makes \"nonchalant comments on the Hitler era.\"{{sfn|Borsody|1956|pp=564-564}} Borsody criticizes Kuhn's thesis that Germans brought Silesia into Western Civilization for Kuhn's failure to separate the history of Germans in Silesia from the Third Reich, or to condemn its atrocities.{{sfn|Borsody|1956|p=564}}\n\nKuhn's two-volume {{lang|de|Geschichte der deutschen Ostsiedlung in der Ostsiedlung in der Neuzeit|italics=yes}} (1955 and 1957) received extremely positive reviews from Rhode, Hans Mortensen, and Hans Linde. Rhode states that Kuhn's monograph will become the standard work on the subject,{{sfn|Rhode|1958|p=296}} while Mortensen says that science owes Kuhn a special thanks for his work,{{sfn|Mortensen|1956|p=265}} and hopes for a third volume.{{sfn|Mortensen|1961|p=530}} Linde states \"[i]t is not likely that this exposition will ever be superseded\"{{sfn|Linde|1958|p=349}} and that \"the evidence is here presented in a dispassionate and objective manner which excludes any kind of polemic.\"{{sfn|Linde|1958|p=350}} {{interlanguage link|Herbert Schlenger|de}} praised Kuhn's synthesis and the work's maps while nevertheless criticizing Kuhn's attempt to connect German settlement with that of other Western Europeans.{{sfn|Schlenger|1957|pp=273-276}}{{sfn|Schlenger|1959|pp=562-563}} Former Nazi Rhode claimed that despite many criticisms of this same work, the Polish historian [[Gerard Labuda]] stated he had to bow his head to Kuhn's achievement.{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=631}} {{interlanguage link|Georges Livet|fr}}, while acknowledging several interesting aspects of the work, criticizes Kuhn's tendency toward conclusions that are \"flattering to national self-esteem\",{{sfn|Livet|1957|p=145}} and Kuhn's decision to selectively cite Polish and Baltic historians without engaging critically with them.{{sfn|Livet|1966|pp=195-196}} {{interlanguage link|Fran\u00e7ois-Georges Dreyfus|fr}} similarly, while calling the book important, criticized that it seems to have been written \"to the greater glory of Germany.\"{{sfn|Dreyfus|1959|p=807}} J\u00f3zef Kokot and Andrzej Bro\u017cek describe Walter Kuhn as one of \"nationalist Ostforscher\" who \"nourish old myths and falsifications\" with Kuhn engaging in myth making about supposed \"cultural mission\" of German colonization in the east.<ref>J\u00f3zef Kokot, Andrzej Bro\u017cek\nZak\u0142ad Narodowy im.

Kossmann expresses his hope that Kuhn's work could lead to greater cooperation between German and Polish scholars.{{sfn|Kossmann|1969|p=700}} However, the author{{Who|date=August 2019}} of a review of Kuhn's atlas \"\"Die mittelalterliche deutsche Ostsiedlung\", in Putzger{{clarify|date=August 2019}} states that it is a typical example of biased interpratation of historical events for use of political propaganda with the aim of giving Germans \"moral right\" to take over and Germanize territories of other nations, including Poland.<ref>Kwartalnik historyczny, Tom 84,Wydania 1-2 page 425 Towarzystwo Historyczne, 1977</ref>\n\nBoth J\u00fcrgen Petersohn and {{interlanguage link|Karl Bosl|de}} gave Kuhn's essay collection {{lang|de|Vergleichende Untersuchungen zur mittelalterlichen Ostsiedlung|italics=yes}} (1973) very positive reviews.{{sfn|Petersohn|1977|pp=109-110}}{{sfn|Bosl|1982|pp=190193}} In his review of Kuhn's history of Bielitz (1981), G\u00fcnther St\u00f6kl calls the work the \"crowning achievement of [Kuhn's] rich life's work\".{{sfn|St\u00f6kl|1982|p=622}} Kuhn's posthumously published essay collection {{lang|de|Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur schlesischen Siedlungsgeschichte|italic=yes}} (1984) received positive reviews from [[Heinrich Appelt]] and {{interlanguage link|Peter Hilsch|de}}, both of whom were pleased that the collection included Kuhn's biographical writings.{{sfn|Hilsch|1987|pp=118-119}}{{sfn|Appelt|1985|p=493}}\n\n====Retrospective reviews====\nWriting retrospectively, Norbert Angermann writes that Kuhn always strove to be objective in his work, despite his emotional attachment to the subject.{{sfn|Angermann}} {{interlanguage link|Gotthold Rhode|de}}, writing at Kuhn's death in 1983, praises Kuhn for writing knowledgeable and incisive reviews of Polish scholars in particular,{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=632}} while referring to Kuhn as \"the most important and most knowledgable representative\" of scholarship on German minorities in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=631}} {{interlanguage link|Hugo Weczerka|de}}, Kuhn's former student at Hamburg,{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=75}} writes that Kuhn's work on the ''Ostsiedlung'' is \"of lasting value\" ({{lang|de|von bleibendem Wert|italics=yes}}), and he notes the positive reception of Kuhn's work in countries besides Germany, including, \"with certain, to some extent justified qualifications\" ({{lang|de|mit gewissen, z.T. berechtigten Einschr\u00e4nkungen|italics=yes}}) in Poland.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=81}} Weczerka nevertheless criticizes Kuhn's fixation on {{lang|de|Deutschtum|italic=yes}} (\"German national traditions\") to the exclusion of the people surrounding German settlers and enclaves and notes that not everyone could agree to some of Kuhn's conclusions.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|pp=81-82}} As a specific example, Weczerka notes that one of Kuhn's maps in the {{lang|de|Atlas zur Geschichte der deutschen Ostsiedlung|italic=yes}} (1958, edited by Wilfried Krallert) depicted the [[Masurians]], [[Kashubians]], [[Sorbs]], and Upper Silesians as \"groups that according to language and feeling of belonging have become German\"  ({{lang|de|Nach Sprache und Zugeh\u00f6rigkeitsgef\u00fchl deutsch gewordene Gruppen|italics=yes}}).{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=82}} Holocaust scholars [[Deb\u00f3rah Dwork]] and [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] refer to Kuhn as representative of \"first-rate German historians\".

Prior to World War II, Kuhn belonged to the [[German minority in Poland]]. His academic work specialized in German minorities outside Germany, particularly in the area of [[Ukraine]], especially [[Volhynia]]. In 1936, Kuhn moved to Germany to take a professorship at the [[University of Breslau]]. In 1940, he joined the [[Nazi party]].{{sfn|M\u00fchle|2005|p=265}} During the war, he was involved as an advisor in various Nazi plans of [[ethnic cleansing]] aimed at Jews, Poles and their replacement by  German settlers from further east. Kuhn continued his academic work post-war in [[West Germany]], becoming a professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] and a recognized expert in the German [[Ostsiedlung]].{{sfn|Angermann}} He retired in 1968, moving to [[Salzburg]], where he died in 1983. Kuhn's post-war work was internationally recognized, but received some criticism from Polish scholars in particular.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|pp=81-82}}<ref>\"Kuhns siedlungshistorische Erkenntnisse haben nicht nur in Deutschland Anerkennung gefunden, sondern - mit gewissen, z.T. berechtigten Einschr\u00e4nkungen auch in Polen. Man war sogar in westlichen L\u00e4ndern wie Irland und Kanada aus komparativen Gr\u00fcnden an Kuhns \"Geschichte der deutschen Ostsiedlung in der Neuzeit\" interessiert, und Charles Higounet aus Bordeaux, der als Gastprofessor in Hamburg weilte und sich mit Walter Kuhn anfreundete, dankte im Vorwort seines Buches \"Die deutsche Ostsiedlung im Mittelalter (1986) Kuhn f\u00fcr die Vermittlung neuer Einsichten.\"{{harvnb|Weczerka|2001|pp=81-82}}</ref>\n\nAlthough they were largely ignored or denied in the post-war period, Kuhn's close connections to National Socialism before and during World War II have come under increased scholarly scrutiny since the publication of [[Michael Burleigh]]'s ''Germany Turns Eastward'' (1988).{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|pp=32-33}} Kuhn's pre-war work has been linked to [[anti-Semitism]], [[anti-Slavism]], and the promotion of German superiority.\n\n==Early life and pre-war career==\nKuhn was born in 1903 in the town of Bielitz ([[Bielsko]]) in [[Austrian Silesia]], in a German-speaking enclave surrounded by Polish speakers.{{sfn|Angermann}} Kuhn's parents belonged to the [[Away from Rome!]]-movement and were both supporters of the unification of Austria with Germany.{{sfn|Pinwinkler|2009|p=34}} As a boy, Kuhn distributed flowers to soldiers guarding against Polish youths who were celebrating the [[Assassination of Franz

Kuhn with the issue of German enclaves in Slavic territory while still young,{{sfn|Angermann}} and Kuhn was, therefore, a Polish citizen in the interwar period.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=78}} Kuhn met

communities and praised \"the strength and beauty of German [[Volkstum]]\".{{sfn|Wolff|1994|p=336}} While the official purpose of the visit was to study German communities, Michael Burleigh writes that it served mostly to reinforce the participants' notions of German superiority towards Polish people.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=107}} Kuhn wrote five of the eight essays about the expedition that were subsequently published in the journal {{lang|de|Deutsche Bl\u00e4tter in Polen|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Chu|2012|p=109}} Kuhn argued that more recent German enclaves in Eastern Europe, because they felt themselves to be superior to the surrounding Slavs, were less like to intermarry or become \"de-Germanised\", as opposed to older enclaves which were more prone to assimilation.{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=106}} Kuhn viewed himself and his colleagues as \"bearers of civilization\" and his goal as \"to transform the instinctive feeling of superiority and pride towards the surrounding peoples (\u2026) into a true national consciousness\".{{sfn|Burleigh|1988|p=107}} Unlike the formerly Prussian members of the expedition, Kuhn argued that the Volhynian Germans were true Germans and should be allowed to develop on their own under the guidance of more mature linguistic islands, which Winson Chu takes to mean Kuhn's own hometown of Bielitz/Bliesko.{{sfn|Chu|2012|pp=108-110}} Kuhn also secretly worked for the organization {{lang|de|Volksbund f\u00fcr das Deutschtum im Ausland|italics=yes}} to verify the population numbers on the

the vocabulary of Kuhn and other contemporary German scholars engaged in studying Eastern Europe: as a specific example, L\u00fcbke notes that Kuhn published an article in 1939 in which he wrote about the \"vital force inherent in German culture in the East\" at a moment in which according to him Germans were engaged in \"ethnic struggle\".{{sfn|L\u00fcbke|2017|p=175}} [[Norbert Angermann]], however, argues that Kuhn's pre-war work was not influenced by the racial theories of the Nazis.{{sfn|Angermann}}\n\nKuhn's focus on linguistic enclaves had mostly been replaced by inter-ethnic

Kossmann expresses his hope that Kuhn's work could lead to greater cooperation between German and Polish scholars.{{sfn|Kossmann|1969|p=700}} However, the author{{Who|date=August 2019}} of a review of Kuhn's atlas \"\"Die mittelalterliche deutsche Ostsiedlung\", in Putzger{{clarify|date=August 2019}} states that it is a typical example of biased interpratation of historical events for use of political propaganda with the aim of giving Germans \"moral right\" to take over and Germanize territories of other nations, including Poland.<ref>Kwartalnik historyczny, Tom 84,Wydania 1-2 page 425 Towarzystwo Historyczne, 1977</ref>\n\nBoth J\u00fcrgen Petersohn and {{interlanguage link|Karl Bosl|de}} gave Kuhn's essay collection {{lang|de|Vergleichende Untersuchungen zur mittelalterlichen Ostsiedlung|italics=yes}} (1973) very positive reviews.{{sfn|Petersohn|1977|pp=109-110}}{{sfn|Bosl|1982|pp=190193}} In his review of Kuhn's history of Bielitz (1981), G\u00fcnther St\u00f6kl calls the work the \"crowning achievement of [Kuhn's] rich life's work\".{{sfn|St\u00f6kl|1982|p=622}} Kuhn's posthumously published published essay collection {{lang|de|Neue Beitr\u00e4ge zur schlesischen Siedlungsgeschichte|italic=yes}} (1984) received positive reviews from [[Heinrich Appelt]] and {{interlanguage link|Peter Hilsch|de}}, both of whom were pleased that the collection included Kuhn's biographical writings.{{sfn|Hilsch|1987|pp=118-119}}{{sfn|Appelt|1985|p=493}}\n\n====Retrospective reviews====\nWriting retrospectively, Norbert Angermann writes that Kuhn always strove to be objective in his work, despite his emotional attachment to the subject.{{sfn|Angermann}} {{interlanguage link|Gotthold Rhode|de}}, writing at Kuhn's death in 1983, praises Kuhn for writing knowledgeable and incisive reviews of Polish scholars in particular,{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=632}} while referring to Kuhn as \"the most important and most knowledgable representative\" of scholarship on German minorities in Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Rhode|1983|p=631}} {{interlanguage link|Hugo Weczerka|de}}, Kuhn's former student at Hamburg,{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=75}} writes that Kuhn's work on the ''Ostsiedlung'' is \"of lasting value\" ({{lang|de|von bleibendem Wert|italics=yes}}), and he notes the positive reception of Kuhn's work in countries besides Germany, including, \"with certain, to some extent justified qualifications\" ({{lang|de|mit gewissen, z.T. berechtigten Einschr\u00e4nkungen|italics=yes}}) in Poland.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=81}} Weczerka nevertheless criticizes Kuhn's fixation on {{lang|de|Deutschtum|italic=yes}} (\"German national traditions\") to the exclusion of the people surrounding German settlers and enclaves and notes that not everyone could agree to some of Kuhn's conclusions.{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|pp=81-82}} As a specific example, Weczerka notes that one of Kuhn's maps in the {{lang|de|Atlas zur Geschichte der deutschen Ostsiedlung|italic=yes}} (1958, edited by Wilfried Krallert) depicted the [[Masurians]], [[Kashubians]], [[Sorbs]], and Upper Silesians as \"groups that according to language and feeling of belonging have become German\"  ({{lang|de|Nach Sprache und Zugeh\u00f6rigkeitsgef\u00fchl deutsch gewordene Gruppen|italics=yes}}).{{sfn|Weczerka|2001|p=82}} Holocaust scholars [[Deb\u00f3rah Dwork]] and [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] refer to Kuhn as representative of \"first-rate German historians\".
