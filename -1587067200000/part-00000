Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, a litter of one to four kittens is born. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats (such as the small, spotted cats in the [[genus]] ''[[Leopardus]]'') in its external appearance. In fact, the jaguarundi shows several features seen in [[mustelid]]s (such as [[otter]]s and [[weasel]]s)\u2014it has an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014gray and red.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. The jaguarundi is an efficient climber, but typically prefers hunting on ground. It feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, [[rodent]]s and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens.

Individuals in captivity have been found to be more gregarious.<ref name=WCoW/> [[Home range]]s tend to be large; a study in Brazil recorded home ranges {{convert|1.4|\u2013|18|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size for females, while those of males measured {{convert|8.5|\u2013|25.3|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in area.<ref name=Hunter/> Two males in Belize were recorded to have exceptionally large home ranges spanning an area of {{convert|88|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|sqkm|sqmi}}, while the home range of a female in the same region measured {{convert|13|\u2013|20|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.<ref name=Nowak/> Population densities are typically low, around {{convert|0.01|to|0.05|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}, though the Llanos in Costa Rica and Venezuela have recorded figures as high as {{convert|0.2|/sqkm|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=bellani/>\n\nMarking behavior could serve as a means of olfactory or visual communication; individuals in captivity have been observed scraping areas with their hind feet (sometimes with urination), clawing on logs, rubbing objects with their heads and leaving feces uncovered. Social behavior such as grooming, growling and sniffing has been recorded. The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Jaguarundis will also take larger prey such as domestic poultry, fish, [[marmoset]]s, rabbits and [[opossum]]s; a study recorded small deer (possibly [[carrion]]) in the diet.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. It can also occur in [[cloud forest]]s, [[mangrove]]s and [[savanna]]s.<ref name=iucn/><ref name=ceballos/> Unlike the [[Sympatry|sympatric]] [[margay]], [[ocelot]] and [[oncilla]], the jaguarundi can occur in open areas as well. In open habitats the jaguarundi prefers areas with vegetative cover such as cacti, which would generally be difficult for possible predators to penetrate; there may be a few clearings at the periphery of such areas.

The cathedrals are notable particularly for their great height, and their extensive use of [[stained glass]] to fill the interiors with light.  They were the tallest and largest buildings of their time, and the most prominent examples of [[Gothic architecture]]. The appearance of the Gothic Cathedral was not only a revolution in architecture;  it also introduced new forms in decoration, sculpture, and art.\n\n[[Cathedrals]] were by definition churches where a [[bishop]] presided.  Abbeys were the churches attached to monasteries.  Many smaller [[parish]] churches were also built in the Gothic style. The appearance of the great cathedrals in the 12th century was a response to the dramatic increase of population and wealth in some parts of Europe, and the need for larger and more imposing buildings.  Technical advances, such an innovative uses of the  [[pointed arch]], [[rib vault]] and [[flying buttress]], allowed the churches and cathedral to become much  taller, stronger, with larger windows and more light.\n\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France at the  [[Abbey of Saint Denis]], near Paris, with the rebuilding of the ambulatory and west facade  of the Abbey church by the Abbot [[Suger]] (1135\u201340).<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\">Renault and Laz\u00e9, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobile'' (2006), p. 36</ref>\nThe first Gothic cathedral, [[Sens Cathedral]] in France  was begun between 1135 and 1140, and consecrated in 1164.  \n\nThe style quickly appeared in England, where it was called simply \"The French style.\"   The Choir of [[Canterbury Cathedral]] was destroyed by fire, and was rebuilt by a French master builder from Sens,   [[William of Sens]] between 1174 and 1184.     Other elements of the style were imported from [[Caen]] in Normandy by French Norman architects, who also brought finely-cut stones from Normandy for their construction. \n\n[[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame Cathedral]] was begun in 1163, and consecrated in 1177.<ref name=\"Laz\u00e9, 2006 p. 36\"/>  The later part of the 12th century and beginning of the 13th century saw a more refined style, characterised by [[Chartres Cathedral]], [[Reims Cathedral]], and [[Amiens Cathedral]].  A third period, called ''Rayonnante'' in France, more highly decorated, as characterized by [[Sainte Chapelle]] (1241-1248) and [[Amiens Cathedral]] in France.  The fourth and final period, called ''Flamboyante'', appeared in the second half of the 14th century, taking its name from the flamelike motifs of decoration.  [[Sainte-Chapelle de Vincennes]] (1370), with its walls of stained glass, is a good example.\n\nRenaissance cathedrals and churches gradually replaced Gothic cathedrals, and the original cathedrals, such as Notre Dame, experienced many modifications or fell into ruin.   However, in the mid-19th century, in large part due to the novel '''Notre Dame de Paris'''  by  [[Victor Hugo]], a wave of new interest, appeared, and many Gothic cathedrals and churches were restored, with greater or more imaginative accuracy. i\n\n==Name==\nThe term [[cathedral]] came from the Greek ''cathedra'', or \"seat\", since it was the official seat of the Bishop, or ''Eveque'', and the principal church of the [[diocese]].   His title came from the Greek term ''Episkopos'', or \"he who sees.\"  As the leader of the [[diocese]]. The Bishop was considered the direct descendant of the [[Apostles]] or disciples of Christ, and had three missions: to direct the affairs of the church within the diocese, to administer the sacraments, and teach the [[Gospels]], or the message of Christ. The Bishop of a cathedral was assisted by the [[Canons]], or ''Chanoines' in French,   who formed a council called the Chapter.<ref>Mignon, Olivier, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drales Gothiques'', (2015), pg. 4</ref>\n\nAt its time, it was called \"The French Style\"   The term \"Gothic\" was a very negative term invented in the late Renaissance by its critics, including the art historian and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].  They considered the style was barbaric, the opposite of the new Renaissance style that they favored.\n\n==History==\n==Mid-12th century  - early Gothic==\n===Abbot Suger and the Basilica of Saint Denis===\n \t\nThe Gothic style first appeared in France in the mid-12th century in an [[Abbey]], [[St Denis Basilica]], built by Abbot [[Suger]] (1081-1151).  The old Basilica was the traditional burial place of [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and of the Kings of France, and was also a very popular pilgrimage destination, so much so that pilgrims were sometimes crushed by the crowds.   Suger became the abbot of Saint Denis in 1122.  He became the friend and confident of two French Kings [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] and [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], and  He served the Regent for Louis VII during the absence of the King for the [[Second Crusade]] (1147-49).  \n \t\nSuger, with the full support of the King, decided to enlarge the church and reconstruct it on a new model.  <ref name = universalis>''Dictionnaire des Architectes'', Encyclopedia Universalis (1999), pp. 659-663</ref>   His first modification was a new west facade, inspired in part by new churches is Normandy,  with two towers and three deep portals.   Each of the portals had a [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of sculpture, telling a Biblical or inspiring story.  the tympana installed by Sugar depicted the Last Judgement over the main door and the Martyrdom of Saint Denis over the other door.   The tympana  over the east portals became a characteristic feature of later Gothic cathedrals. <ref>Mignon, ''Architecture des Cath\u00e9drale Gothiques'' (205), p. 9</ref> \n\nWhen the new facade was complete, Suger turned his attention to the choir and the ambulatory in the west of thehe Suger was also a scholar of the philosophy of [[Plato]], and he believed thet light was a way by which the faithful could be elevated from the material to the immaterial and the divine. The ambulatory of old church was very dark, since Romanesque architecture, with barrel vaults,  required thick walls and supporting walls  between the small chapels.  Suger decided to use a new form of vault, the [[rib vault]], with [[Pointed arch|pointed arches]], which was higher and stronger.  This allowed him to remove the walls between the chapels, and opened the space for seventy stained glass windows in the choir, filling the church with light. {{Sfn|Mignon|2015|page=9}} \n\nThe new structure was finished and dedicated on 11 June 1144, in the presence of the King. The choir and west front of the Abbey of Saint-Denis both became the prototypes for further building in the royal domain of northern France and in the Duchy of Normandy. Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>.\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\nFrom the 12th century onwards, Gothic cathedrals and a churches appeared in other regions of France and gradually in the rest Europe.  The plans and ideas were carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities.. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.\n \n\t\nIn [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms. Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and [[spire]]s; spires and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]] sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n \t\nIn [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].\n \t\nIn the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress was rarely used, replaced by heavy [[abutment]]s with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n \t\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. The Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|the basilica of Saint-Sernin]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south, while the old nave of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] (1210\u20131220) gave the model of the single nave which was generally used in Southern French Gothic architecture (although some churches had two or three naves of equal height). Some Gothic cathedrals in the [[Southern France|Midi]] took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282\u20131480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colourful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}} In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ | title=Episcopal City of Albi}}</ref>\n \t\nThe facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.\n\n==Decoration==\n===Painting and sculpture===\n===Stained glass===\n\n==Bibliography==\n===In English===\n* Martindale, Andrew, ''Gothic Art'', (1967), Thames and Hudson (in English and French); {{ISBN|2-87811-058-7}}ad\n* O'Reilly, Elizabeth, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', (1921), Harper Brothers, New York and London.

Through the rule of the [[House of Plantagenet|Angevin dynasty]], the new style was introduced to England and spread throughout France, the [[Low Countries]], Germany, Spain, northern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]].This combination of innovations made Saint-Denis the first important example of Gothic architecture;   The church was heavily modified over the following centuries, but the ambulatory and some other original elements remain.<ref>''Le Guide du Patrimoine en France'', Centre des Monuments National, Paris, 2002. \"The Basilica, along with its ''chevet'', constitutes the first masterpiece of Gothic architecture.\" </ref>\n \t\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:StDenis Chorumgang.JPG|The Gothic ambulatory of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] (1140-1144)\t\nFile:Saint-Denis - Fa\u00e7ade.jpg|The west facade of the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]], after restoration.

Two were built by Suger's personal friends, the bishops of Noyon and Senlis.  The spread of the style was not limited to cathedrals;  it also soon appeared in Abbey churches, at St. Leu d'Esserent in [[Braine]], and, in the province of [[Champagne]], at St. Remy in [[Rheims]] and Notre-Dame in [[Chalons-sur-Marne]].  It also appeared in  simple churches, such as the Gothic church of Saint Quiriace in [[Provins]]  Though each church employed the new style, each had a distinctly different appearance and personality. <ref>O'Reilly, Elizabeth Boyle, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', Chapter III.</ref>     \n\n*'''[[Noyon Cathedral]]''' replaced a Romanesque cathedral which burned in 1131. The Bishop of Noyon, Baudouin, used the choir of Saint Denis as his direct model. He used the same masons as Suger, and much of the ornamentation is identical with Saint-Denis. Like many early Gothic churches, the interior has both round and pointed arches, and it has some peculiar Germanic features, such as transepts with rounded ends.  \n\n*'''[[Sens Cathedral]]''', begun in 1133, had a special place among cathedrals in France as the primate of Gaul, ranking of higher authority than Paris, a title it held down the 16th century. It attracted important medieval religious figures including [[Saint Bernard]], [[Abelard]] and [[Thomas Becket]], who came there in 1164 to appeal the Pope for support against [[Henry II of England]].  It was begun as a Romanesque cathedral, but as the walls were rising, the design was changed to Gothic and the proposed groin vaults replaced by [[rib vault|rib vaults]]. It was completed soon after Saint Denis, and is considered the first Gothic Cathedral in France. <ref>Centre des Monuments Nationaux, ''Le Guide due Patrimoine en France'' (2002), p. 153</ref> \n\n* '''[[Senlis Cathedral]]''' begun in 1152, was another very early Gothic cathedral built on the model of Saint-Denis by Bishop Thibaut, who had been at the deathbed of Suger. One distinctive feature is the sculpture in the central western portal, which depicts the Death of the Virgin Mary and her Assumption on the [[lintel]], and her Coronation in the [[tympanum]].  This arrangement became a common Gothic feature, found at both the north portal of [[Chartres Cathedral]] and the northwest tower of [[Notre Dame de Paris]].   A major fire in 1504 destroyed the upper vaulting of the original cathedral, and now only the apse, the west facade, and the tower have their original appearance; The exterior is now distinctly flamboyant Gothic. <ref>O'Reilly, Chapter III </ref>.\n\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Cath\u00e9drale de Noyon straight.JPG|[[Noyon Cathedral]] (begun about 1150)\nFile:Interior of Cath\u00e9drale Saint-\u00c9tienne de Sens-6974.jpg|Nave of [[Sens Cathedral]] (1140-1164)\nFile:Senlis Cathedral Exterior, Picardy, France - Diliff.jpg| [[Senlis Cathedral]] (1153\u201391): The original 12th-century tower  was crowned with a octagonal tower and spire in the 13th century. \nFile:Laon, Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame PM 14294.jpg|Facade of [[Laon Cathedral]]\n</gallery>\nFrom the 12th century onwards, Gothic cathedrals and a churches appeared in other regions of France and gradually in the rest Europe.  The plans and ideas were carried by the highly skilled craftsmen who had trained in the Ile-de-France and then carried their crafts to other cities.. The style was adapted to local styles and materials.\n \n\t\nIn [[Normandy]], the new naves were usually very long, sometimes more than one hundred meters, and, from the long Romanesque tradition, the walls were thicker than in northern France, and had shorter buttresses. The interiors were narrower than in the north, and were given a strong sense of verticality by long and narrow bays and lancet arches. Rose windows were rare, replaced on the exterior by a large bay in ''tiers point''. The facades had less sculptural decoration; decoration in the interior was largely in geometric forms. Norman Gothic also usually featured a profusion of towers, lanterns and [[spire]]s; spires and [[Fl\u00e8che|spirelets]] sometimes were seventy meters high. [[Bayeux Cathedral]], [[Rouen Cathedral]], and [[Coutances Cathedral]] are notable examples of Norman Gothic.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n \t\nIn [[Burgundy]], which had a long [[Romanesque style]] tradition, a [[lantern tower]] was often included, and cathedrals often had a narrow passage the length of the cathedral at the level of the stained glass windows. as in [[Auxerre Cathedral]].\n \t\nIn the Southwest of France, the walls were thicker, with narrow openings, and doubled with arches. The flying buttress was rarely used, replaced by heavy [[abutment]]s with chapels between.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}}\n \t\nThe south of France had its own distinct variation of the Gothic style: the [[Southern French Gothic]]. The Gothic cathedrals were often built with brick and tile rather than stone. They generally had thick walls and narrow windows, and were braced by heavy abutments rather than flying buttresses. The form of the tower of [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|the basilica of Saint-Sernin]] was copied by several cathedrals in the south, while the old nave of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] (1210\u20131220) gave the model of the single nave which was generally used in Southern French Gothic architecture (although some churches had two or three naves of equal height). Some Gothic cathedrals in the [[Southern France|Midi]] took unusual form; the [[Cathedral of Albi]] (1282\u20131480) was originally built as fortress, then converted to a cathedral. Albi Cathedral has another very distinctive feature; a colourful interior and painted ceiling.{{sfn|Wenzler|2018|pp=39\u201341}} In the [[Church of the Jacobins|Jacobins church]] of [[Toulouse]], the grafting of a single apse of polygonal plan on a church with two vessels gave birth to a starry vault whose complex organization anticipated more than a century on the Flamboyant Gothic. Tradition refers to this masterpiece as \"palm tree\", because the veins gush out of the smooth shaft of the column-like palm trees.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1337/ | title=Episcopal City of Albi}}</ref>\n \t\nThe facade of [[Toulouse Cathedral]] is unusual; it is the combination of two unfinished cathedral buildings, begun in the 13th century and finally put together. Toulouse Cathedral has no flying buttresses; it is supported by massive ''contreforts'' the height of the building, with chapels between.\n\n==Decoration==\n===Painting and sculpture===\n===Stained glass===\n\n==Bibliography==\n===In English===\n* Martindale, Andrew, ''Gothic Art'', (1967), Thames and Hudson (in English and French); {{ISBN|2-87811-058-7}}ad\n* O'Reilly, Elizabeth, ''How France Built Her Cathedrals'', (1921), Harper Brothers, New York and London.

In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the Aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\n===Literal-allegorical teachings===\nRabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[halakha]]; and \"the secret\" component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those \"equipped with the keys\" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.\n\n===Interpretation of the Aggadah===\nIn line with the above, [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], in his \"Introduction to the Talmud\", states that \"Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a [[mitzvah|commandment]] (i.e. which is not [[halakha|halachic]]) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable.\" As regards this, [[Maimonides]], in his preface to the tenth chapter of [[Mishnah|Tractate]] [[Sanhedrin]] (''Perek Chelek''), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.<ref>Summary per [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayechi/elkayam.html discussion] by Dr. Avraham Elkayam, Department of Philosophy, [[Bar Ilan University]]</ref>\n* The first approach is to accept the Aggadah as literally true, without admission of any hidden, allegorical explanation\u2014even where a literal interpretation runs counter to common sense. Maimonides is dismissive of this approach.\n* The second approach is to assume that anything said by the Sages was intended literally, and to therefore reject, as impossible, non-rational or fantastic teachings (and to consequently consider the Sages as \"simpletons and ignoramuses\"). Maimonides does not entirely reject rationalist interpretation, but he opposes an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] approach which denies the Aggadah a hidden rationality. \"The sages presented their ''drashot'' in a style by which the mind of a fool will reject them because of his way of thinking; it is improper to assign any deficiency to the ''drash''\u2014one may rather suspect that the deficiency is a result of his intellectual shortcomings\" (''Commentary on the Mishnah'': Introduction).\n* The third approach is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: \"overt\" and \"hidden\".

The major works include:\n* ''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'' (''The Book of Legends'') is a classic compilation of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and the [[Midrash]] literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked for three years to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However, they also presented some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] aggadot into modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as ''The Book of Legends'', by William G. Braude.\n* ''Legends of the Jews'', by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and Midrash. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly. Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.\n* ''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]]. Berdichevsky was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the [[Jew]]ish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.\n* The collected works of Dov Noy.<ref>According to Peninnah Schram, \"Dov Noy is the fourth major figure in the renaissance of preserving and perpetuating the Jewish oral tradition.

In this context, the widely held view in [[rabbinic literature]] is that the Aggadah is in fact a medium for the transmission of fundamental teachings (Homiletic Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}) or for explanations of verses in the [[Tanakh]] ([[Exegesis|Exegetic]] Sayings\u2014{{hebrew|\u05de\u05d0\u05de\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd \u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd}}). In Rabbinic thought, therefore, much of the Aggadah is understood as containing a hidden, allegorical dimension, in addition to its overt, literal sense. In general, where a literal interpretation contradicts rationality, the Rabbis seek an allegorical explanation: \"We are told to use our common sense to decide whether an aggada is to be taken literally or not\" (Carmell, 2005).\n\n===Literal-allegorical teachings===\nRabbi [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the ''Ramchal'', discusses this two-tiered, literal-allegorical mode of transmission of the Aggadah in his well-known ''Discourse on the Haggadot''. He explains that the Oral Law, in fact, comprises two components: the legal component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05de\u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the [[mitzvah|mitzvot]] and [[halakha]]; and \"the secret\" component ({{hebrew|\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e1\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea}}), discussing the deeper teachings. The Aggadah, along with the [[Kabbalah]], falls under the latter. The rabbis of the [[Mishnah]]ic era believed that it would be dangerous to record the deeper teachings in explicit, mishnah-like, medium. Rather, they would be conveyed in a \"concealed mode\" and via \"paradoxes\". (Due to their value, these teachings should not become accessible to those \"of bad character\" and due to their depth they should not be made available to those \"not schooled in the ways of analysis\".) This mode of the transmission was nevertheless based on consistent rules and principles such that those \"equipped with the keys\" would be able to unlock their meaning; to others they would appear as non-rational or fantastic.\n\n===Interpretation of the Aggadah===\nIn line with the above, [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]], in his \"Introduction to the Talmud\", states that \"Aggadah comprises any comment occurring in the Talmud on any topic which is not a [[mitzvah|commandment]] (i.e. which is not [[halakha|halachic]]) and one should derive from it only that which is reasonable.\" As regards this, [[Maimonides]], in his preface to the tenth chapter of [[Mishnah|Tractate]] [[Sanhedrin]] (''Perek Chelek''), describes three possible approaches to the interpretation of the Aggadah.<ref>Summary per [http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/vayechi/elkayam.html discussion] by Dr. Avraham Elkayam, Department of Philosophy, [[Bar Ilan University]]</ref>\n* The first approach is to accept the Aggadah as literally true, without admission of any hidden, allegorical explanation\u2014even where a literal interpretation runs counter to common sense. Maimonides is dismissive of this approach.\n* The second approach is to assume that anything said by the Sages was intended literally, and to therefore reject, as impossible, non-rational or fantastic teachings (and to consequently consider the Sages as \"simpletons and ignoramuses\"). Maimonides does not entirely reject rationalist interpretation, but he opposes an [[Exegesis|exegetical]] approach which denies the Aggadah a hidden rationality. \"The sages presented their ''drashot'' in a style by which the mind of a fool will reject them because of his way of thinking; it is improper to assign any deficiency to the ''drash''\u2014one may rather suspect that the deficiency is a result of his intellectual shortcomings\" (''Commentary on the Mishnah'': Introduction).\n* The third approach is to recognise that many Aggadot are intended to teach profound truths, and that the teachings thus operate on two levels: \"overt\" and \"hidden\". Thus any impossible assertion was, in fact, intended as a parable; further, where aggadot can be understood literally, they may be taken on this level. This is, in general, the view of the Rabbis. \"It is proper\u2026to carefully analyse [the Aggadot]\u2026when any of these seem far-fetched we must immerse ourselves in the various branches of knowledge until we understand the concepts.\" (Maimonides, [[op cit]].)\n\nNote that Maimonides' approach is also widely held amongst the non-rationalistic, [[kabbalah|mystical]] streams of Judaism\u2014thus, for example, Rabbi [[Isaiah Horowitz]], the ''Shlah HaKodosh'' holds that \"none of these sometimes mind-boggling 'stories' are devoid of profound meaning; if anyone is devoid of understanding, it is the reader\" (''Shnei Luchos HaBris'', introduction).\n\n===In the Talmud and Midrash===\nThe Aggadah is today recorded in the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]].\n\nIn the Midrash, the aggadic and halakhic material are compiled as two distinct collections: 1) The Aggadic Midrashim, generally, are explanatory aggadah, deriving the \"sermonic implications\" from the biblical text; and 2) the [[Midrash halakha|Halakhic Midrashim]] derive the laws from the text.

''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'', Vol. 19, 1999.</ref> \n\n[[Mainstream|Popularized]] [[anthology|anthologies]] did not appear until more recently\u2014these often incorporate \"aggadot\" from outside of classical [[Rabbinic literature]]. The major works include:\n* ''Sefer Ha-Aggadah'' (''The Book of Legends'') is a classic compilation of aggadah from the [[Mishnah]], the two Talmuds and the [[Midrash]] literature. It was edited by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Yehoshua Hana Rawnitzki]]. Bialik and Ravnitzky worked for three years to compile a comprehensive and representative overview of aggadah. When they found the same aggadah in multiple versions, from multiple sources, they usually selected the later form, the one found in the Babylonian Talmud. However, they also presented some aggadot sequentially, giving the early form from the [[Jerusalem Talmud]], and later versions from the Babylonian Talmud, and from a classic midrash compilation. In each case every aggadah is given with its original source. In their original edition, they translated the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] aggadot into modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Sefer Ha-Aggadah was first published in 1908-11 in [[Odessa]], Russia, then reprinted numerous times in [[Israel]]. In 1992 it was translated into English as ''The Book of Legends'', by William G. Braude.\n* ''Legends of the Jews'', by Rabbi [[Louis Ginzberg]], is an original synthesis of a vast amount of aggadah from the Mishnah, the two Talmuds and Midrash. Ginzberg had an encyclopedic knowledge of all rabbinic literature, and his masterwork included a massive array of aggadot. However he did not create an anthology which showed these aggadot distinctly. Rather, he paraphrased them and rewrote them into one continuous narrative that covered five volumes, followed by two volumes of footnotes that give specific sources.\n* ''Mimekor Yisrael'', by [[Micha Josef Berdyczewski]]. Berdichevsky was interested in compiling the folklore and legends of the [[Jew]]ish people, from the earliest times up until the dawn of the modern era. His collection included a large array of aggadot, although they were limited to those he considered within the domain of folklore.\n* The collected works of Dov Noy.<ref>According to Peninnah Schram, \"Dov Noy is the fourth major figure in the renaissance of preserving and perpetuating the Jewish oral tradition. While he has published many books and important essays (including the entry \"Folklore\" in The [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]), his two main contributions are: 1) he applied an international classification system to Jewish traditional narrative; and 2) he established the Israel Folktale Archives\"</ref> In 1954, Noy established the [http://www.folklore.org.il/asai.html Israel Folktale Archives and Ethnological Museum] at the [[University of Haifa]], an archive containing over 23,000 folktales collected from all the [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various ethnic communities]] who live in [[Israel]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Judaism}}\n* [[:Category:Aggadic Midrashim|Aggadic Midrashim (category)]]\n* [[Moses in rabbinic literature]]\n* [[Pardes (Jewish exegesis)]]\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n* '''Traditional orientation'''\n** ''Introduction to the commentary on the Mishnah'', [[Maimonides]], transl.
