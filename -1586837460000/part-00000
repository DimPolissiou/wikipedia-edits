Snowden also discusses his views on authoritarianism, democracy and privacy.

The lawsuit does not aim to restrict the book's content or its distribution, but to capture the proceeds Snowden is earning from it. The book has been censored in China, with the removed content including comments about authoritarian states, privacy-supporting technologies, and the right to privacy.\n\n== Summary ==\n=== Part One ===\nSnowden recounts growing up in a patriotic military family in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]] and moving to [[Crofton, Maryland]] just shy of his ninth birthday. In Crofton, his father worked as a chief warrant officer in the Aeronautical Engineering Division at Coast Guard Headquarters and his mother at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). He was introduced to computers by his father, using his [[Commodore 64]] home computer. From around the age of twelve he became obsessed with the internet, using a dial-up Internet access and trying to spend his \"every waking moment\" online. He eventually learned computer programming and became a hacker as a teenager, taking his focus away from his schoolwork to the detriment of his grades. He recalls one instance of discovering a security flaw on the website of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. He called the lab to notify them of this and later received a call from a man thanking him and offering a job once he turned 18. Toward the end of his freshman year at [[Arundel High School]], Snowden's parents were getting divorced and sold their Crofton house. He moved into his mother's condo near [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]]. At the beginning of his sophomore year, he was unusually fatigued and was eventually diagnosed with [[infectious mononucleosis]]. He missed four months of classes, and was told he would have to repeat his sophomore year. Instead, he dropped out of Arundel High and enrolled at [[Anne Arundel Community College]] (AACC), taking classes two days a week. He also later passed the [[General Education Development]] (GED) exams at a high school near Baltimore, a promise he made to himself when he dropped out. Snowden started freelancing as a web designer for a woman from his Japanese class at AACC. He wanted to advance his career further, taking a [[Microsoft certification]] course at the Computer Career Institute of a [[Johns Hopkins University]] satellite campus. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Snowden joined the [[United States Army]] to show he wasn't \"just a brain in a jar\" and was on track to become a Special Forces sergeant through the [[Special Forces (United States Army)#Special Forces MOS descriptions|18X]] enlistment option but suffered stress fractures during training at [[Fort Benning]] in Georgia. Snowden says his greatest regret was his own \"reflexive, unquestioning support\" for the [[War on Terror]] and the resulting \"promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars.\"\n\n[[File:Commodore64 ita.jpg|thumb|Snowden first became interested in computers by using his father's [[Commodore 64]] home computer.]]\n\nSnowden still wanted to serve his country and realized he had taken his talent for technology for granted, and began taking classes again at Anne Arundel Community College. Knowing he would need a high-level security clearance to work for an intelligence agency, he searched for jobs that would sponsor his application for the [[Single Scope Background Investigation]]. He became an employee at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study of Language]], a research center sponsored by the NSA. Around the same time, he met his then-girlfriend [[Lindsay Mills]] through the site [[Hot or Not]]. He eventually passed the full-scope polygraph and successfully attained the TS/SCI security clearance, completing his final interview at the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] when he was twenty-two years old.\n\n=== Part Two ===\nAfter attending a 2006 job fair at the Ritz-Carlton in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]], Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA and was assigned to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]]. In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.\n\nShortly after, Snowden took a job as contractor for the NSA in Japan, but was officially an employee of [[Perot Systems]] (which was acquired by [[Dell]] soon after his arrival). He worked at the NSA's Pacific Technical Center (PTC), at [[Yokota Air Base]]. His job there was \"helping to connect the NSA's systems architecture with the CIA's.\" On one occasion, the PTC hosted a conference featuring briefings given by experts from all the intelligence components. The conference concerned how the Chinese intelligence services were targeting the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and how the IC could respond. When the only technology briefer was unable to attend at the last minute, Snowden was selected to replace them in assessing China's surveillance capabilities. He stayed up all night preparing his presentation, sifting through top secret reports off the NSA network and the CIA network. He was stunned by the extent to which China was able to constantly collect, store, and analyze the billions of daily telephone and Internet communications of their over a billion citizenry. However, Snowden began to believe that it was impossible for the US to have so much information about what the Chinese were doing without having done some of the very same things itself. Snowden, however, admits that at the time he \"tamped down\" his unease and fully supported defensive and targeted surveillance. He was further suspicious when he, around the same time, read the ''Unclassified Report on the [[President's Surveillance Program]]''. His suspicion drove him to search for the classified report, but was unable to find it. It was only later, long after he had forgotten about it, that the classified version mistakenly appeared on his desktop. After reading the report, he says he spent months in a sad, low daze: {{cquote|I felt more adult than ever, but also cursed with the knowledge that all of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision. I felt like a fraud, making excuses to Lindsay to explain my sullenness. I felt like a fool, as someone of supposedly serious technical skills who\u2019d somehow helped to build an essential component of this system without realizing its purpose. I felt used, as an employee of the IC who only now was realizing that all along I\u2019d been protecting not my country but the state. I felt, above all, violated.}}\n\nSnowden moved to [[Columbia, Maryland]] in 2011, still working for Dell but now attached again to the CIA. He had switched to a sales position, a move which he describes as a way to distract himself from his unease and begin to have a normal life. However, the rise of cloud computing disturbed Snowden. He began expressing his concerns to Lindsay. Around the same time, Snowden began experiencing intense dizziness and, eventually, his first epileptic seizure. Following a series of seizures, Snowden took a short-term disability leave from Dell. The final chapter of Part Two, \"On the Couch\", describes his time spent recovering on his mother's blue couch as well his thoughts on authoritarian states and privacy in the context of the 2011 [[Arab Spring]].\n\n=== Part Three ===\nIn March 2012, he began working at \"[[Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center|the Tunnel]]\", a former aircraft factory turned NSA facility located under a pineapple field in [[Kunia Camp, Hawaii|Kunia]], on the island of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]. He was working on a Dell contract for the NSA. Snowden moved to Hawaii for the more relaxed lifestyle and the less stressful duties of his new position, in an effort to lessen the triggers of his seizures. He was the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, where he worked as a [[SharePoint]] systems administrator. He began actively searching for the NSA's surveillance capabilities and abuses at this time. As part of his work, Snowden developed a system called Heartbeat which created an automated queue from the classified documents posted to the Intelligence Community's \"readboards\". Heartbeat would perpetually scan for new and unique documents and create a kind of [[News aggregator|aggregated newsfeed]] personalized for each employee, based on their interests and their security clearance. Heartbeat was highly comprehensive, accessing beyond the NSA's network into the networks of the CIA and the FBI as well as into the Department of Defense\u2019s top-secret [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System]]. Heartbeat's servers stored a copy of each scanned document, allowing Snowden to \"perform the kind of deep interagency searches that the heads of most agencies could only dream of.\" Snowden says that nearly all of the documents that he later leaked to journalists were received through Heartbeat.\n\n[[File:Edward Snowden's former house in Waipahu, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Edward Snowden's former house in [[Waipahu, Hawaii]].]]\n\nIn \"Whistleblowing\", Snowden discusses the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argues that the Intelligence Community have \"hacked\" it by acting with impunity from the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch. He also discusses the history of whistleblowing and argues that the terms \"leaking\" and \"whistleblowing\" should not be used interchangeably because he believes \"leaking\" is done out of self-interest, not out of public interest.\n\nWhen Snowden decided to go public, he realized he would have to have documentation or he risked being doubted. He chose not to self-publish to avoid being \"lost among the crazy\" of people posting classified secrets to the Internet every day. He avoided [[WikiLeaks]] because he felt their new strategy of publishing leaks as they received them would be no different to him self-publishing. He felt a [[document dump]] was not appropriate as his leaks were too \"tangled and technical\". He considered ''[[The New York Times]]'' but was unimpressed with how [[Bill Keller]] intentionally delayed the reporting of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]] until after George W. Bush's 2004 reelection. He chose a number of journalists to contact, primarily messaging documentarian [[Laura Poitras]] and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]. He communicated with them over e-mail under the aliases \"Cincinnatus\", \"Citizenfour\" and \"Verax\". To stay anonymous, he went [[war-driving]], exploiting local Wi-Fi networks with an antenna and magnetic GPS sensor while driving in his car around Oahu. He used [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and the Kismet mapping software, running on the [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]] operating system which allowed him to easily [[MAC spoofing|spoof]] his laptop's [[MAC address]].\n\nUnder the guise of compatibility testing, Snowden transferred documents from the Heartbeat server to outdated desktop Dell PCs from his office, then onto [[SD card]]s after [[Data_deduplication|deduplicating]], [[Data_compression|compressing]] and [[Encryption_software|encrypting]] them. He carried the SD cards out through security, hiding them inside a [[Rubik's Cube]], in his sock, in his cheek, and in his pocket. At home, he transferred them onto a single external drive which he left out in the open on his desk.\n\nHe left Dell on March 15, 2013 and began working as an \"infrastructure analyst\" at the National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) in Honolulu through a contractor job at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The NTOC had access to [[XKEYSCORE]]. Snowden witnessed coworkers use XKEYSCORE to view information about their current and former lovers,  called [[LOVEINT]]. He also recalls one time that affected him, watching a personal video of a father and his young son. Between March\u2013May 2013, Snowden began rapidly preparing to leave the country, emptying his bank accounts and erasing and encrypting his old computers. He researched his safest and most conducive destination, narrowing it down to [[Hong Kong]]. The day after Lindsay left on a camping trip, Snowden took an emergency medical leave of absence from work, citing epilepsy. He brought four laptops with him: one for secure communications, one for normal communications, a decoy, and [[Air gap (networking)|a laptop that had never connected to any networks and would never be used to do so]]. He flew to Tokyo then to Hong Kong on May 20, 2013, paying in cash both times.\n\nHe stayed in the [[The Mira Hong Kong]] hotel, where Glenn and Laura met him on June 2, 2013. Between June 3\u2013June 9 in Snowden's hotel room, Glenn and his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' colleague [[Ewen MacAskill]] interviewed Snowden, with Laura filming what would later feature in her Academy Award-winning documentary ''[[Citizenfour]]'' (2014). On June 5, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's first story, on the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA court]] warrant that ordered [[Verizon Business Network Services|Verizon]] to provide a daily feed to the NSA containing \"telephony metadata\". On June 6, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's revelation of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published Laura and [[Barton Gellman]]'s story on PRISM on June 7. Snowden's identity was revealed on June 9 through a video interview directed by Laura published on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website. The U.S. government charged Snowden under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] on June 14 and formally requested his extradition on June 21, Snowden's 30th birthday.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | total_width       = 280\n | image1            = Laura Poitras 2014.jpg\n | image2            = Glenn Greenwald 2014-01-20 001.jpg\n | footer            = [[Laura Poitras]] (left) and [[Glenn Greenwald]] (right) were both contacted by Edward Snowden anonymously over encrypted email.\n}}\n\nAccompanied by [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]] of [[WikiLeaks]], Snowden attempted to travel to [[Ecuador]] for political asylum. They planned to fly to Moscow, then to Havana, then to Caracas, then to [[Quito, Ecuador]] because they were unable to fly directly from Hong Kong and all of the other connecting flights traveled through United States airspace. They arrived at Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] on June 23, but were taken aside and questioned by a man from Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB). The man asked Snowden to work for them, but Snowden rejected the offer and said he had no intention to stay in Russia. The man was surprised and informed Snowden that the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] had canceled his passport. He proceeded to ask Snowden to share information with them but he refused. Snowden was detained in Sheremetyevo for forty days, during which he applied to twenty-seven countries for political asylum but none offered. On August 1, the Russian government granted Snowden temporary asylum.\n\nThe book's penultimate 28th chapter is composed of entries from Lindsay Mills' 2013 diary. Snowden explained that no one but her had the experience or the right to recount that period of her life: \"the FBI interrogations, the surveillance, the press attention, the online harassment, the confusion and pain, the anger and sadness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward Snowden|title=Permanent Record|date=September 17, 2019|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-250-23724-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter, \"Love and Exile\", Snowden expresses his feelings on the impact of his revelations, including ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'' and the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], and his hopes for the future of technology and privacy. He also discusses adjusting to life in Moscow with Lindsay. In the chapter's final sentence, Snowden reveals he and Lindsay were married in 2017.\n\n== Civil lawsuit ==\nOn September 17, 2019, the [[Federal Government of the United States]] filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA.<ref name=\"civilcharges20190917\">{{cite news |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden |title=United States Files Civil Lawsuit Against Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |first1=Joshua |last1=Stueve |work=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Eastern District of Virginia}}</ref> The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir ''Permanent Record''.

Parts of the book were removed, in violation of his publishing agreement. The Chinese version removed Snowden's observation on the motivations of Arab Spring protestors: \"The crowds were calling for an end to oppression, censorship, and precarity. They were declaring that in a truly just society, the people were not answerable to the government, the government was answerable to the people.\" The following section, in which Snowden comments on the nature of authoritarian states, was also largely censored. In the section, Snowden writes, \"Authoritarian states are typically not governments of laws, but governments of leaders, who demand loyalty from their subjects and are hostile to dissent.\" The Chinese version also censored Snowden's references to the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], China's military cyber intelligence and its capabilities, China's [[Great Firewall]], as well Snowden's characterization of [[Hong Kong]] as having \"nominal autonomy\". The Chinese version censored topics not directly related to China as well, including Snowden's commentary on the [[right to privacy]]. Snowden invited his Twitter followers to help him create a \"correct and unabridged version\" of ''Permanent Record'' to be published freely online.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/12/edward-snowden-says-autobiography-permanent-record-censored-in-china |title=Edward Snowden says autobiography has been censored in China |last=Kuo |first=Lily |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3037432/whistle-blower-edward-snowden-slams-china-censorship-his-book |title=Whistle-blower Edward Snowden slams China censorship of his book, vows to put uncut version online |last=Zhen |first=Liu |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[South China Morning Post]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1746780/edward-snowden-calls-out-chinese-censorship-of-his-book/ |title=Edward Snowden blew the whistle on how Chinese censors scrubbed his book |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote, \"Snowden's book likely won't change the minds of his detractors, but he makes a strong case for his efforts.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edward-snowden/permanent-record-snowden/ |title=Permanent Record by Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Greg Myre]] of [[NPR]] wrote, \"Snowden has no new bombshells in his book.

The lawsuit does not aim to restrict book's content or its distribution, but to capture the proceeds Snowden is earning from it. The book has been censored in China, with the removed content including comments about authoritarian states, privacy-supporting technologies, and the right to privacy.\n\n== Summary ==\n=== Part One ===\nSnowden recounts growing up in a patriotic military family in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]] and moving to [[Crofton, Maryland]] just shy of his ninth birthday. In Crofton, his father worked as a chief warrant officer in the Aeronautical Engineering Division at Coast Guard Headquarters and his mother at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). He was introduced to computers by his father, using his [[Commodore 64]] home computer. From around the age of twelve he became obsessed with the internet, using a dial-up Internet access and trying to spend his \"every waking moment\" online. He eventually learned computer programming and became a hacker as a teenager, taking his focus away from his schoolwork to the detriment of his grades. He recalls one instance of discovering a security flaw on the website of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. He called the lab to notify them of this and later received a call from a man thanking him and offering a job once he turned 18. Toward the end of his freshman year at [[Arundel High School]], Snowden's parents were getting divorced and sold their Crofton house. He moved into his mother's condo near [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]]. At the beginning of his sophomore year, he was unusually fatigued and was eventually diagnosed with [[infectious mononucleosis]]. He missed four months of classes, and was told he would have to repeat his sophomore year. Instead, he dropped out of Arundel High and enrolled at [[Anne Arundel Community College]] (AACC), taking classes two days a week. He also later passed the [[General Education Development]] (GED) exams at a high school near Baltimore, a promise he made to himself when he dropped out. Snowden started freelancing as a web designer for a woman from his Japanese class at AACC. He wanted to advance his career further, taking a [[Microsoft certification]] course at the Computer Career Institute of a [[Johns Hopkins University]] satellite campus. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Snowden joined the [[United States Army]] to show he wasn't \"just a brain in a jar\" and was on track to become a Special Forces sergeant through the [[Special Forces (United States Army)#Special Forces MOS descriptions|18X]] enlistment option but suffered stress fractures during training at [[Fort Benning]] in Georgia. Snowden says his greatest regret was his own \"reflexive, unquestioning support\" for the [[War on Terror]] and the resulting \"promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars.\"\n\n[[File:Commodore64 ita.jpg|thumb|Snowden first became interested in computers by using his father's [[Commodore 64]] home computer.]]\n\nSnowden still wanted to serve his country and realized he had taken his talent for technology for granted, and began taking classes again at Anne Arundel Community College. Knowing he would need a high-level security clearance to work for an intelligence agency, he searched for jobs that would sponsor his application for the [[Single Scope Background Investigation]]. He became an employee at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study of Language]], a research center sponsored by the NSA. Around the same time, he met his then-girlfriend [[Lindsay Mills]] through the site [[Hot or Not]]. He eventually passed the full-scope polygraph and successfully attained the TS/SCI security clearance, completing his final interview at the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] when he was twenty-two years old.\n\n=== Part Two ===\nAfter attending a 2006 job fair at the Ritz-Carlton in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]], Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA and was assigned to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]]. In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.\n\nShortly after, Snowden took a job as contractor for the NSA in Japan, but was officially an employee of [[Perot Systems]] (which was acquired by [[Dell]] soon after his arrival). He worked at the NSA's Pacific Technical Center (PTC), at [[Yokota Air Base]]. His job there was \"helping to connect the NSA's systems architecture with the CIA's.\" On one occasion, the PTC hosted a conference featuring briefings given by experts from all the intelligence components. The conference concerned how the Chinese intelligence services were targeting the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and how the IC could respond. When the only technology briefer was unable to attend at the last minute, Snowden was selected to replace them in assessing China's surveillance capabilities. He stayed up all night preparing his presentation, sifting through top secret reports off the NSA network and the CIA network. He was stunned by the extent to which China was able to constantly collect, store, and analyze the billions of daily telephone and Internet communications of their over a billion citizenry. However, Snowden began to believe that it was impossible for the US to have so much information about what the Chinese were doing without having done some of the very same things itself. Snowden, however, admits that at the time he \"tamped down\" his unease and fully supported defensive and targeted surveillance. He was further suspicious when he, around the same time, read the ''Unclassified Report on the [[President's Surveillance Program]]''. His suspicion drove him to search for the classified report, but was unable to find it. It was only later, long after he had forgotten about it, that the classified version mistakenly appeared on his desktop. After reading the report, he says he spent months in a sad, low daze: {{cquote|I felt more adult than ever, but also cursed with the knowledge that all of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision. I felt like a fraud, making excuses to Lindsay to explain my sullenness. I felt like a fool, as someone of supposedly serious technical skills who\u2019d somehow helped to build an essential component of this system without realizing its purpose. I felt used, as an employee of the IC who only now was realizing that all along I\u2019d been protecting not my country but the state. I felt, above all, violated.}}\n\nSnowden moved to [[Columbia, Maryland]] in 2011, still working for Dell but now attached again to the CIA. He had switched to a sales position, a move which he describes as a way to distract himself from his unease and begin to have a normal life. However, the rise of cloud computing disturbed Snowden. He began expressing his concerns to Lindsay. Around the same time, Snowden began experiencing intense dizziness and, eventually, his first epileptic seizure. Following a series of seizures, Snowden took a short-term disability leave from Dell. The final chapter of Part Two, \"On the Couch\", describes his time spent recovering on his mother's blue couch as well his thoughts on authoritarian states and privacy in the context of the 2011 [[Arab Spring]].\n\n=== Part Three ===\nIn March 2012, he began working at \"[[Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center|the Tunnel]]\", a former aircraft factory turned NSA facility located under a pineapple field in [[Kunia Camp, Hawaii|Kunia]], on the island of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]. He was working on a Dell contract for the NSA. Snowden moved to Hawaii for the more relaxed lifestyle and the less stressful duties of his new position, in an effort to lessen the triggers of his seizures. He was the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, where he worked as a [[SharePoint]] systems administrator. He began actively searching for the NSA's surveillance capabilities and abuses at this time. As part of his work, Snowden developed a system called Heartbeat which created an automated queue from the classified documents posted to the Intelligence Community's \"readboards\". Heartbeat would perpetually scan for new and unique documents and create a kind of [[News aggregator|aggregated newsfeed]] personalized for each employee, based on their interests and their security clearance. Heartbeat was highly comprehensive, accessing beyond the NSA's network into the networks of the CIA and the FBI as well as into the Department of Defense\u2019s top-secret [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System]]. Heartbeat's servers stored a copy of each scanned document, allowing Snowden to \"perform the kind of deep interagency searches that the heads of most agencies could only dream of.\" Snowden says that nearly all of the documents that he later leaked to journalists were received through Heartbeat.\n\n[[File:Edward Snowden's former house in Waipahu, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Edward Snowden's former house in [[Waipahu, Hawaii]].]]\n\nIn \"Whistleblowing\", Snowden discusses the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argues that the Intelligence Community have \"hacked\" it by acting with impunity from the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch. He also discusses the history of whistleblowing and argues that the terms \"leaking\" and \"whistleblowing\" should not be used interchangeably because he believes \"leaking\" is done out of self-interest, not out of public interest.\n\nWhen Snowden decided to go public, he realized he would have to have documentation or he risked being doubted. He chose not to self-publish to avoid being \"lost among the crazy\" of people posting classified secrets to the Internet every day. He avoided [[WikiLeaks]] because he felt their new strategy of publishing leaks as they received them would be no different to him self-publishing. He felt a [[document dump]] was not appropriate as his leaks were too \"tangled and technical\". He considered ''[[The New York Times]]'' but was unimpressed with how [[Bill Keller]] intentionally delayed the reporting of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]] until after George W. Bush's 2004 reelection. He chose a number of journalists to contact, primarily messaging documentarian [[Laura Poitras]] and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]. He communicated with them over e-mail under the aliases \"Cincinnatus\", \"Citizenfour\" and \"Verax\". To stay anonymous, he went [[war-driving]], exploiting local Wi-Fi networks with an antenna and magnetic GPS sensor while driving in his car around Oahu. He used [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and the Kismet mapping software, running on the [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]] operating system which allowed him to easily [[MAC spoofing|spoof]] his laptop's [[MAC address]].\n\nUnder the guise of compatibility testing, Snowden transferred documents from the Heartbeat server to outdated desktop Dell PCs from his office, then onto [[SD card]]s after [[Data_deduplication|deduplicating]], [[Data_compression|compressing]] and [[Encryption_software|encrypting]] them. He carried the SD cards out through security, hiding them inside a [[Rubik's Cube]], in his sock, in his cheek, and in his pocket. At home, he transferred them onto a single external drive which he left out in the open on his desk.\n\nHe left Dell on March 15, 2013 and began working as an \"infrastructure analyst\" at the National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) in Honolulu through a contractor job at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The NTOC had access to [[XKEYSCORE]]. Snowden witnessed coworkers use XKEYSCORE to view information about their current and former lovers,  called [[LOVEINT]]. He also recalls one time that affected him, watching a personal video of a father and his young son. Between March\u2013May 2013, Snowden began rapidly preparing to leave the country, emptying his bank accounts and erasing and encrypting his old computers. He researched his safest and most conducive destination, narrowing it down to [[Hong Kong]]. The day after Lindsay left on a camping trip, Snowden took an emergency medical leave of absence from work, citing epilepsy. He brought four laptops with him: one for secure communications, one for normal communications, a decoy, and [[Air gap (networking)|a laptop that had never connected to any networks and would never be used to do so]]. He flew to Tokyo then to Hong Kong on May 20, 2013, paying in cash both times.\n\nHe stayed in the [[The Mira Hong Kong]] hotel, where Glenn and Laura met him on June 2, 2013. Between June 3\u2013June 9 in Snowden's hotel room, Glenn and his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' colleague [[Ewen MacAskill]] interviewed Snowden, with Laura filming what would later feature in her Academy Award-winning documentary ''[[Citizenfour]]'' (2014). On June 5, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's first story, on the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA court]] warrant that ordered [[Verizon Business Network Services|Verizon]] to provide a daily feed to the NSA containing \"telephony metadata\". On June 6, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's revelation of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published Laura and [[Barton Gellman]]'s story on PRISM on June 7. Snowden's identity was revealed on June 9 through a video interview directed by Laura published on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website. The U.S. government charged Snowden under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] on June 14 and formally requested his extradition on June 21, Snowden's 30th birthday.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | total_width       = 280\n | image1            = Laura Poitras 2014.jpg\n | image2            = Glenn Greenwald 2014-01-20 001.jpg\n | footer            = [[Laura Poitras]] (left) and [[Glenn Greenwald]] (right) were both contacted by Edward Snowden anonymously over encrypted email.\n}}\n\nAccompanied by [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]] of [[WikiLeaks]], Snowden attempted to travel to [[Ecuador]] for political asylum. They planned to fly to Moscow, then to Havana, then to Caracas, then to [[Quito, Ecuador]] because they were unable to fly directly from Hong Kong and all of the other connecting flights traveled through United States airspace. They arrived at Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] on June 23, but were taken aside and questioned by a man from Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB). The man asked Snowden to work for them, but Snowden rejected the offer and said he had no intention to stay in Russia. The man was surprised and informed Snowden that the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] had canceled his passport. He proceeded to ask Snowden to share information with them but he refused. Snowden was detained in Sheremetyevo for forty days, during which he applied to twenty-seven countries for political asylum but none offered. On August 1, the Russian government granted Snowden temporary asylum.\n\nThe book's penultimate 28th chapter is composed of entries from Lindsay Mills' 2013 diary. Snowden explained that no one but her had the experience or the right to recount that period of her life: \"the FBI interrogations, the surveillance, the press attention, the online harassment, the confusion and pain, the anger and sadness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward Snowden|title=Permanent Record|date=September 17, 2019|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-250-23724-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter, \"Love and Exile\", Snowden expresses his feelings on the impact of his revelations, including ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'' and the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], and his hopes for the future of technology and privacy. He also discusses adjusting to life in Moscow with Lindsay. In the chapter's final sentence, Snowden reveals he and Lindsay were married in 2017.\n\n== Civil lawsuit ==\nOn September 17, 2019, the [[Federal Government of the United States]] filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA.<ref name=\"civilcharges20190917\">{{cite news |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden |title=United States Files Civil Lawsuit Against Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |first1=Joshua |last1=Stueve |work=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Eastern District of Virginia}}</ref> The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir ''Permanent Record''.

The Chinese version removed Snowden's observation on the motivations of Arab Spring protestors: \"The crowds were calling for an end to oppression, censorship, and precarity. They were declaring that in a truly just society, the people were not answerable to the government, the government was answerable to the people.\" The following section, in which Snowden comments on the nature of authoritarian states, was also largely censored. In the section, Snowden writes, \"Authoritarian states are typically not governments of laws, but governments of leaders, who demand loyalty from their subjects and are hostile to dissent.\" The Chinese version also censored Snowden's references to the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], China's military cyber intelligence and its capabilities, China's [[Great Firewall]], as well Snowden's characterization of [[Hong Kong]] as having \"nominal autonomy\". The Chinese version censored topics not directly related to China as well, including Snowden's commentary on the [[right to privacy]]. Snowden invited his Twitter followers to help him create a \"correct and unabridged version\" of ''Permanent Record'' to be published freely online.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/12/edward-snowden-says-autobiography-permanent-record-censored-in-china |title=Edward Snowden says autobiography has been censored in China |last=Kuo |first=Lily |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3037432/whistle-blower-edward-snowden-slams-china-censorship-his-book |title=Whistle-blower Edward Snowden slams China censorship of his book, vows to put uncut version online |last=Zhen |first=Liu |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[South China Morning Post]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1746780/edward-snowden-calls-out-chinese-censorship-of-his-book/ |title=Edward Snowden blew the whistle on how Chinese censors scrubbed his book |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote, \"Snowden's book likely won't change the minds of his detractors, but he makes a strong case for his efforts.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edward-snowden/permanent-record-snowden/ |title=Permanent Record by Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Greg Myre]] of [[NPR]] wrote, \"Snowden has no new bombshells in his book.

He is most noted for writing the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''. Born into a middle-class family in London, Blackstone was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] before matriculating at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] in 1738. After switching to and completing a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree, he was made a [[Fellow of All Souls#Fellowships|Fellow]] of [[All Souls, Oxford]] on 2 November 1743, admitted to [[Middle Temple]], and [[called to the Bar]] there in 1746. Following a slow start to his career as a barrister, Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration, becoming accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750. Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building, and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. These were massively successful, earning him a total of \u00a3453 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|453|1755|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms), and led to the publication of ''[[An Analysis of the Laws of England]]'' in 1756, which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.\n\nOn 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]], immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise, titled ''[[A Discourse on the Study of the Law]]''. With his growing fame, Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice, also securing election as [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[rotten borough]] of [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]] on 30 March 1761. In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', considered his ''magnum opus''; the completed work earned Blackstone \u00a314,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|14000|1766|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms). After repeated failures, he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] on 16 February 1770, leaving to replace [[Edward Clive (judge)|Edward Clive]] as a [[Justice of the Common Pleas]] on 25 June. He remained in this position until his death, on 14 February 1780.\n\nBlackstone's four-volume ''Commentaries'' were designed to provide a complete overview of English law and were repeatedly republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the [[Second World War]]. Legal education in England had stalled; Blackstone's work gave the law \"at least a veneer of scholarly respectability\".<ref name=mil57/> [[William Searle Holdsworth]], one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that \"If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that [[the United States]], and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [[common law]].\"<ref name=hol157/> In the United States, the ''Commentaries'' influenced [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[John Jay]], [[John Adams]], [[James Kent]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], and remain frequently cited in [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions.\n\n==Early life and education==\nWilliam's father, Charles Blackstone, was a [[Mercery|silk mercer]] from [[Cheapside]],<ref>Doolittle (1983) p. 100</ref> the son of a wealthy [[apothecary]]. He became firm friends with Thomas Bigg, a [[Surgeon#Titles in the United Kingdom|surgeon]] and the son of Lovelace Bigg, a gentleman from [[Wiltshire]].<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 3</ref> After Bigg's sister Mary came to London, Charles eventually persuaded her to marry him in 1718. This was not seen as a good match for her, but the couple lived happily and had four sons, three of whom lived into adulthood.<ref>Odgers (1918) p. 599</ref> Charles (born August 1719) and Henry (May 1722), both became fellows of [[New College, Oxford]] and took [[holy orders]]. Their last son, William, was born on 10 July 1723, five months after Charles' death in February.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 13</ref>\n\nAlthough Charles and Mary Blackstone were members of the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|middle class]] rather than landed gentry, they were particularly prosperous. Tax records show Charles Blackstone to have been the second most prosperous man in the parish in 1722, and death registers show that the family had several servants.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 15</ref> This, along with Thomas Bigg's assistance to the family following Charles' death, helps explain the educational upbringing of the children. William Blackstone was sent to [[Charterhouse School]] in 1730, nominated by Charles Wither, a relative of Mary Blackstone.<ref>de Montmorency (1917) p. 46</ref> William did well there, and became head of the school by age 15.  However, after Charles' death the family fortunes declined, and after Mary died (5 January 1736) the family's resources largely went to meet unpaid bills. William was able to remain at Charterhouse as a \"poor scholar\", having been named to that position in June 1735 after being nominated by [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 21</ref><ref>To recognize the Blackstone heritage at the school, in 1987 Charterhouse created the ''Sir William Blackstone Award'', a scholarship for the son of a lawyer.{{cite news|title=Professional News \u2013 Sir William Blackstone award|date=21 October 1987|work=Law Society Gazette|publisher=Law Society}}</ref>\n\nBlackstone revelled in Charterhouse's academic curriculum, particularly the Latin poetry of Ovid and Virgil. He began to attract note as a poet at school, writing a 30-line set of rhyming couplets to celebrate the wedding of [[Charterhouse School#Headmasters|James Hotchkis]], the headmaster. He also won a silver medal for his Latin verses on [[John Milton]], gave the annual Latin oration in 1738,<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 8</ref> and was noted as having been the favourite student of his masters.<ref>Prest (2008) pp. 24\u201325</ref> On 1 October 1738, taking advantage of a new scholarship available to Charterhouse students, Blackstone matriculated at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]].<ref name=od600>Odgers (1918) p. 600</ref>\n\n==Oxford==\n\n===Study===\n[[File:Pembroke Chapel Quad.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pembroke College, Oxford]], where Blackstone studied]]\nThere are few surviving records of Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College had been set out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied [[Greek language|Greek]], science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 34</ref> Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry,<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 10</ref> with his notes on [[William Shakespeare]] being included in [[George Steevens]]' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name=od600/> Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 37</ref> The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the more surprising element is the sheer number of texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 1740, after only a year and a half as a Bachelor of Arts student, Blackstone was admitted to study for a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree, civil law being the only legal area recognised by his university. This degree course was seven years long, the first two \"supposedly devoted to a broad course of reading in humane studies\", which allowed him to study his own interests.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 40</ref> On 20 November 1741 he was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]],<ref>Odgers (1918) p. 601</ref> the first step on the road to becoming a [[barrister]], but this imposed no obligations and simply allowed a legal career to be an option.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 41</ref> At the time there was no proper legal education system, and Blackstone read (in his own time) ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Coke on Littleton]]'', the works of [[Henry Finch]], and related legal tracts.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nIn addition to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of ''The Lawyer to his Muse'', his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published ''Elements of Architecture'' and ''An Abridgement of Architecture'', two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 44</ref> His next work (1747) was ''The Pantheon: A Vision'', an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 47</ref> This followed his election as a [[Fellow of All Souls#Fellowships|Fellow]] of [[All Souls, Oxford]] on 2 November 1743,<ref>Holdsworth (1932) p. 261</ref> and his [[call to the Bar]] by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.<ref>Odgers (1918) p. 602</ref>\n\nHis call to the Bar saw Blackstone begin to alternate between Oxford and London, occupying chambers in [[Pump Court]] but living at [[All Souls, Oxford|All Souls College]]. As the central courts only sat for three months of the year, the rest of his time was spent on [[Assizes|Assize]] when his work at All Souls permitted.  He regularly acted as a law reporter; his personal notes on cases start with ''Hankey v Trotman'' (1746).<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 19</ref> Blackstone's barrister practice began slowly; his first case in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] was in 1748, and he had only 6 additional motions there through 1751. Two appearances in the [[Court of Chancery]] are also noted, and he is known to have been consulted in [[Roger Newdigate]]'s long-running lawsuit there, but his early court appearances are infrequent.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 71</ref> This is considered to have been due to bad luck, with his call to the Bar occurring at the same time as the massive contraction in business by the central courts, along with his singular lack of connections due to his status as an orphan from the middle class; he was described as \"unrecognised and unemployed\".<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 24</ref> He filled his time by acting as counsel for Oxford, and from May 1749 with his election as [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 73</ref>\n\n===University administration===\n[[File:Analysis of the Laws of England.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[An Analysis of the Laws of England]]'', Blackstone's first legal treatise, published during this period]]\nWhile dividing his time, Blackstone became an administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and [[bursar]] on 28 November 1746.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 25</ref> Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, is attributed to his work.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 76</ref><ref>Holdsworth (1928) p. 156</ref> In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a \"perfectionist zeal\" in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 83</ref> In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, ''An Essay on Collateral Consanguinity'', which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls in an attempt to gain preeminence in elections.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 29</ref> Completion of his [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to [[Convocation]], the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 96</ref> With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to \"no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [and] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself\",<ref>Prest (2008) p. 107</ref> which was to give a set of lectures on the common law \u2013 the first lectures of that sort in the world.<ref>Holdsworth (1932) p. 262</ref>\n\nThis was not entirely out of benevolence; according to Prest, Blackstone was likely aware that an Oxford alumnus, [[Charles Viner (jurist)|Charles Viner]], was planning to endow a professorship of English law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 108</ref> The [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Oxford)|Regius Professorship of Civil Law]] had also become vacant in 1753; despite support from [[Lord Mansfield]], Blackstone had been rejected in favour of Robert Jenner, widely considered Blackstone's lesser intellectually but a far greater political mind.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) pp. 37\u201338</ref> In addition, a private lecture series would be extremely lucrative. While his All Souls fellowship gave him \u00a370 a year, records show that the lecture series brought him \u00a3116, \u00a3226 and \u00a3111 a year respectively from 1753 to 1755 \u2013 a total of \u00a3453 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|453|1755|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms).<ref>Prest (2008) p. 112</ref> A prospectus was issued on 23 June 1753, and with a class of approximately 20 students, the first set of lectures were completed by July 1754. Despite Blackstone's limited oratory skills and a speaking style described by [[Jeremy Bentham]] as \"formal, precise and affected\", Blackstone's lectures were warmly appreciated.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 114</ref> The second and third series were far more popular, partly due to the then unusual use of printed handouts and lists of suggested reading. No copies of these handouts exist, but [[Alexander Popham (penal reformer)|Alexander Popham]], later a close friend of Blackstone, attended the lectures and made notes, which survive. These show Blackstone's attempts to reduce English law to a logical system, with the division of subjects later being the basis for his ''Commentaries''.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 115-7</ref><ref>Simpson (1981) p. 652</ref>\n\nFollowing his lecture series, Blackstone became more prominent in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge at the time had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 119</ref> With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far more involved in the university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 120</ref> He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 121</ref> This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, ''Friendship: An Ode'', in 1756.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 139</ref>\n\nIn 1756 Blackstone published the first of his full legal texts, the 200 page ''[[An Analysis of the Laws of England]]''. Published by the [[Clarendon Press]], the treatise was intended to demonstrate the \"Order, and principal Divisions\" of his lecture series, and a structured introduction to English law. Prest calls this \"a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law . . including constitutional, civil and criminal law, public and private law, substantive law and procedure, as well as some introductory jurisprudential content\".<ref name=pres143>Prest (2008) p. 143</ref> The initial print run of 1,000 copies almost immediately sold out, leading to the printing of three more 1,000-book lots over the next three years, which all sold out. A fifth edition was published in 1762,<ref name=pres144>Prest (2008) p. 144</ref> and a sixth, edited to take into account Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', in 1771.<ref>Cairns (1984) p. 340</ref> Because of the success of the ''Commentaries'', Prest remarks that \"relatively little scholarly attention has been paid to this work\";<ref name=pres143/> at the time, however, it was hailed as \"an elegant performance . . calculated to facilitate this branch of knowledge\".<ref name=pres144/>\n\n===Vinerian Professor of English Law===\n[[File:Allan Ramsay - King George III in coronation robes - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], a patron of Blackstone]]\n\nOn 8 March 1758, the group executing Charles Viner's [[Will (law)|will]] reported to Convocation that Viner recommended creating a Chair of English Law, with a \u00a3200 salary. After much debate, this position was created, and on 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 150</ref> On 24 October he gave his first lecture, to \"a crowded audience\"; the text was soon printed and published as ''[[A Discourse on the Study of the Law]]''. The lecture was tremendously popular, being described as a \"sensible, spirited and manly exhortation to the study of the law\"; the initial print run sold out, necessitating the publication of another 1,000 copies, and it was used to preface later versions of the ''Analysis'' and the first volume of the ''Commentaries''.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 151</ref> Within the university, however, Blackstone was not as popular. As soon as the lecture series opened, an anonymously written open letter was published charging that Blackstone had \"violated the Statutes of the University, by arbitrarily changing the Day appointed for reading his solemn Lectures\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 152</ref> Blackstone suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] soon after the first lecture, and on 24 November he launched a suit in the Chancellor's Court against \"William Jackson of the City of Oxford Printer\" for \u00a3500 damages, justified by Jackson \"printing and publishing a scandalous Libell notoriously reflecting on the Character of him the said William Blackstone\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 153</ref> Jackson had refused to reveal who ordered the anonymous pamphlet, leading to the suit, but it evidently did not proceed further.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 154</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blackstone, The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest (1st ed, 1759, title page) - 20141020.jpg|thumb|left|The title page of the first edition of Blackstone's ''The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest'' (1759)<ref>{{citation|author=William Blackstone|title=The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest, with other Authentic Instruments: To which is Prefixed an Introductory Discourse, Containing the History of the Charters.

While quick to take offence at perceived slights on his own character and motives, he could also show surprising indifference to the effect his words and actions might have on others\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 161</ref> This marked the beginning of his break with Oxford, which coincided with his growing influence outside the university. In 1759 [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]]'s official tutor, requested copies of Blackstone's lectures, which he forwarded. Later that year Blackstone was paid \u00a3200 by the Prince, who became an \"appreciative, loyal, and soon to be incomparably influential patron\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 163</ref> This patronage, and Blackstone's purchase of a set of chambers in the [[Inner Temple]], also transferring to that Inn, were significant steps in his departure from Oxford. In 1759 Blackstone published another two works, ''The Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest, with other authentic Instruments'', described as a \"major piece of pioneering scholarship\" leading to Blackstone's election to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in February 1761,<ref>Prest (2008) pp. 164\u20135</ref> and ''A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple'', which was later used, almost verbatim, as chapters 14 and 15 of the ''Commentaries''.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 168</ref>\n\n==London==\n\n===Work at the Bar===\nWith sponsorship from the Prince of Wales and his success with the ''Analysis'', Blackstone began work as a barrister, although he kept up his lecture series at Oxford. By 1760 he had become \"a very eminent figure indeed in the world of letters\", and his legal practice grew as a result. Although not considered a great barrister of the period, he maintained a steady flow of cases, primarily in the King's Bench and [[Exchequer of Pleas]]. On the death of the third [[Willoughby Bertie, 3rd Earl of Abingdon|Earl of Abingdon]], Blackstone was retained as counsel for the executors and trustees to oversee the family's attempts to pay off debts and meet other obligations.<ref>Prest (2008) pp. 176\u20137</ref> On 5 May 1761 he married Sarah Clitherow, a member of a family of [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|lesser gentry]] from [[Middlesex]]. Their first child, William Bertie Blackstone, born 21 August 1762, did not survive to adulthood.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 179</ref> Seven more children were born; Henry, James, Sarah, Mary, Philippa, William, Charles, and George, who also died in childhood.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 208</ref> The Blackstones had a large estate in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in Berkshire, including 120 acres (46 ha) of [[pasture]]land around the [[River Thames]] and the right of [[advowson]] over [[St Peter's Church, Wallingford|St Peter's Church]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 211</ref>\n\nIn February 1761 Blackstone was considered as a potential [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] candidate for the [[rotten borough]] of [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]] in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect \u2013 at the same time refusing the offer of appointment as [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]]. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 181</ref> This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a [[patent of precedence]] at the same time actually increased the demand on his time.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 182</ref> Court records show him pleading before [[Lord Mansfield]] in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in ''Tonson v Collins'', a copyright case, ''Thiquet v Bath'', an important case on international law, and ''R v [[Chevalier d'Eon|d'Eon]]'', acting for the prosecution in a feud over [[Louis XV]]'s newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 185</ref>\n\nWith this increase in his practice, Blackstone also saw an increase in his out-of-court work, writing opinions and recommendations for various Oxford colleges, the MP [[Jonathan Rashleigh (1693\u20131764)|Jonathan Rashleigh]] and the fourth [[Willoughby Bertie, 4th Earl of Abingdon|Earl of Abingdon]], who paid him to draft several private Acts of Parliament.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 188</ref> In December 1761, he asked [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as [[Chief Justice of Chester]], writing again in July 1762 to \"prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty's Notice\", anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 195</ref> Parliamentary service was considered a \"desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would-be English judges\",<ref>Prest (2008) p. 200</ref> something that did not necessarily bode well for Blackstone. Naturally inarticulate and reticent, he was an infrequent and \"indifferent\" speaker during his first session of Parliament, speaking only 14 times in seven years. His chosen career did lend him to politics, in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees to provide them with technical expertise in drafting legislation.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 201</ref> He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762, after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up, but lost to George Perrott, a leading Exchequer barrister. The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone, after the appointment of [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] (a Whig) as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 206</ref>\n\n===Commentaries on the Laws of England===\nIn 1765 Blackstone announced his resignation from the [[Vinerian Professor of English Law|Vinerian Chair]], effective after his 1766 lectures. These were divided into two 14-lecture series, on \"private wrongs\" and \"public wrongs\" delivered between 12 February and 24 April.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 212</ref> At this point Blackstone had published nothing new since ''A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple'' in 1759.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 214</ref> The decision to resign was most likely due to the increasing demands of his legal practice and the reduced profit from the lectures, which, after peaking at \u00a3340 in 1762, dropped to \u00a3239 a year later and to \u00a3203 for the final round of lectures in 1765\u20136.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 217</ref> In response, Blackstone decided to publish a new book \u2013 ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''. The first volume was published in November 1765, bringing the author \u00a31,600 \u2013 the full work would eventually bring in over \u00a314,000. [[Owen Ruffhead]] described Volume I as \"masterly\", noting that \"Mr Blackstone is perhaps the first who has treated the body of the law in a liberal, elegant and constitutional manner. A vein of good sense and moderation runs through every page\". Every copy was sold within six months, and the second and third volumes, published in October 1766 and June 1768, received a similar reception.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 220</ref> The fourth and final volume appeared in 1770, dealing with Criminal Law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 246</ref> With the financial success of the ''Commentaries'', Blackstone moved in 1768 from his London property in Carey Fields to No. 55 Lincoln's Inn Fields. Neighbours included the [[Sardinia]]n ambassador, [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R#R|Sir Walter Rawlinson]], [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington|Lord Northington]], [[John Morton (MP)|John Morton]] and the [[Earl of Abingdon|Third Earl of Abingdon]], making it an appropriate house for a \"great and able Lawyer\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 235</ref>\n\nBlackstone's treatise was republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 287</ref> Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by [[Henry John Stephen]], first published in 1841,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/26372|title=Oxford DNB article: Stephen, Henry (subscription needed)|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|author2=Patrick Polden |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> was reprinted until after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Milsom (1991) p. 1</ref> The first American edition was produced in 1772; prior to this, over 1,000 copies had already been sold in the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Alschuler (1994) p. 896</ref>\n\n===Judge===\n[[File:SirWilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|Blackstone in 1774, after his appointment as a Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]]]]\nEven after the publication of the ''Commentaries'', Blackstone's chances of judicial appointment remained slim. While he was old enough, experienced enough and widely respected, the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone's lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his chances. In January 1770, however, Lord Grafton's government began to fall, with Camden resigning on 17 January and [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] John Dunning, following him. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] appointed [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] as Prime Minister, and North picked [[Charles Yorke]] as Lord Chancellor.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 254</ref> Yorke's death on 20 January, after holding the position for less than three days, left several important legal positions within the government open. As such, Blackstone, now MP for [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]],<ref>Doolittle (1983) p. 101</ref> was apparently approached to become Solicitor-General; he refused, not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position.<ref name=pres255>Prest (2008) p. 255</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1770 \u2013 apparently with the intervention of the King, and possibly [[Lord Mansfield]] \u2013 Blackstone became a [[Justice of the Common Pleas]], succeeding [[Edward Clive (judge)|Edward Clive]], and was made a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] on 12 February.<ref>Waterman (1934) p. 554</ref> After only four days it was announced that [[Joseph Yates (judge)|Joseph Yates]] was to move to the Common Pleas, and Blackstone was again sworn in as a judge, this time of the Court of King's Bench.<ref name=pres255/> This was apparently due to Yates' poor health; Lord Mansfield ran a busy court as [[Lord Chief Justice of England|Lord Chief Justice]], and it was felt that his transfer to the Common Pleas was for the best. Others commented that it was instead due to political and judicial disagreement, with Yates unwilling to stomach the changes which Mansfield made to English law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 260</ref> Blackstone sat regularly as a judge, despite bouts of ill health, and also served on various circuit courts.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 262</ref> Prest describes him as an \"exceptionally careful, conscientious and well-respected judge . . his judgments ranging between narrowly framed technicalities [and] broad statements of public commentary\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 263</ref> He was, however, considered a poor trial judge, being reversed on appeal more frequently than any of his peers.<ref>[[Stanley Nider Katz|Katz, Stanley N.]], \"Introduction,\" Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England, Vol. I (reprinted), University of Chicago Press, 1979. p. v</ref>\n\nBlackstone returned to the Common Pleas on 25 June 1770, having spent less than six months in the King's Bench;<ref>Sainty (1993) p.81</ref> [[Jeremy Bentham]] asserted that this was due to Mansfield's having Blackstone removed similarly to his removal of Yates. Bentham asserted that in the King's Bench, Blackstone was \"always in hot water\", and that there was \"heartburning\" between the two; Bentham's account is considered dubious because historically, Mansfield and Blackstone had an excellent relationship, with the third volume of the ''Commentaries'' describing Mansfield as \"a judge, whose masterly acquaintance with the law of nations was known and revered by every state in Europe\".<ref>Waterman (1934) p. 555</ref> There is only one recorded King's Bench case, ''R v Proprietors of Birmingham Canal Navigation'', in which Blackstone and Mansfield disagreed.<ref>Hanbury (1959) p. 2</ref>\n\nIn the Common Pleas, Blackstone operated under a civil jurisdiction rather than a mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, and many of his decisions are considered farsighted; the principle in ''Blaney v Hendricks'', for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the [[Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934]].<ref>Hanbury (1959) p. 5</ref> Blackstone's decision in ''Goldswain's Case'' was later repeated by [[Lord Denning]] in ''Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell'' in 1950.<ref>Hanbury (1959) p. 14</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nEnglish jurist [[Jeremy Bentham]] was a critic of Blackstone's theories.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bentham|first1=Jeremy|title=Comment on the Commentaries: A Criticism of William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|journal=Columbia Law Review (excerpted)|date=1763|volume=24|issue=4|pages=540\u2013542|jstor=1113015}}</ref> Others saw Blackstone's theories as inaccurate statements of English law, using the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], the [[Tractatus of Glanville]] and the [[1689 Bill of Rights]] as particularly obvious examples of laws Blackstone omitted.\n\n==Death==\nBlackstone had long suffered from [[gout]], and by November 1779 also had a nervous disorder which caused [[dizziness]], high blood pressure, and possibly [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 301</ref> By 3 February 1780 he was too weak to write, and after \"some Days almost totally insensible\", he died on 14 February.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 302</ref> After a service conducted by Bishop Barrington on 22 February, Blackstone was buried in the family vault under St Peter's Church, Wallingford. His estate at his death was worth less than \u00a315,000; therefore [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]] secured a \u00a3400 annual royal pension for Sarah Blackstone.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 303</ref> The initial reaction to Blackstone's death was subdued, but in December 1780 the Fellows of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] agreed that \"a Statue be erected to the memory of Sr W Blackstone deceased\". Constructed by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon]], the life-sized statue of Blackstone in his judicial robes cost \u00a3539, and has rested in the [[Codrington Library]] since 1872. His brother-in-law, James Clitherow, also published two volumes of [[Sir William Blackstone's Reports|his law reports]] which added \u00a31,287 to the estate, and in 1782 the ''Biographical History of Sir William Blackstone'' appeared.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 304</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Sir William Blackstone Front.jpg|thumbnail|right|A [[Sir William Blackstone (statue)|statue]] of Sir William Blackstone by [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] in front of the [[E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nBlackstone's primary legacy is his written work, specifically the ''Commentaries on the Laws of England''. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was \"almost inexhaustible\" in the 18th and 19th centuries, although the ''Commentaries''' emphasis on the [[Parliamentary sovereignty|sovereignty of Parliament]] drew ire. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] described Blackstone as \"an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 307</ref> Other commentators differ; one described him as \"the core element in the [[Age of Enlightenment|British Enlightenment]]\", comparing him to [[Montesquieu]], [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]] and [[Voltaire]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 308</ref> Academics have said that the ''Commentaries'' were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of [[substantive law]].<ref>Cairns (1984) p. 319</ref> At the time of publication, the [[common law]] of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. The ''Commentaries'' helped to solidify legal thinking.<ref>Miles (2000) p. 46</ref> At the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone's work gave the Law \"at least a veneer of scholarly respectability\".<ref name=mil57/> [[William Searle Holdsworth]], one of Blackstone's successors as [[Vinerian Professor of English Law|Vinerian Professor]], argued that \"if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that [the United States], and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [common] law\".<ref name=hol157>Holdsworth (1928) p. 157</ref>\n\nThe ''Commentaries'' had a particular influence in the United States; [[James Iredell]], an original [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] wrote that the ''Commentaries'' were \"Books admirably calculated for a young Student, and indeed may instruct the most learned . . Pleasure and Instruction go hand in hand\". When the ''Commentaries'' were first printed in North America, 1,400 copies were ordered for Philadelphia alone.<ref>Bader (1995) p. 7</ref> Academics have also noted the early reliance of the Supreme Court on the ''Commentaries'', probably due to a lack of US legal tradition at that time.<ref>Bader (1995) p. 6</ref> The US academic Robert Ferguson notes that \"all our formative documents \u2013 the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the [[Federalist Papers]] and the seminal decisions of the Supreme Court under [[John Marshall]] \u2013 were drafted by attorneys steeped in Sir William Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England''. So much was this the case that the ''Commentaries'' rank second only to the Bible as a literary and intellectual influence on the history of American institutions\".<ref>Bader (1995) p. 8</ref> Even today, the ''Commentaries'' are cited in Supreme Court decisions between 10 and 12 times a year.<ref name=mil57>Miles (2000) p. 57</ref><ref>Alschuler (1994) p. 898</ref>\n\nWithin United States academia and practise, as well as within the judiciary, the ''Commentaries'' had a substantial impact; with the scarcity of law books on the frontier, they were \"both the only law school and the only law library most American lawyers used to practise law in America for nearly a century after they were published\".<ref>Miles (2000) p. 56</ref> Blackstone had drawn up a plan for a dedicated School of Law, and submitted it to the [[University of Oxford]]; when the idea was rejected he included it in the ''Commentaries''. It is from this plan that the modern system of American law schools comes.<ref name=mil57/> Subscribers to the first edition of Blackstone, and later readers who were profoundly influenced by it, include [[James Iredell]], [[John Marshall]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[John Jay]], [[John Adams]], [[James Kent]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Alschuler (1994) p. 897</ref>\n\nIn the early 1920s the [[American Bar Association]] presented a statue of Blackstone to the English Bar Association, however, at the time, the sculpture was too tall to be placed in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London. The sculpture, designed by [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] was eventually cast in Europe and presented back to the US for display. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington, D.C. on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig, holding a copy of ''Commentaries''.

1780) was an English [[jurist]], [[judge]] and [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] politician of the eighteenth century. He is most noted for writing the ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''. Born into a middle-class family in London, Blackstone was educated at [[Charterhouse School]] before matriculating at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]] in 1738. After switching to and completing a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree, he was made a [[Fellow of All Souls#Fellowships|Fellow]] of [[All Souls, Oxford]] on 2 November 1743, admitted to [[Middle Temple]], and [[called to the Bar]] there in 1746. Following a slow start to his career as a barrister, Blackstone became heavily involved in university administration, becoming accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746 and Senior Bursar in 1750. Blackstone is considered responsible for completing the Codrington Library and Warton Building, and simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. On 3 July 1753 he formally gave up his practice as a barrister and instead embarked on a series of lectures on English law, the first of their kind. These were massively successful, earning him a total of \u00a3453 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|453|1755|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms), and led to the publication of ''[[An Analysis of the Laws of England]]'' in 1756, which repeatedly sold out and was used to preface his later works.\n\nOn 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]], immediately embarking on another series of lectures and publishing a similarly successful second treatise, titled ''[[A Discourse on the Study of the Law]]''. With his growing fame, Blackstone successfully returned to the bar and maintained a good practice, also securing election as [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[rotten borough]] of [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]] on 30 March 1761. In November 1765 he published the first of four volumes of ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', considered his ''magnum opus''; the completed work earned Blackstone \u00a314,000 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|14000|1766|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms). After repeated failures, he successfully gained appointment to the judiciary as a Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] on 16 February 1770, leaving to replace [[Edward Clive (judge)|Edward Clive]] as a [[Justice of the Common Pleas]] on 25 June. He remained in this position until his death, on 14 February 1780.\n\nBlackstone's four-volume ''Commentaries'' were designed to provide a complete overview of English law and were repeatedly republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783. Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by Henry John Stephen, first published in 1841, was reprinted until after the [[Second World War]]. Legal education in England had stalled; Blackstone's work gave the law \"at least a veneer of scholarly respectability\".<ref name=mil57/> [[William Searle Holdsworth]], one of Blackstone's successors as Vinerian Professor, argued that \"If the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that [[the United States]], and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [[common law]].\"<ref name=hol157/> In the United States, the ''Commentaries'' influenced [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Marshall]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[John Jay]], [[John Adams]], [[James Kent]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]], and remain frequently cited in [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions.\n\n==Early life and education==\nWilliam's father, Charles Blackstone, was a [[Mercery|silk mercer]] from [[Cheapside]],<ref>Doolittle (1983) p. 100</ref> the son of a wealthy [[apothecary]]. He became firm friends with Thomas Bigg, a [[Surgeon#Titles in the United Kingdom|surgeon]] and the son of Lovelace Bigg, a gentleman from [[Wiltshire]].<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 3</ref> After Bigg's sister Mary came to London, Charles eventually persuaded her to marry him in 1718. This was not seen as a good match for her, but the couple lived happily and had four sons, three of whom lived into adulthood.<ref>Odgers (1918) p. 599</ref> Charles (born August 1719) and Henry (May 1722), both became fellows of [[New College, Oxford]] and took [[holy orders]]. Their last son, William, was born on 10 July 1723, five months after Charles' death in February.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 13</ref>\n\nAlthough Charles and Mary Blackstone were members of the [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|middle class]] rather than landed gentry, they were particularly prosperous. Tax records show Charles Blackstone to have been the second most prosperous man in the parish in 1722, and death registers show that the family had several servants.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 15</ref> This, along with Thomas Bigg's assistance to the family following Charles' death, helps explain the educational upbringing of the children. William Blackstone was sent to [[Charterhouse School]] in 1730, nominated by Charles Wither, a relative of Mary Blackstone.<ref>de Montmorency (1917) p. 46</ref> William did well there, and became head of the school by age 15.  However, after Charles' death the family fortunes declined, and after Mary died (5 January 1736) the family's resources largely went to meet unpaid bills. William was able to remain at Charterhouse as a \"poor scholar\", having been named to that position in June 1735 after being nominated by [[Robert Walpole|Sir Robert Walpole]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 21</ref><ref>To recognize the Blackstone heritage at the school, in 1987 Charterhouse created the ''Sir William Blackstone Award'', a scholarship for the son of a lawyer.{{cite news|title=Professional News \u2013 Sir William Blackstone award|date=21 October 1987|work=Law Society Gazette|publisher=Law Society}}</ref>\n\nBlackstone revelled in Charterhouse's academic curriculum, particularly the Latin poetry of Ovid and Virgil. He began to attract note as a poet at school, writing a 30-line set of rhyming couplets to celebrate the wedding of [[Charterhouse School#Headmasters|James Hotchkis]], the headmaster. He also won a silver medal for his Latin verses on [[John Milton]], gave the annual Latin oration in 1738,<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 8</ref> and was noted as having been the favourite student of his masters.<ref>Prest (2008) pp. 24\u201325</ref> On 1 October 1738, taking advantage of a new scholarship available to Charterhouse students, Blackstone matriculated at [[Pembroke College, Oxford]].<ref name=od600>Odgers (1918) p. 600</ref>\n\n==Oxford==\n\n===Study===\n[[File:Pembroke Chapel Quad.JPG|thumb|right|[[Pembroke College, Oxford]], where Blackstone studied]]\nThere are few surviving records of Blackstone's undergraduate term at Oxford, but the curriculum of Pembroke College had been set out in 1624, and Prest notes that it was probably still followed in 1738, so Blackstone would have studied [[Greek language|Greek]], science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography and poetry.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 34</ref> Blackstone was particularly good at Greek, mathematics and poetry,<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 10</ref> with his notes on [[William Shakespeare]] being included in [[George Steevens]]' 1781 edition of Shakespeare's plays.<ref name=od600/> Many of Blackstone's undergraduate texts survive, and they include few legal texts, instead being wide-ranging; politics, current affairs, poetry, geometry and controversial theological texts.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 37</ref> The last element is understandable, given his family's theological interests, but the more surprising element is the sheer number of texts he owned given his relative poverty as a student.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 39</ref>\n\nOn 9 July 1740, after only a year and a half as a Bachelor of Arts student, Blackstone was admitted to study for a [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] degree, civil law being the only legal area recognised by his university. This degree course was seven years long, the first two \"supposedly devoted to a broad course of reading in humane studies\", which allowed him to study his own interests.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 40</ref> On 20 November 1741 he was admitted to the [[Middle Temple]],<ref>Odgers (1918) p. 601</ref> the first step on the road to becoming a [[barrister]], but this imposed no obligations and simply allowed a legal career to be an option.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 41</ref> At the time there was no proper legal education system, and Blackstone read (in his own time) ''[[Institutes of the Lawes of England|Coke on Littleton]]'', the works of [[Henry Finch]], and related legal tracts.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) pp. 16\u201317</ref>\n\nIn addition to his formal studies, Blackstone published a collection of poetry which included the draft version of ''The Lawyer to his Muse'', his most famous literary work. In 1743 he published ''Elements of Architecture'' and ''An Abridgement of Architecture'', two treatises on the rules governing the art of construction.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 44</ref> His next work (1747) was ''The Pantheon: A Vision'', an anonymously published book of poetry covering the various religions in the world. It depicts a narrator's walking dream through the buildings of various religions, which are all (other than Christianity) depicted in a negative light.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 47</ref> This followed his election as a [[Fellow of All Souls#Fellowships|Fellow]] of [[All Souls, Oxford]] on 2 November 1743,<ref>Holdsworth (1932) p. 261</ref> and his [[call to the Bar]] by the Middle Temple on 28 November 1746.<ref>Odgers (1918) p. 602</ref>\n\nHis call to the Bar saw Blackstone begin to alternate between Oxford and London, occupying chambers in [[Pump Court]] but living at [[All Souls, Oxford|All Souls College]]. As the central courts only sat for three months of the year, the rest of his time was spent on [[Assizes|Assize]] when his work at All Souls permitted.  He regularly acted as a law reporter; his personal notes on cases start with ''Hankey v Trotman'' (1746).<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 19</ref> Blackstone's barrister practice began slowly; his first case in the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] was in 1748, and he had only 6 additional motions there through 1751. Two appearances in the [[Court of Chancery]] are also noted, and he is known to have been consulted in [[Roger Newdigate]]'s long-running lawsuit there, but his early court appearances are infrequent.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 71</ref> This is considered to have been due to bad luck, with his call to the Bar occurring at the same time as the massive contraction in business by the central courts, along with his singular lack of connections due to his status as an orphan from the middle class; he was described as \"unrecognised and unemployed\".<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 24</ref> He filled his time by acting as counsel for Oxford, and from May 1749 with his election as [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] of [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 73</ref>\n\n===University administration===\n[[File:Analysis of the Laws of England.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[An Analysis of the Laws of England]]'', Blackstone's first legal treatise, published during this period]]\nWhile dividing his time, Blackstone became an administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and [[bursar]] on 28 November 1746.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 25</ref> Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, is attributed to his work.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 76</ref><ref>Holdsworth (1928) p. 156</ref> In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a \"perfectionist zeal\" in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 83</ref> In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, ''An Essay on Collateral Consanguinity'', which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls in an attempt to gain preeminence in elections.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) p. 29</ref> Completion of his [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to [[Convocation]], the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 96</ref> With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to \"no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [and] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which I am told may be beneficial to the University as well as myself\",<ref>Prest (2008) p. 107</ref> which was to give a set of lectures on the common law \u2013 the first lectures of that sort in the world.<ref>Holdsworth (1932) p. 262</ref>\n\nThis was not entirely out of benevolence; according to Prest, Blackstone was likely aware that an Oxford alumnus, [[Charles Viner (jurist)|Charles Viner]], was planning to endow a professorship of English law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 108</ref> The [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Oxford)|Regius Professorship of Civil Law]] had also become vacant in 1753; despite support from [[Lord Mansfield]], Blackstone had been rejected in favour of Robert Jenner, widely considered Blackstone's lesser intellectually but a far greater political mind.<ref>Lockmiller (1938) pp. 37\u201338</ref> In addition, a private lecture series would be extremely lucrative. While his All Souls fellowship gave him \u00a370 a year, records show that the lecture series brought him \u00a3116, \u00a3226 and \u00a3111 a year respectively from 1753 to 1755 \u2013 a total of \u00a3453 (\u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|453|1755|r=-3}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}} terms).<ref>Prest (2008) p. 112</ref> A prospectus was issued on 23 June 1753, and with a class of approximately 20 students, the first set of lectures were completed by July 1754. Despite Blackstone's limited oratory skills and a speaking style described by [[Jeremy Bentham]] as \"formal, precise and affected\", Blackstone's lectures were warmly appreciated.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 114</ref> The second and third series were far more popular, partly due to the then unusual use of printed handouts and lists of suggested reading. No copies of these handouts exist, but [[Alexander Popham (penal reformer)|Alexander Popham]], later a close friend of Blackstone, attended the lectures and made notes, which survive. These show Blackstone's attempts to reduce English law to a logical system, with the division of subjects later being the basis for his ''Commentaries''.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 115-7</ref><ref>Simpson (1981) p. 652</ref>\n\nFollowing his lecture series, Blackstone became more prominent in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge at the time had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law or their own customs, based on the civil law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 119</ref> With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far more involved in the university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 120</ref> He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 121</ref> This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, ''Friendship: An Ode'', in 1756.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 139</ref>\n\nIn 1756 Blackstone published the first of his full legal texts, the 200 page ''[[An Analysis of the Laws of England]]''. Published by the [[Clarendon Press]], the treatise was intended to demonstrate the \"Order, and principal Divisions\" of his lecture series, and a structured introduction to English law. Prest calls this \"a marked advance on any previous introduction to English law . . including constitutional, civil and criminal law, public and private law, substantive law and procedure, as well as some introductory jurisprudential content\".<ref name=pres143>Prest (2008) p. 143</ref> The initial print run of 1,000 copies almost immediately sold out, leading to the printing of three more 1,000-book lots over the next three years, which all sold out. A fifth edition was published in 1762,<ref name=pres144>Prest (2008) p. 144</ref> and a sixth, edited to take into account Blackstone's ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', in 1771.<ref>Cairns (1984) p. 340</ref> Because of the success of the ''Commentaries'', Prest remarks that \"relatively little scholarly attention has been paid to this work\";<ref name=pres143/> at the time, however, it was hailed as \"an elegant performance . . calculated to facilitate this branch of knowledge\".<ref name=pres144/>\n\n===Vinerian Professor of English Law===\n[[File:Allan Ramsay - King George III in coronation robes - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|[[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]], a patron of Blackstone]]\n\nOn 8 March 1758, the group executing Charles Viner's [[Will (law)|will]] reported to Convocation that Viner recommended creating a Chair of English Law, with a \u00a3200 salary. After much debate, this position was created, and on 20 October 1758 Blackstone was confirmed as the first [[Vinerian Professor of English Law]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 150</ref> On 24 October he gave his first lecture, to \"a crowded audience\"; the text was soon printed and published as ''[[A Discourse on the Study of the Law]]''. The lecture was tremendously popular, being described as a \"sensible, spirited and manly exhortation to the study of the law\"; the initial print run sold out, necessitating the publication of another 1,000 copies, and it was used to preface later versions of the ''Analysis'' and the first volume of the ''Commentaries''.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 151</ref> Within the university, however, Blackstone was not as popular. As soon as the lecture series opened, an anonymously written open letter was published charging that Blackstone had \"violated the Statutes of the University, by arbitrarily changing the Day appointed for reading his solemn Lectures\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 152</ref> Blackstone suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] soon after the first lecture, and on 24 November he launched a suit in the Chancellor's Court against \"William Jackson of the City of Oxford Printer\" for \u00a3500 damages, justified by Jackson \"printing and publishing a scandalous Libell notoriously reflecting on the Character of him the said William Blackstone\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 153</ref> Jackson had refused to reveal who ordered the anonymous pamphlet, leading to the suit, but it evidently did not proceed further.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 154</ref>\n\n[[File:William Blackstone, The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest (1st ed, 1759, title page) - 20141020.jpg|thumb|left|The title page of the first edition of Blackstone's ''The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest'' (1759)<ref>{{citation|author=William Blackstone|title=The Great Charter and Charter of the Forest, with other Authentic Instruments: To which is Prefixed an Introductory Discourse, Containing the History of the Charters.

While quick to take offence at perceived slights on his own character and motives, he could also show surprising indifference to the effect his words and actions might have on others\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 161</ref> This marked the beginning of his break with Oxford, which coincided with his growing influence outside the university. In 1759 [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|Prince George]]'s official tutor, requested copies of Blackstone's lectures, which he forwarded. Later that year Blackstone was paid \u00a3200 by the Prince, who became an \"appreciative, loyal, and soon to be incomparably influential patron\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 163</ref> This patronage, and Blackstone's purchase of a set of chambers in the [[Inner Temple]], also transferring to that Inn, were significant steps in his departure from Oxford. In 1759 Blackstone published another two works, ''The Great Charter and the Charter of the Forest, with other authentic Instruments'', described as a \"major piece of pioneering scholarship\" leading to Blackstone's election to the [[Society of Antiquaries of London|Society of Antiquaries]] in February 1761,<ref>Prest (2008) pp. 164\u20135</ref> and ''A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple'', which was later used, almost verbatim, as chapters 14 and 15 of the ''Commentaries''.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 168</ref>\n\n==London==\n\n===Work at the Bar===\nWith sponsorship from the Prince of Wales and his success with the ''Analysis'', Blackstone began work as a barrister, although he kept up his lecture series at Oxford. By 1760 he had become \"a very eminent figure indeed in the world of letters\", and his legal practice grew as a result. Although not considered a great barrister of the period, he maintained a steady flow of cases, primarily in the King's Bench and [[Exchequer of Pleas]]. On the death of the third [[Willoughby Bertie, 3rd Earl of Abingdon|Earl of Abingdon]], Blackstone was retained as counsel for the executors and trustees to oversee the family's attempts to pay off debts and meet other obligations.<ref>Prest (2008) pp. 176\u20137</ref> On 5 May 1761 he married Sarah Clitherow, a member of a family of [[Social structure of the United Kingdom|lesser gentry]] from [[Middlesex]]. Their first child, William Bertie Blackstone, born 21 August 1762, did not survive to adulthood.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 179</ref> Seven more children were born; Henry, James, Sarah, Mary, Philippa, William, Charles, and George, who also died in childhood.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 208</ref> The Blackstones had a large estate in [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]] in Berkshire, including 120 acres (46 ha) of [[pasture]]land around the [[River Thames]] and the right of [[advowson]] over [[St Peter's Church, Wallingford|St Peter's Church]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 211</ref>\n\nIn February 1761 Blackstone was considered as a potential [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] candidate for the [[rotten borough]] of [[Hindon (UK Parliament constituency)|Hindon]] in Wiltshire. After consultation with friends, he agreed to this prospect \u2013 at the same time refusing the offer of appointment as [[Lord Chief Justice of Ireland]]. On 30 March 1761 he was returned for Hindon, and took his seat.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 181</ref> This did not limit his legal work, initially, with the seat being given without a requirement to attend or vote in a particular way, and the grant of a [[patent of precedence]] at the same time actually increased the demand on his time.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 182</ref> Court records show him pleading before [[Lord Mansfield]] in the Court of King's Bench soon after his election, and acting as counsel in ''Tonson v Collins'', a copyright case, ''Thiquet v Bath'', an important case on international law, and ''R v [[Chevalier d'Eon|d'Eon]]'', acting for the prosecution in a feud over [[Louis XV]]'s newly appointed cross-dressing Ambassador to the United Kingdom.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 185</ref>\n\nWith this increase in his practice, Blackstone also saw an increase in his out-of-court work, writing opinions and recommendations for various Oxford colleges, the MP [[Jonathan Rashleigh (1693\u20131764)|Jonathan Rashleigh]] and the fourth [[Willoughby Bertie, 4th Earl of Abingdon|Earl of Abingdon]], who paid him to draft several private Acts of Parliament.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 188</ref> In December 1761, he asked [[William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne|Lord Shelburne]], a patron, for his assistance in gaining appointment as [[Chief Justice of Chester]], writing again in July 1762 to \"prevail upon Lord Bute to recommend me to his Majesty's Notice\", anticipating an upcoming vacancy in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 195</ref> Parliamentary service was considered a \"desirable if never absolutely essential qualification for would-be English judges\",<ref>Prest (2008) p. 200</ref> something that did not necessarily bode well for Blackstone. Naturally inarticulate and reticent, he was an infrequent and \"indifferent\" speaker during his first session of Parliament, speaking only 14 times in seven years. His chosen career did lend him to politics, in that the lawyers in the House of Commons were often added to select committees to provide them with technical expertise in drafting legislation.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 201</ref> He again applied for a judicial post in December 1762, after an opening in the Exchequer of Pleas came up, but lost to George Perrott, a leading Exchequer barrister. The next five vacancies also failed to go to Blackstone, after the appointment of [[Charles Pratt, 1st Earl Camden|Lord Camden]] (a Whig) as [[Lord Chancellor]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 206</ref>\n\n===Commentaries on the Laws of England===\nIn 1765 Blackstone announced his resignation from the [[Vinerian Professor of English Law|Vinerian Chair]], effective after his 1766 lectures. These were divided into two 14-lecture series, on \"private wrongs\" and \"public wrongs\" delivered between 12 February and 24 April.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 212</ref> At this point Blackstone had published nothing new since ''A Treatise on the Law of Descents in Fee Simple'' in 1759.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 214</ref> The decision to resign was most likely due to the increasing demands of his legal practice and the reduced profit from the lectures, which, after peaking at \u00a3340 in 1762, dropped to \u00a3239 a year later and to \u00a3203 for the final round of lectures in 1765-6.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 217</ref> In response, Blackstone decided to publish a new book \u2013 ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]''. The first volume was published in November 1765, bringing the author \u00a31,600 \u2013 the full work would eventually bring in over \u00a314,000. [[Owen Ruffhead]] described Volume I as \"masterly\", noting that \"Mr Blackstone is perhaps the first who has treated the body of the law in a liberal, elegant and constitutional manner. A vein of good sense and moderation runs through every page\". Every copy was sold within six months, and the second and third volumes, published in October 1766 and June 1768, received a similar reception.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 220</ref> The fourth and final volume appeared in 1770, dealing with Criminal Law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 246</ref> With the financial success of the ''Commentaries'', Blackstone moved in 1768 from his London property in Carey Fields to No. 55 Lincoln's Inn Fields. Neighbours included the [[Sardinia]]n ambassador, [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society P, Q, R#R|Sir Walter Rawlinson]], [[Robert Henley, 1st Earl of Northington|Lord Northington]], [[John Morton (MP)|John Morton]] and the [[Earl of Abingdon|Third Earl of Abingdon]], making it an appropriate house for a \"great and able Lawyer\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 235</ref>\n\nBlackstone's treatise was republished in 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778 and in a posthumous edition in 1783.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 287</ref> Reprints of the first edition, intended for practical use rather than antiquary interest, were published until the 1870s in England and Wales, and a working version by [[Henry John Stephen]], first published in 1841,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxforddnb.com/view/article/26372|title=Oxford DNB article: Stephen, Henry (subscription needed)|last=Stephen|first=Leslie|author2=Patrick Polden |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> was reprinted until after the [[Second World War]].<ref>Milsom (1991) p. 1</ref> The first American edition was produced in 1772; prior to this, over 1,000 copies had already been sold in the Thirteen Colonies.<ref>Alschuler (1994) p. 896</ref>\n\n===Judge===\n[[File:SirWilliamBlackstone.jpg|thumb|right|Blackstone in 1774, after his appointment as a Justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]]]]\nEven after the publication of the ''Commentaries'', Blackstone's chances of judicial appointment remained slim. While he was old enough, experienced enough and widely respected, the presence of Lord Camden as Lord Chancellor and Blackstone's lack of aristocratic patrons at the time hindered his chances. In January 1770, however, Lord Grafton's government began to fall, with Camden resigning on 17 January and [[Solicitor-General for England and Wales|Solicitor-General]] John Dunning, following him. [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] appointed [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] as Prime Minister, and North picked [[Charles Yorke]] as Lord Chancellor.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 254</ref> Yorke's death on 20 January, after holding the position for less than three days, left several important legal positions within the government open. As such, Blackstone, now MP for [[Westbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Westbury]],<ref>Doolittle (1983) p. 101</ref> was apparently approached to become Solicitor-General; he refused, not wanting to deal with the complicated duties attached to the position.<ref name=pres255>Prest (2008) p. 255</ref>\n\nOn 9 February 1770 \u2013 apparently with the intervention of the King, and possibly [[Lord Mansfield]] \u2013 Blackstone became a [[Justice of the Common Pleas]], succeeding [[Edward Clive (judge)|Edward Clive]], and was made a [[Serjeant-at-Law]] on 12 February.<ref>Waterman (1934) p. 554</ref> After only four days it was announced that [[Joseph Yates (judge)|Joseph Yates]] was to move to the Common Pleas, and Blackstone was again sworn in as a judge, this time of the Court of King's Bench.<ref name=pres255/> This was apparently due to Yates' poor health; Lord Mansfield ran a busy court as [[Lord Chief Justice of England|Lord Chief Justice]], and it was felt that his transfer to the Common Pleas was for the best. Others commented that it was instead due to political and judicial disagreement, with Yates unwilling to stomach the changes which Mansfield made to English law.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 260</ref> Blackstone sat regularly as a judge, despite bouts of ill health, and also served on various circuit courts.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 262</ref> Prest describes him as an \"exceptionally careful, conscientious and well-respected judge . . his judgments ranging between narrowly framed technicalities [and] broad statements of public commentary\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 263</ref> He was, however, considered a poor trial judge, being reversed on appeal more frequently than any of his peers.<ref>[[Stanley Nider Katz|Katz, Stanley N.]], \"Introduction,\" Sir William Blackstone, Commentaries on the Law of England, Vol. I (reprinted), University of Chicago Press, 1979. p. v</ref>\n\nBlackstone returned to the Common Pleas on 25 June 1770, having spent less than six months in the King's Bench;<ref>Sainty (1993) p.81</ref> [[Jeremy Bentham]] asserted that this was due to Mansfield's having Blackstone removed similarly to his removal of Yates. Bentham asserted that in the King's Bench, Blackstone was \"always in hot water\", and that there was \"heartburning\" between the two; Bentham's account is considered dubious because historically, Mansfield and Blackstone had an excellent relationship, with the third volume of the ''Commentaries'' describing Mansfield as \"a judge, whose masterly acquaintance with the law of nations was known and revered by every state in Europe\".<ref>Waterman (1934) p. 555</ref> There is only one recorded King's Bench case, ''R v Proprietors of Birmingham Canal Navigation'', in which Blackstone and Mansfield disagreed.<ref>Hanbury (1959) p. 2</ref>\n\nIn the Common Pleas, Blackstone operated under a civil jurisdiction rather than a mixed civil and criminal one. This played to his strengths, and many of his decisions are considered farsighted; the principle in ''Blaney v Hendricks'', for example, that interest is due on an account where money was lent, which anticipated Section 3 of the [[Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934]].<ref>Hanbury (1959) p. 5</ref> Blackstone's decision in ''Goldswain's Case'' was later repeated by [[Lord Denning]] in ''Falmouth Boat Construction Co v Howell'' in 1950.<ref>Hanbury (1959) p. 14</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\nEnglish jurist [[Jeremy Bentham]] was a critic of Blackstone's theories.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bentham|first1=Jeremy|title=Comment on the Commentaries: A Criticism of William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England|journal=Columbia Law Review (excerpted)|date=1763|volume=24|issue=4|pages=540\u2013542|jstor=1113015}}</ref> Others saw Blackstone's theories as inaccurate statements of English law, using the [[Constitutions of Clarendon]], the [[Tractatus of Glanville]] and the [[1689 Bill of Rights]] as particularly obvious examples of laws Blackstone omitted.\n\n==Death==\nBlackstone had long suffered from [[gout]], and by November 1779 also had a nervous disorder which caused [[dizziness]], high blood pressure, and possibly [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 301</ref> By 3 February 1780 he was too weak to write, and after \"some Days almost totally insensible\", he died on 14 February.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 302</ref> After a service conducted by Bishop Barrington on 22 February, Blackstone was buried in the family vault under St Peter's Church, Wallingford. His estate at his death was worth less than \u00a315,000; therefore [[William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland|William Eden]] secured a \u00a3400 annual royal pension for Sarah Blackstone.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 303</ref> The initial reaction to Blackstone's death was subdued, but in December 1780 the Fellows of [[All Souls College, Oxford|All Souls College]] agreed that \"a Statue be erected to the memory of Sr W Blackstone deceased\". Constructed by [[John Bacon (sculptor, born 1740)|John Bacon]], the life-sized statue of Blackstone in his judicial robes cost \u00a3539, and has rested in the [[Codrington Library]] since 1872. His brother-in-law, James Clitherow, also published two volumes of [[Sir William Blackstone's Reports|his law reports]] which added \u00a31,287 to the estate, and in 1782 the ''Biographical History of Sir William Blackstone'' appeared.<ref>Prest (2008) p. 304</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Sir William Blackstone Front.jpg|thumbnail|right|A [[Sir William Blackstone (statue)|statue]] of Sir William Blackstone by [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] in front of the [[E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse]] in Washington, D.C.]]\nBlackstone's primary legacy is his written work, specifically the ''Commentaries on the Laws of England''. Demand for reprinted, abridged and translated versions was \"almost inexhaustible\" in the 18th and 19th centuries, although the ''Commentaries''' emphasis on the [[Parliamentary sovereignty|sovereignty of Parliament]] drew ire. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] described Blackstone as \"an inferior writer, without liberality of mind or depth of judgment\".<ref>Prest (2008) p. 307</ref> Other commentators differ; one described him as \"the core element in the [[Age of Enlightenment|British Enlightenment]]\", comparing him to [[Montesquieu]], [[Cesare Beccaria|Beccaria]] and [[Voltaire]].<ref>Prest (2008) p. 308</ref> Academics have said that the ''Commentaries'' were crucial in changing English Law from a system based on actions to a system of [[substantive law]].<ref>Cairns (1984) p. 319</ref> At the time of publication, the [[common law]] of England was still, in some ways, in its infancy, with people uncertain as to what the law was. The ''Commentaries'' helped to solidify legal thinking.<ref>Miles (2000) p. 46</ref> At the same time, legal education had stalled, and Blackstone's work gave the Law \"at least a veneer of scholarly respectability\".<ref name=mil57/> [[William Searle Holdsworth]], one of Blackstone's successors as [[Vinerian Professor of English Law|Vinerian Professor]], argued that \"if the Commentaries had not been written when they were written, I think it very doubtful that [the United States], and other English speaking countries would have so universally adopted the [common] law\".<ref name=hol157>Holdsworth (1928) p. 157</ref>\n\nThe ''Commentaries'' had a particular influence in the United States; [[James Iredell]], an original [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] wrote that the ''Commentaries'' were \"Books admirably calculated for a young Student, and indeed may instruct the most learned . . Pleasure and Instruction go hand in hand\". When the ''Commentaries'' were first printed in North America, 1,400 copies were ordered for Philadelphia alone.<ref>Bader (1995) p. 7</ref> Academics have also noted the early reliance of the Supreme Court on the ''Commentaries'', probably due to a lack of US legal tradition at that time.<ref>Bader (1995) p. 6</ref> The US academic Robert Ferguson notes that \"all our formative documents \u2013 the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], the [[Federalist Papers]] and the seminal decisions of the Supreme Court under [[John Marshall]] \u2013 were drafted by attorneys steeped in Sir William Blackstone's ''Commentaries on the Laws of England''. So much was this the case that the ''Commentaries'' rank second only to the Bible as a literary and intellectual influence on the history of American institutions\".<ref>Bader (1995) p. 8</ref> Even today, the ''Commentaries'' are cited in Supreme Court decisions between 10 and 12 times a year.<ref name=mil57>Miles (2000) p. 57</ref><ref>Alschuler (1994) p. 898</ref>\n\nWithin United States academia and practise, as well as within the judiciary, the ''Commentaries'' had a substantial impact; with the scarcity of law books on the frontier, they were \"both the only law school and the only law library most American lawyers used to practise law in America for nearly a century after they were published\".<ref>Miles (2000) p. 56</ref> Blackstone had drawn up a plan for a dedicated School of Law, and submitted it to the [[University of Oxford]]; when the idea was rejected he included it in the ''Commentaries''. It is from this plan that the modern system of American law schools comes.<ref name=mil57/> Subscribers to the first edition of Blackstone, and later readers who were profoundly influenced by it, include [[James Iredell]], [[John Marshall]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], [[John Jay]], [[John Adams]], [[James Kent]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]].<ref>Alschuler (1994) p. 897</ref>\n\nIn the early 1920s the [[American Bar Association]] presented a statue of Blackstone to the English Bar Association, however, at the time, the sculpture was too tall to be placed in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]] in London. The sculpture, designed by [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] was eventually cast in Europe and presented back to the US for display. [[United States Congress|Congress]] approved the placement of the sculpture in Washington, D.C. on 15 March 1943, and appropriated $10,000 for the installation. The bronze statue is a nine-foot (2.7 m) standing portrait of Blackstone wearing judicial robes and a long curly wig, holding a copy of ''Commentaries''. It is placed on a tall granite base and stands on [[Constitution Avenue]] & 3rd Street NW.<ref name=\"SOS\">{{cite web|author=Smithsonian|year=1993|title=Sir William Blackstone, (sculpture)|website=Save Outdoor Sculpture|publisher=Smithsonian|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=all&source=~!siartinventories&uri=full=3100001~!324786~!0#focus}}</ref><ref>Holdsworth (1928) p. 163</ref> The town of [[Blackstone, Virginia]] is named after him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownblackstone.org/visit-blackstone-virginia.html|title=Visit Downtown Blackstone Virginia|publisher=Downtown Blackstone Inc.|accessdate=4 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414142250/http://www.downtownblackstone.org/visit-blackstone-virginia.html|archivedate=14 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe North Wall [[Frieze]] in the courtroom of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] depicts William Blackstone, as one of the most influential legal commentators in world history.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf|title=US Supreme Court Courtroom Friezes|accessdate=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Blackstone's Ratio or Blackstone's Formulation===\n{{main|Blackstone's Ratio}}\nAmong the most well-known of Blackstone's contributions to judicial theory is his own statement of the principle that it \"is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir William Blackstone|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/68589/supplemental-information|website=Britannica|accessdate=29 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile this argument originates at least as far back as Genesis 18:23\u201332 in the Bible,<ref name=Volokh>[http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/guilty.htm \"''n'' Guilty Men\"], 146 University of Pennsylvania Law Review 173, Alexander Volokh, 1997.</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=72mZ1EMFRNkC&pg=PA187 ''Why Terrorism Works: Understanding the Threat, Responding to the Challenge''], Yale University Press, Alan M.

[[John Bellenden Ker]] (1765?\u20131842), for example, wrote four volumes arguing that English nursery rhymes were actually written in 'Low Saxon', a hypothetical early form of Dutch. He then 'translated' them back into English, revealing in particular a strong tendency to [[anti-clericalism]].<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Carpenter|Prichard|1984|p=290}} Many of the ideas about the links between rhymes and historical persons, or events, can be traced back to Katherine Elwes's book ''The Real Personages of Mother Goose'' (1930), in which she linked famous nursery-rhyme characters with real people, on little or no evidence. She assumed that children's songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative, propaganda or covert protest, and rarely considered that they could have been written simply for entertainment.<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Opie|2004|p=179}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale, light-hearted updating, like Felix Dennis's ''When Jack Sued Jill \u2013 Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times'' (2006), or satires written as if from the point of view of political correctness in order to condemn reform.<ref>F.

The definitive study of English rhymes remains the work of [[Iona and Peter Opie]].<ref name=Opie1951 />\n\n==Meanings of nursery rhymes==\nMany nursery rhymes have been argued to have hidden meanings and origins. [[John Bellenden Ker]] (1765?\u20131842), for example, wrote four volumes arguing that English nursery rhymes were actually written in 'Low Saxon', a hypothetical early form of Dutch. He then 'translated' them back into English, revealing in particular a strong tendency to [[anti-clericalism]].<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Carpenter|Prichard|1984|p=290}} Many of the ideas about the links between rhymes and historical persons, or events, can be traced back to Katherine Elwes's book ''The Real Personages of Mother Goose'' (1930), in which she linked famous nursery-rhyme characters with real people, on little or no evidence. She assumed that children's songs were a peculiar form of coded historical narrative, propaganda or covert protest, and rarely considered that they could have been written simply for entertainment.<ref name=Wilton2004 />{{sfn|Opie|2004|p=179}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!

Most attempts to reform nursery rhymes on this basis appear to be either very small scale, light-hearted updating, like Felix Dennis's ''When Jack Sued Jill \u2013 Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times'' (2006), or satires written as if from the point of view of political correctness in order to condemn reform.<ref>F.
