The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

Owned by the ''De La Salle Brothers Philippines'' and administered by the ''Sisters of St. Paul de Chartres'', it offers a [[Tertiary referral hospital|tertiary level of medical care]]. The offices of the clinical departments and the full-time clinical faculty members are in this hospital. Since 1995, the expansion program has increased the hospital's bed capacity to a total of 300 beds. The De La Salle University Medical Center includes many [[state-of-the-art]] medical equipment. The hospital also leads other private hospitals in Cavite in setting up medical wards intended for the poor enrolled in the Cavite Governor's health reform program, Dignidad at Kalidad (DK). <ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center |url=https://www.spchcm.com/hospitals/dlsumc |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The DLSUMC Medical Arts Center |url=https://architizer.com/projects/the-dlsumc-medical-arts-center/ |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=DLSU Medical Center in Dasmari\u00f1as, Cavite upgrades facility |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2014/05/19/1324141/dlsu-medical-center-dasmarias-cavite-upgrades-facility |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nThe De La Salle University Medical Center was initially inaugurated as a 180-bed teaching and training hospital of the then Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine in 1982. In 1987, the De La Salle University system run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools acquired ownership of both the college and hospital. The hospital is administered by the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres, a Catholic religious congregation providing health services throughout the country.\n\nIn 1990, a 4-storey annex, the Raul Wu Chiu Kuan Building was added, increasing bed capacity to 175. Modern equipment continued to be acquired to make DLSUMC comparable with any of the large hospitals in Metro Manila. A Pulmonary Unit, [[Hemodialysis]] Unit, 12-bed [[Intensive Care Unit]], Cardiovascular Laboratory, [[CT Scan]], Echo-Doppler, and [[Medical ultrasound|Ultrasonography]] are just some of the services offered by the medical center.\n\nAugust 28, 1997 marked the inauguration of the 10-storey hospital annex building, the De La Salle University-Do\u00f1a Teodorica Favis Vda. De Rivera Hall.\n\nIn October 1999, the De La Salle University Medical Center became the first hospital in the Philippines to receive an [[ISO 9001]] Certification and in July 2003 it received a Certification by the [[Technischer \u00dcberwachungsverein|TUV\u2013Rheinland]] and Berlin\u2013 Brandenburg Group of Companies.<ref>{{cite web |title=De La Salle University Medical Center History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/dlsumc/about/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Departments and Services===\n*[[Anesthesia]]                        \n*[[Emergency Medicine]]                \n*[[Family medicine|Family and]] [[Community health|Community Medicine]]     \n*[[Internal Medicine]]\n**''[[Allergy]] and [[Immunology]], [[Cardiology]], [[Dermatology]], [[Endocrinology]], [[Gastroenterology]], [[Hematology]], [[Infectious Diseases]],  [[Nephrology]], [[Oncology]], [[Pulmonology]], [[Neurology]], and [[Rheumatology]]''\n*Laboratory Medicine\n**''Hematology, [[Serology]] and Immunology, [[Clinical Chemistry]], [[Microscopy]], [[Microbiology]], [[Blood Transfusion]], [[Surgical pathology|Surgical Pathology]] and [[Cytology]]''\n*[[Obstetrics]] and [[Gynecology]]\n**''[[Perinatology]], OB-Gyne [[Ultrasound]], Trophoblastic Disease, Gynecologic Oncology, Reproductive Endocrinology and [[Infertility]], Infectious Disease, and Gynecologic [[Endoscopy]]''\n*[[Ophthalmology]]                    \n*[[Orthopedics]]\n**''[[Major trauma|Trauma]] Surgery, [[Sports Medicine]] and Arthroscopic Surgery, [[Joint]] Replacement Surgery, [[Shoulder]] Surgery, [[Vertebral column|Spine]] Surgery, Musculoskeletal [[Tumor]] Surgery, Orthopedic Pediatric Surgery, Limb Lengthening and Deformity Correction, [[Foot]] and [[Ankle]] Surgery''\n*[[Otorhinolaryngology]] (ENT)\n**''Head and Neck Surgery, [[Audiology]], [[Otology]], Rhinopharyngology, [[Laryngology]] and Voice Rehabilitation, Bronchoesophagology, Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, Facial Aesthetic Surgery, Newborn Hearing Screening, Hearing and Audiometer Evaluator, and [[Sleep medicine|Sleep Laboratory]]''\n*[[Pediatrics]]\n*[[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation]]\n*[[Psychiatry]]\n*[[Radiology]]\n**''[[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[Computed tomography|CT-Scan]], [[Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry|DEXA Bone Densitometry]], [[Nuclear Medicine]], [[Mammography]], Ultrasonography, C-Arm Machine Scan and General Radiology''\n*[[Surgery]]\n\n==Angelo King Medical Research Center==\n<center>''Hall of Fame, Manuel L.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.

A directed graph without directed cycles is called a ''[[directed acyclic graph]]''.

This is because the edge K-I is a chord.]]\n\nA [[chordless cycle]] in a graph, also called a hole or an induced cycle, is a cycle such that no two vertices of the cycle are connected by an edge that does not itself belong to the cycle. An antihole is the [[complement graph|complement]] of a graph hole. Chordless cycles may be used to characterize [[perfect graph]]s: by the [[strong perfect graph theorem]], a graph is perfect if and only if none of its holes or antiholes have an odd number of vertices that is greater than three. A [[chordal graph]], a special type of perfect graph, has no holes of any size greater than three.\n\nThe [[Girth (graph theory)|girth]] of a graph is the length of its shortest cycle; this cycle is necessarily chordless. [[Cage (graph theory)|Cages]] are defined as the smallest regular graphs with given combinations of degree and girth.\n\nA [[peripheral cycle]] is a cycle in a graph with the property that every two edges not on the cycle can be connected by a path whose interior vertices avoid the cycle. In a graph that is not formed by adding one edge to a cycle, a peripheral cycle must be an induced cycle.\n\n== Cycle space ==\nThe term ''cycle'' may also refer to an element of the [[cycle space]] of a graph. There are many cycle spaces, one for each coefficient field or ring.

Since retiring from playing the game in 1982, Hiddink has gone on to enjoy an illustrious career in management, leading both clubs and countries from across the globe to achieve various titles and feats.\n\nIn March 1987, Hiddink was appointed [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] manager after previously serving as assistant. Hiddink's PSV side won three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles, three consecutive [[KNVB Cup]]s and the [[1987\u201388 European Cup|European Cup]] in the historic [[Treble (association football)|Treble]]-winning season of [[1987\u201388 PSV Eindhoven season|1987\u201388]]. Hiddink spent one unsuccessful season at [[Istanbul]] side [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]], then the following season was appointed manager of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], where he stayed until November 1993. He returned to the [[Mestalla Stadium|Mestalla]] in March 1994, where he stayed for the rest of the [[1993\u201394 La Liga|1993\u201394]] season.\n\nHiddink then took charge of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] in January 1995, leading the Dutch to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]] and a fourth-place finish in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. He resigned as Netherlands manager after the World Cup, where he was then appointed manager of Spanish giants [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. His time in [[Madrid]] ended prematurely after he was sacked in February 1999 as Real were struggling in the league. He took over the reins at fellow [[La Liga]] side [[Real Betis]] in February 2000, but was sacked just three months later, following the season's conclusion.\n\nThe lure of taking another team to a World Cup led to Hiddink taking the [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea national team]] job in January 2001. [[Korea Republic|South Korea]] were joint hosts of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], so expectations were high. He led South Korea to a historic 4th-placed finish and became a national hero there.<ref>{{Cite web|title = BBC SPORT {{!}} WORLD CUP {{!}} Results|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/bsp/statistics/results.stm|publisher = BBC|access-date = 14 January 2016}}</ref> Hiddink returned to the Netherlands to rejoin PSV after the conclusion of the World Cup. During his second spell, he won three more Eredivise titles and another KNVB Cup, making him the most successful football manager in Dutch history. In July 2005, Hiddink was appointed manager of the [[Australia national soccer team|Australian national team]], serving as manager of both PSV and Australia simultaneously. He led Australia to qualify for their first World Cup in 32 years, while at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] itself, he led the nation to the knockout stages, the first time in the Socceroos' history. Following the World Cup, he joined the [[Russia national football team|Russian national team]]. Russia scraped through qualification at the expense of [[England national football team|England]], ultimately reaching the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].\n\nIn February 2009, while still managing Russia, Hiddink was appointed interim manager of English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He enjoyed success during his short stay at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], winning the [[FA Cup]], whilst restoring Chelsea to a respectable position in the league. Meanwhile, after Russia failed to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Hiddink resigned as its manager. He returned to Turkey as [[Turkey national football team|Turkish national team]] manager, but his time in charge ended two years later after the nation failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. In February 2012, Hiddink made a return to club management, taking charge of Russian side [[FC Anzhi Makhachkala|Anzhi Makhachkala]]. After a period of relative success, Hiddink left Anzhi in July 2013.\n\nFollowing the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Hiddink succeeded [[Louis van Gaal]] as [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] manager, his second stint in charge of his home nation. His time at the helm ended, however, as the Netherlands were struggling to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]]; he was subsequently relieved of his post and replaced by [[Danny Blind]]. Following this, nearly six years after his previous departure from Chelsea, Hiddink was again appointed interim manager of the London-based club in December 2015 following the sacking of [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]].\n\n==Playing career==\nHiddink was born in [[Varsseveld]]<ref name=BDFutbol/> and started his career as a player in the youth side of amateur club SC Varsseveld. He turned professional after signing on for Dutch club [[De Graafschap]] in 1967. Hiddink played at the [[Doetinchem]] club under manager [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]]. In 1973, Hiddink and manager de Visser earned promotion to the [[Eredivisie]], the top league in Dutch football.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oeuvreprijs naar Piet de Visser |url=http://www.net2client.com/ZZZ/08/04101/Uitslagen_2004.htm?MCT7evlngrp3%C3%BE |publisher=Rinus Michels Awards 2005 |date=28 May 2005 |accessdate=17 January 2007 |language=Dutch |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928064135/http://www.net2client.com/ZZZ/08/04101/Uitslagen_2004.htm?MCT7evlngrp3%C3%BE |archivedate=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ever since, the careers of the two Dutchmen have intersected: De Visser scouted numerous South American players, such as PSV players [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Rom\u00e1rio]] (who played under Hiddink at PSV from 1988 until 1990) and former Chelsea defender [[Alex Rodrigo Dias da Costa|Alex]], for Hiddink's PSV. Also, De Visser, in his role as personal advisor to [[Roman Abramovich]], was influential in bringing Hiddink to the [[Russia national football team]] and more recently to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as caretaker manager following the dismissal of Brazilian [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]]. It was De Visser who introduced Hiddink to Abramovich during a meeting in [[Eindhoven]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite news | title=Will the Kremlin demand the final say in Hiddink's future at Chelsea?| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1145538/Will-Kremlin-demand-final-say-Hiddinks-future-Chelsea.html | newspaper=Daily Mail | date=14 February 2009 | accessdate=14 February 2009 | location=London | first=Rob | last=Draper}}</ref> He spent most of his playing career at De Graafschap, including three years under de Visser, and remains a fan of the club. He joined [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] in 1970, but after failing to win a permanent position in the team, he rejoined De Graafschap after just one year and remained there until 1977. In 1981, he rejoined De Graafschap and retired a year later. He generally played as a [[Midfielder (association football)|midfielder]] during his playing days.\n\n==Managerial career==\n\n===Early club career===\n{{multiple image | direction = vertical | width = 220\n|image1=Ajax tegen PSV 2-0 trainer Guus Hiddink , kop, Bestanddeelnr 934-3348.jpg\n|caption1=Guus Hiddink in 1988 as manager of [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].\n|image2=Aankomst PSV met Europa Cup I op vliegveld Eindhoven Hans van Breukelen en trai, Bestanddeelnr 934-2544.jpg\n|caption2=Hiddink (right) and [[Hans van Breukelen]] (left) holding the European Cup on arrival at [[Eindhoven Airport]]\n}}\nHaving honed his coaching skills as an assistant manager, Hiddink took over the managerial role at [[PSV Eindhoven]] in 1987 after also holding the assistant manager position for the club from 1983 to March 1987. Hiddink took over in March 1987, whilst the team was trailing by three points behind [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] with ten matches remaining in the [[1986\u201387 Eredivisie|league]]. PSV, however, managed to win the championship six points ahead of Ajax. It was at PSV where he led the team to its first ever [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] triumph in 1988 (and [[The Treble]]), affirming the Eindhoven club's ranking as one of the three giants of Dutch football, alongside rivals Ajax and [[Feyenoord]]. He also won three [[Eredivisie]] titles with the club in between 1987 and 1990. \"Hiddink will never take all the credit for himself, he will also involve his staff in it. That adds to the strong sense of unity. Hiddink has final responsibility, but always shares it with the team around him. He is a real team player,\" said [[Berry van Aerle]], who was coached by Hiddink in two separate periods with PSV.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n| url        = http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=418237.html\n| title      = Van Aerle about Hiddink: \"He is a real team player\"\n| work       = Berend Scholten @ UEFA.com\n| date       = 5 May 2006\n}}\n</ref>\n\nHiddink also had a coaching stint at Turkish club [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.

After a 2\u20131 loss to the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] team in January 2002, he was criticized again for not taking his job seriously.<ref name=\"nyt_sk_savior\" /> Nevertheless, the team he assembled was a cohesive unit. However, Hiddink began focusing on physical fitness for players during training in preparation for the World Cup later that year.\n\nIn the World Cup itself, the South Korean team achieved its first ever victory in the first stage (2\u20130, against [[Poland national football team|Poland]]), and after a 1\u20131 draw with the U.S. and a further 1\u20130 victory against heavily favoured [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], the South Korean team qualified for the second round.\n\nTheir second round opponents were [[Italy national football team|Italy]], who they defeated 2\u20131 on the golden goal rule. The Korean public then began to dream of a semi-final berth, a dream that was realized after defeating [[Spain national football team|Spain]] on penalties in the quarter-final.

former player.He enjoyed a long career playing as a [[midfielder]] in his native [[Netherlands]], playing for sides such as PSV Eindhoven, [[De Graafschap]] and [[NEC (football club)|NEC Nijmegen]], as well as some time spent playing in the United States. Since retiring from playing the game in 1982, Hiddink has gone on to enjoy an illustrious career in management, leading both clubs and countries from across the globe to achieve various titles and feats.\n\nIn March 1987, Hiddink was appointed [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] manager after previously serving as assistant. Hiddink's PSV side won three consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles, three consecutive [[KNVB Cup]]s and the [[1987\u201388 European Cup|European Cup]] in the historic [[Treble (association football)|Treble]]-winning season of [[1987\u201388 PSV Eindhoven season|1987\u201388]]. Hiddink spent one unsuccessful season at [[Istanbul]] side [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K. (football)|Fenerbah\u00e7e]], then the following season was appointed manager of [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], where he stayed until November 1993. He returned to the [[Mestalla Stadium|Mestalla]] in March 1994, where he stayed for the rest of the [[1993\u201394 La Liga|1993\u201394]] season.\n\nHiddink then took charge of the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] in January 1995, leading the Dutch to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]] and a fourth-place finish in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. He resigned as Netherlands manager after the World Cup, where he was then appointed manager of Spanish giants [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]. His time in [[Madrid]] ended prematurely after he was sacked in February 1999 as Real were struggling in the league. He took over the reins at fellow [[La Liga]] side [[Real Betis]] in February 2000, but was sacked just three months later, following the season's conclusion.\n\nThe lure of taking another team to a World Cup led to Hiddink taking the [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea national team]] job in January 2001. [[Korea Republic|South Korea]] were joint hosts of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], so expectations were high. He led South Korea to a historic 4th-placed finish and became a national hero there.<ref>{{Cite web|title = BBC SPORT {{!}} WORLD CUP {{!}} Results|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/bsp/statistics/results.stm|publisher = BBC|access-date = 14 January 2016}}</ref> Hiddink returned to the Netherlands to rejoin PSV after the conclusion of the World Cup. During his second spell, he won three more Eredivise titles and another KNVB Cup, making him the most successful football manager in Dutch history. In July 2005, Hiddink was appointed manager of the [[Australia national soccer team|Australian national team]], serving as manager of both PSV and Australia simultaneously. He led Australia to qualify for their first World Cup in 32 years, while at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] itself, he led the nation to the knockout stages, the first time in the Socceroos' history. Following the World Cup, he joined the [[Russia national football team|Russian national team]]. Russia scraped through qualification at the expense of [[England national football team|England]], ultimately reaching the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2008|Euro 2008]].\n\nIn February 2009, while still managing Russia, Hiddink was appointed interim manager of English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. He enjoyed success during his short stay at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], winning the [[FA Cup]], whilst restoring Chelsea to a respectable position in the league. Meanwhile, after Russia failed to qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Hiddink resigned as its manager. He returned to Turkey as [[Turkey national football team|Turkish national team]] manager, but his time in charge ended two years later after the nation failed to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. In February 2012, Hiddink made a return to club management, taking charge of Russian side [[FC Anzhi Makhachkala|Anzhi Makhachkala]]. After a period of relative success, Hiddink left Anzhi in July 2013.\n\nFollowing the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], Hiddink succeeded [[Louis van Gaal]] as [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch national team]] manager, his second stint in charge of his home nation. His time at the helm ended, however, as the Netherlands were struggling to qualify for [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]]; he was subsequently relieved of his post and replaced by [[Danny Blind]]. Following this, nearly six years after his previous departure from Chelsea, Hiddink was again appointed interim manager of the London-based club in December 2015 following the sacking of [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]].\n\n==Playing career==\nHiddink was born in [[Varsseveld]]<ref name=BDFutbol/> and started his career as a player in the youth side of amateur club SC Varsseveld. He turned professional after signing on for Dutch club [[De Graafschap]] in 1967. Hiddink played at the [[Doetinchem]] club under manager [[Piet de Visser (football manager)|Piet de Visser]]. In 1973, Hiddink and manager de Visser earned promotion to the [[Eredivisie]], the top league in Dutch football.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oeuvreprijs naar Piet de Visser |url=http://www.net2client.com/ZZZ/08/04101/Uitslagen_2004.htm?MCT7evlngrp3%C3%BE |publisher=Rinus Michels Awards 2005 |date=28 May 2005 |accessdate=17 January 2007 |language=Dutch |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070928064135/http://www.net2client.com/ZZZ/08/04101/Uitslagen_2004.htm?MCT7evlngrp3%C3%BE |archivedate=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Ever since, the careers of the two Dutchmen have intersected: De Visser scouted numerous South American players, such as PSV players [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Rom\u00e1rio]] (who played under Hiddink at PSV from 1988 until 1990) and former Chelsea defender [[Alex Rodrigo Dias da Costa|Alex]], for Hiddink's PSV. Also, De Visser, in his role as personal advisor to [[Roman Abramovich]], was influential in bringing Hiddink to the [[Russia national football team]] and more recently to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] as caretaker manager following the dismissal of Brazilian [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]]. It was De Visser who introduced Hiddink to Abramovich during a meeting in [[Eindhoven]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite news | title=Will the Kremlin demand the final say in Hiddink's future at Chelsea?| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1145538/Will-Kremlin-demand-final-say-Hiddinks-future-Chelsea.html | newspaper=Daily Mail | date=14 February 2009 | accessdate=14 February 2009 | location=London | first=Rob | last=Draper}}</ref> He spent most of his playing career at De Graafschap, including three years under de Visser, and remains a fan of the club.
