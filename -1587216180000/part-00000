The central and rightmost cell are in [[interphase]], so the entire nuclei are labeled. The cell on the left is going through [[mitosis]] and its DNA has condensed.]]\nIn [[biology]], '''cell theory''' is the historic [[scientific theory]], now universally accepted, that living organisms are made up of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, that they are the basic structural/organizational unit of all organisms, and that all cells come from pre-existing cells. Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells,  known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].\n\nThe three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:\n# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\n# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.\n# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n\nThe first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.<ref>Villarreal, Luis P.

In the first century BC, Romans were able to make glass, discovering that objects appeared to be larger under the [[glass]]. In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D\u2019Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.<ref>Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554</ref> [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscopes]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupr\u00e9|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}</ref><ref>William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392</ref> In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.<ref name=Gest />\n\nExtensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His was a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress in microscope technology until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\"/>\n\nOptical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]]. The development of the [[electron microscope]] in the 1920s made it possible to view objects that are smaller than optical wavelengths, once again opening up new possibilities in science.<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\" />\n\n== Discovery of cells ==\n[[File:Cork Micrographia Hooke.png|thumb|Drawing of the structure of [[Cork cambium|cork]] by [[Robert Hooke]] that appeared in ''[[Micrographia]]''.]]\n\nThe cell was first discovered by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1665, which can be found to be described in his book [[Micrographia]].

Hooke discovered a multitude of tiny pores that he named \"cells\". This came from the Latin word Cella, meaning \u2018a small room\u2019 like monks lived in and also Cellulae, which meant the six sided cell of a honeycomb. However, Hooke did not know their real structure or function.<ref>{{cite book |author=Inwood, Stephen |title=The man who knew too much: the strange and inventive life of Robert Hooke, 1635\u20131703 |publisher=Pan |location=London |year=2003 |page=72 |isbn=0-330-48829-5}}</ref> \nWhat Hooke had thought were cells, were actually empty cell walls of plant tissues. With microscopes during this time having a low magnification, Hooke was unable to see that there were other internal components to the cells he was observing. Therefore, he did not think the \"cellulae\" were alive.<ref name=\"Becker, Wayne M.; Kleinsmith, Lewis J. and Hardin, Jeff 2003 1\">{{cite book|author1=Becker, Wayne M. |author2=Kleinsmith, Lewis J. |author3=Hardin, Jeff |page=1|title=The World of the Cell|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UA8OAAAACAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-8053-4854-5}}</ref> His cell observations gave no indication of the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and other [[organelle]]s found in most living cells. In Micrographia, Hooke also observed mould, bluish in color, found on leather. After studying it under his microscope, he was unable to observe \u201cseeds\u201d that would have indicated how the mould was multiplying in quantity. This led to Hooke suggesting that spontaneous generation, from either natural or artificial heat, was the cause. Since this was an old [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian theory]] still accepted at the time, others did not reject it and was not disproved until [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] later discovered that generation was achieved otherwise.<ref name=Gest />\n\n[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] is another scientist who saw these cells soon after Hooke did.

In a letter to [[The Royal Society]] on October 9, 1676, he states that [[motility]] is a quality of life therefore these were living organisms. Over time, he wrote many more papers in which described many specific forms of [[microorganisms]]. Leeuwenhoek named these \u201canimalcules,\u201d which included [[protozoa]] and other unicellular organisms, like [[bacteria]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\" /> Though he did not have much formal education, he was able to identify the first accurate description of red blood cells and discovered bacteria after gaining interest in the sense of taste that resulted in Leeuwenhoek to observe the tongue of an ox, then leading him to study \"pepper water\" in 1676. He also found for the first time the [[sperm cells]] of animals and humans. Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.<ref name=Gest />\n\nThe cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying.

The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].\nThe idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn\u2019t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.\n\n===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===\n\nTwo opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}</ref> The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.\nThe [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33\u201359|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}</ref> Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.\nOver the same time period, it was shown (Procter & Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form\u2014the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water\u2014and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.\nBy the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks & Brooks published a monograph, \"The Permeability of Living Cells\", which rejects the bulk phase theories.\n\n===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===\n\nWith the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[:de:Karl_Lohmann_(Biochemiker)|Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.\nThe tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.\n \nThe modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.\nThese major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact\u2014there are, however, a few dissenters.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===\n\nIn 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.\n\nIn 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.\n\n== Types of cells ==\n{{Main|Cell types}}\n[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|right|[[Prokaryote]] cell.]]\n[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Eukaryote cell.]]\nCells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:\n\n# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.<ref name=w11>Wolfe, p.&nbsp;11</ref> Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s).

Cells are the basic unit of structure in all organisms and also the basic unit of reproduction. With continual improvements made to [[microscope]]s over time, magnification technology advanced enough to discover cells in the 17th century. This discovery is largely attributed to [[Robert Hooke]], and began the scientific study of cells,  known as [[cell biology]]. Over a century later, many debates about cells began amongst scientists. Most of these debates involved the nature of cellular regeneration, and the idea of cells as a fundamental unit of life. Cell theory was eventually formulated in 1839. This is usually credited to [[Matthias Schleiden]] and [[Theodor Schwann]]. However, many other scientists like [[Rudolf Virchow]] contributed to the theory. It was an important step in the movement away from [[spontaneous generation]].\n\nThe three [[:wikt:tenet|tenet]]s to the cell theory are as described below:\n# All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\n# The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.\n# Cells arise from pre-existing cells.\n\nThe first of these tenets is disputed, as [[non-cellular life|non-cellular entities]] such as viruses are sometimes considered life-forms.<ref>Villarreal, Luis P.

In Italy during the 12th century, Salvino D\u2019Armate made a piece of glass fit over one eye, allowing for a magnification effect to that eye. The expanded use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century probably led to wider spread use of [[Optical microscope#Simple microscope|simple microscope]]s ([[magnifying glass]]es) with limited magnification.<ref>Atti Della Fondazione Giorgio Ronchi E Contributi Dell'Istituto Nazionale Di Ottica, Volume 30, La Fondazione-1975, page 554</ref> [[Optical microscope#Compound microscope|Compound microscopes]], which combine an [[Objective (optics)|objective lens]] with an [[eyepiece]] to view a [[real image]] achieving much higher magnification, first appeared in Europe around 1620.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Albert Van Helden|author2=Sven Dupr\u00e9|author3=Rob van Gent|title=The Origins of the Telescope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XguxYlYd-9EC&pg=PA24|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=978-90-6984-615-6|page=24}}</ref><ref>William Rosenthal, Spectacles and Other Vision Aids: A History and Guide to Collecting, Norman Publishing, 1996, page 391 - 392</ref> In 1665, Robert Hooke used a microscope about six inches long with two convex lenses inside and examined specimens under reflected light for the observations in his book ''[[Micrographia]]''. Hooke also used a simpler microscope with a single lens for examining specimens with directly transmitted light, because this allowed for a clearer image.<ref name=Gest />\n\nExtensive microscopic study was done by [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], a draper who took the interest in microscopes after seeing one while on an apprenticeship in Amsterdam in 1648. At some point in his life before 1668, he was able to learn how to grind lenses.  This eventually led to Leeuwenhoek making his own unique microscope. His was a single lens simple microscope, rather than a [[compound microscope]]. This was because he was able to use a single lens that was a small glass sphere but allowed for a magnification of 270x. This was a large progression since the magnification before was only a maximum of 50x. After Leeuwenhoek, there was not much progress in microscope technology until the 1850s, two hundred years later. [[Carl Zeiss]], a German engineer who manufactured microscopes, began to make changes to the lenses used. But the optical quality did not improve until the 1880s when he hired [[Otto Schott]] and eventually [[Ernst Abbe]].<ref name=\"Unifying Concept\"/>\n\nOptical microscopes can focus on objects the size of a [[wavelength]] or larger, giving restrictions still to advancement in discoveries with objects smaller than the wavelengths of [[visible light]].

Once discovering these types of cells, Leeuwenhoek saw that the fertilization process requires the sperm cell to enter the [[egg cell]]. This put an end to the previous theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. After reading letters by Leeuwenhoek, Hooke was the first to confirm his observations that were thought to be unlikely by other contemporaries.<ref name=Gest />\n\nThe cells in animal tissues were observed after plants were because the [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] were so fragile and susceptible to tearing, it was difficult for such thin slices to be prepared for studying. Biologists believed that there was a fundamental unit to life, but were unsure what this was. It would not be until over a hundred years later that this fundamental unit was connected to cellular structure and existence of cells in animals or plants.<ref name=\"History of Biology\">{{cite web|last=Robinson|first=Richard|title=History of Biology: Cell Theory and Cell Structure|url=http://www.biologyreference.com/Gr-Hi/History-of-Biology-Cell-Theory-and-Cell-Structure.html#b|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>  This conclusion was not made until [[Henri Dutrochet]].

The first cell theory is credited to the work of [[Theodor Schwann]] and [[Matthias Jakob Schleiden]] in the 1830s. In this theory the internal contents of cells were called [[protoplasm]] and described as a jelly-like substance, sometimes called living jelly. At about the same time, [[colloidal chemistry]] began its development, and the concepts of [[bound water]] emerged. A [[colloid]] being something between a [[solution]] and a [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], where [[Brownian motion]] is sufficient to prevent [[sedimentation]].\nThe idea of a [[semipermeable membrane]], a barrier that is permeable to [[solvent]] but impermeable to solute [[molecules]] was developed at about the same time. The term [[osmosis]] originated in 1827 and its importance to [[physiological]] phenomena realized, but it wasn\u2019t until 1877, when the [[botanist]] [[Pfeffer]] proposed the [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] of [[cell physiology]]. In this view, the cell was seen to be enclosed by a thin surface, the [[plasma membrane]], and cell water and solutes such as a [[potassium]] [[ion]] existed in a physical state like that of a [[dilute solution]]. In 1889 Hamburger used [[hemolysis]] of [[erythrocytes]] to determine the permeability of various solutes. By measuring the time required for the cells to swell past their elastic limit, the rate at which solutes entered the cells could be estimated by the accompanying change in cell volume. He also found that there was an apparent nonsolvent volume of about 50% in red blood cells and later showed that this includes water of hydration in addition to the protein and other nonsolvent components of the cells.\n\n===Evolution of the membrane and bulk phase theories===\n\nTwo opposing concepts developed within the context of studies on [[osmosis]], permeability, and electrical properties of cells.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Gilbert N.|title=In search of the physical basis of life|date=1984|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|isbn=0306414090}}</ref> The first held that these properties all belonged to the plasma membrane whereas the other predominant view was that the [[protoplasm]] was responsible for these properties.\nThe [[History of cell membrane theory|membrane theory]] developed as a succession of ad-hoc additions and changes to the theory to overcome experimental hurdles. Overton (a distant cousin of Charles Darwin) first proposed the concept of a lipid (oil) plasma membrane in 1899. The major weakness of the [[lipid membrane]] was the lack of an explanation of the high permeability to water, so Nathansohn (1904) proposed the mosaic theory. In this view, the membrane is not a pure lipid layer, but a mosaic of areas with lipid and areas with semipermeable gel. Ruhland refined the mosaic theory to include pores to allow additional passage of small molecules. Since membranes are generally less permeable to [[anions]], [[Leonor Michaelis]] concluded that [[ions]] are [[adsorbed]] to the walls of the pores, changing the permeability of the pores to ions by [[electrostatic repulsion]]. Michaelis demonstrated the [[membrane potential]] (1926) and proposed that it was related to the distribution of ions across the membrane.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Michaelis|first1=L.|title=Contribution to the Theory of Permeability of Membranes for Electrolytes|journal=The Journal of General Physiology|volume=8|issue=2 |pages=33\u201359|year=1925|pmid=19872189|pmc=2140746|doi=10.1085/jgp.8.2.33}}</ref> Harvey and Danielli (1939) proposed a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane covered on each side with a layer of protein to account for measurements of surface tension. In 1941 Boyle & Conway showed that the membrane of frog muscle was permeable to both {{chem|K|+}} and {{chem|Cl|-}}, but apparently not to {{chem|Na|+}}, so the idea of electrical charges in the pores was unnecessary since a single critical pore size would explain the permeability to {{chem|K|+}}, {{chem|H|+}}, and {{chem|Cl|-}} as well as the impermeability to {{chem|Na|+}}, {{chem|Ca|+}}, and {{chem|Mg|2+}}.\nOver the same time period, it was shown (Procter & Wilson, 1916) that gels, which do not have a semipermeable membrane, would swell in dilute solutions. [[Jacques Loeb|Loeb]] (1920) also studied [[gelatin]] extensively, with and without a membrane, showing that more of the properties attributed to the plasma membrane could be duplicated in [[gels]] without a membrane. In particular, he found that an electrical potential difference between the gelatin and the outside medium could be developed, based on the {{chem|H|+}} concentration. Some criticisms of the membrane theory developed in the 1930s, based on observations such as the ability of some cells to swell and increase their surface area by a factor of 1000. A lipid layer cannot stretch to that extent without becoming a patchwork (thereby losing its barrier properties. Such criticisms stimulated continued studies on protoplasm as the principal agent determining cell permeability properties. In 1938, Fischer and Suer proposed that water in the protoplasm is not free but in a chemically combined form\u2014the protoplasm represents a combination of protein, salt and water\u2014and demonstrated the basic similarity between swelling in living tissues and the swelling of gelatin and [[fibrin]] gels. Dimitri Nasonov (1944) viewed proteins as the central components responsible for many properties of the cell, including electrical properties.\nBy the 1940s, the bulk phase theories were not as well developed as the membrane theories. In 1941, Brooks & Brooks published a monograph, \"The Permeability of Living Cells\", which rejects the bulk phase theories.\n\n===Emergence of the steady-state membrane pump concept===\n\nWith the development of [[radioactive tracers]], it was shown that cells are not impermeable to {{chem|Na|+}}. This was difficult to explain with the membrane barrier theory, so the sodium pump was proposed to continually remove {{chem|Na|+}} as it permeates cells. This drove the concept that cells are in a state of [[dynamic equilibrium]], constantly using energy to maintain [[ion gradient]]s. In 1935, [[Karl Lohmann]] discovered [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and its role as a source of energy for cells, so the concept of a metabolically-driven [[sodium pump]] was proposed.\nThe tremendous success of [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin|Hodgkin]], [[Andrew Huxley|Huxley]], and [[Bernard Katz|Katz]] in the development of the membrane theory of cellular membrane potentials, with differential equations that modeled the phenomena correctly, provided even more support for the membrane pump hypothesis.\n \nThe modern view of the plasma membrane is of a fluid lipid bilayer that has protein components embedded within it. The structure of the membrane is now known in great detail, including 3D models of many of the hundreds of different proteins that are bound to the membrane.\nThese major developments in cell physiology placed the membrane theory in a position of dominance and stimulated the imagination of most physiologists, who now apparently accept the theory as fact\u2014there are, however, a few dissenters.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===The reemergence of the bulk phase theories===\n\nIn 1956, Afanasy S. Troshin published a book, ''The Problems of Cell Permeability'', in Russian (1958 in German, 1961 in Chinese, 1966 in English) in which he found that permeability was of secondary importance in determination of the patterns of equilibrium between the cell and its environment. Troshin showed that cell water decreased in solutions of galactose or urea although these compounds did slowly permeate cells. Since the membrane theory requires an impermanent solute to sustain cell shrinkage, these experiments cast doubt on the theory. Others questioned whether the cell has enough energy to sustain the sodium/potassium pump. Such questions became even more urgent as dozens of new metabolic pumps were added as new chemical gradients were discovered.\n\nIn 1962, [[Gilbert Ling]] became the champion of the bulk phase theories and proposed his association-induction hypothesis of living cells.\n\n== Types of cells ==\n{{Main|Cell types}}\n[[File:Prokaryote cell.svg|thumb|right|[[Prokaryote]] cell.]]\n[[File:Endomembrane system diagram en (edit).svg|thumb|Eukaryote cell.]]\nCells can be subdivided into the following subcategories:\n\n# ''[[Prokaryote]]s'': Prokaryotes are relatively small cells surrounded by the plasma membrane, with a characteristic cell wall that may differ in composition depending on the particular organism.<ref name=w11>Wolfe, p.&nbsp;11</ref> Prokaryotes lack a [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] (although they do have circular or linear [[DNA]]) and other membrane-bound [[organelle]]s (though they do contain [[ribosome]]s).

She was the first propeller-driven gunboat in the world.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the [[First War of Schleswig]], 1848-1850 between [[Denmark]] and the two [[Duchy|duchies]], the Schleswig-Holstein navy comprised three [[paddlewheeler]]s with sail rigging, a [[schooner]] and 12 gunboats; their task was to protect the coast against Danish raids.\n\n[[File:Schleswig-Holsteinisches Kanonenboot VON DER TANN 1849. Gem\u00e4lde von L\u00fcder Arenhold 1891.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Von der Tann'' 1849. Painting by [[L\u00fcder Arenhold]], 1891]]\n\nInitially called Gunboat No. 1, ''Von der Tann'' was the most modern of these ships. Her [[Marine steam engine|steam engine]], built by [[August Howaldt]] at [[Howaldtswerke|Schweffel und Howaldt's]] works in Kiel, gave her {{convert|36|hp}} and a top speed (under steam) of six knots. She carried the [[rigging]] of a three-mast schooner, with a very tall [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] behind the main mast. Her armament comprised two 64-pounder guns mounted on [[Swivel gun|swivels]] fore and aft plus four three-pounder [[howitzer]]s.\n\n[[File:Von der Tann i brand 25 juli 1850.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Vilhelm Melbye]]: ''Von der Tann'' aground at Neustadt. (The ''Hekla'' seen in the background)]]\n\nDuring the night of 20/21 July 1850, ''Von der Tann'' had captured a Danish freighter in the [[bay of L\u00fcbeck]], but was not permitted to enter the neutral port of [[Travem\u00fcnde]] which belonged to the Free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] City of [[L\u00fcbeck]]. When ''Von der Tann'' attempted to enter the port of [[Neustadt in Holstein]], she was engaged by Danish naval forces, the ships ''Heckla'' and ''Valkyren''. During the ensuing battle, ''Von der Tann'' accidentally [[ship grounding|ran aground]] just outside Neustadt harbor. The ship was abandoned and set on fire by her crew, but was later repaired and put back into service. In 1853, after the end of the First War of Schleswig, ''Von der Tann'' was taken over by the [[Danish navy]] and renamed ''St\u00f8ren''.

She was the first propeller-driven gunboat in the world.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the [[First War of Schleswig]], 1848-1850 between [[Denmark]] and the two [[Duchy|duchies]], the Schleswig-Holstein navy comprised three [[paddlewheeler]]s with sail rigging, a [[schooner]] and 12 gunboats; their task was to protect the coast against Danish raids.\n\n[[File:Schleswig-Holsteinisches Kanonenboot VON DER TANN 1849. Gem\u00e4lde von L\u00fcder Arenhold 1891.jpg|thumb|300px|left|''Von der Tann'' 1849. Painting by [[L\u00fcder Arenhold]], 1891]]\n\nInitially called Gunboat No. 1, ''Von der Tann'' was the most modern of these ships. Her [[Marine steam engine|steam engine]], built by [[August Howaldt]] at [[Howaldtswerke|Schweffel und Howaldt's]] works in Kiel, gave her {{convert|36|hp}} and a top speed (under steam) of six knots. She carried the [[rigging]] of a three-mast schooner, with a very tall [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]] behind the main mast. Her armament comprised two 64-pounder guns mounted on [[Swivel gun|swivels]] fore and aft plus four three-pounder [[howitzer]]s.\n\n[[File:Von der Tann i brand 25 juli 1850.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Vilhelm Melbye]]: ''Von der Tann'' aground at Neustadt. (The ''Hekla'' seen in the background)]]\n\nDuring the night of 20/21 July 1850, ''Von der Tann'' had captured a Danish freighter in the [[bay of L\u00fcbeck]], but was not permitted to enter the neutral port of [[Travem\u00fcnde]] which belonged to the Free [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] City of [[L\u00fcbeck]]. When ''Von der Tann'' attempted to enter the port of [[Neustadt in Holstein]], she was engaged by Danish naval forces, the ships ''Heckla'' and ''Valkyren''. During the ensuing battle, ''Von der Tann'' accidentally [[ship grounding|ran aground]] just outside Neustadt harbor. The ship was abandoned and set on fire by her crew, but was later repaired and put back into service. In 1853, after the end of the First War of Schleswig, ''Von der Tann'' was taken over by the [[Danish navy]] and renamed ''St\u00f8ren''. She was [[ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and scrapped in 1862.

Historically, each is a successor to one of the previous [[Australian colonies]]. Each state has its own constitution, with its own legislature (parliament), judiciary and executive.  The state parliaments have [[plenary power|plenary]] legislative power, except that some areas of legislative power are exclusive to the Federal Parliament, many others are exercised concurrently with it and, in case of conflict between federal and state legislation, the federal legislation prevails.  A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].\n\nThere are also ten '''territories''', whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation.  The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between ''internal'' territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and ''external'' territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location.\n\nTwo of the three ''internal'' territories{{mdash}}the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the [[Northern Territory]]{{mdash}}function almost as states.  Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden.  Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court.  The third internal territory, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], is the product of Australia's complex relationship with its capital city; rather than having the same level of autonomy as the other internal territories, it has services provided by the ACT.\n\nThere are also seven ''external'' territories, not part of the Australian mainland or of any state. Three of them have a small permanent population, two have tiny and transient populations, and two are uninhabited.  All are directly administered by the federal [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (or the [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] in the case of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]). [[Norfolk Island]], which is permanently populated, was partially self-governing until 2015.\n\nThe term \"'''interstate'''\" is used within Australia to refer to any cross-border events, transactions, or travel.\n\n== Geographic Australia ==\nThe term ''geographic Australia'' is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures. This area comprises [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] in addition to the six states and three mainland territories; Norfolk Island is the only territory with a permanent population that is not part of geographic Australia.<ref>{{Cite report | first=Brian | last=Pink | authorlink=Brian_Pink  | year=2010  | title=Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics | section=Definition of Australia | sectionurl=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/58B39EB886CFC607CA25779F00172F75?opendocument | page=5}}</ref>\n\n== States and territories ==\n{{Administrative divisions of Australia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| Reference map for states and territories of Australia\n|-\n|[[File:Australia states and territories labelled.svg|frameless|upright=2.75]]\n|}\n{{anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| States of Australia<ref group=\"n\">Unless provided, references and details on data provided in the table can be found within the individual state and territory articles.</ref>\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|[[List of Australian flags#States and territories|Flag]]\n!

(The territory was previously known as [[German New Guinea]], between 1884 and 1914; it was formally under Australian military occupation, in 1914\u20131920.)\nIn 1949, the combined [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was created, although both the two territories remained technically distinct, for some administrative and legal purposes, until 1975, when the combined entity became independent.\n\n'''Nauru''', 1920\u20131968<br>\nThe Australian government received a League of Nations [[History of Nauru|mandate for Nauru]], following World War I.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Papua, New Guinea and Nauru were controlled by the Australian government as [[United Nations trust territories]]. The ''[[Papua and New Guinea Act 1949]]'' placed the Territory of New Guinea in an \"administrative union\" with the Territory of Papua. The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was eventually given independence as [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1975. Nauru was granted independence in 1968.\n\n== Background and overview ==\n[[File:Australia history.gif|frameless|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nThe states originated as separate [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonies prior to [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901. The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]], in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the [[Colony of Tasmania]] (initially established as a separate colony named [[Van Diemen's Land]] in 1825), the [[History of Western Australia#British Colony|Colony of Western Australia]] (initially established as the smaller [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829), the [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia .281836.29|Province of South Australia]] (1836), the [[Colony of New Zealand]] (1840),<ref>A.H. McLintock (ed), ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'', 3 vols, Wellington, NZ:R.E. Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 3 p. 526.'</ref> the [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria Colony]] (1851) and the [[Queensland#Colony of Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] (1859). Upon Federation, the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nLegislative powers of the states are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], section 107, and under the principle of [[federalism]], [[Federalism in Australia|Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution]]. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]]; laws for territories are determined by the Australian Parliament.<ref>Constitution of Australia, section 122</ref>\n\nMost of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.\n\nEach state has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], appointed by [[Monarchy of Australia|the monarch]] (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]), which by convention she does on the advice of the state premier. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, by contrast, is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Jervis Bay Territory]] is the only non-self-governing internal territory. Until 1989, it was administered as if it were a part of the ACT, although it has always been a separate territory.  Under the terms of the ''Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915'',<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth)].</ref> the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory insofar as they are applicable and providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |quote= Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, insofar as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the 'Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915' |publisher= The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate= 17 January 2013}}</ref> Although residents of the Jervis Bay Territory are generally subject to laws made by the ACT Legislative Assembly, they are not represented in the Assembly. They are represented in the [[Parliament of Australia]] as part of the Electoral [[Division of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory)|Division of Fraser]] in the ACT and by the ACT's two Senators. In other respects, the territory is administered directly by the Federal Government through the Territories portfolio.\n\nThe external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] possessed a degree of self-government from 1979 until 2015.\n\nEach state has a [[bicameral]] parliament except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council and is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island, each have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances, the Governor will appoint as premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of [[constitutional crisis]], the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing internal territories is called the chief minister. The Northern Territory's chief minister, in normal circumstances whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the administrator.\n\nThe term \"interstate\" is used within Australia to refer to a number of events, transactions, registrations, travel, etc. which occurs across borders or outside of the particular state or territory of the user of the term. Examples of use include motor vehicle registration,<ref>{{cite web|website=sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/registration/vehicle-registration/driving-an-interstate-registered-vehicle|title=Interstate-registered vehicles|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> travel,<ref>{{cite web|website=Public Transport Victoria|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/interstate-travel/|title=Interstate travel|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> applications to educational institutions out of one's home state.<ref>{{cite web|website=VTAC|url=https://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/interstate.html|title=Applying interstate|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are very few urban areas bifurcated by state/territory borders.

Australia|Cadastral divisions]]\n}}\n\nGovernment in the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]] is exercised on three levels: [[Government of Australia|federal]], '''states and territories''', and [[local government in Australia|local government]].\n\nThere are six '''states''':  [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. Historically, each is a successor to one of the previous [[Australian colonies]]. Each state has its own constitution, with its own legislature (parliament), judiciary and executive.  The state parliaments have [[plenary power|plenary]] legislative power, except that some areas of legislative power are exclusive to the Federal Parliament, many others are exercised concurrently with it and, in case of conflict between federal and state legislation, the federal legislation prevails.  A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].\n\nThere are also ten '''territories''', whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation.  The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between ''internal'' territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and ''external'' territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location.\n\nTwo of the three ''internal'' territories{{mdash}}the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the [[Northern Territory]]{{mdash}}function almost as states.  Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden.  Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court.  The third internal territory, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], is the product of Australia's complex relationship with its capital city; rather than having the same level of autonomy as the other internal territories, it has services provided by the ACT.\n\nThere are also seven ''external'' territories, not part of the Australian mainland or of any state. Three of them have a small permanent population, two have tiny and transient populations, and two are uninhabited.  All are directly administered by the federal [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (or the [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] in the case of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]). [[Norfolk Island]], which is permanently populated, was partially self-governing until 2015.\n\nThe term \"'''interstate'''\" is used within Australia to refer to any cross-border events, transactions, or travel.\n\n== Geographic Australia ==\nThe term ''geographic Australia'' is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures. This area comprises [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] in addition to the six states and three mainland territories; Norfolk Island is the only territory with a permanent population that is not part of geographic Australia.<ref>{{Cite report | first=Brian | last=Pink | authorlink=Brian_Pink  | year=2010  | title=Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics | section=Definition of Australia | sectionurl=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/58B39EB886CFC607CA25779F00172F75?opendocument | page=5}}</ref>\n\n== States and territories ==\n{{Administrative divisions of Australia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| Reference map for states and territories of Australia\n|-\n|[[File:Australia states and territories labelled.svg|frameless|upright=2.75]]\n|}\n{{anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| States of Australia<ref group=\"n\">Unless provided, references and details on data provided in the table can be found within the individual state and territory articles.</ref>\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|[[List of Australian flags#States and territories|Flag]]\n!

(The territory was previously known as [[German New Guinea]], between 1884 and 1914; it was formally under Australian military occupation, in 1914\u20131920.)\nIn 1949, the combined [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was created, although both the two territories remained technically distinct, for some administrative and legal purposes, until 1975, when the combined entity became independent.\n\n'''Nauru''', 1920\u20131968<br>\nThe Australian government received a League of Nations [[History of Nauru|mandate for Nauru]], following World War I.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Papua, New Guinea and Nauru were controlled by the Australian government as [[United Nations trust territories]]. The ''[[Papua and New Guinea Act 1949]]'' placed the Territory of New Guinea in an \"administrative union\" with the Territory of Papua. The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was eventually given independence as [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1975. Nauru was granted independence in 1968.\n\n== Background and overview ==\n[[File:Australia history.gif|frameless|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nThe states originated as separate [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonies prior to [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901. The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]], in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the [[Colony of Tasmania]] (initially established as a separate colony named [[Van Diemen's Land]] in 1825), the [[History of Western Australia#British Colony|Colony of Western Australia]] (initially established as the smaller [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829), the [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia .281836.29|Province of South Australia]] (1836), the [[Colony of New Zealand]] (1840),<ref>A.H. McLintock (ed), ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'', 3 vols, Wellington, NZ:R.E. Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 3 p. 526.'</ref> the [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria Colony]] (1851) and the [[Queensland#Colony of Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] (1859). Upon Federation, the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nLegislative powers of the states are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], section 107, and under the principle of [[federalism]], [[Federalism in Australia|Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution]]. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]]; laws for territories are determined by the Australian Parliament.<ref>Constitution of Australia, section 122</ref>\n\nMost of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.\n\nEach state has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], appointed by [[Monarchy of Australia|the monarch]] (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]), which by convention she does on the advice of the state premier. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, by contrast, is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Jervis Bay Territory]] is the only non-self-governing internal territory. Until 1989, it was administered as if it were a part of the ACT, although it has always been a separate territory.  Under the terms of the ''Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915'',<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth)].</ref> the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory insofar as they are applicable and providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |quote= Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, insofar as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the 'Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915' |publisher= The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate= 17 January 2013}}</ref> Although residents of the Jervis Bay Territory are generally subject to laws made by the ACT Legislative Assembly, they are not represented in the Assembly. They are represented in the [[Parliament of Australia]] as part of the Electoral [[Division of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory)|Division of Fraser]] in the ACT and by the ACT's two Senators. In other respects, the territory is administered directly by the Federal Government through the Territories portfolio.\n\nThe external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] possessed a degree of self-government from 1979 until 2015.\n\nEach state has a [[bicameral]] parliament except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council and is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island, each have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances, the Governor will appoint as premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of [[constitutional crisis]], the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing internal territories is called the chief minister. The Northern Territory's chief minister, in normal circumstances whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the administrator.\n\nThe term \"interstate\" is used within Australia to refer to a number of events, transactions, registrations, travel, etc. which occurs across borders or outside of the particular state or territory of the user of the term. Examples of use include motor vehicle registration,<ref>{{cite web|website=sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/registration/vehicle-registration/driving-an-interstate-registered-vehicle|title=Interstate-registered vehicles|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> travel,<ref>{{cite web|website=Public Transport Victoria|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/interstate-travel/|title=Interstate travel|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> applications to educational institutions out of one's home state.<ref>{{cite web|website=VTAC|url=https://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/interstate.html|title=Applying interstate|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are very few urban areas bifurcated by state/territory borders.
