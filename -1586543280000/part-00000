To Spanish ears, however, the word sounded like ''abre ojos'' (\"open your eyes\"), so they imputed this meaning, and this false etymology was later borrowed by English, Dutch and French writers.<ref name=\"Forsyth 1957\">{{cite journal | first = John | last = Forsyth | year = 1957 | title = Visit of the yacht Grootenbroeck to the coast of the South-land in 1631 | journal = [[Early Days (journal)|Early Days]] | volume = V | issue = III | pages = 17\u201326}}</ref> See [[wikt:abrojo|abrojo]] wiktionary entry.\n\nWhy Houtman named the islands using a Portuguese word remains a subject of debate. John Forsyth states that the islands are named after the [[Abrolhos Archipelago]] off the east coast of [[Brazil]], which was discovered and named by Portuguese navigators early in the 16th century. This position is supported by the fact that Houtman was familiar with the Abrolhos Archipelago, having sailed through it in 1598.<ref name=\"Forsyth 1957\"/> Others assert that ''abrolhos'' was a Portuguese [[lookout]]'s cry which, like many other Portuguese maritime terms, was taken up by sailors of other nationalities,<ref name=\"Richardson 1983\">{{cite journal | last = Richardson | first = W.

Frederick also appears to have been a keen linguist, having published the first-known Dutch-Malay and Dutch-Malagasy dictionaries in 1603.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cornelis-and-Frederik-de-Houtman|title=Cornelis and Frederik de Houtman - Dutch explorers|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He appears to have been fluent-enough in Portuguese that he might have used an evocative Portuguese word if it described the area better than any Dutch word did.\n\nFinally, it has been argued by proponents of the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]] that the Portuguese name is evidence that the islands were charted by Portuguese navigators in the 16th century. [[Kenneth McIntyre]], for example, claimed that Houtman was in possession of Portuguese maps of the west coast of Australia, and that he named the islands \"abrolhos\" in accordance with the name on his map.<ref name=\"McIntyre 1977\"/> Charting of the islands was previously credited to [[Jorge de Menezes]], but the notion that Menezes visited Australia is now thoroughly discredited, and no other candidate has been proffered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nThe primary piece of evidence for the claim of Portuguese priority is the 16th century [[Dieppe maps]], some of which are said to show the west coast of Australia, including an island at the position of the Houtman Abrolhos. This island is unlabelled on most of the Dieppe maps, but on [[Pierre Desceliers]]' 1550 map, it is labelled ''Arenes''.

The Dutch ship {{ship||Batavia|ship|2}}, under the command of [[Francisco Pelsaert]], ran aground on her [[maiden voyage]], and Pelsaert and some men went in an open boat to the town of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) to get help. A group of the men who stayed on some of the islets decided to terrorise and massacre many others, including women and children. When Pelsaert returned, many of the culprits were executed.\n\n===Wreck of ''Zeewijk''===\n{{ship||Zeewijk}} was the last of the four Dutch [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] to be wrecked on the west coast of Australia. The Ship's Council having made the inexplicable decision to disregard sailing orders and actually seek out the west coast of Australia, the ship ran onto the Half Moon Reef at about 7:30&nbsp;pm on 9 June 1727. It did not break up immediately, and the heavy swell made evacuation impossible until 18 June. The [[longboat]] was launched on that day, and the crew and stores were thereafter gradually transferred to nearby [[Gun Island]]. Later, the men landed ten chests of money, containing 315,836 [[guilder]]s and weighing a total of three tons.<ref name=\"Edwards 1970\"/>\n\nThe crew of ''Zeewijk'' would be marooned in the Pelsaert Group for ten months, during which time they lived off seals, seabirds, eggs, and victuals salvaged from the wreck. They obtained some water from rainfall, but were forced to explore throughout the group in search of further supplies. A great many men died on the islands, including two boys who were accused of [[sodomy]] and marooned on separate islands of the Mangrove Group.<ref name=\"Edwards 1970\"/>\n\nOn 10 July the longboat, fitted for a voyage and crewed with eleven men, was sent to Batavia to obtain help. It never arrived there, and nothing is known of its fate. Four months later the castaways began building a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} boat, sufficient to carry all the men and the money chests. Completed in March 1728 and affectionately named ''Sloepie'' (\"little [[sloop]]\"), it was the first ocean-going vessel built in Australian history. On 26 March 1728, the surviving men set sail for Batavia, arriving in [[Sunda Strait]] late the following month.<ref name=\"Edwards 1970\"/>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Admiralty Chart No 1723 The Houtman Rocks, Published 1845.jpg|thumb|In 1845, the [[British Admiralty]] published a chart of \"The Houtman Rocks\", based on the 1840 survey of [[John Clements Wickham]] and [[John Lort Stokes]].]]\n\nDuring [[Admiralty]]<!--Title of an authority!--> surveys of the north west coast in 1840, crew from {{HMS|Beagle}} discovered a brass gun of about three pounds calibre, an iron swivel on which paint still adhered as well as numerous other artefacts signifying European occupation, on the largest island in the Pelsart Group.

Others were more recently formed from [[coral]] rubble.\n\n==Oceanography==\n\n===Bathymetry===\nThe Houtman Abrolhos lies in the Indian Ocean about 60 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) off the coast of Western Australia, near the edge of Australia's [[continental shelf]]. At less than 50 metres (160&nbsp;ft) deep, the shelf is quite shallow. It is also fairly level, the depth increasing to the west at a modest gradient of about 1.3 metres per kilometre (7&nbsp;ft/mi). About five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) to the west of the Houtman Abrolhos lies the [[shelf break]], beyond which the seabed falls away much more steeply, averaging around 50 metres per kilometre (260&nbsp;ft/mi).<ref name = \"Pearce 1997\">{{cite book | first = AF | last = Pearce | year = 1997 | chapter = The Leeuwin Current and the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia | editor = Wells, FE | title = The Marine Flora and Fauna of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia | volume = 1 | pages = 11\u201346 | publisher = Western Australian Museum | location = Perth}}</ref>\n\nThe islands of each island group arise from a single [[carbonate platform]], so the waters within an island group are mostly shallow. The channels between groups, however, are 40 to 50 metres deep, and therefore no impediment to the exchange of offshore and inshore waters.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n===Currents===\nThe Houtman Abrolhos lies almost directly in the path of the [[Leeuwin Current]], which draws warm, low-saline water of tropical origin southwards along the coast of Western Australia. This current flows all year round, but is strongest during [[southern hemisphere]] winter months. In general the Leeuwin Current runs along the shelf break, and thus passes close by the western edge of the Abrolhos. It meanders, however, sometimes passing well out to sea, and sometimes passing directly through the island chain, bathing it in warm tropical water;<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/> Although the direction of the Leeuwin Current is predominantly southerly, [[Shark Bay, Western Australia|Shark Bay]] and the Houtman Abrolhos together act as a [[topography|topographical]] trigger for the forming of [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]],<ref name=\"Waite 2007\">{{cite journal | first = A.

There is limited evidence for some sporadic, localised upwelling in the vicinity of the Abrolhos, but if so it appears to have little effect on the extremely low levels of nutrients in the water.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n===Temperature and salinity===\n[[File:Houtman Abrolhos sea temperature and salinity.png|thumb|Mean monthly temperature versus [[salinity]] for the Houtman Abrolhos and the adjacent coast in 1994, showing the Houtman Abrolhos to be much less variable.]]\n\nSea temperature at the islands varies according to a diurnal cycle, with the water at its coldest between six and eight in the morning, and at its warmest between three and four in the afternoon. In summer the daily temperature range is around 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (2&nbsp;\u00b0F); in winter it is about half that.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nThere is also an annual cycle, with sea temperature varying by a little less than 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (7&nbsp;\u00b0F) over the year, peaking at nearly 24&nbsp;\u00b0C (75&nbsp;\u00b0F) in March, and falling to around 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) in September. This variability is much less than in nearby coastal waters, which reaches a similar peak in summer but drops as low as 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64&nbsp;\u00b0F) in winter. The relatively low variability in sea temperatures at the Abrolhos is largely attributable to the Leeuwin Current, which bathes the islands in warm tropical water during winter months.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nA similar annual pattern occurs in [[salinity]]. There is a clear seasonal variation, with values ranging from a summer high of around 35.7 [[parts per trillion|ppt]], to a winter low of around 35.4 ppt. As with water temperatures, the variability in salinity is much smaller than in coastal waters, where summer salinity reaches 36.4 ppt. This difference is partly due to the low-salinity waters of the Leeuwin Current, but there are a number of other factors involved, including high evaporation of coastal waters in summer.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nTemperatures can also vary substantially from year to year. Annual mean temperatures vary by as much as 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (2&nbsp;\u00b0F); with cooler years usually cooler throughout the year. There is evidence that annual mean temperatures are related to [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] events.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nThe [[water column]] is generally well-mixed, with no evidence of a significant [[halocline]] or [[thermocline]]. Mean differences in water temperature between sea surface and sea bed range from only half a degree (Celsius; 1&nbsp;\u00b0F) in summer to almost zero in winter, and differences in salinity are very small even when the Leeuwin Current is at its strongest.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n===Sea levels===\nAs with the rest of southwestern Australia, [[tide]]s at the Houtman Abrolhos are small and irregular. There is little tidal data available for the islands, but what there is accords very closely with the data for Geraldton. Geraldton tides follow a diurnal pattern, with maximum tidal ranges of around 1-metre (3&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nMean sea levels at Geraldton show seasonal fluctuations, being higher in winter when the Leeuwin Current is at its peak. There are also variations from year to year, which are strongly associated with the [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) cycle. Apparently, ENSO events induce a weaker Leeuwin Current, which results in lower sea levels.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nThere is no published information on wave heights in the Abrolhos. In the open ocean, waves are typically a little over two metres high all year round. Nearer the mainland, they are usually less than 1.2 metres, with a calmer period in March and April, and another in October and November.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n{{As of|2012}}, the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] has not published [[climate|climatic]] data for the Houtman Abrolhos. However, an [[automatic weather station]] has been installed on [[North Island (Houtman Abrolhos)|North Island]] since 1990, and hourly measures of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[air temperature]], [[wind speed]], [[wind direction]], [[relative humidity]] and [[atmospheric pressure]] have been publicly available since then. Based on this and other data, researchers have put together a picture of the Abrolhos' climate.\n\nThe islands have a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[semi-arid climate]], or Bsh, under [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]])  with warm dry summers and cooler, wet winters. Mean temperatures range from 9.3&nbsp;\u00b0C to 19.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in July, and from 19.1&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C in February. These temperatures have a substantially smaller range than on the mainland: the summer temperature is typically a degree cooler, while winter temperatures are a good deal warmer. This is due to the influence of the ocean, and to the Leeuwin Current.\n\n86% of the rain falls between April and September; on average there are 89 raindays, resulting in 469 millimetres of rain. The wettest month is June, when over 100 millimetres typically falls. In contrast, only about 70 millimetres can be expected to fall between October and March.\n\nIt is nearly always windy. During summer a high pressure ridge lies to the south, causing persistent winds from the southeast or southwest, at speeds exceeding 17 knots (31&nbsp;km/h) almost half the time. During autumn and winter, the ridge moves northwards, increasing the atmospheric pressure over the islands, resulting in highly variable winds. Winter tends to produce both the strongest gales and the most frequent periods of calm.\n\nIn addition to these winds, there is daily pattern of land breezes in the morning, followed by the onset of south-westerly sea breezes in the afternoon. This pattern is caused by temperature differences between the land and the ocean, and is not as strong in the Houtman Abrolhos as on the mainland, but is present nonetheless.\n\nThree classes of storm have been identified for the region. Brief squalls may occur between December and April. A [[tropical cyclone]] occurs in the area about once in three years, between January and April; these may generate extremely high wind speeds that are potentially destructive. During winter, [[extra-tropical cyclone]]s sometimes pass south of Geraldton, generating winter gales with gusts of up to 35 metres per second, the wind direction from the northwest initially, then gradually moving around to southerly.\n\n==Biogeography==\nUnder the [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA), the islands of the Houtman Abrolhos fall within the [[Geraldton Hills]] subregion of the [[Geraldton Sandplains]] region.<ref name=\"IBRA 5.1\">{{cite journal|author=[[Environment Australia]] |title=Revision of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) and Development of Version 5.1 \u2013 Summary Report |publisher=[[Department of the Environment and Water Resources]], [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] |url=http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905215218/http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html |archivedate=5 September 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"IBRA 6.1\">[http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version6-1/index.html IBRA Version 6.1] data {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908221444/http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version6-1/index.html |date=8 September 2006 }}</ref> The main [[biogeography|biogeographic]] significance of the islands is their isolation, allowing them to provide [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for such threatened fauna as [[Tammar wallaby|tammar wallabies]] (''Macropus eugenii''), [[Australian sea lion]]s (''Neophoca cinerea'') and rare breeding seabirds.<ref name=\"Desmond 2001\">{{cite book | first = Anthony | last = Desmond |author2=Alanna Chant | year = 2001 | chapter = Geraldton Sandplains 2 (GS2 \u2013 Geraldton Hills subregion) | chapterurl = http://www.naturebase.net/pdf/science/bio_audit/geraldton_sandplains02_p265-292.pdf | accessdate = 2008-03-02 | title = A Biodiversity Audit of WA | url = http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/960/1397/ | publisher = Department of Environment and Conservation | location = Western Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn marine terms, the Houtman Abrolhos is located within the [[Southwest Shelf Transition]], an [[Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia]] (IMCRA) [[biotone]] that takes in the continental shelf from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]].

The proportions of tropical, temperate and west coast endemic biota vary from taxonomic group to group, but in general the biota is dominated by tropical species.

This has led to a 1727 population estimate of between 290 and 580 animals for the entire Houtman Abrolhos. Populations apparently fell dramatically between the 1840s and the 1880s, largely due to extensive commercial [[seal hunting|sealing]] in the area. In addition to direct killing of the animals, it is likely that much of the [[mangrove]] habitat on the islands was cleared as fuel for [[trypot]]s, and this may have affected the survival of young pups.

As a result of this competition for light, space and nutrients, coral at the Houtman Abrolhos tends to grow more slowly and die younger than is usual. Reef production is to a large extent due to the production of carbon by [[coralline algae]] rather than by coral.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chrisholm|first=John R.M.|date=2003|title=Primary Productivity of Reef-Building Crutose Coralline Algae|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/376a/d9431a329b7eb1a51e91c57d859775153c37.pdf|journal=Limnol.

In the most recent survey, 77 species were collected, of which around half are probably new to science. Only two locations were surveyed in this study, however, so this figure is likely to represent only a small proportion of the total sponge fauna of the Houtman Abrolhos; the islands are therefore thought to harbour an extremely rich diversity of sponges. A preliminary assessment suggested that there were more temperate species than tropical, which stands in marked contrast to most other groups.<ref name=\"Fromont 1999\">{{cite journal | last = Fromont | first = J. | year = 1999 | title = Demosponges of the Houtman Abrolhos | journal = Memoirs of the Queensland Museum | volume = 44 | pages = 175\u2013183}}</ref>\n\nThe [[marine worm]]s identified at the Houtman Abrolhos include 22 species of the [[polychaete]] family [[Terebellidae]],<ref name=\"Erseus 1997\">{{cite book | first = Christer | last = Ers\u00e9us | year = 1997 | chapter = Marine Tubificidae (Oligochaeta) from the Montebello and Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia, with descriptions of twenty-three new species | editor = Wells, F.

Aside from the early castaways noted above, the Islands have only had a small seasonal population of fishermen. The present fishermen all have permanent residence elsewhere, mainly in [[Geraldton]], but their island shacks are used as a base during the season. For example, North Island has a seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishers, with individual moorings and simple dwellings. During lobster season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, the island hosts up to 130 people. The camp is serviced by a carrier boat, the North Islander, which visits the island every three days, bringing supplies and taking out the catch and any domestic waste.\n\nTourists are not allowed to camp, and the conservation designation of the Island group forbids any real expansion in human occupation.\n\n====Western rock lobster====\nThe islands are the centre of the [[western rock lobster]] fishery, the largest single-species fishery in Western Australia.\n\n====Saucer scallops====\nAfter Shark Bay, the Houtman Abrolhos supports Western Australia's second largest [[saucer scallop]] fishery.<ref name=\"Fisheries 2007\">{{cite journal|title=Management of the Houtman Abrolhos System: A Draft Review 2007\u20132017 |version=Fisheries Management Paper No. 220 |year=2007 |publisher=Department of Fisheries, Government of Western Australia |url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp220/fmp220.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609101748/http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp220/fmp220.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2009 |accessdate=2007-12-01 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Fisheries 2000\">{{cite journal|title=Aquaculture Plan for the Houtman Abrolhos Islands |version=Fisheries Management Paper No. 137 |year=2000 |publisher=Department of Fisheries, Government of Western Australia |url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp137/fmp137.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010115535/http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp137/fmp137.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}</ref> This fishery is managed under the ''Abrolhos Islands and Mid West Trawl Limited Entry Fishery Notice 1993''.

Catches vary greatly from year to year; from 2001 to 2003, for example, the total annual catch totalled 1182 tons, 195 tons and 5840 tons (whole weight) respectively. This variability is apparently related to the strength of the Leeuwin Current, as strong current is correlated with low scallop recruitment.<ref name=\"DEH 2005\"/>\n\nThe total value of the fishery in 2003 was A$19.6 million, although this figure includes a small prawn fishery operating out of [[Port Gregory]].

Discovery of the islands was credited to [[Frederick de Houtman]], Captain-General of ''Dordrecht'', as it was Houtman who later wrote of the discovery in a letter to the directors of the [[Dutch East India Company]]:\n{{quote|\"On the 29th do. deeming ourselves to be in an open sea, we shaped our course north-by-east.

In the Portuguese language of the time, ''abrolhos'' meant \"spiked obstructions\", and served not only as a word for offshore reefs, but also as their word for [[caltrop]]s and [[Cheval de frise|chevaux de frise]]. To Spanish ears, however, the word sounded like ''abre ojos'' (\"open your eyes\"), so they imputed this meaning, and this false etymology was later borrowed by English, Dutch and French writers.<ref name=\"Forsyth 1957\">{{cite journal | first = John | last = Forsyth | year = 1957 | title = Visit of the yacht Grootenbroeck to the coast of the South-land in 1631 | journal = [[Early Days (journal)|Early Days]] | volume = V | issue = III | pages = 17\u201326}}</ref> See [[wikt:abrojo|abrojo]] wiktionary entry.\n\nWhy Houtman named the islands using a Portuguese word remains a subject of debate. John Forsyth states that the islands are named after the [[Abrolhos Archipelago]] off the east coast of [[Brazil]], which was discovered and named by Portuguese navigators early in the 16th century. This position is supported by the fact that Houtman was familiar with the Abrolhos Archipelago, having sailed through it in 1598.<ref name=\"Forsyth 1957\"/> Others assert that ''abrolhos'' was a Portuguese [[lookout]]'s cry which, like many other Portuguese maritime terms, was taken up by sailors of other nationalities,<ref name=\"Richardson 1983\">{{cite journal | last = Richardson | first = W.

Frederick also appears to have been a keen linguist, having published the first-known Dutch-Malay and Dutch-Malagasy dictionaries in 1603.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Cornelis-and-Frederik-de-Houtman|title=Cornelis and Frederik de Houtman - Dutch explorers|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> He appears to have been fluent-enough in Portuguese that he might have used an evocative Portuguese word if it described the area better than any Dutch word did.\n\nFinally, it has been argued by proponents of the [[theory of Portuguese discovery of Australia]] that the Portuguese name is evidence that the islands were charted by Portuguese navigators in the 16th century. [[Kenneth McIntyre]], for example, claimed that Houtman was in possession of Portuguese maps of the west coast of Australia, and that he named the islands \"abrolhos\" in accordance with the name on his map.<ref name=\"McIntyre 1977\"/> Charting of the islands was previously credited to [[Jorge de Menezes]], but the notion that Menezes visited Australia is now thoroughly discredited, and no other candidate has been proffered.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nThe primary piece of evidence for the claim of Portuguese priority is the 16th century [[Dieppe maps]], some of which are said to show the west coast of Australia, including an island at the position of the Houtman Abrolhos. This island is unlabelled on most of the Dieppe maps, but on [[Pierre Desceliers]]' 1550 map, it is labelled ''Arenes''.

The Dutch ship {{ship||Batavia|ship|2}}, under the command of [[Francisco Pelsaert]], ran aground on her [[maiden voyage]], and Pelsaert and some men went in an open boat to the town of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]) to get help. A group of the men who stayed on some of the islets decided to terrorise and massacre many others, including women and children. When Pelsaert returned, many of the culprits were executed.\n\n===Wreck of ''Zeewijk''===\n{{ship||Zeewijk}} was the last of the four Dutch [[East Indiaman|East Indiamen]] to be wrecked on the west coast of Australia. The Ship's Council having made the inexplicable decision to disregard sailing orders and actually seek out the west coast of Australia, the ship ran onto the Half Moon Reef at about 7:30&nbsp;pm on 9 June 1727. It did not break up immediately, and the heavy swell made evacuation impossible until 18 June. The [[longboat]] was launched on that day, and the crew and stores were thereafter gradually transferred to nearby [[Gun Island]]. Later, the men landed ten chests of money, containing 315,836 [[guilder]]s and weighing a total of three tons.<ref name=\"Edwards 1970\"/>\n\nThe crew of ''Zeewijk'' would be marooned in the Pelsaert Group for ten months, during which time they lived off seals, seabirds, eggs, and victuals salvaged from the wreck. They obtained some water from rainfall, but were forced to explore throughout the group in search of further supplies. A great many men died on the islands, including two boys who were accused of [[sodomy]] and marooned on separate islands of the Mangrove Group.<ref name=\"Edwards 1970\"/>\n\nOn 10 July the longboat, fitted for a voyage and crewed with eleven men, was sent to Batavia to obtain help. It never arrived there, and nothing is known of its fate. Four months later the castaways began building a {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} boat, sufficient to carry all the men and the money chests. Completed in March 1728 and affectionately named ''Sloepie'' (\"little [[sloop]]\"), it was the first ocean-going vessel built in Australian history. On 26 March 1728, the surviving men set sail for Batavia, arriving in [[Sunda Strait]] late the following month.<ref name=\"Edwards 1970\"/>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Admiralty Chart No 1723 The Houtman Rocks, Published 1845.jpg|thumb|In 1845, the [[British Admiralty]] published a chart of \"The Houtman Rocks\", based on the 1840 survey of [[John Clements Wickham]] and [[John Lort Stokes]].]]\n\nDuring [[Admiralty]]<!--Title of an authority!--> surveys of the north west coast in 1840, crew from {{HMS|Beagle}} discovered a brass gun of about three pounds calibre, an iron swivel on which paint still adhered as well as numerous other artefacts signifying European occupation, on the largest island in the Pelsart Group.

Others were more recently formed from [[coral]] rubble.\n\n==Oceanography==\n\n===Bathymetry===\nThe Houtman Abrolhos lies in the Indian Ocean about 60 kilometres (40&nbsp;mi) off the coast of Western Australia, near the edge of Australia's [[continental shelf]]. At less than 50 metres (160&nbsp;ft) deep, the shelf is quite shallow. It is also fairly level, the depth increasing to the west at a modest gradient of about 1.3 metres per kilometre (7&nbsp;ft/mi). About five kilometres (3&nbsp;mi) to the west of the Houtman Abrolhos lies the [[shelf break]], beyond which the seabed falls away much more steeply, averaging around 50 metres per kilometre (260&nbsp;ft/mi).<ref name = \"Pearce 1997\">{{cite book | first = AF | last = Pearce | year = 1997 | chapter = The Leeuwin Current and the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia | editor = Wells, FE | title = The Marine Flora and Fauna of the Houtman Abrolhos Islands, Western Australia | volume = 1 | pages = 11\u201346 | publisher = Western Australian Museum | location = Perth}}</ref>\n\nThe islands of each island group arise from a single [[carbonate platform]], so the waters within an island group are mostly shallow. The channels between groups, however, are 40 to 50 metres deep, and therefore no impediment to the exchange of offshore and inshore waters.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n===Currents===\nThe Houtman Abrolhos lies almost directly in the path of the [[Leeuwin Current]], which draws warm, low-saline water of tropical origin southwards along the coast of Western Australia. This current flows all year round, but is strongest during [[southern hemisphere]] winter months. In general the Leeuwin Current runs along the shelf break, and thus passes close by the western edge of the Abrolhos. It meanders, however, sometimes passing well out to sea, and sometimes passing directly through the island chain, bathing it in warm tropical water;<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/> Although the direction of the Leeuwin Current is predominantly southerly, [[Shark Bay, Western Australia|Shark Bay]] and the Houtman Abrolhos together act as a [[topography|topographical]] trigger for the forming of [[eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]],<ref name=\"Waite 2007\">{{cite journal | first = A.

There is limited evidence for some sporadic, localised upwelling in the vicinity of the Abrolhos, but if so it appears to have little effect on the extremely low levels of nutrients in the water.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n===Temperature and salinity===\n[[File:Houtman Abrolhos sea temperature and salinity.png|thumb|Mean monthly temperature versus [[salinity]] for the Houtman Abrolhos and the adjacent coast in 1994, showing the Houtman Abrolhos to be much less variable.]]\n\nSea temperature at the islands varies according to a diurnal cycle, with the water at its coldest between six and eight in the morning, and at its warmest between three and four in the afternoon. In summer the daily temperature range is around 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (2&nbsp;\u00b0F); in winter it is about half that.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nThere is also an annual cycle, with sea temperature varying by a little less than 4&nbsp;\u00b0C (7&nbsp;\u00b0F) over the year, peaking at nearly 24&nbsp;\u00b0C (75&nbsp;\u00b0F) in March, and falling to around 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F) in September. This variability is much less than in nearby coastal waters, which reaches a similar peak in summer but drops as low as 18&nbsp;\u00b0C (64&nbsp;\u00b0F) in winter. The relatively low variability in sea temperatures at the Abrolhos is largely attributable to the Leeuwin Current, which bathes the islands in warm tropical water during winter months.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nA similar annual pattern occurs in [[salinity]]. There is a clear seasonal variation, with values ranging from a summer high of around 35.7 [[parts per trillion|ppt]], to a winter low of around 35.4 ppt. As with water temperatures, the variability in salinity is much smaller than in coastal waters, where summer salinity reaches 36.4 ppt. This difference is partly due to the low-salinity waters of the Leeuwin Current, but there are a number of other factors involved, including high evaporation of coastal waters in summer.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nTemperatures can also vary substantially from year to year. Annual mean temperatures vary by as much as 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (2&nbsp;\u00b0F); with cooler years usually cooler throughout the year. There is evidence that annual mean temperatures are related to [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] events.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nThe [[water column]] is generally well-mixed, with no evidence of a significant [[halocline]] or [[thermocline]]. Mean differences in water temperature between sea surface and sea bed range from only half a degree (Celsius; 1&nbsp;\u00b0F) in summer to almost zero in winter, and differences in salinity are very small even when the Leeuwin Current is at its strongest.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n===Sea levels===\nAs with the rest of southwestern Australia, [[tide]]s at the Houtman Abrolhos are small and irregular. There is little tidal data available for the islands, but what there is accords very closely with the data for Geraldton. Geraldton tides follow a diurnal pattern, with maximum tidal ranges of around 1-metre (3&nbsp;ft).<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nMean sea levels at Geraldton show seasonal fluctuations, being higher in winter when the Leeuwin Current is at its peak. There are also variations from year to year, which are strongly associated with the [[El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) cycle. Apparently, ENSO events induce a weaker Leeuwin Current, which results in lower sea levels.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\nThere is no published information on wave heights in the Abrolhos. In the open ocean, waves are typically a little over two metres high all year round. Nearer the mainland, they are usually less than 1.2 metres, with a calmer period in March and April, and another in October and November.<ref name=\"Pearce 1997\"/>\n\n==Climate==\n{{As of|2012}}, the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]] has not published [[climate|climatic]] data for the Houtman Abrolhos. However, an [[automatic weather station]] has been installed on [[North Island (Houtman Abrolhos)|North Island]] since 1990, and hourly measures of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[air temperature]], [[wind speed]], [[wind direction]], [[relative humidity]] and [[atmospheric pressure]] have been publicly available since then. Based on this and other data, researchers have put together a picture of the Abrolhos' climate.\n\nThe islands have a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[semi-arid climate]], or Bsh, under [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]])  with warm dry summers and cooler, wet winters. Mean temperatures range from 9.3&nbsp;\u00b0C to 19.5&nbsp;\u00b0C in July, and from 19.1&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C in February. These temperatures have a substantially smaller range than on the mainland: the summer temperature is typically a degree cooler, while winter temperatures are a good deal warmer. This is due to the influence of the ocean, and to the Leeuwin Current.\n\n86% of the rain falls between April and September; on average there are 89 raindays, resulting in 469 millimetres of rain. The wettest month is June, when over 100 millimetres typically falls. In contrast, only about 70 millimetres can be expected to fall between October and March.\n\nIt is nearly always windy. During summer a high pressure ridge lies to the south, causing persistent winds from the southeast or southwest, at speeds exceeding 17 knots (31&nbsp;km/h) almost half the time. During autumn and winter, the ridge moves northwards, increasing the atmospheric pressure over the islands, resulting in highly variable winds. Winter tends to produce both the strongest gales and the most frequent periods of calm.\n\nIn addition to these winds, there is daily pattern of land breezes in the morning, followed by the onset of south-westerly sea breezes in the afternoon. This pattern is caused by temperature differences between the land and the ocean, and is not as strong in the Houtman Abrolhos as on the mainland, but is present nonetheless.\n\nThree classes of storm have been identified for the region. Brief squalls may occur between December and April. A [[tropical cyclone]] occurs in the area about once in three years, between January and April; these may generate extremely high wind speeds that are potentially destructive. During winter, [[extra-tropical cyclone]]s sometimes pass south of Geraldton, generating winter gales with gusts of up to 35 metres per second, the wind direction from the northwest initially, then gradually moving around to southerly.\n\n==Biogeography==\nUnder the [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA), the islands of the Houtman Abrolhos fall within the [[Geraldton Hills]] subregion of the [[Geraldton Sandplains]] region.<ref name=\"IBRA 5.1\">{{cite journal|author=[[Environment Australia]] |title=Revision of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) and Development of Version 5.1 \u2013 Summary Report |publisher=[[Department of the Environment and Water Resources]], [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] |url=http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html |accessdate=2007-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905215218/http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version5-1/summary-report/index.html |archivedate=5 September 2006 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"IBRA 6.1\">[http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version6-1/index.html IBRA Version 6.1] data {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908221444/http://www.deh.gov.au/parks/nrs/ibra/version6-1/index.html |date=8 September 2006 }}</ref> The main [[biogeography|biogeographic]] significance of the islands is their isolation, allowing them to provide [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]] for such threatened fauna as [[Tammar wallaby|tammar wallabies]] (''Macropus eugenii''), [[Australian sea lion]]s (''Neophoca cinerea'') and rare breeding seabirds.<ref name=\"Desmond 2001\">{{cite book | first = Anthony | last = Desmond |author2=Alanna Chant | year = 2001 | chapter = Geraldton Sandplains 2 (GS2 \u2013 Geraldton Hills subregion) | chapterurl = http://www.naturebase.net/pdf/science/bio_audit/geraldton_sandplains02_p265-292.pdf | accessdate = 2008-03-02 | title = A Biodiversity Audit of WA | url = http://www.naturebase.net/content/view/960/1397/ | publisher = Department of Environment and Conservation | location = Western Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn marine terms, the Houtman Abrolhos is located within the [[Southwest Shelf Transition]], an [[Integrated Marine and Coastal Regionalisation of Australia]] (IMCRA) [[biotone]] that takes in the continental shelf from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] to [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]].

The proportions of tropical, temperate and west coast endemic biota vary from taxonomic group to group, but in general the biota is dominated by tropical species.

Populations apparently fell dramatically between the 1840s and the 1880s, largely due to extensive commercial [[seal hunting|sealing]] in the area. In addition to direct killing of the animals, it is likely that much of the [[mangrove]] habitat on the islands was cleared as fuel for [[trypot]]s, and this may have affected the survival of young pups.

Aside from the early castaways noted above, the Islands have only had a small seasonal population of fishermen. The present fishermen all have permanent residence elsewhere, mainly in [[Geraldton]], but their island shacks are used as a base during the season. For example, North Island has a seasonal camp for western rock lobster fishers, with individual moorings and simple dwellings. During lobster season, which runs from 15 March to 30 June, the island hosts up to 130 people. The camp is serviced by a carrier boat, the North Islander, which visits the island every three days, bringing supplies and taking out the catch and any domestic waste.\n\nTourists are not allowed to camp, and the conservation designation of the Island group forbids any real expansion in human occupation.\n\n====Western rock lobster====\nThe islands are the centre of the [[western rock lobster]] fishery, the largest single-species fishery in Western Australia.\n\n====Saucer scallops====\nAfter Shark Bay, the Houtman Abrolhos supports Western Australia's second largest [[saucer scallop]] fishery.<ref name=\"Fisheries 2007\">{{cite journal|title=Management of the Houtman Abrolhos System: A Draft Review 2007\u20132017 |version=Fisheries Management Paper No. 220 |year=2007 |publisher=Department of Fisheries, Government of Western Australia |url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp220/fmp220.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609101748/http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp220/fmp220.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2009 |accessdate=2007-12-01 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Fisheries 2000\">{{cite journal|title=Aquaculture Plan for the Houtman Abrolhos Islands |version=Fisheries Management Paper No. 137 |year=2000 |publisher=Department of Fisheries, Government of Western Australia |url=http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp137/fmp137.pdf |accessdate=2007-12-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010115535/http://www.fish.wa.gov.au/docs/mp/mp137/fmp137.pdf |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}</ref> This fishery is managed under the ''Abrolhos Islands and Mid West Trawl Limited Entry Fishery Notice 1993''.

He was [[Director of Chancery]] and a [[Lord of Session]].<ref>http://www.scotsconnection.com/clan_crests/Scott.htm</ref> His surname is often spelt as '''Scott''', and Scotstarvit is also spelt as '''Scotstarvet''' or '''Scotstarver'''.\n\n==Life==\nHe was the only son of Robert Scot the younger of [[Knights-Spottie]] in [[Perthshire]], representative in the male line of the Scots of [[Duke of Buccleuch|Buccleuch]]. Robert Scot succeeded to the office of director of chancery on the resignation of his father, Robert Scot the elder of Knights-Spottie, but, falling into bad health, resigned the office in 1582 in favour of his father, its former holder. Robert Scot the elder in 1592 again resigned the office to a kinsman, William Scot of Ardross, on condition that his grandson, John Scott (the subject of this article) should succeed to it on attaining majority, which he did in 1606. The Scottish chancery framed and issued crown charters, brieves, and other crown writs. The possession, loss, and efforts to regain this office played a large part in the career of Sir John.\n\nHe was educated at [[St Leonard's College (University of St Andrews)|St. Leonard's College]], St. Andrews, which he appears to have entered in 1600: he describes himself in the register of 1603 as in his third year. After leaving St. Andrews he went abroad to study, and on his return was called to the bar in 1606. In 1611 he acquired [[Tarvet]] and other lands in [[Fife]], to which he gave the name of Scotstarvet, and six years later he was knighted then made a privy councillor in 1622 by [[James I of England|James VI]], in whose honour he published a Latin poem, ''Hod\u0153poricon in serenissimi et invictissimi Principis Jacobi Sexti ex Scoti\u00e2 su\u00e2 discessum.''\n\nIn 1619 Scot had a license to go for a year to [[Flanders]] and elsewhere. He did not practise much, if at all, at the bar, but recommended himself to Charles I by a suggestion for increasing the revenue by altering the law of feudal tenure. He became in 1629 an [[Extraordinary Lord of Session|extraordinary]], and in 1632 an ordinary, [[lord of session]] under the title of Scotstarvet.\n\nHe was one of many Scottish lawyers and lairds who accepted the covenant, which he subscribed at his parish kirk of [[Ceres, Fife]] on 30 April 1638, and in the following November he declined to sign the king's confession. In 1640 he served on the committee of the estates for the defence of the country. In 1641 he was, with consent of the estates, reappointed judge by a new commission. During the war between England and Scotland he served on the war committee in 1648 and 1649. He bought the Mill of [[Kinghorn]] and [[Inchkeith|Inchkeith Island]] for 20,000 merks in 1649.<ref>http://www.oldandnewedinburgh.co.uk/volume6/page109.htm</ref>\n\nUnder the Commonwealth he lost the office both of judge and director of chancery. He made many appeals to be restored to the latter as an administrative, and not a judicial, office; but, although he obtained an opinion in his favour by the commissioners of the great seal, [[Oliver Cromwell]] gave it in 1652 to Jeffrey the quaker, who held it till the [[English Restoration|Restoration]]. Scott, through [[George Monck]], again appealed to Cromwell for the reversion of the office if Jeffrey died. Cromwell fined him \u00a31,500 in 1654 for his part in the war. But his later correspondence with Cromwell did not improve his character with the royalists, and on the Restoration he was fined \u00a3500, and was not restored to the office of judge or that of director of chancery, which was conferred on [[Sir William Ker]], who, he indignantly said, \u2018danced him out of it, being a dextrous dancer.\u2019 [[Sir James Balfour, 1st Baronet|Sir James Balfour]] described Scott's public character in a few words: \u2018He was a busy man in troubled times.\u2019 But in spite of his misfortunes, Scot did not cease to be busy when peace came. He returned to Scotstarvet, where he engaged in literary work and correspondence. There he died in 1670.\n\n==Works and legacy==\nScott is characterized by [[James Grant (1822\u20131887)|James Grant]] in ''Old and New Scotland'' as \"eccentric and sarcastic\".

When ''D. mettleri'' are collected from cacti in prevalent geographic locations, they are isolated alongside ''D. nigrospiracula''. Both species exploit the toxic sap of their host plants. However, unlike ''D. nigrospiracula,'' ''D. mettleri'' has a more efficient detoxification system that enables it to nest in areas not exploited by ''D. nigrospiracula''.<ref name=\"Castrezana_2012\" />\n\n''D. mettleri'' prefers to breed in soil moisturized in the sap of injured cacti, while ''D. nigrospiracula'' is found in the tissue of the cactus itself and is thus subjected to less concentrated toxin levels as compared to ''D. mettleri''. An up-regulation in the genes encoding for [[Xenobiotic|xenobiotic resistance]] are attributed to the specialized and highly efficient [[detoxification]] ability of ''D. mettleri'' in comparison to other species. This enables the species to use a breeding ground otherwise lethal to both larvae and adults.<ref name=\"Castrezana_2012\" />\n\n===Feeding differences===\n''D. nigrospiracula'' solely exploits cactus [[sap]] on the plant itself (i.e. in the tissues of the cacti). However, ''D. mettleri'' adults are located on both the cactus and in nearby soil, as the fly has the specialized ability to detoxify the highly concentrated sap found in surrounding soil. Females are more commonly located in their breeding ground (the soil), whereas males are situated in both areas.<ref name=\"Heed_1977\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Heed WB | date = 1977 | title = A new cactus feeding but soil breeding species of Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae). | journal = Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington | volume = 79 | pages = 649\u2013654 }}</ref>\n\n===Physical distinction===\n[[Phenotype|Phenotypic]] differences and similarities may be used to distinguish between ''D. mettleri'' and ''D. nigrospiracula''.<ref name=\"Heed_1977\"/> Similarities between these two species include large bodies, black carcasses, and thin, defined cheeks that stand in stark contrast to their elongated eyes.<ref name=\"Heed_1977\" /> Differences between these two species that can be used to decipher between them include the following characteristics that D.

The hypothesis that the necrotic tissue of cacti serves as a similarly protective environment as the soil of the Sonoran Desert for other species of ''Drosophila'' has been disproven. While other ''Drosophila'' have higher heat tolerances due to their breeding grounds in the necrotic tissue of cacti that is higher in heat, ''D. mettleri'' have a lower thermal tolerance because there is no evolutionary advantage to such heat tolerance (ability to exploit the less heat-exposed area of cacti soil).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stratman R, Markow TA | title = Resistance to thermal stress in desert Drosophila. | journal = Functional Ecology | date = December 1998 | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 965\u201370 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2435.1998.00270.x }}</ref>\n[[File:Crested Saguaro cactus.jpg|left|thumb|A species of Saguaro cactus, a key host species for D. ''mettleri.'']]\n\n=== Effects of geographic barriers ===\nThe geography of the area encompassed by the Sonoran Desert gives rise to genetic differentiation among desert ''Drosophila'' species who feed on necrotic rot. The Sonoran Desert incorporates the [[peninsular]] region of [[Baja California]] and mainland regions of California. After the peninsula was formed, the [[Gulf of California]], which lies between  the peninsula and the mainland, served as a barrier to dispersal opportunities in insects and land mammals. Another physical geographic barrier is the [[Gran Desierto de Altar|Gran Desierto de Alter]], a large sand dune between the peninsula and the mainland.\u00a0 These physical geographic barriers are the cause of [[gene flow]] among Sonoran Desert flies. Studies of [[Alloenzyme|allozymes]] in ''D. mettleri'' and ''D. nigrospiracula'' show differences in nuclear markers that would otherwise suggest differentiation among the regions of the Sonoran Desert. In ''D. nigrospiracula'', there were markers that showed differences within the species when they were located disparately among the peninsular and mainland regions of the desert. In ''D. mettleri'', however, there were no such nuclear marker differences among members of the species found on the peninsula versus those found on the mainland. These differences show that deviations among ''D. mettleri'' can be supported through the [[Gene flow|stepping stone hypothesis]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pfeiler E, Markow TA | title = Phylogeography of the Cactophilic Drosophila and Other Arthropods Associated with Cactus Necroses in the Sonoran Desert | journal = Insects | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 218\u201331 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 26467624 | pmc = 4553460 | doi = 10.3390/insects2020218 }}</ref>     \n\nEach of the relatives of ''D. mettleri'' that are closest [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] do not inhabit the Sonoran Desert region; therefore, the four species of ''Drosophila'' that do inhabit the Sonoran Desert region experienced [[parallel evolution]] instead of speciation within the desert.

Each of these flies chooses to exploit a different host plant for its resources (breeding, food). The selection of host cactus is important to the amount of resources available to each of these species and plays a role in the growth and development of the species. \u00a0\n\n=== Other factors leading to host selection ===\nEach fly species exploits necrotic rot patches on the cactus for nutrients. The largest necrotic patch sizes rank in order from highest to lowest: cardon, saguaro, [[Stenocereus thurberi|organpipe]], and senita. The size and arm spans of the cacti did not influence the size of the necrotic patches. Instead of rot patch size being regulated by spatial factors, seasonal differences in the growth of the host plants determined how large and how abundant necrotic patches were. Further, temporal factors determined the amount of time a necrotic patch lasted; during the spring, patches are least abundant and during the summer, patches are most abundant. While all other species of the four Sonoran Desert Drosophila showed a correlation between the resource richness of their hosts\u2019 necrotic patches and population size, no such distinct correlation was found for ''D. mettleri''. ''D. mettleri'' exploits both necrotic patches and soil near rotting cacti; further, this species can thrive on a variety of hosts, leading to more dispersal of these flies under a given spatial region. The overall development periods and availability of host cacti strongly affects the growth of both larvae and the reproductive success of adults. For larvae, optimal host conditions entail long-lived necrotic plots as this gives the larvae enough time to grow and develop into larger, more fit adults. For adults, adequate conditions include hosts that grow more regularly because adults will have a regular site to lay eggs.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" />\n\n===Defense mechanism===\nThe host cacti contain toxic chemicals and compounds that otherwise prevent flies from feeding on cacti. ''D. metlerri'' contains genes that enable it to detoxify these toxic compounds and thus feed off of the cacti as a source of nutrients. These genes are linked to the evolution of [[xenobiotic]] resistance.\n\n==Life history==\nThe unique ability of ''D. mettleri'' to detoxify the high concentration of [[Alkaloid|alkaloids]] present in the soil surrounding cacti with rot spots enables adult females to lay their eggs and sustain their larvae in the same nesting area. Other species of desert ''Drosophila'' that inhabit the same geographic region lack this ability and thus reduce the amount of competition females face in finding nesting sites. One species (''D. majavensis'') is composed of adults who cannot withstand the high alkaloid concentration in cacti soil unlike the larva that is only slightly sensitive. While this may encourage larval deposits to form in the soil, the inability of adult females to survive in these soil conditions prevents them from nesting in the soil, thus decreasing the amount of competition ''D. mettleri'' faces in finding appropriate nesting sites.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biennial Report, National Institute of General Medical Sciences (U.S.)|date=1987|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health}}</ref>\n\n==Food resources==\n\n=== Rot material ===\nLike other desert species of ''Drosophila'', ''D. mettleri'' relies on the exudant juices of cacti as a feeding substrate. The juice found in the necrotic tissue of the cacti is also used as a feeding substrate when levels of exudates in the soil become low or scarce.<ref name=\"pmid10479998\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker JS, Starmer WT|date=1999|title=Environmental effects and the genetics of oviposition site preference for natural yeast substrates in Drosophila buzzatii|journal=Hereditas|volume=130|issue=2|pages=145\u201375|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1999.00145.x|pmid=10479998}}</ref>\n\n=== Yeast and bacteria ===\nThe area of the cactus often exploited by ''D. mettleri'' (when exudants are not extracted from soil) are \"rot pockets\". These pockets form when the cactus is injured; aggregates of bacteria and yeast conglomerate on the surface near the injury site and begin to form a pocket-like indent. The [[fermentation]] of the yeast and bacteria in this pocket serve as a \"signal\" to ''D. mettleri'' so that the site can be exploited for food.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" /> \n\nCommunities of yeast on host species of ''D. mettleri'' have been isolated and serve to decompose the host cacti. During mating, both sexes of the fly gift each other yeast and bacteria. This mixture is then placed on breeding sites, later exposing larvae to natural florae necessary in increasing their fitness.<ref name=\"pmid4904970\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Bakula M|date=November 1969|title=The persistence of a microbial flora during postembryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Journal of Invertebrate Pathology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=365\u201374|doi=10.1016/0022-2011(69)90163-3|pmid=4904970}}</ref>\n\n==Mating==\n===Courtship behavior===\nThe courtship behaviors of desert ''Drosophila'' of the [[Eremophila (plant)|Eremophila]] complex are similar. ''D. mettleri'', belonging to this complex, begin courting as soon as they have their first [[Intrasexual competition|intrasexual]] contact. Once the male brushes against a female, courting begins and the male begins to follow the female. The male initiates in courtship song through vibration of his wings. The male will choose to either follow a side of the female or follow behind her. Depending on the spot the male decides to occupy will determine the vibrational frequency of the male's wings. The farther the male is to the female, the shorter the wing pulses are. When the female stops moving, vibrational frequency increases. During this courtship song, the male may chose to lick the genitals of the female. If the female chooses to accept a male during his courting song, the female's wings will expand and the male will terminate his song. The flies will begin to copulate soon after.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Spangler HG, Heed WB|date=January 1995|title=Courtship sounds and behaviour of the two saguaro-breeding Drosophila and their relatives.|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1031\u20139|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80103-0}}</ref> In comparison to other species in the Eremophila complex, males of ''D. mettleri'' are more likely to force copulation with females.\n\n===Courtship song===\nThe courting song of ''D. mettleri'' is characterized by distinct vibrational pulses and frequencies. The more mobile a female is, the more irregular the vibrational pulses of the male will be. To initiate the courting song, a male will extend his wings seventy-eighty degrees and release a few short pulses. After the initiation process, more regular pulses are released by males.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\" />\n\n=== Male-female controls ===\nIn ''D. mettleri'', after the male inserts his sperm (i.e. ejaculates) into his mate, swelling of the vaginal wall occurs. This may serve as a copulatory plug that serves as a defense against other males copulating and having offspring with the female. The male is then enabled to ensure his own paternity. This is an adaptation by the males of ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0as females of this species re-mate many times and will selectively fertilize her eggs. The copulatory plug has been shown to ensure paternity of the father, but there is no evidence of this plug serving any selection purposes. \u00a0\n\n6-8 hours after the insemination process occurs, a female will get rid of any excess sperm and the material that was used as a copulatory plug by her mate. This shows that both the male and females in the relationship have control over the sexual behaviors and outcomes of the opposite sex.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Tolbert LP, Heed WB|date=March 1994|title=Ultrastructural examination of the insemination reaction in Drosophila|journal=Cell and Tissue Research|volume=275|issue=3|pages=467\u201379|doi=10.1007/BF00318816|pmid=8137397}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:Parasite140083-fig1 Figs 1-7 Neoechinorhynchus (Hebesoma) spiramuscularis.tif|left|thumb|A sketch shows the reproductive architecture in a female fly.]]\n<br />\n==== Ejaculation material ====\nThe ejaculate material from the male serves a larger purpose than acting as a copulatory plug. The fluid may serve as a source of nutrients, and can also affect the time it takes for sperm activation to occur as well as the time of oviposition. The nutrients found in this fluid have been shown to increase egg size and to increase the quantity of eggs laid by the female (depending on the nutrient density of the fluid). Thus, the quality of this fluid limits or increases the female's reproductive success. The amount of fluid a male will contribute during a mating is dependent on the species of the Sonoran Desert drosophila. In ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0males make large ejaculatory investments when mating, and thus the male's fluid quality plays a large role in the development of the larvae.\n\n=== Ejaculation nutrients' role in monogamy ===\nThe costs of having only one reproductive partner due to effects of the plug must be outweighed by the nutrient benefits gained by the ejaculated material. The cost to benefit trade-off is dependent upon resource availability and is highly regulated by the distribution and growth of rot material.  In D. ''mettleri'', there has been an evolutionary drive toward greater reproductive success of males donating the best quality and quantity of fluid. Radio-labeling was used to measure the amount of fluid incorporated into female egg production (and thus not removed from the body after 6-8 hours). They found that females with the largest vaginal swellings incorporated the highest amount of sperm from a single male partner than did females who had smaller vaginal swellings (and thus had the option to re-mate). Other Dipterans who do not have females undergoing an insemination process were also observed; no radio-labeled material was found in the eggs of these females, showing that the insemination process characteristic of D. ''mettleri'' and other Desert Drosophila is essential in male paternity assurance.<ref name=\"pmid28568832\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pitnick S, Markow TA, Riedy MF|date=May 1991|title=Transfer of Ejaculate and Incorporation of Male-Derived Substances by Females in the Nannoptera Species Group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=45|issue=3|pages=774\u2013780|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1991.tb04347.x|pmid=28568832}}</ref>\n\n=== Not all are monogamous ===\nA study published in 2012 did extensive research into the reproductive biology of ''D. mettleri'' and correlating information to its reproductive behaviors. Male flies mature more quickly than female flies do, but the study showed this is not the pivotal factor in why many wild females either lack sperm or exploit sperm sources too quickly once inseminated. The researchers concluded that the quick cycling of sperm in females explains why there may be frequent remating in this species both in the lab and in nature. The study also found that there were no consequences to life spans of females that had remated more than other females. In fact, a few benefits to multiple mating for females include greater female postcopulatory control of sperm and greater success of offspring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese A.|last2=Beall|first2=Stephen|last3=Castrezana|first3=Sergio|date=2012-04-01|title=The wild side of life|journal=Fly|volume=6|issue=2|pages=98\u2013101|doi=10.4161/fly.19552|issn=1933-6934|pmid=22627903}}</ref>\n\n==Parental care==\n===Oviposition===\nAs [[Necrotroph|necrotrophs]], these flies are known to lay their eggs in the rotting refuse of dying cacti. In comparison to other necrotrophs in the desert, ''D. metlerri'' prefers to breed in soils entrenched in the liquid of these rotting cacti rather than breeding in the tissues of cacti that contain these juices. The significance of this behavior is that the arid conditions of the desert lead to extreme water loss in the cacti, and resulting liquid toxins trailing into nearby soil is concentrated to a magnitude other nectrotrophs cannot detoxify. Thus, the detoxification capacity of ''D. metlerri'' enables it to breed in a niche environment not exploited commonly by other species.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Fogleman JC, Heed WB, Kircher HW|date=January 1982|title=Drosophila mettleri and senita cactus alkaloids: fitness measurements and their ecological significance.|journal=Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A: Physiology|volume=71|issue=3|pages=413\u20137|doi=10.1016/0300-9629(82)90427-3}}</ref>\n\nThe specialized detoxification abilities of ''D. mettleri'' have been tested in order to see if host-plant shifts would lead to changes on the genetic level in future offspring of flies exploiting cacti with different chemical compositions than those of their typical host cacti (senita and saguaro).<ref name=\"pmid26384860\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Hoang K, Matzkin LM, Bono JM|date=October 2015|title=Transcriptional variation associated with cactus host plant adaptation in Drosophila mettleri populations|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=24|issue=20|pages=5186\u201399|doi=10.1111/mec.13388|pmid=26384860}}</ref> Future generations showed transcriptional changes in genes triggering different metabolic pathways better equipped to detoxify the variant chemical environment of their host-cacti.\n\n==Enemies==\n===Parasites===\n''Drosophila'' species, including ''D. mettleri'' and others in its phylogenetic lineage, show predatory pressure by [[Ectoparasitic|ectoparasistic]] [[Mite|mites]] that live in the necrotic rotting spots on desert cacti.

When ''D. mettleri'' are collected from cacti in prevalent geographic locations, they are isolated alongside ''D. nigrospiracula''. Both species exploit the toxic sap of their host plants.

The Sonoran Desert incorporates the [[peninsular]] region of [[Baja California]] and mainland regions of California. After the peninsula was formed, the [[Gulf of California]], which lies between  the peninsula and the mainland, served as a barrier to dispersal opportunities in insects and land mammals. Another physical geographic barrier is the [[Gran Desierto de Altar|Gran Desierto de Alter]], a large sand dune between the peninsula and the mainland.\u00a0 These physical geographic barriers are the cause of [[gene flow]] among Sonoran Desert flies. Studies of [[Alloenzyme|allozymes]] in ''D. mettleri'' and ''D. nigrospiracula'' show differences in nuclear markers that would otherwise suggest differentiation among the regions of the Sonoran Desert. In ''D. nigrospiracula'', there were markers that showed differences within the species when they were located disparately among the peninsular and mainland regions of the desert. In ''D. mettleri'', however, there were no such nuclear marker differences among members of the species found on the peninsula versus those found on the mainland.

Each of these flies chooses to exploit a different host plant for its resources (breeding, food). The selection of host cactus is important to the amount of resources available to each of these species and plays a role in the growth and development of the species. \u00a0\n\n=== Other factors leading to host selection ===\nEach fly species exploits necrotic rot patches on the cactus for nutrients. The largest necrotic patch sizes rank in order from highest to lowest: cardon, saguaro, [[Stenocereus thurberi|organpipe]], and senita. The size and arm spans of the cacti did not influence the size of the necrotic patches. Instead of rot patch size being regulated by spatial factors, seasonal differences in the growth of the host plants determined how large and how abundant necrotic patches were. Further, temporal factors determined the amount of time a necrotic patch lasted; during the spring, patches are least abundant and during the summer, patches are most abundant. While all other species of the four Sonoran Desert Drosophila showed a correlation between the resource richness of their hosts\u2019 necrotic patches and population size, no such distinct correlation was found for ''D. mettleri''. ''D. mettleri'' exploits both necrotic patches and soil near rotting cacti; further, this species can thrive on a variety of hosts, leading to more dispersal of these flies under a given spatial region. The overall development periods and availability of host cacti strongly affects the growth of both larvae and the reproductive success of adults. For larvae, optimal host conditions entail long-lived necrotic plots as this gives the larvae enough time to grow and develop into larger, more fit adults. For adults, adequate conditions include hosts that grow more regularly because adults will have a regular site to lay eggs.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" />\n\n===Defense mechanism===\nThe host cacti contain toxic chemicals and compounds that otherwise prevent flies from feeding on cacti. ''D. metlerri'' contains genes that enable it to detoxify these toxic compounds and thus feed off of the cacti as a source of nutrients. These genes are linked to the evolution of [[xenobiotic]] resistance.\n\n==Life history==\nThe unique ability of ''D. mettleri'' to detoxify the high concentration of [[Alkaloid|alkaloids]] present in the soil surrounding cacti with rot spots enables adult females to lay their eggs and sustain their larvae in the same nesting area. Other species of desert ''Drosophila'' that inhabit the same geographic region lack this ability and thus reduce the amount of competition females face in finding nesting sites. One species (''D. majavensis'') is composed of adults who cannot withstand the high alkaloid concentration in cacti soil unlike the larva that is only slightly sensitive. While this may encourage larval deposits to form in the soil, the inability of adult females to survive in these soil conditions prevents them from nesting in the soil, thus decreasing the amount of competition ''D. mettleri'' faces in finding appropriate nesting sites.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biennial Report, National Institute of General Medical Sciences (U.S.)|date=1987|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institute of Health}}</ref>\n\n==Food resources==\n\n=== Rot material ===\nLike other desert species of ''Drosophila'', ''D. mettleri'' relies on the exudant juices of cacti as a feeding substrate. The juice found in the necrotic tissue of the cacti is also used as a feeding substrate when levels of exudates in the soil become low or scarce.<ref name=\"pmid10479998\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Barker JS, Starmer WT|date=1999|title=Environmental effects and the genetics of oviposition site preference for natural yeast substrates in Drosophila buzzatii|journal=Hereditas|volume=130|issue=2|pages=145\u201375|doi=10.1111/j.1601-5223.1999.00145.x|pmid=10479998}}</ref>\n\n=== Yeast and bacteria ===\nThe area of the cactus often exploited by ''D. mettleri'' (when exudants are not extracted from soil) are \"rot pockets\". These pockets form when the cactus is injured; aggregates of bacteria and yeast conglomerate on the surface near the injury site and begin to form a pocket-like indent. The [[fermentation]] of the yeast and bacteria in this pocket serve as a \"signal\" to ''D. mettleri'' so that the site can be exploited for food.<ref name=\"Breitmeyer_1998\" /> \n\nCommunities of yeast on host species of ''D. mettleri'' have been isolated and serve to decompose the host cacti.

''D. mettleri'', belonging to this complex, begin courting as soon as they have their first [[Intrasexual competition|intrasexual]] contact. Once the male brushes against a female, courting begins and the male begins to follow the female. The male initiates in courtship song through vibration of his wings. The male will choose to either follow a side of the female or follow behind her. Depending on the spot the male decides to occupy will determine the vibrational frequency of the male's wings. The farther the male is to the female, the shorter the wing pulses are. When the female stops moving, vibrational frequency increases. During this courtship song, the male may chose to lick the genitals of the female. If the female choses to accept a male during his courting song, the female's wings will expand and the male will terminate his song. The flies will begin to copulate soon after.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Spangler HG, Heed WB|date=January 1995|title=Courtship sounds and behaviour of the two saguaro-breeding Drosophila and their relatives.|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1031\u20139|doi=10.1016/0003-3472(95)80103-0}}</ref> In comparison to other species in the Eremophila complex, males of ''D. mettleri'' are more likely to force copulation with females.\n\n===Courtship song===\nThe courting song of ''D. mettleri'' is characterized by distinct vibrational pulses and frequencies. The more mobile a female is, the more irregular the vibrational pulses of the male will be. To initiate the courting song, a male will extend his wings seventy-eighty degrees and release a few short pulses. After the initiation process, more regular pulses are released by males.<ref name=\"Alonso-Pimente_1995\" />\n\n=== Male-female controls ===\nIn ''D. mettleri'', after the male inserts his sperm (i.e. ejaculates) into his mate, swelling of the vaginal wall occurs. This may serve as a copulatory plug that serves as a defense against other males copulating and having offspring with the female. The male is then enabled to ensure his own paternity. This is an adaptation by the males of ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0as females of this species re-mate many times and will selectively fertilize her eggs. The copulatory plug has been shown to ensure paternity of the father, but there is no evidence of this plug serving any selection purposes. \u00a0\n\n6-8 hours after the insemination process occurs, a female will get rid of any excess sperm and the material that was used as a copulatory plug by her mate. This shows that both the male and females in the relationship have control over the sexual behaviors and outcomes of the opposite sex.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso-Pimentel H, Tolbert LP, Heed WB|date=March 1994|title=Ultrastructural examination of the insemination reaction in Drosophila|journal=Cell and Tissue Research|volume=275|issue=3|pages=467\u201379|doi=10.1007/BF00318816|pmid=8137397}}</ref>\n<br />\n[[File:Parasite140083-fig1 Figs 1-7 Neoechinorhynchus (Hebesoma) spiramuscularis.tif|left|thumb|A sketch shows the reproductive architecture in a female fly.]]\n<br />\n==== Ejaculation material ====\nThe ejaculate material from the male serves a larger purpose than acting as a copulatory plug. The fluid may serve as a source of nutrients, and can also affect the time it takes for sperm activation to occur as well as the time of oviposition. The nutrients found in this fluid have been shown to increase egg size and to increase the quantity of eggs laid by the female (depending on the nutrient density of the fluid). Thus, the quality of this fluid limits or increases the female's reproductive success. The amount of fluid a male will contribute during a mating is dependent on the species of the Sonoran Desert drosophila. In ''D. mettleri'', \u00a0males make large ejaculatory investments when mating, and thus the male's fluid quality plays a large role in the development of the larvae.\n\n=== Ejaculation nutrients' role in monogamy ===\nThe costs of having only one reproductive partner due to effects of the plug must be outweighed by the nutrient benefits gained by the ejaculated material. The cost to benefit trade-off is dependent upon resource availability and is highly regulated by the distribution and growth of rot material.  In D. ''mettleri'', there has been an evolutionary drive toward greater reproductive success of males donating the best quality and quantity of fluid. Radio-labeling was used to measure the amount of fluid incorporated into female egg production (and thus not removed from the body after 6-8 hours). They found that females with the largest vaginal swellings incorporated the highest amount of sperm from a single male partner than did females who had smaller vaginal swellings (and thus had the option to re-mate). Other Dipterans who do not have females undergoing an insemination process were also observed; no radio-labeled material was found in the eggs of these females, showing that the insemination process characteristic of D. ''mettleri'' and other Desert Drosophila is essential in male paternity assurance.<ref name=\"pmid28568832\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Pitnick S, Markow TA, Riedy MF|date=May 1991|title=Transfer of Ejaculate and Incorporation of Male-Derived Substances by Females in the Nannoptera Species Group (Diptera: Drosophilidae)|journal=Evolution; International Journal of Organic Evolution|volume=45|issue=3|pages=774\u2013780|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1991.tb04347.x|pmid=28568832}}</ref>\n\n=== Not all are monogamous ===\nA study published in 2012 did extensive research into the reproductive biology of ''D. mettleri'' and correlating information to its reproductive behaviors. Male flies mature more quickly than female flies do, but the study showed this is not the pivotal factor in why many wild females either lack sperm or exploit sperm sources too quickly once inseminated. The researchers concluded that the quick cycling of sperm in females explains why there may be frequent remating in this species both in the lab and in nature. The study also found that there were no consequences to life spans of females that had remated more than other females. In fact, a few benefits to multiple mating for females include greater female postcopulatory control of sperm and greater success of offspring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese A.|last2=Beall|first2=Stephen|last3=Castrezana|first3=Sergio|date=2012-04-01|title=The wild side of life|journal=Fly|volume=6|issue=2|pages=98\u2013101|doi=10.4161/fly.19552|issn=1933-6934|pmid=22627903}}</ref>\n\n==Parental care==\n===Oviposition===\nAs [[Necrotroph|necrotrophs]], these flies are known to lay their eggs in the rotting refuse of dying cacti. In comparison to other necrotrophs in the desert, ''D. metlerri'' prefers to breed in soils entrenched in the liquid of these rotting cacti rather than breeding in the tissues of cacti that contain these juices. The significance of this behavior is that the arid conditions of the desert lead to extreme water loss in the cacti, and resulting liquid toxins trailing into nearby soil is concentrated to a magnitude other nectrotrophs cannot detoxify.

The word itself derives through [[Old French]] from the [[Latin]] word ''mansio'' \"dwelling\", an abstract noun derived from the verb ''manere'' \"to dwell\". The [[English language|English]] word ''[[manse]]'' originally defined a property large enough for the parish priest to maintain himself, but a mansion is no longer self-sustaining in this way (compare a Roman or medieval [[villa]]).

As social conditions slowly changed and stabilised [[fortification]]s were able to be reduced, and over the centuries gave way to comfort. It became fashionable and possible for homes to be beautiful rather than grim and forbidding allowing for the development of the modern mansion.\n\nIn British English, a mansion block refers to a block of flats or [[apartments]] designed for the appearance of grandeur. In many parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Japan, the word mansion also refers to a block of apartments. In modern Japan, a \"manshon\" (\u30de\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3), stemming from the English word \"mansion\", is used to refer to a multi-unit apartment complex or condominium.\n\nIn Europe,  from the 15th century onwards, a combination of politics and advancements in modern weaponry negated the need for the aristocracy to live in fortified castles. As a result, many were transformed into mansions without defences or demolished and rebuilt in a more modern, undefended style. Due to intermarriage and primogeniture inheritance amongst the aristocracy, it became common for one noble to often own several country houses.

It might be noted that sometimes the house of a clergyman was called a \"mansion house\" (e.g., by the Revd James Blair, Commissary in Virginia for the Bishop of London, 1689\u20131745, a term related to the word \"manse\" commonly used in the Church of Scotland and in Non-Conformist churches.

Built by self-made men, these were often smaller than those built by the old European aristocracy. These new builders of mansions did not confine themselves to just the then-fashionable Gothic tastes in architecture, but also experimented with 19th-century versions of older Renaissance and Tudoresque styles; [[The Breakers]] in [[Rhode Island]] is a fine example of American Renaissance revivalism.\n\nDuring the 19th century, like the major thoroughfares of all important cities, [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]], was lined with mansions. Many of these were designed by the leading architects of the day, often in European [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]], and were built by families who were making their fortunes, and thus achieving their social aspirations. However, nearly all of these have now been demolished, thus depriving New York of a [[boulevard]] to rival, in the architectural sense, those in [[Paris]], [[London]] or [[Rome]]\u2014where the many large mansions and [[palazzi]] built or remodeled during this era still survive. Mansions built in the countryside were not spared either. One of the most spectacular estates of the U.S., [[Whitemarsh Hall]], was demolished in 1980, along with its extensive gardens, to make way for suburban developments.\n\nGrand [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] mansions designed by [[Samuel McIntire]] inhabit an area that, in 2012, is the largest collection of 17th- and 18th-century structures in the United States of America.

He and his brothers, Joseph and Angler, began their careers as housewrights and carpenters while in their teens but, early on, Samuel's work caught the eye of Salem's pre-eminent merchant, Elias Hasket Derby. Over the next quarter century, McIntire built or remodelled a number of homes for Derby and members of his extended family. McIntire also worked occasionally on Derby's vessels, and wasn't averse to fixing a wagon or building a birdhouse if his patron so desired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemweb.com/guide/arch/houses.shtml#pnhouse |title=Salem Massachusetts \u2013 Salem Architecture 17th & 18th Centuries: Overview |publisher=Salemweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> [[Hamilton Hall (Salem, Massachusetts)|Hamilton Hall]] is a [[National Historic Landmark]] at 9 Chestnut Street in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].

He also built, on elegant Chestnut Street, a function hall (named for Alexander Hamilton) and church for the town's merchant class. McIntire also designed the former Salem Court House and Registry of Deeds.\n\nAfter 1793, Samuel McIntire worked exclusively in the architectural style developed by [[Robert Adam]] in Great Britain and brought to America by the great Boston architect, Charles Bulfinch. The delicate [[Adam style]], which emphasized decorative elements and ornamentation, was tailor-made for McIntire, whose unerring sense of design and proportion was exceeded only by his skill as a woodcarver. Carved swags, rosettes, garlands, and his signature sheaths of wheat dominate wood surfaces in McIntire homes built between 1793 and his death in 1811.\n\n[[File:Netherlands, Enschede, Buitenplaats Zonnebeek (1).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] inspired Zonnebeek (1907), [[Enschede]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nEven in Europe, some 19th-century mansions were often built as replicas of older houses, the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res]] in [[France]] was inspired by [[Mentmore Towers]], which in turn is a copy of [[Wollaton Hall]]. Other mansions were built in the new and innovative styles of the new era such as the [[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]] style: The Breakers is a pastiche of an [[Italian Renaissance]] [[palazzo]]; [[Waddesdon Manor]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] is a faithful mixture of various [[France|French]] [[ch\u00e2teau]]x. One of the most enduring and most frequently copied styles for a mansion is the [[Palladian]] \u2013 particularly so in the 18th century. However, the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] was probably the most popular choice of design in the 19th century. The most bizarre example of this was probably [[Fonthill Abbey]] which actually set out to imitate the mansions which had truly evolved from [[medieval]] Gothic [[abbey]]s following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century.\n\nMansions built during and after the 19th century were seldom supported by the large estates of their predecessors. These new mansions were often built as the week-end retreats of [[businessmen]] who commuted to their offices by the new [[railway]]s, which enabled them to leave the [[city]] more easily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Latin America==\n[[File:Fachada lateral de la Quinta Gameros 2.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Quinta Gameros]] is a [[Porfiriato|Porfirian]]-era mansion located in [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]].

Whereas until the second half of the 19th century, Portugal and Spain as the colonial (or former colonial) powers were the eminent models for architecture and upper-class lifestyle, towards the end of the 19th century they were sometimes replaced by then more dominant powers like France or England.\n\nIn comparably developed, densely populated countries like Mexico, feudal estates and their mansions were as grand and stately as in the [[Mediterranean]] old world, whereas where estates were founded in the sparsely populated remote areas like the Pampa of Argentina or Uruguay, where iron pillars, doors, windows, and furniture had to be brought from Europe by ship and afterwards ox cart, buildings were smaller, but normally still aspiring to evoke a stately impression, often featuring, like their earlier Italian counterparts, a [[belvedere (structure)|morador]].\n\nIn Venezuela, the traditional Spanish mansions with a garden in the center of the property are usually referred as \"[[Quinta (estate)|Quinta]]\".\n\n==Modern mansions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Eaton Hall 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]], England, the [[Duke of Westminster]]'s 20th-century country house stands alongside the remains of its 19th-century predecessor.]]\n\nMansions built during the 20th and 21st centuries usually have specially designed rooms meant to accommodate leisure activities of a particular kind. Many will have a conservatory or [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|greenhouse]], while others will have an [[infinity pool]] or a [[home cinema|home theater]]. Some have all of these features. The relative importance of these specially designed rooms changes with the times. At the beginning of the 20th century, no true mansion would have been built without a room to house a private [[library]] or [[study (room)|study]], while at the beginning of the 21st century the presence of a room designed for a home theater or [[movie theater|cinema]] is normal. Most recently, mansions have been built with integrated [[home automation]]. Some other technology-inclined mansions may even have a [[bowling alley]] or a [[server room]].\n\nA modern mansion today may not necessarily be limited to a single house standing alone, but like [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]'s [[Domus Aurea]], mansions may be compounds or a grouping of larger houses. The [[Kennedy Compound]] is an example of one family building surrounded by large houses on a single plot. In general, whether a house can be called a mansion is contextual\u2014in Manhattan or many cities a {{convert|5000| sqft|adj=on}} house would certainly be described as such, but a similar-sized house in the Atlanta suburbs probably would not. Calling a dwelling a mansion indicates a level of grandeur and consumption considerably greater than the norm in that location, with the additional connotation of quality, and correlates highly with the housing patterns of the upper class.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Housing}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[List of Gilded Age mansions]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n* [[Manor house]]\n* [[Mansion tax]]\n* [[Mansionization]]\n* [[Pazo]]\n* [[Townhouse]]\n* [[Villa]]\n* [[Ansitz]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Mansions}}\n* [http://www.colonial-estates.pvoss.de Historic Mansions and Estates in Latin America]\n* [http://www.mois.ee/english/ Estonian Manors Portal] the English version introduces 438 well-preserved historical manors (mansions, estates) in Estonia\n\n[[Category:House types]]\n[[Category:Luxury real estate]]\n\n[[he:\u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4]]\n[[mk:\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u045c\u0430]]\n[[sl:Dvor]]\n[[sv:Herrg\u00e5rd]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2010}}\n[[File:Gelbensande3.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Gelbensande|Gelbensande Manor]], an 1885 [[Gr\u00fcnderzeit]] style mansion built for hunting, near [[Rostock]], Germany.]]\n\nA '''mansion''' is a large dwelling [[house]].

Most [[Europe]]an mansions were also the hub of vast [[Estate (house)|estates]].\n\n==19th-century development==\n[[File:The Breakers Newport.jpg|thumb|left|Built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style, [[The Breakers]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], is one of the best known 19th-century mansions in the [[United States]].]]\nThe 19th century saw the continuation of the building of mansions in the [[United States]] and Europe. Built by self-made men, these were often smaller than those built by the old European aristocracy. These new builders of mansions did not confine themselves to just the then-fashionable Gothic tastes in architecture, but also experimented with 19th-century versions of older Renaissance and Tudoresque styles; [[The Breakers]] in [[Rhode Island]] is a fine example of American Renaissance revivalism.\n\nDuring the 19th century, like the major thoroughfares of all important cities, [[Fifth Avenue]] in [[New York City]], was lined with mansions. Many of these were designed by the leading architects of the day, often in European [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival style]], and were built by families who were making their fortunes, and thus achieving their social aspirations. However, nearly all of these have now been demolished, thus depriving New York of a [[boulevard]] to rival, in the architectural sense, those in [[Paris]], [[London]] or [[Rome]]\u2014where the many large mansions and [[palazzi]] built or remodeled during this era still survive. Mansions built in the countryside were not spared either. One of the most spectacular estates of the U.S., [[Whitemarsh Hall]], was demolished in 1980, along with its extensive gardens, to make way for suburban developments.\n\nGrand [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] mansions designed by [[Samuel McIntire]] inhabit an area that, in 2012, is the largest collection of 17th- and 18th-century structures in the United States of America. This district in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], is called the [[Chestnut Street District|McIntire Historic District]] with the center being Chestnut Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemweb.com/guide/arch/mdistrict.shtml |title=Salem Massachusetts \u2013 Salem Architecture Salem Architecture: McIntire |publisher=Salemweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> McIntire's training came from his father and from books. He and his brothers, Joseph and Angler, began their careers as housewrights and carpenters while in their teens but, early on, Samuel's work caught the eye of Salem's pre-eminent merchant, Elias Hasket Derby. Over the next quarter century, McIntire built or remodelled a number of homes for Derby and members of his extended family. McIntire also worked occasionally on Derby's vessels, and wasn't averse to fixing a wagon or building a birdhouse if his patron so desired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salemweb.com/guide/arch/houses.shtml#pnhouse |title=Salem Massachusetts \u2013 Salem Architecture 17th & 18th Centuries: Overview |publisher=Salemweb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-18}}</ref> [[Hamilton Hall (Salem, Massachusetts)|Hamilton Hall]] is a [[National Historic Landmark]] at 9 Chestnut Street in [[Salem, Massachusetts]].

He also built, on elegant Chestnut Street, a function hall (named for Alexander Hamilton) and church for the town's merchant class. McIntire also designed the former Salem Court House and Registry of Deeds.\n\nAfter 1793, Samuel McIntire worked exclusively in the architectural style developed by [[Robert Adam]] in Great Britain and brought to America by the great Boston architect, Charles Bulfinch. The delicate [[Adam style]], which emphasized decorative elements and ornamentation, was tailor-made for McIntire, whose unerring sense of design and proportion was exceeded only by his skill as a woodcarver. Carved swags, rosettes, garlands, and his signature sheaths of wheat dominate wood surfaces in McIntire homes built between 1793 and his death in 1811.\n\n[[File:Netherlands, Enschede, Buitenplaats Zonnebeek (1).JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] inspired Zonnebeek (1907), [[Enschede]], [[Netherlands]]]]\nEven in Europe, some 19th-century mansions were often built as replicas of older houses, the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Ferri\u00e8res]] in [[France]] was inspired by [[Mentmore Towers]], which in turn is a copy of [[Wollaton Hall]]. Other mansions were built in the new and innovative styles of the new era such as the [[Arts and Crafts movement|arts and crafts]] style: The Breakers is a pastiche of an [[Italian Renaissance]] [[palazzo]]; [[Waddesdon Manor]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] is a faithful mixture of various [[France|French]] [[ch\u00e2teau]]x. One of the most enduring and most frequently copied styles for a mansion is the [[Palladian]] \u2013 particularly so in the 18th century. However, the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] was probably the most popular choice of design in the 19th century. The most bizarre example of this was probably [[Fonthill Abbey]] which actually set out to imitate the mansions which had truly evolved from [[medieval]] Gothic [[abbey]]s following the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the 16th century.\n\nMansions built during and after the 19th century were seldom supported by the large estates of their predecessors. These new mansions were often built as the week-end retreats of [[businessmen]] who commuted to their offices by the new [[railway]]s, which enabled them to leave the [[city]] more easily.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n==Latin America==\n[[File:Fachada lateral de la Quinta Gameros 2.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Quinta Gameros]] is a [[Porfiriato|Porfirian]]-era mansion located in [[Chihuahua City|Chihuahua]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]. The building, designed in a French style, is testimony to an era when France asserted greater [[soft power]] in the region than either Spain or Portugal.]]\nIn [[Latin America]], the grand [[rural]] [[Estate (land)|estate]], the [[Hacienda]], Estancia, in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] speaking [[Brazil]] Fazenda or Est\u00e2ncia, with the mansion as its stately center, is a characteristic feature.\n\nMansions tended to follow European [[architectural style]]s. Whereas until the second half of the 19th century, Portugal and Spain as the colonial (or former colonial) powers were the eminent models for architecture and upper-class lifestyle, towards the end of the 19th century they were sometimes replaced by then more dominant powers like France or England.\n\nIn comparably developed, densely populated countries like Mexico, feudal estates and their mansions were as grand and stately as in the [[Mediterranean]] old world, whereas where estates were founded in the sparsely populated remote areas like the Pampa of Argentina or Uruguay, where iron pillars, doors, windows, and furniture had to be brought from Europe by ship and afterwards ox cart, buildings were smaller, but normally still aspiring to evoke a stately impression, often featuring, like their earlier Italian counterparts, a [[belvedere (structure)|morador]].\n\nIn Venezuela, the traditional Spanish mansions with a garden in the center of the property are usually referred as \"[[Quinta (estate)|Quinta]]\".\n\n==Modern mansions==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Eaton Hall 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eaton Hall, Cheshire|Eaton Hall]], England, the [[Duke of Westminster]]'s 20th-century country house stands alongside the remains of its 19th-century predecessor.]]\n\nMansions built during the 20th and 21st centuries usually have specially designed rooms meant to accommodate leisure activities of a particular kind. Many will have a conservatory or [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|greenhouse]], while others will have an [[infinity pool]] or a [[home cinema|home theater]]. Some have all of these features. The relative importance of these specially designed rooms changes with the times. At the beginning of the 20th century, no true mansion would have been built without a room to house a private [[library]] or [[study (room)|study]], while at the beginning of the 21st century the presence of a room designed for a home theater or [[movie theater|cinema]] is normal. Most recently, mansions have been built with integrated [[home automation]]. Some other technology-inclined mansions may even have a [[bowling alley]] or a [[server room]].\n\nA modern mansion today may not necessarily be limited to a single house standing alone, but like [[Roman Emperor]] [[Nero]]'s [[Domus Aurea]], mansions may be compounds or a grouping of larger houses. The [[Kennedy Compound]] is an example of one family building surrounded by large houses on a single plot. In general, whether a house can be called a mansion is contextual\u2014in Manhattan or many cities a {{convert|5000| sqft|adj=on}} house would certainly be described as such, but a similar-sized house in the Atlanta suburbs probably would not. Calling a dwelling a mansion indicates a level of grandeur and consumption considerably greater than the norm in that location, with the additional connotation of quality, and correlates highly with the housing patterns of the upper class.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Housing}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[List of Gilded Age mansions]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area]]\n* [[List of largest houses in the United States]]\n* [[Manor house]]\n* [[Mansion tax]]\n* [[Mansionization]]\n* [[Pazo]]\n* [[Townhouse]]\n* [[Villa]]\n* [[Ansitz]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{Commons category|Mansions}}\n* [http://www.colonial-estates.pvoss.de Historic Mansions and Estates in Latin America]\n* [http://www.mois.ee/english/ Estonian Manors Portal] the English version introduces 438 well-preserved historical manors (mansions, estates) in Estonia\n\n[[Category:House types]]\n[[Category:Luxury real estate]]\n\n[[he:\u05d0\u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d4]]\n[[mk:\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u045c\u0430]]\n[[sl:Dvor]]\n[[sv:Herrg\u00e5rd]]\n", "name_user": "31.200.48.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansion"}

In Britain, the tank was called by two names based on the turret configuration and crew size. Tanks employing US pattern [[Gun turret|turrets]] were called the \"'''Lee'''\", named after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]]. Variants using British pattern turrets were known as \"'''Grant'''\", named after [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] general [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\nDesign commenced in July 1940, and the first M3s were operational in late 1941.<ref>Zaloga p. 16 & 20</ref> The U.S. Army needed a medium tank armed with a 75mm gun and, coupled with the United Kingdom's immediate demand for 3,650 medium tanks,<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 20 & 21</ref> the Lee began production by late 1940. The design was a compromise meant to produce a tank as soon as possible. The M3 had considerable firepower and good armor, but had serious drawbacks in its general design and shape, including a high silhouette, an archaic [[sponson]] mounting of the main gun preventing the tank from taking a [[hull-down]] position, riveted construction, and poor off-road performance.\n\nIts overall performance was not satisfactory and the tank was withdrawn from combat in most theaters as soon as the [[M4 Sherman]] tank became available in larger numbers. In spite of this, it was considered by [[Hans von Luck]] (an ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Wehrmacht Heer'']] and the author of ''Panzer Commander'') to be superior to the best German tank at the time of its introduction, the [[Panzer IV]] (at least until the F2 variant).<ref>{{cite book|last1=von Luck|first1=Hans |authorlink=Hans von Luck|title=Panzer Commander: The Memoirs of Colonel Hans von Luck|date=2013|publisher=Dell|page=Paragraph 6.75}}</ref>\n\nDespite being replaced elsewhere, the British continued to use M3s in combat against the Japanese in [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|southeast Asia]] until 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205205489 |title=The British Army in Burma 1945 |publisher=Imperial War Museum}}</ref> Nearly a thousand M3s were supplied to the Soviet military under Lend-Lease between 1941\u20131943.\n\n==Development==\nIn {{year|1939}}, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] possessed approximately 400 tanks, mostly [[M2 Light Tank]]s, with 18 of the to-be-discontinued [[M2 Medium Tank]]s as the only ones considered \"modern\".<ref>Hunnicutt p. 44</ref> The U.S. funded tank development poorly during the interwar years, and had little experience in design as well as poor doctrine to guide design efforts.\n\n[[File:M3 tank riveting LOC fsa 8e10699.jpg|thumb|left|M3 Lee being manufactured.]]\n\nThe [[M2 Medium Tank]] was typical of [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFVs) many nations produced in 1939. When the U.S. entered the war, the M2 design was already obsolete with a [[37 mm Gun M3|37 mm gun]], an impractical number of secondary machine guns, a very high silhouette, and 32&nbsp;mm frontal armor. The [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]]'s success in the [[Battle of France|French campaign]] led the U.S. Army to immediately order a new medium tank armed with a [[75 mm gun (US)|75&nbsp;mm gun]] in a turret as a response. This would be the M4 Sherman. Until the Sherman reached production, an interim design with a 75&nbsp;mm gun was urgently needed.\n\nThe M3 was the solution. The design was unusual because the main weapon \u2013 a larger caliber, medium-velocity 75&nbsp;mm gun \u2013 was in an offset [[sponson]] mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was necessary because, at the time, American tank plants did not have the design experience necessary to make a gun turret capable of holding a 75&nbsp;mm weapon. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37&nbsp;mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a [[machine gun]]. The use of two main guns was seen on the French [[Char B1]] and the Mark I version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Churchill tank]]. In each case, two weapons were mounted to give the tanks adequate capability in firing both anti-personnel [[High-explosive shell|high explosive]] and [[Canister shot|canister]] ammunition and [[Armor-piercing shell|armor-piercing]] ammunition for anti-tank combat. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern, having a main gun that could fire an armor-piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for effectively piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank featuring a turreted gun. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but Britain<ref>Zaloga, ''Armored Thunderbolt'', p. 21</ref> urgently needed tanks. A drawback of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a [[hull-down]] position and use its 75&nbsp;mm gun at the same time. The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret basket to the gearbox driving the front sprockets. Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of {{convert|37|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The vertical volute-sprung suspension (VVSS) units possessed a return roller mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system in the form of an electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system.\n\n[[File:M3-lee-camp-polk.jpg|thumb|left|Front view of an M3.]]\n\nThe 75&nbsp;mm gun was operated by a gunner and a loader; sighting the gun used an M1 periscope \u2013 with an integral telescope \u2013 on the top of the sponson. The periscope rotated with the gun. The sight was marked from zero to {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}},{{efn|later 3,500 yards}} with vertical markings to aid deflection shooting at a moving target. The gunner laid the gun on target through geared handwheels for traverse and elevation. The shorter barreled 75&nbsp;mm M2 cannon sometimes featured a counterweight at the end of the barrel to balance the gun for operation with the gyrostabilizer until the longer 75&nbsp;mm M3 variant was brought into use.<ref>[http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m3lee.html \"Medium Tank M3 Lee\"]</ref>\n\nThe 37&nbsp;mm gun was aimed through the M2 periscope, mounted in the mantlet to the side of the gun. It also sighted the coaxial machine gun. Two range scales were provided: 0\u2013{{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} for the 37&nbsp;mm and 0\u2013{{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} for the machine gun. The 37&nbsp;mm gun also featured a counterweight \u2013 a long rod under the barrel \u2013 though it was ill maintained by crews who knew little about its use.\n\n[[File:M-3Grants-E 014053.2.jpg|thumb|British M3 Grant (left) and Lee (right) at [[El Alamein]] ([[Egypt]]), in the [[Sahara Desert]], 1942, showing differences between the British turret and the original design.]]\nThere were also two .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine guns mounted in the hull, fixed in traverse but adjustable in elevation, which were controlled by the driver. These were, due to coordination issues, removed, though they would be seen on early Sherman tanks.<ref name=\"Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Outside\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7eJr0grTc Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: M3 Grant. Part 1</ref>\n\nThough not at war, the U.S. was willing to produce, sell and ship armored vehicles to Britain. The British had requested that their [[Matilda II]] infantry tank and [[Crusader tank|Crusader]] cruiser tank designs be made by American factories, but this request was refused. With much of their equipment [[Dunkirk evacuation|left on the beaches near Dunkirk]], the equipment needs of the British were acute. Though not entirely satisfied with the design, they ordered the M3 in large numbers. British experts had viewed the mock-up in 1940 and identified features that they considered flaws \u2013 the high profile, the hull mounted main gun, the lack of a radio in the turret (though the tank did have a radio down in the hull), the riveted armor plating (whose rivets tended [[Spall|to pop off inside the interior in a deadly ricochet]] when the tank was hit by a non-penetrating round), the smooth track design, insufficient armor plating and lack of splash-proofing of the joints.{{sfn|Fletcher, Great Tank Scandal|page= 90 }}\n\nThe British desired modifications for the tank they were purchasing. A [[bustle rack]] was to be made at the back of the turret to house the [[Wireless Set No. 19]]. The turret was to be given thicker armor plate than in the original U.S. design, and the machine gun cupola was to be replaced with a simple hatch. Extended space within the turret of the new M3 also allowed the use of a smoke bomb launcher, although the addition of the radio would take the space for storage of fifty 37&nbsp;mm rounds, reducing the ammunition capacity to 128 rounds. Several of these new \"Grant\" tanks would also be equipped with sand shields for action in North Africa, though they often fell off.<ref name=\"Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Outside\"/><ref name=\"Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Inside\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu8NwLls7PY&t=1048s Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: M3 Grant. Part 2</ref> With these modifications accepted, the British ordered 1,250 M3s. The order was subsequently increased with the expectation that when the M4 Sherman was available, it could replace part of the order. Contracts were arranged with three U.S. companies. The total cost of the order was approximately US$240 million, the sum of all British funds in the US; it took the [[Lend-Lease|US Lend-Lease act]] to solve the financial shortfall.\n\nThe prototype was completed in March 1941 and production models followed, with the first British-specification tanks produced in July. Both U.S. and British tanks had thicker armor than first planned.{{sfn|Fletcher, Great Tank Scandal|page= 93 }} The British design required one fewer crew member than the US version due to the radio in the turret. The U.S. eventually eliminated the full-time radio operator, assigning the task to the driver. After extensive losses in Africa and Greece, the British realized that to meet their needs for tanks, both the Lee and the Grant types would need to be accepted.\n\nThe U.S. military used the \"M\" (Model) letter to designate nearly all of their equipment. When the British Army received their new M3 medium tanks from the US, confusion immediately set in<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 18</ref> between the different M3 medium tank and M3 light tank. The British Army began naming their American tanks after American military figures, although the U.S. Army never used those terms until after the war.<ref name=\"stout1946_136\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou |title=\"Tanks are Mighty Fine Things\" |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou/page/n149 136] |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref><ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 19</ref> M3 tanks with the cast turret and radio setup received the name \"General Grant\", while the original M3s were called \"General Lee\", or more usually just \"Grant\" and \"Lee\".{{r|stout1946_136}}<ref>Bishop (The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II) p. 34</ref>\n\nThe chassis and running gear of the M3 design was adapted by the Canadians for their [[Ram tank]]. The hull of the M3 was also used for self-propelled [[artillery]] as with the original design of the [[M7 Priest]], of which nearly 3,500 were built, and recovery vehicles.\n\n==Operational history==\nOf the 6,258 M3 variants manufactured in the United States, 2,855 (45%) were officially handed over to the British government.\n\nThe M3 Grant first saw action with the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa, during May 1942.

They soon discovered the M3 could engage them beyond the effective range of their [[5&nbsp;cm Pak 38]] anti-tank gun, and the [[5&nbsp;cm KwK 39]] of the [[Panzer III]], their main medium tank. The M3 was also vastly superior to the [[Fiat M13/40]] and [[Fiat M14/41|M14/41]] tanks employed by the Italian troops, whose [[Cannone da 47/32 M35|47&nbsp;mm gun]] was effective only at point-blank range, while only the few [[Semovente 75/18|Semoventi da 75/18]] self-propelled guns were able to destroy it using [[HEAT]] rounds.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cappellano|first1=F.|last2=Battistelli|first2=P.P|title=Italian medium tanks: 1939-45|date=2012|publisher=Osprey Publ.|location=Oxford|isbn=9781849087759|pages=34\u201338}}</ref> In addition to the M3's 75&nbsp;mm gun outranging the Panzers, they were equipped with high explosive shells to take out infantry and other soft targets, which previous British tanks lacked; upon the introduction of the M3, Rommel noted:\n\n{{quote|Up to May of 1942, our tanks had in general been superior in quality to the corresponding British types. This was now no longer true, at least not to the same extent.}}\n\nDespite the M3's advantages and surprise appearance during the Battle of Gazala, it could not win the battle for the British. In particular, the high-velocity [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88&nbsp;mm Flak]] gun, adapted as an anti-tank gun, proved deadly if British tanks attacked without artillery support.<ref>[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-m-3-grant-americas-nazi-germany-tank-killer-19126 The M-3 Grant: America's Nazi Germany Tank-Killer] - Nationalinterest.org, 22 January 2017</ref> Britain's Director of Armored Fighting Vehicles nonetheless said before the M4 Sherman arrived that<ref name=\"stout1946_137_138\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou |title=\"Tanks are Mighty Fine Things\" |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou/page/n150 137]\u2013138 |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The Grants and the Lees have proven to be the mainstay of the fighting forces in the Middle East; their great reliability, powerful armament and sound armor have endeared them to the troops.}}\n\nGrants and Lees served with British units in North Africa until the end of the campaign. Following [[Operation Torch]] (the invasion of French North Africa), the U.S. also fought in North Africa using the M3 Lee.\n\nThe US [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] had been issued new M4 Shermans, but had to give up one regiment's worth to the British Army prior to the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Consequently, a regiment of the division was still using the M3 Lee in North Africa.\n\nThe M3 was generally appreciated during the North African campaign for its mechanical reliability, good armor protection, and heavy firepower.{{efn|Initially there were problems with engine wear and suspension springs.{{sfn|Fletcher, Great Tank Scandal|page= 92 }}}} In all three aspects, the M3 was capable of engaging [[Panzer|German tanks]] and towed [[anti-tank]] guns.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHowever, the high silhouette and low, hull-mounted 75&nbsp;mm were tactical drawbacks since they prevented fighting from a [[hull-down]] firing position. In addition, the use of riveted hull superstructure armor on the early versions led to [[Spall#Antitank warfare|spalling]], where the impact of enemy shells caused the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank. Later models were built with all-welded armor to eliminate this problem. These lessons had already been applied to the design and production of the M4.\n\nThe M3 was replaced in front-line roles by the [[M4 Sherman]] as soon as the M4 was available. However, several specialist vehicles based on the M3 were later employed in Europe, such as the M31 [[armoured recovery vehicle|armored recovery vehicle]] and the [[Canal Defence Light]].\n\n===Eastern Europe- Soviet Service===\n[[File:Soviet M3 Lee tanks of the 6th Guards Army Kursk July 1943.jpg|thumb|A company of M3 Lees of the Soviet [[6th Guards Army]] advanced towards the front line during the [[Battle of Kursk]], July 1943]]\nBeginning from 1941, 1,386 M3 medium tanks were shipped from the USA to the Soviet Union, with 417 lost during shipping (when they went down with their transporting vessels which were lost to German submarine, naval and aerial attacks en route).<ref name=\"ww2-weapons.com\"/><ref>{{citation |script-title=ru:\u0411\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041c. \u041f. \u00ab\u0422\u0440\u0451\u0445\u044d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439\u00bb \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a M3 \u00ab\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b \u041b\u0438\u00bb / \u00ab\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u00bb. \u2014 \u041c.: \u042f\u0443\u0437\u0430, \u042d\u043a\u0441\u043c\u043e, 2011. \u2014 104 \u0441. \u2014 (\u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f). \u2014 1700 \u044d\u043a\u0437. \u2014 |isbn=978-5-699-49808-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lufOAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=ru#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=Russian}}</ref> These were supplied through the American [[Lend-Lease]] program between 1942 and 1943.\n\nLike British Commonwealth units, Soviet Red Army personnel tended to refer to the M3 as the \"Grant\", even though all of the M3s shipped to Russia were technically of the \"Lee\" variants.

It had no dedicated armoured branch and most of its very limited capabilities in tank warfare had been deployed to the North African Campaign (i.e. three divisional cavalry battalions). By early 1941, the effectiveness of large-scale German panzer attacks had been recognised, and a dedicated armoured mustering was formed. The [[Australian Armoured Corps]] initially included the cadres of three armoured divisions \u2013 all of which were equipped at least partly with M3 Grants made available from surplus British orders.\n\nThe [[1st Australian Armoured Division]] was formed with a view towards complementing the three Australian infantry divisions then in North Africa. However, following the outbreak of hostilities with Japan,<ref name=\"Lambert\">Zach Lambert, 2012, [https://www.army.gov.au/sites/g/files/net1846/f/aaj_2012_1.pdf \"The Birth, Life and Death of the 1st Australian Armoured Division\"], ''Australian Army Journal'' vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 96\u201397.</ref> the division was retained in Australia.

These divisions were also partly equipped with M3 Grants.<ref name=\"Hopkins\">Ronald Hopkins, 1978, ''Australian Armour: A History of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps 1927\u20131972'', Puckapunyal, Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum, pp. 125\u2013130, 326.</ref>\n\nIn January 1943, the main body of the 1st Armoured Division was deployed to home defence duties between [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Geraldton, Western Australia]], where it formed part of [[III Corps (Australia)|III Corps]].<ref name=\"Lambert\"/>\n\nBy the middle of the war, the Australian Army had deemed the Grant to be unsuitable for combat duties overseas and M3 units were re-equipped with the [[Matilda II]] before being deployed to the [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Borneo Campaign]]s. Due to personnel shortages, all three divisions were officially disbanded during 1943 and downgraded to brigade- and battalion-level units.<ref name=\"Hopkins\"/>\n\n====Post-war use in Australia====\nDuring the war, the Australian Army had converted some M3 Grants for special purposes, including a small number of bulldozer variants, [[beach armoured recovery vehicle]]s and [[Amphibious vehicle#Tracked|wader]] prototypes.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, 14 of the Australian Grants were converted to a local [[self-propelled gun]] design, the [[Yeramba]], becoming the only SPG ever deployed by the Australian Army. Fitted with a [[25-pounder]] field gun, the Yerambas remained in service with the 22nd Field Regiment, [[Royal Australian Artillery]], until the late 1950s.\n\nMany M3s deemed surplus to Australian Army requirements were acquired by civilian buyers during the 1950s and 1960s for conversion to earthmoving equipment and/or tractors.\n\n===Conclusion===\n{{no footnotes|section|date=April 2015}}\nOverall, the M3 was able to be effective on the battlefield from 1942 until 1943. However, US armored units lacked tactical expertise on a method to overcome its design.<ref>Porter (Allied Tanks of World War II 1339-1945 The World's Greatest Weapons) p. 77</ref> Its armor and firepower were equal or superior to most of the threats it faced, especially in the Pacific. Long-range, high-velocity guns were not yet common on German tanks in the African theater. However, the rapid pace of tank development meant that the M3 was very quickly outclassed.

In Britain, the tank was called by two names based on the turret configuration and crew size. Tanks employing US pattern [[Gun turret|turrets]] were called the \"'''Lee'''\", named after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] general [[Robert E. Lee]]. Variants using British pattern turrets were known as \"'''Grant'''\", named after [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] general [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\nDesign commenced in July 1940, and the first M3s were operational in late 1941.<ref>Zaloga p. 16 & 20</ref> The U.S. Army needed a medium tank armed with a 75mm gun and, coupled with the United Kingdom's immediate demand for 3,650 medium tanks,<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 20 & 21</ref> the Lee began production by late 1940. The design was a compromise meant to produce a tank as soon as possible. The M3 had considerable firepower and good armor, but had serious drawbacks in its general design and shape, including a high silhouette, an archaic [[sponson]] mounting of the main gun preventing the tank from taking a [[hull-down]] position, riveted construction, and poor off-road performance.\n\nIts overall performance was not satisfactory and the tank was withdrawn from combat in most theaters as soon as the [[M4 Sherman]] tank became available in larger numbers. In spite of this, it was considered by [[Hans von Luck]] (an ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|''Wehrmacht Heer'']] and the author of ''Panzer Commander'') to be superior to the best German tank at the time of its introduction, the [[Panzer IV]] (at least until the F2 variant).<ref>{{cite book|last1=von Luck|first1=Hans |authorlink=Hans von Luck|title=Panzer Commander: The Memoirs of Colonel Hans von Luck|date=2013|publisher=Dell|page=Paragraph 6.75}}</ref>\n\nDespite being replaced elsewhere, the British continued to use M3s in combat against the Japanese in [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|southeast Asia]] until 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205205489 |title=The British Army in Burma 1945 |publisher=Imperial War Museum}}</ref> Nearly a thousand M3s were supplied to the Soviet military under Lend-Lease between 1941\u20131943.\n\n==Development==\nIn {{year|1939}}, the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] possessed approximately 400 tanks, mostly [[M2 Light Tank]]s, with 18 of the to-be-discontinued [[M2 Medium Tank]]s as the only ones considered \"modern\".<ref>Hunnicutt p. 44</ref> The U.S. funded tank development poorly during the interwar years, and had little experience in design as well as poor doctrine to guide design efforts.\n\n[[File:M3 tank riveting LOC fsa 8e10699.jpg|thumb|left|M3 Lee being manufactured.]]\n\nThe [[M2 Medium Tank]] was typical of [[armored fighting vehicle]]s (AFVs) many nations produced in 1939. When the U.S. entered the war, the M2 design was already obsolete with a [[37 mm Gun M3|37 mm gun]], an impractical number of secondary machine guns, a very high silhouette, and 32&nbsp;mm frontal armor. The [[Panzer III]] and [[Panzer IV]]'s success in the [[Battle of France|French campaign]] led the U.S. Army to immediately order a new medium tank armed with a [[75 mm gun (US)|75&nbsp;mm gun]] in a turret as a response. This would be the M4 Sherman. Until the Sherman reached production, an interim design with a 75&nbsp;mm gun was urgently needed.\n\nThe M3 was the solution. The design was unusual because the main weapon \u2013 a larger caliber, medium-velocity 75&nbsp;mm gun \u2013 was in an offset [[sponson]] mounted in the hull with limited traverse. The sponson mount was necessary because, at the time, American tank plants did not have the design experience necessary to make a gun turret capable of holding a 75&nbsp;mm weapon. A small turret with a lighter, high-velocity 37&nbsp;mm gun sat on top of the tall hull. A small cupola on top of the turret held a [[machine gun]]. The use of two main guns was seen on the French [[Char B1]] and the Mark I version of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Churchill tank]]. In each case, two weapons were mounted to give the tanks adequate capability in firing both anti-personnel [[High-explosive shell|high explosive]] and [[Canister shot|canister]] ammunition and [[Armor-piercing shell|armor-piercing]] ammunition for anti-tank combat. The M3 differed slightly from this pattern, having a main gun that could fire an armor-piercing projectile at a velocity high enough for effectively piercing armor, as well as deliver a high-explosive shell that was large enough to be effective. Using a hull mounted gun, the M3 design could be produced faster than a tank featuring a turreted gun. It was understood that the M3 design was flawed, but Britain<ref>Zaloga, ''Armored Thunderbolt'', p. 21</ref> urgently needed tanks. A drawback of the sponson mount was that the M3 could not take a [[hull-down]] position and use its 75&nbsp;mm gun at the same time. The M3 was tall and roomy: the power transmission ran through the crew compartment under the turret basket to the gearbox driving the front sprockets. Steering was by differential braking, with a turning circle of {{convert|37|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The vertical volute-sprung suspension (VVSS) units possessed a return roller mounted directly atop the main housing of each of the six suspension units (three per side), designed as self-contained and readily replaced modular units bolted to the hull sides. The turret was power-traversed by an electro-hydraulic system in the form of an electric motor providing the pressure for the hydraulic motor. This fully rotated the turret in 15 seconds. Control was from a spade grip on the gun. The same motor provided pressure for the gun stabilizing system.\n\n[[File:M3-lee-camp-polk.jpg|thumb|left|Front view of an M3.]]\n\nThe 75&nbsp;mm gun was operated by a gunner and a loader; sighting the gun used an M1 periscope \u2013 with an integral telescope \u2013 on the top of the sponson. The periscope rotated with the gun. The sight was marked from zero to {{convert|3000|yd|m|abbr=on}},{{efn|later 3,500 yards}} with vertical markings to aid deflection shooting at a moving target. The gunner laid the gun on target through geared handwheels for traverse and elevation. The shorter barreled 75&nbsp;mm M2 cannon sometimes featured a counterweight at the end of the barrel to balance the gun for operation with the gyrostabilizer until the longer 75&nbsp;mm M3 variant was brought into use.<ref>[http://afvdb.50megs.com/usa/m3lee.html \"Medium Tank M3 Lee\"]</ref>\n\nThe 37&nbsp;mm gun was aimed through the M2 periscope, mounted in the mantlet to the side of the gun. It also sighted the coaxial machine gun. Two range scales were provided: 0\u2013{{convert|1500|yd|m|abbr=on}} for the 37&nbsp;mm and 0\u2013{{convert|1000|yd|m|abbr=on}} for the machine gun. The 37&nbsp;mm gun also featured a counterweight \u2013 a long rod under the barrel \u2013 though it was ill maintained by crews who knew little about its use.\n\n[[File:M-3Grants-E 014053.2.jpg|thumb|British M3 Grant (left) and Lee (right) at [[El Alamein]] ([[Egypt]]), in the [[Sahara Desert]], 1942, showing differences between the British turret and the original design.]]\nThere were also two .30-06 Browning M1919A4 machine guns mounted in the hull, fixed in traverse but adjustable in elevation, which were controlled by the driver. These were, due to coordination issues, removed, though they would be seen on early Sherman tanks.<ref name=\"Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Outside\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p7eJr0grTc Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: M3 Grant. Part 1</ref>\n\nThough not at war, the U.S. was willing to produce, sell and ship armored vehicles to Britain. The British had requested that their [[Matilda II]] infantry tank and [[Crusader tank|Crusader]] cruiser tank designs be made by American factories, but this request was refused. With much of their equipment [[Dunkirk evacuation|left on the beaches near Dunkirk]], the equipment needs of the British were acute. Though not entirely satisfied with the design, they ordered the M3 in large numbers. British experts had viewed the mock-up in 1940 and identified features that they considered flaws \u2013 the high profile, the hull mounted main gun, the lack of a radio in the turret (though the tank did have a radio down in the hull), the riveted armor plating (whose rivets tended [[Spall|to pop off inside the interior in a deadly ricochet]] when the tank was hit by a non-penetrating round), the smooth track design, insufficient armor plating and lack of splash-proofing of the joints.{{sfn|Fletcher, Great Tank Scandal|page= 90 }}\n\nThe British desired modifications for the tank they were purchasing. A [[bustle rack]] was to be made at the back of the turret to house the [[Wireless Set No. 19]]. The turret was to be given thicker armor plate than in the original U.S. design, and the machine gun cupola was to be replaced with a simple hatch. Extended space within the turret of the new M3 also allowed the use of a smoke bomb launcher, although the addition of the radio would take the space for storage of fifty 37&nbsp;mm rounds, reducing the ammunition capacity to 128 rounds. Several of these new \"Grant\" tanks would also be equipped with sand shields for action in North Africa, though they often fell off.<ref name=\"Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Outside\"/><ref name=\"Chieftain/Nicholas Moran Grant Inside\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu8NwLls7PY&t=1048s Inside the Chieftain's Hatch: M3 Grant. Part 2</ref> With these modifications accepted, the British ordered 1,250 M3s. The order was subsequently increased with the expectation that when the M4 Sherman was available, it could replace part of the order. Contracts were arranged with three U.S. companies. The total cost of the order was approximately US$240 million, the sum of all British funds in the US; it took the [[Lend-Lease|US Lend-Lease act]] to solve the financial shortfall.\n\nThe prototype was completed in March 1941 and production models followed, with the first British-specification tanks produced in July. Both U.S. and British tanks had thicker armor than first planned.{{sfn|Fletcher, Great Tank Scandal|page= 93 }} The British design required one fewer crew member than the US version due to the radio in the turret. The U.S. eventually eliminated the full-time radio operator, assigning the task to the driver. After extensive losses in Africa and Greece, the British realized that to meet their needs for tanks, both the Lee and the Grant types would need to be accepted.\n\nThe U.S. military used the \"M\" (Model) letter to designate nearly all of their equipment. When the British Army received their new M3 medium tanks from the US, confusion immediately set in<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 18</ref> between the different M3 medium tank and M3 light tank. The British Army began naming their American tanks after American military figures, although the U.S. Army never used those terms until after the war.<ref name=\"stout1946_136\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou |title=\"Tanks are Mighty Fine Things\" |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946 |page=[https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou/page/n149 136] |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref><ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 19</ref> M3 tanks with the cast turret and radio setup received the name \"General Grant\", while the original M3s were called \"General Lee\", or more usually just \"Grant\" and \"Lee\".{{r|stout1946_136}}<ref>Bishop (The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II) p. 34</ref>\n\nThe chassis and running gear of the M3 design was adapted by the Canadians for their [[Ram tank]]. The hull of the M3 was also used for self-propelled [[artillery]] as with the original design of the [[M7 Priest]], of which nearly 3,500 were built, and recovery vehicles.\n\n==Operational history==\nOf the 6,258 M3 variants manufactured in the United States, 2,855 (45%) were officially handed over to the British government. \n\nThe M3 Grant first saw action with the Royal Armoured Corps in North Africa, during May 1942.

Their appearance was a surprise to the Germans, who were unprepared for the M3's 75&nbsp;mm gun. They soon discovered the M3 could engage them beyond the effective range of their [[5&nbsp;cm Pak 38]] anti-tank gun, and the [[5&nbsp;cm KwK 39]] of the [[Panzer III]], their main medium tank. The M3 was also vastly superior to the [[Fiat M13/40]] and [[Fiat M14/41|M14/41]] tanks employed by the Italian troops, whose [[Cannone da 47/32 M35|47&nbsp;mm gun]] was effective only at point-blank range, while only the few [[Semovente 75/18|Semoventi da 75/18]] self-propelled guns were able to destroy it using [[HEAT]] rounds.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cappellano|first1=F.|last2=Battistelli|first2=P.P|title=Italian medium tanks: 1939-45|date=2012|publisher=Osprey Publ.|location=Oxford|isbn=9781849087759|pages=34\u201338}}</ref> In addition to the M3's 75&nbsp;mm gun outranging the Panzers, they were equipped with high explosive shells to take out infantry and other soft targets, which previous British tanks lacked; upon the introduction of the M3, Rommel noted:\n\n{{quote|Up to May of 1942, our tanks had in general been superior in quality to the corresponding British types. This was now no longer true, at least not to the same extent.}}\n\nDespite the M3's advantages and surprise appearance during the Battle of Gazala, it could not win the battle for the British. In particular, the high-velocity [[8.8 cm Flak 18/36/37/41|88&nbsp;mm Flak]] gun, adapted as an anti-tank gun, proved deadly if British tanks attacked without artillery support.<ref>[http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/the-m-3-grant-americas-nazi-germany-tank-killer-19126 The M-3 Grant: America's Nazi Germany Tank-Killer] - Nationalinterest.org, 22 January 2017</ref> Britain's Director of Armored Fighting Vehicles nonetheless said before the M4 Sherman arrived that<ref name=\"stout1946_137_138\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou |title=\"Tanks are Mighty Fine Things\" |last=Stout |first=Wesley W. |publisher=Chrysler Corporation |year=1946 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/tanmightyfi00stou/page/n150 137]\u2013138 |access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The Grants and the Lees have proven to be the mainstay of the fighting forces in the Middle East; their great reliability, powerful armament and sound armor have endeared them to the troops.}}\n\nGrants and Lees served with British units in North Africa until the end of the campaign. Following [[Operation Torch]] (the invasion of French North Africa), the U.S. also fought in North Africa using the M3 Lee.\n\nThe US [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]] had been issued new M4 Shermans, but had to give up one regiment's worth to the British Army prior to the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. Consequently, a regiment of the division was still using the M3 Lee in North Africa.\n\nThe M3 was generally appreciated during the North African campaign for its mechanical reliability, good armor protection, and heavy firepower.{{efn|Initially there were problems with engine wear and suspension springs.{{sfn|Fletcher, Great Tank Scandal|page= 92 }}}} In all three aspects, the M3 was capable of engaging [[Panzer|German tanks]] and towed [[anti-tank]] guns.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nHowever, the high silhouette and low, hull-mounted 75&nbsp;mm were tactical drawbacks since they prevented fighting from a [[hull-down]] firing position. In addition, the use of riveted hull superstructure armor on the early versions led to [[Spall#Antitank warfare|spalling]], where the impact of enemy shells caused the rivets to break off and become projectiles inside the tank. Later models were built with all-welded armor to eliminate this problem. These lessons had already been applied to the design and production of the M4.\n\nThe M3 was replaced in front-line roles by the [[M4 Sherman]] as soon as the M4 was available. However, several specialist vehicles based on the M3 were later employed in Europe, such as the M31 [[armoured recovery vehicle|armored recovery vehicle]] and the [[Canal Defence Light]].\n\n===Eastern Europe- Soviet Service===\n[[File:Soviet M3 Lee tanks of the 6th Guards Army Kursk July 1943.jpg|thumb|A company of M3 Lees of the Soviet [[6th Guards Army]] advanced towards the front line during the [[Battle of Kursk]], July 1943]]\nBeginning from 1941, 1,386 M3 medium tanks were shipped from the USA to the Soviet Union, with 417 lost during shipping (when they went down with their transporting vessels which were lost to German submarine, naval and aerial attacks en route).<ref name=\"ww2-weapons.com\"/><ref>{{citation |script-title=ru:\u0411\u0430\u0440\u044f\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041c. \u041f. \u00ab\u0422\u0440\u0451\u0445\u044d\u0442\u0430\u0436\u043d\u044b\u0439\u00bb \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0446 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d\u0430. \u0422\u0430\u043d\u043a M3 \u00ab\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b \u041b\u0438\u00bb / \u00ab\u0413\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b \u0413\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u00bb. \u2014 \u041c.: \u042f\u0443\u0437\u0430, \u042d\u043a\u0441\u043c\u043e, 2011. \u2014 104 \u0441. \u2014 (\u0410\u0440\u0441\u0435\u043d\u0430\u043b \u043a\u043e\u043b\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0446\u0438\u044f). \u2014 1700 \u044d\u043a\u0437. \u2014 |isbn=978-5-699-49808-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lufOAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=ru#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=Russian}}</ref> These were supplied through the American [[Lend-Lease]] program between 1942 and 1943.\n\nLike British Commonwealth units, Soviet Red Army personnel tended to refer to the M3 as the \"Grant\", even though all of the M3s shipped to Russia were technically of the \"Lee\" variants.

Soviet troops still fielded their Lee/Grant tanks on secondary and quieter/less-action fronts, such as in the Arctic region during the Red Army's [[Petsamo\u2013Kirkenes Offensive]] against German forces in Norway in October 1944, where the then-obsolete US tanks faced mainly captured French tanks used by the Germans, such as the [[SOMUA S35]], which to a limited extent was somewhat comparable to the Lee/Grant it fought against.\n\n===Pacific War===\nIn the [[Pacific War]], armored warfare played a relatively minor role for the Allies as well as for the Japanese, compared with that of naval,<ref>Zaloga (Japanese Tanks) back cover & p. 3</ref> air,<ref>Ewing p. VII</ref> and infantry units.\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean Theater]] and the [[Southwest Pacific Theater]], the U.S. Army deployed none of its dedicated armored divisions and only a third of its 70 other separate tank battalions.\n\nA small number of M3 Lees saw action in the central Pacific Ocean Theater in {{year|1943}}.\n\nWhile the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] deployed all six of its tank battalions,<ref>Zaloga (Armored Thunderbolt) p. 24 & 301</ref> none of these were equipped with the M3 Lee.

It played a pivotal role during the [[Battle of Imphal]], during which the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]'s 14th Tank Regiment (primarily equipped with their own [[Type 95 Ha-Go]] light tanks, together with a handful of captured British [[M3 Stuart]] light tanks as well) encountered M3 medium tanks for the first time and found their light tanks outgunned and outmatched by the better British armour.<ref>Zaloga (Japanese Tanks 1939-45) p. 40</ref> Despite their worse-than-average off-road performance, the British M3 tanks performed well as they traversed the steep hillsides around [[Imphal]] and defeated the assaulting Japanese forces. Officially declared obsolete in April 1944,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> nevertheless, the Lee/Grant saw action until the end of the war in September 1945.\n\n=== Australia ===\nAt the beginning of the war, Australian Army doctrine viewed tank units as minor offensive components within infantry divisions. It had no dedicated armoured branch and most of its very limited capabilities in tank warfare had been deployed to the North African Campaign (i.e. three divisional cavalry battalions). By early 1941, the effectiveness of large-scale German panzer attacks had been recognised, and a dedicated armoured mustering was formed. The [[Australian Armoured Corps]] initially included the cadres of three armoured divisions \u2013 all of which were equipped at least partly with M3 Grants made available from surplus British orders.\n\nThe [[1st Australian Armoured Division]] was formed with a view towards complementing the three Australian infantry divisions then in North Africa. However, following the outbreak of hostilities with Japan,<ref name=\"Lambert\">Zach Lambert, 2012, [https://www.army.gov.au/sites/g/files/net1846/f/aaj_2012_1.pdf \"The Birth, Life and Death of the 1st Australian Armoured Division\"], ''Australian Army Journal'' vol. 9, no. 1, pp. 96\u201397.</ref> the division was retained in Australia. During April\u2013May 1942, the 1st Armoured Division's regiments were reported to be re-equipping with M3 Grants and were training, in a series of large exercises, in the area around [[Narrabri, New South Wales]].<ref name=\"Lambert\"/>\n\nThe cadres of other two divisions, the [[2nd Armoured Division (Australia)|2nd]] and [[3rd Armoured Division (Australia)|3rd Armoured Division]]s were both officially formed in 1942, as [[Australian Army Reserve|Militia]] (reserve/home defence) units. These divisions were also partly equipped with M3 Grants.<ref name=\"Hopkins\">Ronald Hopkins, 1978, ''Australian Armour: A History of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps 1927\u20131972'', Puckapunyal, Royal Australian Armoured Corps Tank Museum, pp. 125\u2013130, 326.</ref>\n\nIn January 1943, the main body of the 1st Armoured Division was deployed to home defence duties between [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Geraldton, Western Australia]], where it formed part of [[III Corps (Australia)|III Corps]].<ref name=\"Lambert\"/>\n\nBy the middle of the war, the Australian Army had deemed the Grant to be unsuitable for combat duties overseas and M3 units were re-equipped with the [[Matilda II]] before being deployed to the [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]] and [[Borneo Campaign]]s. Due to personnel shortages, all three divisions were officially disbanded during 1943 and downgraded to brigade- and battalion-level units.<ref name=\"Hopkins\"/>\n\n====Post-war use in Australia====\nDuring the war, the Australian Army had converted some M3 Grants for special purposes, including a small number of bulldozer variants, [[beach armoured recovery vehicle]]s and [[Amphibious vehicle#Tracked|wader]] prototypes.\n\nFollowing the end of the war, 14 of the Australian Grants were converted to a local [[self-propelled gun]] design, the [[Yeramba]], becoming the only SPG ever deployed by the Australian Army. Fitted with a [[25-pounder]] field gun, the Yerambas remained in service with the 22nd Field Regiment, [[Royal Australian Artillery]], until the late 1950s.\n\nMany M3s deemed surplus to Australian Army requirements were acquired by civilian buyers during the 1950s and 1960s for conversion to earthmoving equipment and/or tractors.\n\n===Conclusion===\n{{no footnotes|section|date=April 2015}}\nOverall, the M3 was able to be effective on the battlefield from 1942 until 1943. However, US armored units lacked tactical expertise on a method to overcome its design.<ref>Porter (Allied Tanks of World War II 1339-1945 The World's Greatest Weapons) p. 77</ref> Its armor and firepower were equal or superior to most of the threats it faced, especially in the Pacific. Long-range, high-velocity guns were not yet common on German tanks in the African theater. However, the rapid pace of tank development meant that the M3 was very quickly outclassed. By mid-1942, with the introduction of the German [[Tiger I]], the up-gunning of the [[Panzer IV]] to [[7.5 cm KwK 40|a long 75&nbsp;mm gun]], and the first appearance in 1943 of the [[Panther tank|Panther]], along with the availability of large numbers of the [[M4 Sherman]], the M3 was withdrawn from service in the European Theater.\n\n==Variants==\n[[File:M3 and relatives.PNG|right|thumb|M3 and its contribution to other AFVs of the Second World War.]]\n[[File:M31-ARV-batey-haosef-2.jpg|right|thumb|M31 TRV showing dummy hull gun.]]\n[[File:M3-lee-chrysler-arsenal-2.jpg|right|thumb|Chrysler plant manufacturing the M3 Lee.]]\n''British designations in parentheses''\n\n===US variants===\n;M3 (Lee I/Grant I)\n:Riveted hull, high profile turret, gasoline engine. 4,724 built.\n;M3A1 (Lee II)\n:Cast (rounded) upper hull. 300 built.\n;M3A2 (Lee III)\n:Welded (sharp edged) hull.

Generally, it holds the boot firmly to allow the skier to maneuver the ski.  However, if certain force limits are exceeded, it releases the boot to minimize skier injury, such as in the case of a fall or impact.  There are different types of bindings for different types of [[skiing]].\n\n== Alpine ==\n[[Image:Alpine ski bindings 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alpine ski bindings: for inbounds resort skiing, alpine touring and for toolfree length adjustment (from top to bottom)]]\n[[Image:Skistopperopen.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Snow brake in open position]]\nModern [[alpine skiing]] bindings fix the boot at the toe and heel.\n\nIn some bindings, to reduce injury the boot can release in case of a fall. The boot is released by the binding if a certain amount of [[torque]] is applied, usually created by the weight of a falling skier. The torque required is adjustable, according to the weight, foot size, and skiing style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dinsetting.com |title=DIN Setting Calculator |publisher=DINSetting.com |accessdate=20 Dec 2013}}</ref> A snow brake prevents the ski from moving while it is not attached to a boot.\n\nAlso known as randonee, an [[alpine touring binding]] allows the heel to be clipped down to the ski when skiing downhill, but allows it to be released when climbing.<ref>{{cite web|title=ki Bindings - Components and Functions|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/whatareskibindings.asp|website=ABC of skiing|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Alpine touring===\nAn alpine touring binding allows the skier to have the heel of the ski boot free and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using Nordic skiing techniques for [[ski touring]], and to have both the heel and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using [[alpine skiing]] techniques to descend the mountain. Most touring bindings are designed for ski boots falling under one of two ISO specifications:  \n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38623 ISO 5355:2005], for traditional [[Ski boots#Alpine|alpine boots]]. In this variation the pivot is located in the front of the binding. \n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=45842 ISO 9523:2008], for boots in which the pivot is formed at the boot / binding interface. \nThe two setups are mutually incompatible: in the former, the boot lacks sockets to engage ISO 9523 compatible bindings, while the later boot toe and heel-piece dimensions are incompatible with ISO 5355 bindings.\n\n==Nordic==\n\n===Cable binding===\n{{main|Cable binding}}\nThe cable binding was widely used through the middle of the 20th century. It has the toe section of the boot anchored, and an adjustable cable around the heel secures the boot. While binding designs vary, before 2007 almost all dedicated Telemark models had been designed to fit boots with 75mm ''Nordic Norm'' \"duckbill\" toes.\n\n===Rottefella (NN, Nordic Norm) ===\n[[File:NN-type Rottefella binding.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Rottefella cross-country binding. The ski boot has small holes that fit over the pins seen on the bottom of the plate, keeping the boot from sliding rearward. The metal bar clamps the toe down onto the pins, and can be released by pressing down on the plastic clip with a ski pole.]]\nThe Rottefella binding was developed in 1927 by [[Bror With]]. The name means \"rat trap\" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. It is also known as the 75&nbsp;mm, Nordic Norm, or 3-pin. After victories at the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in [[St. Moritz]], the binding remained the standard for [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] for the next 60 years. They are no longer as popular as they were but are still for sale. The binding has three small pins that stick up from the binding. The toe of the boot has three holes into which the pins are inserted. The boot is then clamped down by a bail. The binding is asymmetrical, having left and right foot orientations. Prior to the Nordic Norm, cross-country ski bindings had as many as four pins.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KicPH9IN4rAC&pg=PA36&dq=four-pin+ski+binding&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz0dPbsNXZAhUEH6wKHc-yB88Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=four-pin%20ski%20binding&f=false|title=Skiing|last=Grout|first=William|date=October 1974|publisher=Ziff-Davis|year=|isbn=|volume=27|location=New York|pages=36|language=en|issn=0037-6264|number=2}}</ref>\n\n===NNN (New Nordic Norm) ===\n[[File:NNN-Binding.JPG|thumb|The NNN binding has two ridges extending backwards from the toe latch, matching corresponding channels in the boot]]\n[[Rottefella]]'s NNN (New Nordic Norm) has a bar in the toe of the boot hooked into a corresponding latch in the binding. There have been several versions of NNN, and the first NNN version is not compatible with current designs. A stronger, wider BC (Back Country) version also exists, abbreviated NNN{{nnbsp}}BC or NNN{{endash}}BC.\n\n=== NIS (Nordic Integrated System)===\nNIS (Nordic Integrated System), introduced in 2005 by [[Skis Rossignol|Rossignol]], [[Madshus]], [[Rottefella]], and [[Alpina \u017diri|Alpina]],<ref>Mike Muha, [http://www.nordicskiracer.com/Equipment/2005/NIS/NIS.asp \"Nordic Integrated System \"], Nordic Ski Racer, 26 January 2005</ref> is fully compatible with NNN boots and bindings, but is a different way of attaching the bindings to the ski.<ref name=rei>{{cite web|title=Cross-Country Ski Gear: How to Choose|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|publisher=REI|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> It features an integrated binding plate on the top of the ski to which the bindings attach, allowing adjustment in the field with a metallic NIS key. The initial design of the plate used a movable insert for position adjustment. NIS skis allow installation of non-NIS bindings. In 2007, [[Fischer Skis|Fischer]] abandoned SNS and entirely switched to NIS. \n\nRottefella Xcelerator bindings provide an increased power transfer from ski boots with a matching Xcelerator pattern sole. Xcelerator SSR bindings include QuickLock mechanism for tool-less position adjustment.\n\n===SNS (Salomon Nordic System) ===\n[[File:SNS Profil-Bindung.JPG|thumb|The SNS Profil binding has one large, central ridge, extending backwards from the toe latch, and one metal bar on the boot]]\n[[File:SNS Pilot-Binding.JPG|thumb|The SNS Pilot binding has same central ridge as the SNS Profil, but has two bars on the boot for better stabilization]]\nSNS ([[Salomon Group|Salomon]] Nordic System) looks very similar to NNN, except it has one large ridge and the bar is shorter. Three variants exist:\n* SNS Profil: One metal bar in the toe of the boot.\n* SNS Pilot: Two metal bars on the boot.\n* SNS X-Adventure: Stronger design used for back-country skiing (also referred to as SNS{{endash}}BC).\nPilot boots cannot be used with a Profil binding but Profil boots can be used with Pilot bindings.  The original Pilot boots had the front pin 10 mm from the front of the boot (RS10), while the newer Pilot boots have the front pin 17 mm from the front of the boot (RS17).  SNS is marketed by [[Amer Sports]] under their Salomon and [[Atomic Skis|Atomic]] brands.\n\nThe predecessor was simply called Salomon Nordic System (SNS): \n* SNS: \"U-shaped\" metal bar protruding from the front of the boot\n\n===Prolink (Salomon NNN-compatible system) ===\nThe Rotefella NNN system was adopted by Fischer and their various brands, making SNS decline in use in North America. In response to the need for NNN compatibility, in 2016 Salomon introduced the Prolink system, although Salomon claims that SNS will still be produced and available. The Prolink binding is somewhat lighter than NNN and mounts directly to the ski using pre-drilled holes, as opposed to a built-in ski-mounted NIS or IFP plate used by NNN. Salomon claims their new system delivers a superior \u201csnow feel\u201d as compared to NNN or even their own SNS system which pairs with thicker soled boots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fasterskier.com/fsarticle/salomon-to-join-nnn-club-slated-to-reveal-new-boots-and-bindings-option-on-jan-1/|title=Salomon to Join NNN Club, Slated to Reveal New Boots-and-Bindings Option on Jan. 1|last=Albert|first=Jason|date=December 31, 2015|website=Faster Skier|access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===NTN (New Telemark Norm)===\nIn 2007, Rottefella introduced the New Telemark Norm binding. The system's objective is to provide a free heel telemark ski binding featuring lateral release, increased lateral rigidity, tunable performance, and free-pivot touring functionality.  The boots are unlike other tele boots in that they do not have a 75&nbsp;mm square toe and require a lip underneath the arch of the boot for the binding to attach.  Scarpa sells a version of the boot which is compatible with NTN Tele and Dynafit bindings. Rottefella currently (2015) offers two models of the binding, the Freeride for the lift assisted skier and the Freedom for the tourer.  Both models feature a free pivot and one boot standard, NTN.  Different spring cartridges can be used to match the binding to the skier's weight and skiing style.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Telemark Norm (NTN)|url=http://www.newtelemarkguide.com/wiki/New_Telemark_Norm|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== IFP (Turnamic) ===\nIn 2016, Fischer and Rossignol introduced a new IFP (Integrated Fixation Plate) binding plate which allows tool-less adjustment of binding position. The Turnamic binding uses step-in locking for the boot, and the lock closes or opens by turning the lever to the side. \n\nThe IFP Turnamic bindings can be used with all NNN/Prolink boots, but the IFP plate will not accept NIS 1.0 bindings because of the new lock mechanism.<ref>https://skihaussteamboat.com/turnamic-xcelerator-prolink-nnn-what-a-nordic-guide-to-xc-boots-and-bindings/</ref>\n\nRottefella subsequently introduced continuously adjustable MOVE Switch bindings which can be installed in the IFP (and NIS) plates.<ref name=Rottefella-MOVE/>\n\n=== NIS 2.0 (MOVE)===\nIn 2018, Rottefella and [[Madshus]] announced the NIS 2.0 plate with the MOVE bindings which allow continuous on-the-fly adjustment of binding position with the boot locked-in. The NIS 2.0 plate and the MOVE Switch turnable wheel are designed to accept any existing NIS/NNN binding, using either fixed inserts or adjustable sliding inserts. MOVE Electric remote adjustment is being developed for 2019-2020 season.<ref>http://blog.ultratune.net/2018/01/skiing-201819-madshus-redline.html</ref> <ref name=Madshus-Redline-IGC>https://news.madshus.com/2017/10/11/optimizing-the-skin-ski/</ref> Rottefella also provides MOVE Switch conversion kits for NIS 1.0, IFP, and Prolink skis. <ref name=Rottefella-MOVE>https://www.bouldernordic.com/news/1084</ref>\n<ref name=MOVE-Switch>https://www.rottefella.com/move-system</ref>\n\nThe use of continuously adjustable bindings has been approved by the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]]; such adjustment allows the skier to fine-tune ski grip and glide, which is important for classic style racing on skis with waxless \"mohair\" grip-zones.<ref>https://news.madshus.com/2018/02/19/inside-the-factory-skin-skis-are-coming-to-the-world-cup/</ref><ref name=Madshus-Redline-IGC/> Previous Rottefella NNN bindings required the skier to dismount then apply significant force to a small metal NIS key to unlatch the binding.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old ski binding.jpg|thumb|Old ski binding]]\n[[File:Huitfeldt-bindingen.JPG|thumb|right|A late model Huitfeldt-style binding.

This added a loop of twisted birch roots that ran from the existing birch root toe loops around the boot heels and back. This allowed the heel to lift as before, for walking and gliding, but better held the boots to the skis allowing greater control. This enabled Norheim to control the skis with his feet and legs, replacing the former technique of dragging a large pole in the snow on one side or the other to drag the skier in that direction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lert|first=Wolfgang|title=A Binding Revolution|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=March 2002|pages=25\u201326|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wlgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> These new techniques spread throughout [[Telemark]] and would later be named for the region.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lund|first=Morten|title=Norway: How It All Started|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=September 2007|pages=8\u201313|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=SlgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n* 1894: [[Fritz R. Huitfeldt]] invented a binding with a secure toe iron which allowed the heel to move freely. This became the standard industry binding through the 1930s. Huitfeldt drove the evolution of the ski binding over the next 20 years. In 1894, he introduced the use of semi-circular metal hooks at the toe to attach the straps. The hooks were positioned to tightly fit to the sides of the boot, keeping the ski centred and eliminating any \"flop\" that the formerly loose straps allowed. The heel strap was also attached to the same hooks, but because of their rounded shape, the required range of motion was provided by the straps sliding up and down on the hooks. This allowed the heel strap to be replaced by a less flexible leather strap. Together, these changes dramatically tightened the binding, greatly increasing control.<ref name=lert25>Lert, pg. 25</ref>\n* 1897: Huitfeldt further improved the design by changing the toe piece. Instead of hooks, he drilled a rectangular hole through the ski from side to side, and passed an iron bar through it. The bar was then bent up on either side, locking it in place, and then formed to fit the toe of the boot. This improvement once again dramatically improved the firmness of the fit. Finally, in 1904 he adopted the Hoyer-Ellefsen toggle, a lever that replaced the buckles.<ref name=lert26>Lert, pg. 26</ref> This not only greatly improved mechanical advantage, further improving the strength of the binding, but also made the system much easier to put on and remove. Better yet, the geometry of the attachment points meant the heel strap was mechanically attached below that of the toe strap, which provided a constant \"diagonal downpull\" that naturally returned the heel to the ski.\n* 1920: Huitfeldt style bindings were by far the most popular system for decades, with the only major change being Marius Eriksen's 1920 introduction of pre-formed plates that were screwed on top of the ski.<ref name=lert26/> Other binding systems did exist, in particular a class of bindings originally introduced by [[Mathias Zdarsky]] that replaced the heel strap with a long metal plate under the sole of the boot, hinged at the front to allow the heel to rise. The heel was held to the plate by a short strap attaching at the back.<ref>John Allen,  [https://books.google.ca/books?id=VVgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12 \"Mathias Zdarsky: The Father of Alpine Skiing\"], ''Ski Heritage'', March 2008, pg. 12</ref> These gave even better control than the Huitfeldt design, but so firmly attached the leg that injury was a real problem.\n* 1927: Change eventually came through the evolution of the [[Rottefella]] binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This would only work if the sole was held very firmly down on the pins, so the binding also introduced a metal clip that was forced down onto the top of the sole of the boot, forcing it onto the pins. When the inventor, Bror With, won a race on the new design, Norwegian Crown Prince Olav asked him what they were, and he responded \"Oh, they're just a couple of rat traps I picked up at the hardware store\".<ref name=rot>[http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ \"About Us\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104003/http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ |date=2015-09-06 }}, Rottefella</ref> \"Rottefella\" is Norwegian for \"rat trap\".\n* 1929: The introduction of the cable binding allowed the [[Stem Christie|Christie turn]] to become a standard on downhill runs, and to further support this style of skiing the Swiss racer Guido Reuge in 1929 invented a cable binding with steel clips below the boot heel to enable clamping the heel down for downhill portions. He named the product \"Kandahar\" for the international Kandahar Cup ski races.<ref>{{cite book|last=Huntsford|first=Roland|title=Two Planks and a Passion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY7hYFesJe0C&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=kandahar+binding+reuge&source=bl&ots=sCTF3xB-G9&sig=dTKNZr6PTwawR9MOatm2NXj31sI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3PSbUtbzO8WdyQHIpYGgCA&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=kandahar%20binding%20reuge&f=false}}</ref> In use in alpine races, the Kandahar binding led to serious leg injuries, and by 1939 experimentation began in earnest on bindings that would release the boot in a fall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=Release! History of Safety Bindings|url=http://skiinghistory.org/history/release-history-safety-bindings|publisher=Skiing History magazine}}</ref>\n\n* 1932: a major advance on the Huitfeldt concept was introduced to the market by Guido Reuge in 1932. Reuge replaced the heel strap with a metal cable connected to a spring at the front of the toe. The spring provided even tension as the boot moved. Previously, the strap was adjusted so it had enough slack to allow the boot to rotate as high as the skier wished, but as the boot rotated back down to the ski it became increasingly slack again. The cable removed this limitation, and held the boot firmly through its entire motion, greatly increasing the solidity of the fit. A later advance added two small metal clips near the rear of the foot that the cable could be clipped under. These held the boot firmly to the ski during downhill portions of the runs. Cable bindings remained in use for some time for cross-country, and are today popular for telemark skiing. However, the [[Rottefella]] design from the 1930s became more popular for Nordic skiing through the 1950s and into the 1970s until the [[Salomon Nordic System]] (SNS) binding entirely re-invented bindings used for Nordic skiing.\n* 1937: [[Hjalmar Hvam]] broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding. This was a metal clip with a pyramidal top that fit into a slot cut into the sole of the ski boot. When the boot was rotated forward, the slot on the toe eventually rose above the metal pyramid, allowing the toe to release from the ski. The system was considered with suspicion by professional skiers, especially when Olaf Rodegaard released during a race. However, Rodegaard credits the release with saving him from a broken leg.<ref name=m27>Masia, pg. 27</ref> In the post-war era, Hvam sold several thousand pairs of Saf-Ski's, in an era when alpine skiing was in its infancy. Hvam continued to sell the Saf-Ski into the 1960s, but in 1966 his insurance rates increased so dramatically that he was forced from the market.<ref name=m30>Masia, pg. 30</ref>\n* 1950: A dramatic advance in alpine ski bindings was introduced as the [[Look Nevada]] in 1950. The Nevada held the toe centred over the ski using two metal fingers shaped into an upside-down V. The fingers were pivoted to allow motion to the sides, and centred with a spring. During a fall, sideways torsion could overcome the force of the spring and allow the boot to release directly to the side. This design was quickly copied by other vendors, notably [[Marker_(ski_bindings)|Marker]], and had the first real impact on the dominance of the fixed-toe bindings. By the late 1950s, there were about 35 different release toe bindings on the US market,<ref name=m29>Masia, pg. 29</ref> most of which used a normal Kandahar-style heel cable.\n* 1960: The first modern heel-and-toe binding for alpine skiing was the Cubco binding, first introduced in 1950 but not popular until about 1960. A heel-release binding faced the problem that there was no obvious place to attach to on the heel, so the Cubco solved this by screwing small metal clips into the sole of the boot. This also eliminated the changes in performance as the sole of the boot wore down, or the geometry of the sole changed as the boot wore into the skier's foot.<ref name=m29/> Marker introduced the Rotomat, which gripped onto the sole where it extended past the heel, and Look quickly followed suit with their Grand Prix design. By the mid-1960s, release bindings that worked on both the heel and the toe were common, and by the late 1960s, the cable binding had disappeared from alpine skiing.\n* 1966: The introduction of plastic ski boots permitted the development of industrial standards for the function of alpine skiing bindings. \n* 1972: Injury rates from alpine skiing began to fall with the gradual introduction of the Teflon anti-friction pad around 1972.\n* 1970s:\n**Alpine: One problem with 1960s release bindings was that the boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led to the introduction of plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the [[BURT Retractable Bindings]] and [[Spademan binding]], but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As more and more of the alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records.<ref>Seth Masia, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1gEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39 \"The Better Mousetrap\"], ''Ski Heritage'', March 2003, pg 39-41</ref> The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by [[Lange (ski boots)|Lange]] as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the sole piece was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings to clip on. Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry. Although plate bindings of the era had much better safety records, notably the Spademan design, the new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier.\n** Nordic: Problems with the geometry of the boot sole, which meant only certain boots would work, meant the Rottafella was not widely used. This problem was eventually solved through the same evolution of plastic components that changed the alpine skiing market. The use of highly flexible plastics allowed for a sole that was very strong torsionally and side-to-side, but still had excellent flexibility lengthwise, allowing the heel to rise as with a cable binding. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s.<ref name=rot/> A similar system with a 50&nbsp;mm \"duckbill\" once existed for lighter setups, but is obsolete and no longer available. Unlike the 75&nbsp;mm it was symmetric. It was the binding of choice for racing, before the adoption of skate ski racing, in the early 1970s. The 50&nbsp;mm was also designated according to the thickness of the \"duckbill\" having either 7&nbsp;mm or 11\u201313&nbsp;mm thick soles hence these bindings often had two notches in the bail to clamp boots with different sole thicknesses.\n*1980s:\n{{clear}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Ski bindings}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Skiing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ski Binding}}\n[[Category:Skiing equipment]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=April 2011}}\n[[Image:TouringBinding1.gif|thumb|right|250px|[[Alpine touring binding|Alpine touring]] ski boot, binding, and ski crampon]]\n\nA '''ski binding''' is a device that connects a [[ski boot]] to the [[ski]].

There are different types of bindings for different types of [[skiing]].\n\n== Alpine ==\n[[Image:Alpine ski bindings 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alpine ski bindings: for inbounds resort skiing, alpine touring and for toolfree length adjustment (from top to bottom)]]\n[[Image:Skistopperopen.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Snow brake in open position]]\nModern [[alpine skiing]] bindings fix the boot at the toe and heel.\n\nIn some bindings, to reduce injury the boot can release in case of a fall. The boot is released by the binding if a certain amount of [[torque]] is applied, usually created by the weight of a falling skier. The torque required is adjustable, according to the weight, foot size, and skiing style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dinsetting.com |title=DIN Setting Calculator |publisher=DINSetting.com |accessdate=20 Dec 2013}}</ref> A snow brake prevents the ski from moving while it is not attached to a boot.\n\nAlso known as randonee, an [[alpine touring binding]] allows the heel to be clipped down to the ski when skiing downhill, but allows it to be released when climbing.<ref>{{cite web|title=ki Bindings - Components and Functions|url=http://www.abc-of-skiing.com/whatareskibindings.asp|website=ABC of skiing|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Alpine touring===\nAn alpine touring binding allows the skier to have the heel of the ski boot free and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using Nordic skiing techniques for [[ski touring]], and to have both the heel and the toe of the ski boot in the binding when using [[alpine skiing]] techniques to descend the mountain. Most touring bindings are designed for ski boots falling under one of two ISO specifications:  \n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=38623 ISO 5355:2005], for traditional [[Ski boots#Alpine|alpine boots]]. In this variation the pivot is located in the front of the binding. \n* [http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=45842 ISO 9523:2008], for boots in which the pivot is formed at the boot / binding interface. \nThe two setups are mutually incompatible: in the former, the boot lacks sockets to engage ISO 9523 compatible bindings, while the later boot toe and heel-piece dimensions are incompatible with ISO 5355 bindings.\n\n==Nordic==\n\n===Cable binding===\n{{main|Cable binding}}\nThe cable binding was widely used through the middle of the 20th century. It has the toe section of the boot anchored, and an adjustable cable around the heel secures the boot. While binding designs vary, before 2007 almost all dedicated Telemark models had been designed to fit boots with 75mm ''Nordic Norm'' \"duckbill\" toes.\n\n===Rottefella (NN, Nordic Norm) ===\n[[File:NN-type Rottefella binding.jpg|thumb|right|A typical Rottefella cross-country binding. The ski boot has small holes that fit over the pins seen on the bottom of the plate, keeping the boot from sliding rearward. The metal bar clamps the toe down onto the pins, and can be released by pressing down on the plastic clip with a ski pole.]]\nThe Rottefella binding was developed in 1927 by [[Bror With]]. The name means \"rat trap\" in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]. It is also known as the 75&nbsp;mm, Nordic Norm, or 3-pin. After victories at the [[1928 Winter Olympics]] in [[St. Moritz]], the binding remained the standard for [[cross-country skiing (sport)|cross-country skiing]] for the next 60 years. They are no longer as popular as they were but are still for sale. The binding has three small pins that stick up from the binding. The toe of the boot has three holes into which the pins are inserted. The boot is then clamped down by a bail. The binding is asymmetrical, having left and right foot orientations. Prior to the Nordic Norm, cross-country ski bindings had as many as four pins.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KicPH9IN4rAC&pg=PA36&dq=four-pin+ski+binding&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz0dPbsNXZAhUEH6wKHc-yB88Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=four-pin%20ski%20binding&f=false|title=Skiing|last=Grout|first=William|date=October 1974|publisher=Ziff-Davis|year=|isbn=|volume=27|location=New York|pages=36|language=en|issn=0037-6264|number=2}}</ref>\n\n===NNN (New Nordic Norm) ===\n[[File:NNN-Binding.JPG|thumb|The NNN binding has two ridges extending backwards from the toe latch, matching corresponding channels in the boot]]\n[[Rottefella]]'s NNN (New Nordic Norm) has a bar in the toe of the boot hooked into a corresponding latch in the binding. There have been several versions of NNN, and the first NNN version is not compatible with current designs. A stronger, wider BC (Back Country) version also exists, abbreviated NNN{{nnbsp}}BC or NNN{{endash}}BC.\n\n=== NIS (Nordic Integrated System)===\nNIS (Nordic Integrated System), introduced in 2005 by [[Skis Rossignol|Rossignol]], [[Madshus]], [[Rottefella]], and [[Alpina \u017diri|Alpina]],<ref>Mike Muha, [http://www.nordicskiracer.com/Equipment/2005/NIS/NIS.asp \"Nordic Integrated System \"], Nordic Ski Racer, 26 January 2005</ref> is fully compatible with NNN boots and bindings, but is a different way of attaching the bindings to the ski.<ref name=rei>{{cite web|title=Cross-Country Ski Gear: How to Choose|url=http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/crosscountry-ski-touring-gear.html|publisher=REI|accessdate=15 November 2014}}</ref> It features an integrated binding plate on the top of the ski to which the bindings attach, allowing adjustment in the field with a metallic NIS key. The initial design of the plate used a movable insert for position adjustment. NIS skis allow installation of non-NIS bindings. In 2007, [[Fischer Skis|Fischer]] abandoned SNS and entirely switched to NIS. \n\nRottefella Xcelerator bindings provide an increased power transfer from ski boots with a matching Xcelerator pattern sole. Xcelerator SSR bindings include QuickLock mechanism for tool-less position adjustment.\n\n===SNS (Salomon Nordic System) ===\n[[File:SNS Profil-Bindung.JPG|thumb|The SNS Profil binding has one large, central ridge, extending backwards from the toe latch, and one metal bar on the boot]]\n[[File:SNS Pilot-Binding.JPG|thumb|The SNS Pilot binding has same central ridge as the SNS Profil, but has two bars on the boot for better stabilization]]\nSNS ([[Salomon Group|Salomon]] Nordic System) looks very similar to NNN, except it has one large ridge and the bar is shorter. Three variants exist:\n* SNS Profil: One metal bar in the toe of the boot.\n* SNS Pilot: Two metal bars on the boot.\n* SNS X-Adventure: Stronger design used for back-country skiing (also referred to as SNS{{endash}}BC).\nPilot boots cannot be used with a Profil binding but Profil boots can be used with Pilot bindings.  The original Pilot boots had the front pin 10 mm from the front of the boot (RS10), while the newer Pilot boots have the front pin 17 mm from the front of the boot (RS17).  SNS is marketed by [[Amer Sports]] under their Salomon and [[Atomic Skis|Atomic]] brands.\n\nThe predecessor was simply called Salomon Nordic System (SNS): \n* SNS: \"U-shaped\" metal bar protruding from the front of the boot\n\n===Prolink (Salomon NNN-compatible system) ===\nThe Rotefella NNN system was adopted by Fischer and their various brands, making SNS decline in use in North America. In response to the need for NNN compatibility, in 2016 Salomon introduced the Prolink system, although Salomon claims that SNS will still be produced and available. The Prolink binding is somewhat lighter than NNN and mounts directly to the ski using pre-drilled holes, as opposed to a built-in ski-mounted NIS or IFP plate used by NNN. Salomon claims their new system delivers a superior \u201csnow feel\u201d as compared to NNN or even their own SNS system which pairs with thicker soled boots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fasterskier.com/fsarticle/salomon-to-join-nnn-club-slated-to-reveal-new-boots-and-bindings-option-on-jan-1/|title=Salomon to Join NNN Club, Slated to Reveal New Boots-and-Bindings Option on Jan. 1|last=Albert|first=Jason|date=December 31, 2015|website=Faster Skier|access-date=2017-12-30}}</ref>\n\n===NTN (New Telemark Norm)===\nIn 2007, Rottefella introduced the New Telemark Norm binding. The system's objective is to provide a free heel telemark ski binding featuring lateral release, increased lateral rigidity, tunable performance, and free-pivot touring functionality.  The boots are unlike other tele boots in that they do not have a 75&nbsp;mm square toe and require a lip underneath the arch of the boot for the binding to attach.  Scarpa sells a version of the boot which is compatible with NTN Tele and Dynafit bindings. Rottefella currently (2015) offers two models of the binding, the Freeride for the lift assisted skier and the Freedom for the tourer.  Both models feature a free pivot and one boot standard, NTN.  Different spring cartridges can be used to match the binding to the skier's weight and skiing style.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Telemark Norm (NTN)|url=http://www.newtelemarkguide.com/wiki/New_Telemark_Norm|accessdate=16 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== IFP (Turnamic) ===\nIn 2016, Fischer and Rossignol introduced a new IFP (Integrated Fixation Plate) binding plate which allows tool-less adjustment of binding position. The Turnamic binding uses step-in locking for the boot, and the lock closes or opens by turning the lever to the side. \n\nThe IFP Turnamic bindings can be used with all NNN/Prolink boots, but the IFP plate will not accept NIS 1.0 bindings because of the new lock mechanism.<ref>https://skihaussteamboat.com/turnamic-xcelerator-prolink-nnn-what-a-nordic-guide-to-xc-boots-and-bindings/</ref>\n\nRottefella subsequently introduced continuously adjustable MOVE Switch bindings which can be installed in the IFP (and NIS) plates.<ref name=Rottefella-MOVE/>\n\n=== NIS 2.0 (MOVE)===\nIn 2018, Rottefella and [[Madshus]] announced the NIS 2.0 plate with the MOVE bindings which allow continuous on-the-fly adjustment of binding position with the boot locked-in. The NIS 2.0 plate and the MOVE Switch turnable wheel are designed to accept any existing NIS/NNN binding, using either fixed inserts or adjustable sliding inserts. MOVE Electric remote adjustment is being developed for 2019-2020 season.<ref>http://blog.ultratune.net/2018/01/skiing-201819-madshus-redline.html</ref> <ref name=Madshus-Redline-IGC>https://news.madshus.com/2017/10/11/optimizing-the-skin-ski/</ref> Rottefella also provides MOVE Switch conversion kits for NIS 1.0, IFP, and Prolink skis. <ref name=Rottefella-MOVE>https://www.bouldernordic.com/news/1084</ref>\n<ref name=MOVE-Switch>https://www.rottefella.com/move-system</ref>\n\nThe use of continuously adjustable bindings has been approved by the [[International Ski Federation|FIS]]; such adjustment allows the skier to fine-tune ski grip and glide, which is important for classic style racing on skis with waxless \"mohair\" grip-zones.<ref>https://news.madshus.com/2018/02/19/inside-the-factory-skin-skis-are-coming-to-the-world-cup/</ref><ref name=Madshus-Redline-IGC/> Previous Rottefella NNN bindings required the skier to dismount then apply significant force to a small metal NIS key to unlatch the binding.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Old ski binding.jpg|thumb|Old ski binding]]\n[[File:Huitfeldt-bindingen.JPG|thumb|right|A late model Huitfeldt-style binding.

This added a loop of twisted birch roots that ran from the existing birch root toe loops around the boot heels and back. This allowed the heel to lift as before, for walking and gliding, but better held the boots to the skis allowing greater control. This enabled Norheim to control the skis with his feet and legs, replacing the former technique of dragging a large pole in the snow on one side or the other to drag the skier in that direction.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lert|first=Wolfgang|title=A Binding Revolution|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=March 2002|pages=25\u201326|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wlgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref> These new techniques spread throughout [[Telemark]] and would later be named for the region.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Lund|first=Morten|title=Norway: How It All Started|journal=Skiing Heritage Journal|date=September 2007|pages=8\u201313|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=SlgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n* 1894: [[Fritz R. Huitfeldt]] invented a binding with a secure toe iron which allowed the heel to move freely. This became the standard industry binding through the 1930s. Huitfeldt drove the evolution of the ski binding over the next 20 years. In 1894, he introduced the use of semi-circular metal hooks at the toe to attach the straps. The hooks were positioned to tightly fit to the sides of the boot, keeping the ski centred and eliminating any \"flop\" that the formerly loose straps allowed. The heel strap was also attached to the same hooks, but because of their rounded shape, the required range of motion was provided by the straps sliding up and down on the hooks. This allowed the heel strap to be replaced by a less flexible leather strap. Together, these changes dramatically tightened the binding, greatly increasing control.<ref name=lert25>Lert, pg. 25</ref>\n* 1897: Huitfeldt further improved the design by changing the toe piece. Instead of hooks, he drilled a rectangular hole through the ski from side to side, and passed an iron bar through it. The bar was then bent up on either side, locking it in place, and then formed to fit the toe of the boot. This improvement once again dramatically improved the firmness of the fit. Finally, in 1904 he adopted the Hoyer-Ellefsen toggle, a lever that replaced the buckles.<ref name=lert26>Lert, pg. 26</ref> This not only greatly improved mechanical advantage, further improving the strength of the binding, but also made the system much easier to put on and remove. Better yet, the geometry of the attachment points meant the heel strap was mechanically attached below that of the toe strap, which provided a constant \"diagonal downpull\" that naturally returned the heel to the ski.\n* 1920: Huitfeldt style bindings were by far the most popular system for decades, with the only major change being Marius Eriksen's 1920 introduction of pre-formed plates that were screwed on top of the ski.<ref name=lert26/> Other binding systems did exist, in particular a class of bindings originally introduced by [[Mathias Zdarsky]] that replaced the heel strap with a long metal plate under the sole of the boot, hinged at the front to allow the heel to rise. The heel was held to the plate by a short strap attaching at the back.<ref>John Allen,  [https://books.google.ca/books?id=VVgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12 \"Mathias Zdarsky: The Father of Alpine Skiing\"], ''Ski Heritage'', March 2008, pg. 12</ref> These gave even better control than the Huitfeldt design, but so firmly attached the leg that injury was a real problem.\n* 1927: Change eventually came though the evolution of the [[Rottefella]] binding, first introduced in 1927. The original Rottefella eliminated the heel strap, which held the boot forward in the binding, by drilling small holes in the sole of the boot which fit into pins in the toe piece. This would only work if the sole was held very firmly down on the pins, so the binding also introduced a metal clip that was forced down onto the top of the sole of the boot, forcing it onto the pins. When the inventor, Bror With, won a race on the new design, Norwegian Crown Prince Olav asked him what they were, and he responded \"Oh, they're just a couple of rat traps I picked up at the hardware store\".<ref name=rot>[http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ \"About Us\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906104003/http://www.rottefella.no/en/Our-history/ |date=2015-09-06 }}, Rottefella</ref> \"Rottefella\" is Norwegian for \"rat trap\".\n* 1929: The introduction of the cable binding allowed the [[Stem Christie|Christie turn]] to become a standard on downhill runs, and to further support this style of skiing the Swiss racer Guido Reuge in 1929 invented a cable binding with steel clips below the boot heel to enable clamping the heel down for downhill portions. He named the product \"Kandahar\" for the international Kandahar Cup ski races.<ref>{{cite book|last=Huntsford|first=Roland|title=Two Planks and a Passion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IY7hYFesJe0C&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=kandahar+binding+reuge&source=bl&ots=sCTF3xB-G9&sig=dTKNZr6PTwawR9MOatm2NXj31sI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3PSbUtbzO8WdyQHIpYGgCA&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=kandahar%20binding%20reuge&f=false}}</ref> In use in alpine races, the Kandahar binding led to serious leg injuries, and by 1939 experimentation began in earnest on bindings that would release the boot in a fall.<ref>{{cite web|last=Masia|first=Seth|title=Release! History of Safety Bindings|url=http://skiinghistory.org/history/release-history-safety-bindings|publisher=Skiing History magazine}}</ref>\n\n* 1932: a major advance on the Huitfeldt concept was introduced to the market by Guido Reuge in 1932. Reuge replaced the heel strap with a metal cable connected to a spring at the front of the toe. The spring provided even tension as the boot moved. Previously, the strap was adjusted so it had enough slack to allow the boot to rotate as high as the skier wished, but as the boot rotated back down to the ski it became increasingly slack again. The cable removed this limitation, and held the boot firmly through its entire motion, greatly increasing the solidity of the fit. A later advance added two small metal clips near the rear of the foot that the cable could be clipped under. These held the boot firmly to the ski during downhill portions of the runs. Cable bindings remained in use for some time for cross-country, and are today popular for telemark skiing. However, the [[Rottefella]] design from the 1930s became more popular for Nordic skiing through the 1950s and into the 1970s until the [[Salomon Nordic System]] (SNS) binding entirely re-invented bindings used for Nordic skiing.\n* 1937: [[Hjalmar Hvam]] broke his leg skiing, and while recuperating from surgery, invented the Saf-Ski toe binding. This was a metal clip with a pyramidal top that fit into a slot cut into the sole of the ski boot. When the boot was rotated forward, the slot on the toe eventually rose above the metal pyramid, allowing the toe to release from the ski. The system was considered with suspicion by professional skiers, especially when Olaf Rodegaard released during a race. However, Rodegaard credits the release with saving him from a broken leg.<ref name=m27>Masia, pg. 27</ref> In the post-war era, Hvam sold several thousand pairs of Saf-Ski's, in an era when alpine skiing was in its infancy. Hvam continued to sell the Saf-Ski into the 1960s, but in 1966 his insurance rates increased so dramatically that he was forced from the market.<ref name=m30>Masia, pg. 30</ref>\n* 1950: A dramatic advance in alpine ski bindings was introduced as the [[Look Nevada]] in 1950. The Nevada held the toe centred over the ski using two metal fingers shaped into an upside-down V. The fingers were pivoted to allow motion to the sides, and centred with a spring. During a fall, sideways torsion could overcome the force of the spring and allow the boot to release directly to the side. This design was quickly copied by other vendors, notably [[Marker_(ski_bindings)|Marker]], and had the first real impact on the dominance of the fixed-toe bindings. By the late 1950s, there were about 35 different release toe bindings on the US market,<ref name=m29>Masia, pg. 29</ref> most of which used a normal Kandahar-style heel cable.\n* 1960: The first modern heel-and-toe binding for alpine skiing was the Cubco binding, first introduced in 1950 but not popular until about 1960. A heel-release binding faced the problem that there was no obvious place to attach to on the heel, so the Cubco solved this by screwing small metal clips into the sole of the boot. This also eliminated the changes in performance as the sole of the boot wore down, or the geometry of the sole changed as the boot wore into the skiers foot.<ref name=m29/> Marker introduced the Rotomat, which gripped onto the sole where it extended past the heel, and Look quickly followed suit with their Grand Prix design. By the mid-1960s, release bindings that worked on both the heel and the toe were common, and by the late 1960s, the cable binding had disappeared from alpine skiing.\n* 1966: The introduction of plastic ski boots permitted the development of industrial standards for the function of alpine skiing bindings. \n* 1972: Injury rates from alpine skiing began to fall with the gradual introduction of the Teflon anti-friction pad around 1972.\n* 1970s:\n**Alpine: One problem with 1960s release bindings was that the boots were not standardized, and a binding that worked well on one boot might be dangerous on another, or might become dangerous over time as the boot shifted about. This led to the introduction of plate bindings, which used a metal plate firmly clipped to the sole of the boot, and bindings that clamped onto the plate. The plate could be easily removed for walking about. Plate bindings were popular in the US in the 1970s, notably the [[BURT Retractable Bindings]] and [[Spademan binding]], but never caught on in any major way in Europe. As more and more of the alpine skiing market came under control of European companies, the plate bindings disappeared, in spite of their excellent safety records.<ref>Seth Masia, [https://books.google.com/books?id=x1gEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA39 \"The Better Mousetrap\"], ''Ski Heritage'', March 2003, pg 39-41</ref> The disappearance of the plate and alternate systems was due to a combination of factors, notably the introduction of standardized hard plastic boots. Plastic was first introduced by [[Lange (ski boots)|Lange]] as a way of improving existing leather designs. As the new material spread through the industry, the sole piece was standardized to allow toe-and-heel bindings to clip on. Plastic had the advantages of being much firmer than leather, not changing shape over time, and having predictable friction characteristics wet or dry. Although plate bindings of the era had much better safety records, notably the Spademan design, the new boots and bindings could be easily adapted to any ski for any skier.\n** Nordic: Problems with the geometry of the boot sole, which meant only certain boots would work, meant the Rottafella was not widely used. This problem was eventually solved through the same evolution of plastic components that changed the alpine skiing market. The use of highly flexible plastics allowed for a sole that was very strong torsionally and side-to-side, but still had excellent flexibility lengthwise, allowing the heel to rise as with a cable binding. This was standardized as the 3-pin system, which was widespread by the 1970s.<ref name=rot/> A similar system with a 50&nbsp;mm \"duckbill\" once existed for lighter setups, but is obsolete and no longer available. Unlike the 75&nbsp;mm it was symmetric. It was the binding of choice for racing, before the adoption of skate ski racing, in the early 1970s. The 50&nbsp;mm was also designated according to the thickness of the \"duckbill\" having either 7&nbsp;mm or 11\u201313&nbsp;mm thick soles hence these bindings often had two notches in the bail to clamp boots with different sole thicknesses.\n*1980s:\n{{clear}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Ski bindings}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Skiing}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ski Binding}}\n[[Category:Skiing equipment]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; mnr cpy ed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ski_binding"}
