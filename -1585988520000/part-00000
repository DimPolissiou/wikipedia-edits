Because the coal and clay beneath the eastern side of Aldridge (towards Stonnall) is located much deeper under the surface, extraction of this coal and clay would not have been economically viable. As a result, farms continued to dominate the eastern part, though a sand quarry was set up and still remains on Birch Lane.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621175821/http://www.btinternet.com/~aldridgelhs/HISTORY.htm A Brief History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, modern shops were built in the centre of Aldridge, as well as council buildings. After the [[Second World War]] Aldridge became a [[dormitory town]], or [[suburb]], of [[Birmingham]]. A small airport called Aldridge Airport was used during the Second World War and after was used for passenger services.\n\nAldridge became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] in [[Staffordshire]] in 1894. Other [[village]]s within the district included [[Pelsall]], [[Walsall Wood]], [[Clayhanger, Walsall|Clayhanger]] and [[Streetly]].

Some of the most notable factories include the large [[Ibstock]] brick works,  and the [[GKN Driveline|GKN Driveshafts]] factory, although the latter company closed in recent years due to relocation and cheaper foreign imports. [[Birlec]], a manufacturer of industrial furnaces relocated to Aldridge in the late 1950s, but has since closed. Aldridge Plastics Ltd, a plastics injection moulder, was set up in the town in 1968 and continued trading for almost 40 years before ceasing production in 2007. From January 2011, GFP Engineering Ltd, a Glass Reinforced Plastic (GRP) moulding company, will commence trading after relocating from nearby Lichfield.{{citation needed|reason=update evidence required|date=November 2014}} There is also a marina, Aldridge Marina, which recently underwent full refurbishment offering facilities for canal boat moorers.\n\nMost of the towns shops are located either on High Street, Anchor Road, or in the shopping area known as \"The Parade\".

As a result, farms continued to dominate the eastern part, though a sand quarry was set up and still remains on Birch Lane.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070621175821/http://www.btinternet.com/~aldridgelhs/HISTORY.htm A Brief History<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century, modern shops were built in the centre of Aldridge, as well as council buildings.

In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums.

He and friend Steve Goodman had each been active in the [[Chicago]] folk scene before being \"discovered\" by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (Kristofferson remarked that Prine wrote songs so good that \"we'll have to break his thumbs\").<ref name=\"Chilton, Martin 2013\">Chilton, Martin. \"John Prine: I Find the Human Condition Funny; John Prine, One of Bob Dylan's Favourite Songwriters, Is Appearing in the UK and Ireland.

The album received many positive reviews, and some hailed Prine as \"the next Dylan.\" [[Bob Dylan]] himself appeared unannounced at one of Prine's first [[New York City]] club appearances, anonymously backing him on harmonica.\n\nPrine's second album, ''[[Diamonds in the Rough (album)|Diamonds In The Rough]]'' (1972), was a surprise for many after the critical success of his first LP; it was an uncommercial, stripped-down affair that reflected Prine's fondness for bluegrass music and features songs reminiscent of [[Hank Williams]]. Highlights include the allegorical \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]],\" which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad \"Souvenirs,\" which Prine later recorded with Goodman.\n\nSubsequent albums include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as \"Dear Abby,\" \"Grandpa Was a Carpenter,\" and \"Christmas in Prison,\" and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with \"Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\". The latter album was Prine's first to be charted in the US Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reflecting growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. Many veteran Prine fans view the release of 1978's ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' as a creative highpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Steve Goodman-produced album gave listeners songs such as \"The Hobo Song,\" \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone,\" and the title track.\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me By My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman. The song good-naturedly spoofs stereotypical country music lyrics. Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit and the tune went to Goodman, although Goodman bought Prine a jukebox as a gift from his publishing royalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiLqHTvbKE|title=John Prine - You Never Even Call Me by My Name (1987)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Prine toured the U.S. and Canada with a full band featuring guitarist [[Arlen Roth]]. {{Asof|2014}}, this has been Prine's only tour with a full band.\n\nThe 1979 album ''[[Pink Cadillac (album)|Pink Cadillac]]'' features two songs produced by [[Sun Records]] founder [[Sam Phillips]], who by this time rarely did any studio work. The song \"Saigon,\" is about a Vietnam vet traumatized by the war (\"The static in my attic's gettin' ready to blow\"). During the recording, one of the guitar amps blew up (which is evident on the album). The other song Phillips produced is \"How Lucky,\" about Prine's hometown.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1981, rejecting the established model of the recording industry, which Prine felt exploited singers and songwriters, he co-founded the independent record label [[Oh Boy Records]]. His fans, supporting the project, sent him enough money to cover the costs, in advance, of his next album.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prine continued writing and recording albums throughout the 1980s  His songs continued to be covered by other artists; the country supergroup [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] recorded \"The Twentieth Century Is Almost Over,\" which had been written by Prine and Goodman. Steve Goodman died of leukemia in 1984 and Prine continues to perform many of Goodman's songs in concert to this day, such as \"My Old Man.\"\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, Prine released the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''The Missing Years'', his first collaboration with producer and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]] bassist [[Howie Epstein]]. The title song records Prine's humorous take on what [[Jesus]] did in the unrecorded years between his childhood and [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]]. In 1995, ''[[Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings]]'' was released, another collaboration with Epstein. Prine followed in 1999 with ''[[In Spite of Ourselves]]'', which was unusual for him in that it contained only one original song; the rest were covers of classic country songs. All of the tracks are duets with well-known female country vocalists, including [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Dolores Keane]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], and [[Iris DeMent]], notably on the title track.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn 2001, Prine co-starred in the [[Billy Bob Thornton]] movie ''[[Daddy & Them]]''. \"In Spite of Ourselves\" can be heard as the end credits roll.\n\nPrine recorded a version of [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\" in 2004 for the compilation album ''[[Beautiful Dreamer (album)|Beautiful Dreamer]]'', which won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Prine released his first all-new offering since ''Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings'', the album ''[[Fair & Square]]'', which tended toward a more laid-back, acoustic approach. The album contains songs such as \"Safety Joe,\" about a man who has never taken any risks in his life, and also \"Some Humans Ain't Human,\" Prine's protest piece on the album, which talks about the ugly side of [[human nature]] and includes a quick shot at President [[George W. Bush]]. ''Fair & Square'' won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. The album contains original songs plus two covers: [[A.P. Carter]]'s \"Bear Creek Blues\" and [[Blaze Foley]]'s \"Clay Pigeons.\"\n\n=== 2010s ===\nOn June 22, 2010, Oh Boy Records released a tribute album titled ''[[Broken Hearts and Dirty Windows: The Songs of John Prine]]''.

He has been active as a composer, recording artist, and live performer since the early 1970s, and is known for an often humorous style of country music that has elements of [[protest music|protest]] and social commentary.\n\nBorn and raised in [[Maywood, Illinois]], Prine learned to play the guitar at the age of 14. He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/989572224213450752 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=1964-09-17 |accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref> After serving in [[West Germany]] with the U.S. armed forces, he moved to [[Chicago]] in the late 1960s, where he worked as a mailman, writing and singing songs as a hobby.\n\nA member of Chicago's [[folk revival]], he was discovered by [[Kris Kristofferson]], resulting in the production of Prine's [[John Prine (album)|self-titled debut album]] with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1971. After receiving critical acclaim, Prine focused on his musical career, recording three more albums for Atlantic. He then signed to [[Asylum Records]], where he recorded an additional three albums. In 1984 he co-founded [[Oh Boy Records]], an independent record label with which he would release most of his subsequent albums. After his battle with [[Squamous cell carcinoma|squamous cell cancer]] in 1998, Prine's vocals deepened into a gravelly voice.\n\nWidely cited as one of the most influential songwriters of his generation, Prine is known for humorous lyrics about love, life, and current events, as well as serious songs with social commentary, or which recollect melancholy tales from his life.\n\n==Early life==\nPrine is the son of William Prine. a [[Tool and die maker|tool-and-die]] maker, and Verna Hamm, a homemaker, both from [[Muhlenberg County, Kentucky|Muhlenberg County]], [[Kentucky]]. He grew up in the Maywood suburb of Chicago.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Barry|first=Dan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/arts/music/john-prine-endures-with-a-half-smile-and-a-song.html|title=John Prine Endures, With a Half-Smile and a Song|date=2016-04-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He started playing guitar at age 14, taught by his brother, David.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shrout.co.uk/jpbackpage.html |title=John Prine Information |publisher=Shrout.co.uk |date=1946-10-10 |accessdate=2011-03-15}}</ref> He attended classes at Chicago's [[Old Town School of Folk Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/oldtownschool/status/98957222421345075 |title=John Prine OTSFM Registration Card |publisher=Old Town School of Folk Music |date=1964-09-17 |accessdate=2018-04-26}}</ref> Prine attended [[Proviso East High School]] in [[Maywood, Illinois]]. He was a mailman for five years and served in the [[United States Army|Army]] during the [[Vietnam War]] era, serving in Germany, before beginning his musical career in [[Chicago]].\n\nIn the late-1960s, while Prine was delivering mail, he began to sing at [[open mic]] evenings at the Fifth Peg on Armitage Avenue in Chicago. Prine was initially a spectator, reluctant to perform, but eventually did so in response to a \"You think you can do better?\" comment made to him by another performer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://devildick.blogspot.de/2012/02/john-prine-st-1971.html |title=The Devil's Music: John Prine \u2013 S/T \u2013 1971 |publisher=Devildick.blogspot.de |date=2012-02-07 |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] heard him there and wrote the first review Prine ever received, calling him a great songwriter.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/john-prine-american-legend |title=Roger Ebert's Journal: \"John Prine: American Legend\" |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=23 February 2015}}</ref> He became a central figure in the Chicago [[American folk music revival|folk revival]], which also included such singer-songwriters as [[Steve Goodman]], [[Michael Peter Smith]], [[Bonnie Koloc]], [[Jim Post]], [[Tom Dundee]], [[Anne Hills]]  and [[Fred Holstein]].

He and friend Steve Goodman had each been active in the [[Chicago]] folk scene before being \"discovered\" by [[Kris Kristofferson]] (Kristofferson remarked that Prine wrote songs so good that \"we'll have to break his thumbs\").<ref name=\"Chilton, Martin 2013\">Chilton, Martin. \"John Prine: I Find the Human Condition Funny; John Prine, One of Bob Dylan's Favourite Songwriters, Is Appearing in the UK and Ireland. Here He Talks to Martin Chilton.\" Daily Telegraph [London, England] February 8, 2013, Web Edition Articles ed.: Print.</ref> The album included his signature songs \"Illegal Smile,\" \"[[Sam Stone (song)|Sam Stone]],\" and the folk and country standards \"[[Angel from Montgomery]]\" and \"[[Paradise (John Prine song)|Paradise]].\" The album also featured \"[[Hello In There]],\" a song about aging that was later covered by numerous artists, and \"Far From Me\", a lonely waltz about lost love for a waitress that Prine later said was his favorite of all his songs. The album received many positive reviews, and some hailed Prine as \"the next Dylan.\" [[Bob Dylan]] himself appeared unannounced at one of Prine's first [[New York City]] club appearances, anonymously backing him on harmonica.\n\nPrine's second album, ''[[Diamonds in the Rough (album)|Diamonds In The Rough]]'' (1972), was a surprise for many after the critical success of his first LP; it was an uncommercial, stripped-down affair that reflected Prine's fondness for bluegrass music and features songs reminiscent of [[Hank Williams]]. Highlights include the allegorical \"[[The Great Compromise (song)|The Great Compromise]],\" which includes a recitation and addresses the [[Vietnam War]], and the ballad \"Souvenirs,\" which Prine later recorded with Goodman.\n\nSubsequent albums include ''[[Sweet Revenge (John Prine album)|Sweet Revenge]]'' (1973), containing such fan favorites as \"Dear Abby,\" \"Grandpa Was a Carpenter,\" and \"Christmas in Prison,\" and [[Common Sense (John Prine album)|''Common Sense'']] (1975), with \"Come Back to Us Barbara Lewis Hare Krishna Beauregard\". The latter album was Prine's first to be charted in the US Top 100 by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reflecting growing commercial success. It was produced by Steve Cropper. Many veteran Prine fans view the release of 1978's ''[[Bruised Orange]]'' as a creative highpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The Steve Goodman-produced album gave listeners songs such as \"The Hobo Song,\" \"Sabu Visits the Twin Cities Alone,\" and the title track.\n\nIn 1974, singer [[David Allan Coe]] achieved considerable success on the country charts with \"[[You Never Even Called Me By My Name]]\", co-written by Prine and Goodman. The song good-naturedly spoofs stereotypical country music lyrics. Prine refused to take a songwriter's credit and the tune went to Goodman, although Goodman bought Prine a jukebox as a gift from his publishing royalties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMiLqHTvbKE|title=John Prine - You Never Even Call Me by My Name (1987)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=October 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Prine toured the U.S. and Canada with a full band featuring guitarist [[Arlen Roth]]. {{Asof|2014}}, this has been Prine's only tour with a full band.\n\nThe 1979 album ''[[Pink Cadillac (album)|Pink Cadillac]]'' features two songs produced by [[Sun Records]] founder [[Sam Phillips]], who by this time rarely did any studio work. The song \"Saigon,\" is about a Vietnam vet traumatized by the war (\"The static in my attic's gettin' ready to blow\"). During the recording, one of the guitar amps blew up (which is evident on the album). The other song Phillips produced is \"How Lucky,\" about Prine's hometown.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nIn 1981, rejecting the established model of the recording industry, which Prine felt exploited singers and songwriters, he co-founded the independent record label [[Oh Boy Records]]. His fans, supporting the project, sent him enough money to cover the costs, in advance, of his next album.<ref name=\":0\" /> Prine continued writing and recording albums throughout the 1980s  His songs continued to be covered by other artists; the country supergroup [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] recorded \"The Twentieth Century Is Almost Over,\" which had been written by Prine and Goodman. Steve Goodman died of leukemia in 1984 and Prine continues to perform many of Goodman's songs in concert to this day, such as \"My Old Man.\"\n\n=== 1990s ===\nIn 1991, Prine released the [[Grammy Award]]-winning ''The Missing Years'', his first collaboration with producer and [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]] bassist [[Howie Epstein]]. The title song records Prine's humorous take on what [[Jesus]] did in the unrecorded years between his childhood and [[Ministry of Jesus|ministry]]. In 1995, ''[[Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings]]'' was released, another collaboration with Epstein. Prine followed in 1999 with ''[[In Spite of Ourselves]]'', which was unusual for him in that it contained only one original song; the rest were covers of classic country songs. All of the tracks are duets with well-known female country vocalists, including [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Patty Loveless]], [[Dolores Keane]], [[Trisha Yearwood]], and [[Iris DeMent]], notably on the title track.\n\n=== 2000s ===\nIn 2001, Prine co-starred in the [[Billy Bob Thornton]] movie ''[[Daddy & Them]]''. \"In Spite of Ourselves\" can be heard as the end credits roll.\n\nPrine recorded a version of [[Stephen Foster]]'s \"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]\" in 2004 for the compilation album ''[[Beautiful Dreamer (album)|Beautiful Dreamer]]'', which won the Grammy for Best Traditional Folk Album in 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Prine released his first all-new offering since ''Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings'', the album ''[[Fair & Square]]'', which tended toward a more laid-back, acoustic approach. The album contains songs such as \"Safety Joe,\" about a man who has never taken any risks in his life, and also \"Some Humans Ain't Human,\" Prine's protest piece on the album, which talks about the ugly side of [[human nature]] and includes a quick shot at President [[George W. Bush]]. ''Fair & Square'' won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. The album contains original songs plus two covers: [[A.P. Carter]]'s \"Bear Creek Blues\" and [[Blaze Foley]]'s \"Clay Pigeons.\"\n\n=== 2010s ===\nOn June 22, 2010, Oh Boy Records released a tribute album titled ''[[Broken Hearts and Dirty Windows: The Songs of John Prine]]''. The album features members of the modern folk revival including [[My Morning Jacket]], [[The Avett Brothers]], [[Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band]], [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], [[Lambchop (band)|Lambchop]], [[Josh Ritter]], [[Drive-By Truckers]], [[Nickel Creek]]'s [[Sara Watkins]], [[Deer Tick (band)|Deer Tick]] featuring Liz Isenberg, [[Justin Townes Earle]], [[Those Darlins]], and [[Bon Iver]]'s [[Justin Vernon]].<ref name=\"broken hearts\">{{cite web|url=http://brokenheartsanddirtywindows.com/about.html |title=Broken Hearts and Dirty Windows: The Songs of John Prine; Oh Boy Records |publisher=brokenheartsanddirtywindows.com |accessdate=2012-02-18}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Prine was named winner of the PEN/Song Lyrics Award, given to two songwriters every other year by the [[PEN International|PEN]] New England chapter. The 2016 award was shared with [[Tom Waits]] and his songwriting collaborator wife [[Kathleen Brennan]]. Judges for the award included [[Peter Wolf]], [[Rosanne Cash]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Elvis Costello]] and others, as well as literary judge [[Salman Rushdie]].<ref>PEN+NE Song Lyric Award page http://www.pen-ne.org/lyrics/</ref> In 2016, Prine released ''[[For Better, or Worse]]'', a follow-up to ''[[In Spite of Ourselves]]'' from 1999. The album featured country music covers featuring some of the most prominent female voices in the genre including [[Alison Krauss]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Kacey Musgraves]] and [[Lee Ann Womack]] among others, as well as [[Iris DeMent]], the only artist to be featured on both albums.\n\nOn March 15, 2017 The American Currents exhibit opened at the Country Music Hall of Fame. The exhibit featured a pair of cowboy boots and jacket that he often wore on stage, his personal guitar and the original handwritten lyric to his hit, \"Angel From Montgomery.\" The American Currents Class of 2016 showcased artists who made a significant impact on country music in 2016, including [[Jason Aldean]], [[Kelsea Ballerini]], [[Ross Copperman]], [[The Earls of Leicester (band)|The Earls of Leicester]], [[Brett Eldredge]], [[Florida Georgia Line]], [[Mickey Guyton]], [[Natalie Hemby]], [[Sierra Hull]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Jim Lauderdale]], [[Shane McAnally]], [[Lori McKenna]], [[William Michael Morgan]], [[Maren Morris]], [[Jon Pardi]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Margo Price]], John Prine, [[RaeLynn]], [[Chris Stapleton|Chris and Morgane Stapleton]] and [[Randy Travis]]. Prine won his second Artist of the Year award at the 2017 [[Americana Music Honors & Awards]] after previously winning in 2005.\n\nOn February 8, 2018, Prine announced his first new album of original material in 13 years, titled ''[[The Tree of Forgiveness]]'', would be released on April 13. Produced by [[Dave Cobb]], the album was released on Prine's own Oh Boy Records and features guest artists [[Jason Isbell]], [[Amanda Shires]], [[Dan Auerbach]] and [[Brandi Carlile]].

The price of copper collapsed and mining activities came to an end in the summer of 1935. The Copper River and Northwestern railroad was last used in November 1938.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== The Birth of Kennecott ==\nThe Alaska Syndicate took form in 1906 when the financial interests of JP Morgan merged with the mining interests of the Guggenheims, with Stephen Birch as the managing director. Stephen Birch also expanded the Syndicate to other ventures. Eventually, it acquired an important mercantile business, Alaska's second largest company, its largest steamship and its longest railroads.<ref>Stearns, \"Morgan-Guggenheim Syndicate\" (M.A. thesis, Columbia University, 1936).</ref>\n\nThe discovery of high-grade copper ore at Kennecott attracted attention in the mining industry. Steven Birch was one of the earliest people who purchased claims in the Kennecott ores when it was first discovered. He persuaded JP Morgan and the Guggenheims to invest in the deposit at Kennecott. The operation and the development of the ores in Kennecott falls in the successions of two organizations: The Alaska Syndicate and the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The two organizations share the same goals across different historical times. They are stability of supply, transportations and markets.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Kennecott: Alaskan Origins of a Copper Empire, 1900-1938|last = Grauman|first = |date = 1978|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nThe Alaska Syndicate, as typical businessmen in the 19th century, used bribes and promises to win business favors in the political system. However, their methods were seriously challenged by James Wickersham who led the Alaskan people against monopolism. The famous Ballinger-Pinchot Affair [14] eventually changed the political landscape across the board.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, it caused the resignation of Ballinger, who was a politician in favor of the Alaska Syndicate. Also, the effects of this anti-syndicate climate caused the failure of President Taft's re-election to the presidency. His successor, president Wilson had a series of political reforms which made the old methods of the Alaska Syndicate to not work in the new times. Consequently, the Alaska Syndicate invited public participation and a new corporation, the Kennecott Copper Corporation, was founded.  Essentially the same people controlled the Corporation, but with different tactics and methods to manage the organization.\n\n== James Wickersham ==\nJames Wickersham was district judge and delegate of the House of Representatives for the Territory of Alaska 1909-1917, 1919, and 1921, 1931-1933.\n\nThe Territory of Alaska had a man who stood up for the area, and this man's name was James Wickersham. James Wickersham was a major opponent of the Alaska Syndicate.\n\n\"An affidavit similar to the one herewith enclosed was submitted by Hon. James Wickersham Delegate from Alaska, on May 24, 1910, together with a copy of a letter which he forwarded to the Attorney General on the same date, with reference to the matter of furnishing coal to military posts at Forts Davis and Liscum, Alaska, and on May 28, 1910, this office informed the Secretary of War that the papers referred to would be held, pending call from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office. As it is understood that the Department of Justice was investigating the matter, no further action was taken by his office.\n\n\"However, on November 26, 1910, Mr. Stuart McNamara, of No. 52 William Street, New York, formerly connected with the Department of Justice, requested, and was furnished, a brief statement of facts as shown by the records of this office, it being understood that fee intended to assist the Department of Justice in the investigation of the matter.\n\n\"No call has yet been received from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office.\"<ref>United States Congressional serial set, issue 6117 pg. 75-79</ref>\n\nEfforts toward self-government were complicated by the influence in Washington of the \"Alaska Syndicate,\" formed in 1906 by the fortunes of J. P. Morgan and Guggenheim. The Syndicate had purchased the large Kennicott-Bonanza copper mine and controlled much of Alaskan steamship and rail transportation, as well as a major part of the salmon canning industry. The Syndicate lobby in Washington had successfully opposed any further extension of Alaskan home rule. James Wickersham, who had been appointed to an Alaskan judgeship in 1900 by President McKinley, became alarmed by the potential influence of incorporated interests in the territory and took up the struggle for Alaskan self-government. Wickersham argued that Alaska's resources should be used for the good of the entire country rather than exploited by a select group of large, absentee-controlled interests\u2014home rule, he claimed, would assure more just utilization of the territory's natural wealth. The 1910 Ballinger-Pinchot affair, which involved the illegal distribution of thirty-three federal government Alaskan coal land claims to the Guggenheim interests, culminated in a Congressional investigation and brought Alaska directly into the national headlines.<ref>Gislason, Eric. A Brief History in Alaska Statehood</ref>\n\nIn the midst of it all, James Wickersham was a big contribution to Alaska becoming a state.\n\n== Kennicott and Kennecott ==\nThe town of [[Kennicott, Alaska|Kennicott]] was home to over 500 miners and their families, which is now a small community. It was a classic \"dry\" company town. Most of the miners lived in company housing and was revolved around the mining operation. The Kennecott Copper Mine was the largest copper mine in the world at some time. (?) The mine operated from 1911 to 1938 in the town that is known now as [[McCarthy, Alaska|McCarthy]] in [[Wrangell\u2013St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell St. Elias National Park]]. In the spring of 1915, Guggenheim and Morgan formed the [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]]. The total production was valued at over $200 million which is now comparable about $3 billion. After all of the rich copper deposits were depleted the mines of Kennecott along with the railroad, ceased operations.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.largestnationalpark.com/history.html|title = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|date = 2009|accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|publisher = Largest National Park|last = |first = }}</ref> The Alaska Syndicate was formed to develop the mine which eventually expanded into coal, salmon, and infrastructure throughout the state. Their influence helped to prevent Alaska from becoming a state as early as 1916. While the Kennecott Mining Company was still in operation they had developed other properties that still exist today. The different spelling between ''Kennicott'' and ''Kennecott'' was a simple mistake of one letter that the mine owner accidentally spelled wrong and never changed it.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.trekalaska.com/wrangell-st-elias-national-park/kennicott-alaska|title = Trek Alaska|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = Trek Alaska Wilderness Adventure|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe Kennicott glacier was named after Robert Kennicott. Robert Kennicott was a part of the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] and arrived in [[San Francisco]] in April 1865. The group moved north to [[Vancouver]] where Kennicott suffered a period of ill health. After his recovery they moved north again to [[Alaska]] in August 1865. Kennicott died in May 1866, likely of congestive heart failure, while traveling up the [[Yukon River]].\n[[File:Kennicott 01.jpg|thumb|Kennecott Mine]]\nToday{{When|date=July 2016}} the tourism makes up the majority of the local economy. People from all over the world come and visit the remains of the Kennecott mines. Even though Kennicott is not a copper mining town anymore it is still a company town of sorts with it having headquarters to the National Park Service.

The deputized leader of the band who shot the worker was subsequently tried and \"the syndicate lost much face as charges of bribery and other irregularities were aired.\"<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe terrain presented difficulties including bridging the intense flow of the Copper River, building around glaciers, and chiseling into the rock faces of two canyons.<ref name=\":2\" /> The railroad cost $20 million, including $1.5 million for the construction of the \"[[Miles Glacier Bridge|Million Dollar Bridge]],\" which crosses the Copper River between the Miles and Childs Glaciers.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWhen the great depression hit, the Alaska Syndicate was not immune. The price of copper collapsed and mining activities came to an end in the summer of 1935. The Copper River and Northwestern railroad was last used in November 1938.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== The Birth of Kennecott ==\nThe Alaska Syndicate took form in 1906 when the financial interests of JP Morgan merged with the mining interests of the Guggenheims, with Stephen Birch as the managing director. Stephen Birch also expanded the Syndicate to other ventures. Eventually, it acquired an important mercantile business, Alaska's second largest company, its largest steamship and its longest railroads.<ref>Stearns, \"Morgan-Guggenheim Syndicate\" (M.A. thesis, Columbia University, 1936).</ref>\n\nThe discovery of high-grade copper ore at Kennecott attracted attention in the mining industry. Steven Birch was one of the earliest people who purchased claims in the Kennecott ores when it was first discovered. He persuaded JP Morgan and the Guggenheims to invest in the deposit at Kennecott. The operation and the development of the ores in Kennecott falls in the successions of two organizations: The Alaska Syndicate and the Kennecott Copper Corporation. The two organizations share the same goals across different historical times. They are stability of supply, transportations and markets.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Kennecott: Alaskan Origins of a Copper Empire, 1900-1938|last = Grauman|first = |date = 1978|journal = Western Historical Quarterly|accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}</ref>\n\nThe Alaska Syndicate, as typical businessmen in the 19th century, use bribes and promises to win business favors in the political system. However, their methods were seriously challenged by James Wickersham who led the Alaskan people against monopolism. The famous Ballinger-Pinchot Affair [14] eventually changed the political landscape across the board.<ref name=\":3\" /> For example, it caused the resignation of Ballinger, who was a politician in favor of the Alaska Syndicate. Also, the effects of this anti-syndicate climate caused the failure of President Taft's re-election to the presidency. His successor, president Wilson had a series of political reforms which made the old methods of the Alaska Syndicate to not work in the new times. Consequently, the Alaska Syndicate invited public participation and a new corporation, the Kennecott Copper Corporation, was founded.  Essentially the same people controlled the Corporation, but with different tactics and methods to manage the organization.\n\n== James Wickersham ==\nJames Wickersham was district judge and delegate of the House of Representatives for the Territory of Alaska 1909-1917, 1919, and 1921, 1931-1933.\n\nThe Territory of Alaska had a man who stood up for the area, and this man's name was James Wickersham. James Wickersham was a major opponent of the Alaska Syndicate.\n\n\"An affidavit similar to the one herewith enclosed was submitted by Hon. James Wickersham Delegate from Alaska, on May 24, 1910, together with a copy of a letter which he forwarded to the Attorney General on the same date, with reference to the matter of furnishing coal to military posts at Forts Davis and Liscum, Alaska, and on May 28, 1910, this office informed the Secretary of War that the papers referred to would be held, pending call from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office. As it is understood that the Department of Justice was investigating the matter, no further action was taken by his office.\n\n\"However, on November 26, 1910, Mr. Stuart McNamara, of No. 52 William Street, New York, formerly connected with the Department of Justice, requested, and was furnished, a brief statement of facts as shown by the records of this office, it being understood that fee intended to assist the Department of Justice in the investigation of the matter.\n\n\"No call has yet been received from the Attorney General for any papers or information that may be on file in this office.\"<ref>United States Congressional serial set, issue 6117 pg. 75-79</ref>\n\nEfforts toward self-government were complicated by the influence in Washington of the \"Alaska Syndicate,\" formed in 1906 by the fortunes of J. P. Morgan and Guggenheim. The Syndicate had purchased the large Kennicott-Bonanza copper mine and controlled much of Alaskan steamship and rail transportation, as well as a major part of the salmon canning industry. The Syndicate lobby in Washington had successfully opposed any further extension of Alaskan home rule. James Wickersham, who had been appointed to an Alaskan judgeship in 1900 by President McKinley, became alarmed by the potential influence of incorporated interests in the territory and took up the struggle for Alaskan self-government. Wickersham argued that Alaska's resources should be used for the good of the entire country rather than exploited by a select group of large, absentee-controlled interests\u2014home rule, he claimed, would assure more just utilization of the territory's natural wealth. The 1910 Ballinger-Pinchot affair, which involved the illegal distribution of thirty-three federal government Alaskan coal land claims to the Guggenheim interests, culminated in a Congressional investigation and brought Alaska directly into the national headlines.<ref>Gislason, Eric. A Brief History in Alaska Statehood</ref>\n\nIn the midst of it all, James Wickersham was a big contribution to Alaska becoming a state.\n\n== Kennicott and Kennecott ==\nThe town of [[Kennicott, Alaska|Kennicott]] was home to over 500 miners and their families, which is now a small community. It was a classic \"dry\" company town. Most of the miners lived in company housing and was revolved around the mining operation. The Kennecott Copper Mine was the largest copper mine in the world at some time. (?) The mine operated from 1911 to 1938 in the town that is known now as [[McCarthy, Alaska|McCarthy]] in [[Wrangell\u2013St. Elias National Park and Preserve|Wrangell St. Elias National Park]]. In the spring of 1915, Guggenheim and Morgan formed the [[Kennecott Copper Corporation]]. The total production was valued at over $200 million which is now comparable about $3 billion. After all of the rich copper deposits were depleted the mines of Kennecott along with the railroad, ceased operations.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url = http://www.largestnationalpark.com/history.html|title = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|date = 2009|accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = McCarthy, Kennecott, & the Kennicott Valley|publisher = Largest National Park|last = |first = }}</ref> The Alaska Syndicate was formed to develop the mine which eventually expanded into coal, salmon, and infrastructure throughout the state. Their influence helped to prevent Alaska from becoming a state as early as 1916. While the Kennecott Mining Company was still in operation they had developed other properties that still exist today. The different spelling between ''Kennicott'' and ''Kennecott'' was a simple mistake of one letter that the mine owner accidentally spelled wrong and never changed it.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.trekalaska.com/wrangell-st-elias-national-park/kennicott-alaska|title = Trek Alaska|date = |accessdate = December 10, 2014|website = Trek Alaska Wilderness Adventure|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nThe Kennicott glacier was named after Robert Kennicott. Robert Kennicott was a part of the [[Western Union Telegraph Expedition]] and arrived in [[San Francisco]] in April 1865. The group moved north to [[Vancouver]] where Kennicott suffered a period of ill health. After his recovery they moved north again to [[Alaska]] in August 1865. Kennicott died in May 1866, likely of congestive heart failure, while traveling up the [[Yukon River]].\n[[File:Kennicott 01.jpg|thumb|Kennecott Mine]]\nToday{{When|date=July 2016}} the tourism makes up the majority of the local economy. People from all over the world come and visit the remains of the Kennecott mines. Even though Kennicott is not a copper mining town anymore it is still a company town of sorts with it having headquarters to the National Park Service. McCarthy is still able to be accessed by the [[McCarthy Road]] which follows the rail bed of the old Copper River and [[Northwestern Railway (Alaska)|Northwestern Railway]] from [[Chitina]] to McCarthy.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Investment funds]]\n[[Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct transportation companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Mining in Alaska]]\n[[Category:Political history of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Alaska]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Alaska]]\n", "name_user": "Writhing", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Birth of Kennecott", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Syndicate"}

In 1902 the company's vessels made 21 visits to Dubai and from 1904 on,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=743}}</ref> the steamers called fortnightly \u2013 in 1906, trading seventy thousand tonnes of cargo.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=34}}</ref> The frequency of these vessels only helped to accelerate Dubai's role as an emerging port and trading hub of preference.

The disaster was a major setback for Dubai, with many families losing their breadwinner and merchants facing financial ruin. These losses came at a time when the tribes of the interior were also experiencing poverty. In a letter to the Sultan of [[Muscat]] in 1911, Butti laments, 'Misery and poverty are raging among them, with the result that they are struggling, looting and killing among themselves.'<ref>{{Cite book|title=Father of Dubai|last=Wilson|first=Graeme|publisher=Media Prima|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=39}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-oil Dubai===\nDubai's geographical proximity to [[Iran]] made it an important trade location. The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen, chiefly those from Iran, many of whom eventually settled in the town. By the beginning of the 20th century, it was an important port.<ref name=\"britannica\"/> At that time, Dubai consisted of the town of Dubai and the nearby village of [[Jumeirah]], a collection of some 45 ''areesh'' (palm leaf) huts.<ref name=\"Lorimer 1915 454\"/> Dubai was known for its [[pearl]] exports until the 1930s; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the 1929 [[Great Depression]] and the innovation of [[cultured pearls]].

This gold was, in the vast majority, re-exported - mainly to customers who took delivery in international waters off [[India]]. The import of gold to India had been banned and so the trade was characterised as smuggling, although Dubai's merchants were quick to point out that they were making legal deliveries of gold and that it was up to the customer where they took it.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Gold smuggling boosts Dubai economy|last=Thomas|first=Anthony|date=3 March 1969|work=The Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1966, more gold was shipped from London to Dubai than almost anywhere else in the world (Only France and Switzerland took more), at 4 million ounces. Dubai also took delivery of over $15 million-worth of watches and over 5 million ounces of silver. The 1967 price of gold was $35 an ounce but its market price in India was $68 an ounce - a healthy markup.

The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972, although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built.
