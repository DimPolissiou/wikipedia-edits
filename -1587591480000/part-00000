In the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 it appears as ''{{lang|ang|Sandwice}}''. The name ''-wich'' comes from the Anglo Saxon ''{{lang|ang|-w\u012bc}}'', meaning a dwelling or fortified place where trade takes place. The name means \"market town on sandy soil\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.404.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sandwich, town bridge (detail) - geograph.org.uk - 650895.jpg|thumb|The [[Sandwich Toll Bridge]], showing the town's coat of arms]]\nBefore Sandwich became a [[Cinque Port]], the ancient [[Saxon]] town of Stonar on the bank of the [[Wantsum Channel|Wantsum estuary]], but on the opposite side of the mouth of the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]], was already well established. It remained a place of considerable importance but it disappeared almost without trace in the 14th century. The ruins of the major Roman fort of [[Richborough]] are close by. It was the landing place of the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] in AD 43.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7648033.stm |title=Dig uncovers Roman invasion coast |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2 October 2008 }}</ref>  In 2008, an archaeological dig proved that this was a defensive site of a Roman beachhead, protecting 700 metres of coast.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/roman-invasion-beach-found-in-kent-949717.html |title=Roman invasion beach found in Kent: Archaeologists unearth landing point of legions \u2013 only now it's two miles from the coast |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1028 King [[Canute]] ({{circa|995}}\u20131035) granted a charter to the monks of [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], to operate a ferry across the river and collect tolls.

The prize beast arrived at Sandwich quayside, delivered as a gift to the English monarch [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] from the French king, and was then taken on foot to the king's menagerie in the [[Tower of London]]. The journey through [[Kent]] is reported to have proceeded without incident, except when a bull in a field by the roadside took umbrage at the great beast passing and attacked it.

A force of around 4,000 men from [[Honfleur]], under the command of [[Pierre de Br\u00e9z\u00e9]], [[Marshal of France]], came ashore to pillage the town, in the process murdering the mayor, John Drury. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe in mourning for this ignoble deed.\n\nSandwich later gained significantly from the skills brought to the town by many [[Flanders|Flemish]] settlers, who were granted the right to settle by [[letters patent]] from [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], dated 6 July 1561.<ref>F.W. Cross, \"History of the Walloon and Huguenot Church at Canterbury.\" In: ''Publications of the Huguenot Society of London'', 15 (1898), p. 13.</ref> Sandwich was the only town in England that housed more so-called \"strangers\" than native Englishmen in the 16th century. Historian Marcel Backhouse estimated there were at least 2,400 Flemish and 500 [[Wallonia|Walloon]] exiles living in Sandwich at the time.<ref>M. Backhouse, ''The Flemish and Walloon Communities at Sandwich during the Reign of Elizabeth I (1561-1603)'', Brussels: Paleis der Academie\u00ebn, 1995, pp. 32-34.</ref> These settlers brought with them techniques of market gardening, and were responsible for growing the first English [[celery]], which was already and still very popular in Flanders. Elizabeth I granted 25 Flemish families permission to live in Sandwich, and St Peter became the \"Stranger's Church\" in 1564 when the plague came to the town, in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. The 1661 tower collapse was repaired by the Flemish community, and the distinctive tower reflects their work. The [[Huguenot]] refugees also brought over Flemish architectural techniques, that are now as much a part of Kent as the thatched cottage. One can still see the difference between the English (lower section) and Flemish (upper section) of the tower. In addition techniques of [[silk]] manufacture were imported, enhancing the Kent cloth industry.\n\nThe coat of arms of Sandwich is blazoned ''Per pale Gules and Azure three demi-Lions passant guardant in pale Or conjoined with as many sterns of demi-Ships Argent'';<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/weald_downs.html |title=Sandwich Town Council |work=Civic Heraldry of England }}</ref> see photo.

The title [[Earl of Sandwich]] was created in 1660 for the prominent naval commander Admiral [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich|Sir Edward Montagu]] (1625\u201372).\n\n[[File:Sandwich kent map1945.jpg|thumb|right|A map of Sandwich from 1945]]\nIn 1759, [[Thomas Paine]] (1737\u20131809) had his home and shop in a house at 20 New Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-sandwich.co.uk/town_history/scrapbook/thomas_paine.htm |title=Thomas Paine |work=Sandwich People & History |publisher=Open Sandwich |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref> The house is now marked with a plaque and is a listed building.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1069586 |desc=20 and 22 New Street |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (1869\u20131944) built [[The Salutation, Sandwich|The Salutation]] in [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]].

As the story goes, he was an avid gambler, and since he often did not have time to sit for a meal due to his gambling habits, he would order his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread. Because Montagu was the Earl of Sandwich, others{{who|date=June 2012}} began to order \"the same as Sandwich!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whatscookingamerica.net/History/SandwichHistory.htm|title=Sandwich History|first=Linda|last=Stradley|date=20 May 2015|website=What's Cooking America}}</ref> However, the exact circumstances of the invention are still the subject of debate. A rumour in a contemporary travel book called ''Tour to London'' by Pierre Jean Grosley (although not confirmed) formed the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the [[gambling]] table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktoider.nu/sandwich_eng.html|title=Hexmaster's Factoids: Sandwich|website=www.faktoider.nu}}</ref> An alternative suggestion by Sandwich's biographer, [[N.

During Sandwich festivals of the past there have been European markets, motorcycle meets, an illuminated boat parade or dressed ship parade on The Quay, a street Barn Dance, various concerts (both classical and modern pop/rock), Simultaneous Chess Tournament with Grand Master John Emms and a vintage Car Show. The festival usually lasts for eight days.\n\n===Newspapers===\nSandwich has two paid-for newspapers, the ''Deal and Sandwich Express'' (published by Kent Regional News and Media) and the ''[[East Kent Mercury and Dover Mercury|East Kent Mercury]]'' (published by the [[KM Group]]). Free newspapers for the town include the ''Dover Extra'', part of the KM Group; and ''yoursandwich'', part of [[KOS Media]].\n\n===Radio===\nThe local radio station for Sandwich is [[KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country]], although the town has good coverage of [[KMFM Thanet]]. Sandwich is also served by the county-wide stations [[Heart Kent|Heart]], [[Gold (radio)|Gold]] and [[BBC Radio Kent]]. Sandwich is also covered by Podcasting service [[Dover]] Community Radio <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dcrfm.co.uk/|title=DCR Local Radio for Dover, Deal, Sandwich and the surrounding areas.|website=www.dcrfm.co.uk}}</ref> who cover [[Dover District]] with local podcasts on their website.

It lies on the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]] and has a population of 4,985.<ref name=\"popn\"/> Sandwich was one of the [[Cinque Ports]] and still has many original medieval buildings, including several [[listed building|listed]] [[public houses]] and gates in the old town walls, churches, [[almshouse]]s and the [[White Mill, Sandwich|White Mill]]. While once a major port, it is now two miles from the sea due to the disappearance of the [[Wantsum Channel]]. Its historic centre has been preserved.<ref>: \"It had just closed up, and now it was preserved, two miles from the sea, in its own rich silt\", as [[Paul Theroux]] remarked in ''The Kingdom by the Sea'', 1983:33.</ref> [[Sandwich Bay, Kent|Sandwich Bay]] is home to [[nature reserve]]s and two world-class [[golf]] courses, [[Royal St George's]] and [[Prince's Golf Club, Sandwich|Prince's]]. The town is also home to many educational and cultural events. Sandwich also gave its name to [[Sandwich|the food]] by way of [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]], and the word ''sandwich'' is now found in several languages.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe place-name 'Sandwich' is first attested in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', where it appears as ''{{lang|ang|Sondwic}}'' in 851 and ''{{lang|ang|Sandwic}}'' in 993. In the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' of 1086 it appears as ''{{lang|ang|Sandwice}}''. The name ''-wich'' comes from the Anglo Saxon ''{{lang|ang|-w\u012bc}}'', meaning a dwelling or fortified place where trade takes place. The name means \"market town on sandy soil\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.404.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sandwich, town bridge (detail) - geograph.org.uk - 650895.jpg|thumb|The [[Sandwich Toll Bridge]], showing the town's coat of arms]]\nBefore Sandwich became a [[Cinque Port]], the ancient [[Saxon]] town of Stonar on the bank of the [[Wantsum Channel|Wantsum estuary]], but on the opposite side of the mouth of the [[River Stour, Kent|River Stour]], was already well established. It remained a place of considerable importance but it disappeared almost without trace in the 14th century. The ruins of the major Roman fort of [[Richborough]] are close by. It was the landing place of the [[Roman invasion of Britain]] in AD 43.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/7648033.stm |title=Dig uncovers Roman invasion coast |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=2 October 2008 }}</ref>  In 2008, an archaeological dig proved that this was a defensive site of a Roman beachhead, protecting 700 metres of coast.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/roman-invasion-beach-found-in-kent-949717.html |title=Roman invasion beach found in Kent: Archaeologists unearth landing point of legions \u2013 only now it's two miles from the coast |work=[[The Independent]] |date=2 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1028 King [[Canute]] ({{circa|995}}\u20131035) granted a charter to the monks of [[Christ Church, Canterbury]], to operate a ferry across the river and collect tolls. In 1192, returning from the [[Third Crusade]], [[Richard I|Richard the Lionheart]] was jailed by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]]. Henry released Richard in February 1194. On 13 March 1194, Richard landed at the port of Sandwich and came back to England.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Richard I |last=Gillingham |first=John |year=2000 |isbn=0300094043 |page=251 }}</ref> On 21 May 1216, Prince [[Louis VIII of France|Louis of France]] landed at Sandwich in support of the [[First Barons' War]] against [[John, King of England|King John]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Key Magna Carta Battles, 1214\u20131267 |url=http://magnacarta800th.com/history-of-the-magna-carta/key-magna-carta-locations-1214-1267/ |publisher=Magna Carta 800th Committee |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707025815/http://magnacarta800th.com/history-of-the-magna-carta/key-magna-carta-locations-1214-1267/ |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 July 2013 |archivedate=7 July 2014 }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=May 2017}} The [[Battle of Sandwich (1217)|Battle of Sandwich]] occurred just off the coast in 1217.\n\nThe Port of Sandwich is no stranger to odd events in English history. It was here that the first captive [[elephant]] was landed in England by the emperor Claudius.<ref>See the [[history of elephants in Europe]]</ref> Later another elephant was landed here, in 1255. The prize beast arrived at Sandwich quayside, delivered as a gift to the English monarch [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] from the French king, and was then taken on foot to the king's menagerie in the [[Tower of London]]. The journey through [[Kent]] is reported to have proceeded without incident, except when a bull in a field by the roadside took umbrage at the great beast passing and attacked it. In one move, the animal was thrown by the elephant and killed outright.<ref name=Hidden>{{cite book |first=Alan |last=Major |year=1994 |title=Hidden Kent |publisher=Countryside Books |isbn=1-85306-295-2 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fishergate, Sandwich - geograph.org.uk - 1569.jpg|thumb|left|The Fisher Gate]]\nThe Fisher Gate on the quay dates from 1384, and has been scheduled as an [[Scheduled Ancient Monument|Ancient Monument]].

A force of around 4,000 men from [[Honfleur]], under the command of [[Pierre de Br\u00e9z\u00e9]], [[Marshal of France]], came ashore to pillage the town, in the process murdering the mayor, John Drury. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe in mourning for this ignoble deed.\n\nSandwich later gained significantly from the skills brought to the town by many [[Flanders|Flemish]] settlers, who were granted the right to settle by [[letters patent]] from [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], dated 6 July 1561.<ref>F.W. Cross, \"History of the Walloon and Huguenot Church at Canterbury.\" In: ''Publications of the Huguenot Society of London'', 15 (1898), p. 13.</ref> Sandwich was the only town in England that housed more so-called \"strangers\" than native Englishmen in the 16th century. Historian Marcel Backhouse estimated there were at least 2,400 Flemish and 500 [[Wallonia|Walloon]] exiles living in Sandwich at the time.<ref>M. Backhouse, ''The Flemish and Walloon Communities at Sandwich during the Reign of Elizabeth I (1561-1603)'', Brussels: Paleis der Academie\u00ebn, 1995, pp. 32-34.</ref> These settlers brought with them techniques of market gardening, and were responsible for growing the first English [[celery]], which was already and still very popular in Flanders. Elizabeth I granted 25 Flemish families permission to live in Sandwich, and St Peter became the \"Stranger's Church\" in 1564 when the plague came to the town, in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. The 1661 tower collapse was repaired by the Flemish community, and the distinctive tower reflects their work. The [[Huguenot]] refugees also brought over Flemish architectural techniques, that are now as much a part of Kent as the thatched cottage. One can still see the difference between the English (lower section) and Flemish (upper section) of the tower. In addition techniques of [[silk]] manufacture were imported, enhancing the Kent cloth industry.\n\nThe coat of arms of Sandwich is blazoned ''Per pale Gules and Azure three demi-Lions passant guardant in pale Or conjoined with as many sterns of demi-Ships Argent'';<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/weald_downs.html |title=Sandwich Town Council |work=Civic Heraldry of England }}</ref> see photo. It is one of the earliest heraldic examples of [[dimidiation]], an early method of combining two different coats of arms: in this case the [[Royal Arms of England]] (1198\u20131340), ''Gules three lions passant guardant Or langued and armed Azure'', and the Arms of the Cinque Ports, ''Azure three ships Or''. The title [[Earl of Sandwich]] was created in 1660 for the prominent naval commander Admiral [[Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich|Sir Edward Montagu]] (1625\u201372).\n\n[[File:Sandwich kent map1945.jpg|thumb|right|A map of Sandwich from 1945]]\nIn 1759, [[Thomas Paine]] (1737\u20131809) had his home and shop in a house at 20 New Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.open-sandwich.co.uk/town_history/scrapbook/thomas_paine.htm |title=Thomas Paine |work=Sandwich People & History |publisher=Open Sandwich |accessdate=2 April 2010 }}</ref> The house is now marked with a plaque and is a listed building.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1069586 |desc=20 and 22 New Street |accessdate=2 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 1912 Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]] (1869\u20131944) built [[The Salutation, Sandwich|The Salutation]] in [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne style]].

As the story goes, he was an avid gambler, and since he often did not have time to sit for a meal due to his gambling habits, he would order his valet to bring him meat tucked between two pieces of bread. Because Montagu was the Earl of Sandwich, others{{who|date=June 2012}} began to order \"the same as Sandwich!\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whatscookingamerica.net/History/SandwichHistory.htm|title=Sandwich History|first=Linda|last=Stradley|date=20 May 2015|website=What's Cooking America}}</ref> However, the exact circumstances of the invention are still the subject of debate. A rumour in a contemporary travel book called ''Tour to London'' by Pierre Jean Grosley (although not confirmed) formed the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the [[gambling]] table.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faktoider.nu/sandwich_eng.html|title=Hexmaster's Factoids: Sandwich|website=www.faktoider.nu}}</ref> An alternative suggestion by Sandwich's biographer, [[N.

Free newspapers for the town include the ''Dover Extra'', part of the KM Group; and ''yoursandwich'', part of [[KOS Media]].\n\n===Radio===\nThe local radio station for Sandwich is [[KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country]], although the town has good coverage of [[KMFM Thanet]]. Sandwich is also served by the county-wide stations [[Heart Kent|Heart]], [[Gold (radio)|Gold]] and [[BBC Radio Kent]].

The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.\n\n== Preventive conservation ==\nProper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock's sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.\n\n=== Horological Conservation History ===\n[[File:L Ancient-egyptian-sundial.jpg|thumb|World's oldest Sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC).

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> \n:c. '''Unsuitable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n:d. '''Improper cleaning and polishing'''\n:Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> \n:e. '''Improper lubrication'''\n:Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n=== Natural causes ===\n\n:a. '''Humidity and temperature'''\n:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON /> \n:b. '''Pests'''\n:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n:c. '''Light'''\n:Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:d. '''Contaminants'''\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\n:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\n=== Types of clock damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=http://www.conservationregister.com/PIcon-CareClocks.asp|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right.

[[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006). Care and Conservation of Clocks. Retrieved from: \thttps://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf </ref>. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> \n:c. '''Unsuitable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n:d. '''Improper cleaning and polishing'''\n:Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> \n:e. '''Improper lubrication'''\n:Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n=== Natural causes ===\n\n:a. '''Humidity and temperature'''\n:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON /> \n:b. '''Pests'''\n:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n:c.

The [[Spire (mollusc)|spire]] is composed of six slightly convex [[Whorl (mollusc)|whorl]]s, somewhat flattened at their upper part, ornamented with longitudinal, spinous folds. The [[body whorl]] supports two or three rows of spinous, distant tubercles. Besides, the whole shell is crossed by pretty fine, transverse striae, more apparent towards the base. The [[Aperture (mollusc)|aperture]] is sub-rounded. The outer [[Lip (gastropod)|lip]] is margined externally, and striated internally. The color of this shell is grayish, with irregular transverse bands of a slate or violet color. The tubercles are sometimes white, and often brown lines cross them. \n<ref name=\"Kiener\">[https://archive.org/details/generalspeciesic00kien Kiener (1840).
