Her debut single \"[[Legend of a Cowgirl]]\" reached the top 40 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1997. Her debut album, ''[[Chupacabra (album)|Chupacabra]]'', released by [[Columbia Records]], was praised by critics and appeared on the US [[Heatseekers Albums]] chart. In 2001, Coppola appeared as a guest artist on the Baha Men single \"[[You All Dat]]\", which broke the top 10 in Australia and gave Coppola her second entry on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 to date.\n\nCoppola released several independently-recorded albums in the early 2000s as well as starring in the musical film The Singing Biologist, where she wrote the music for the movie. In 2007, she was signed to [[Ipecac Records]], and the same year released ''[[The Black & White Album]]''. The album was met with favorable reviews from music critics and marked a comeback for Coppola. The following year, she formed the pop/R&B duo [[Little Jackie]] with programmer [[Adam Pallin]]. Their debut single, \"[[The World Should Revolve Around Me]]\", reached the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The song was used as the theme for the [[VH1]] reality TV series ''[[New York Goes to Hollywood]]'', and peaked at number 90 on the ''Billboard'' [[Pop 100]] airplay chart. The duo's debut album, ''[[The Stoop (album)|The Stoop]]'', was released by [[S-Curve Records|S-Curve]] in 2008, though it peaked outside of the top 100 in the United Kingdom, and the duo were dropped from the label. Following ''The Stoop'', Coppola released two more solo records: ''The Glass Wall'', in 2012, and ''Hypocrites'', in 2017.

Imani Coppola  profile] ''TV Tropes''</ref> is an American singer-songwriter and violinist. Her debut single \"[[Legend of a Cowgirl]]\" reached the top 40 on the ''Billboard'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 1997. Her debut album, ''[[Chupacabra (album)|Chupacabra]]'', released by [[Columbia Records]], was praised by critics and appeared on the US [[Heatseekers Albums]] chart. In 2001, Coppola appeared as a guest artist on the Baha Men single \"[[You All Dat]]\", which broke the top 10 in Australia and gave Coppola her second entry on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 to date.\n\nCoppola released several independently-recorded albums in the early 2000s as well as starring in the musical film The Singing Biologist, where she wrote the music for the movie. In 2007, she was signed to [[Ipecac Records]], and the same year released ''[[The Black & White Album]]''. The album was met with favorable reviews from music critics and marked a comeback for Coppola. The following year, she formed the pop/R&B duo [[Little Jackie]] with programmer [[Adam Pallin]]. Their debut single, \"[[The World Should Revolve Around Me]]\", reached the top 40 in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The song was used as the theme for the [[VH1]] reality TV series ''[[New York Goes to Hollywood]]'', and peaked at number 90 on the ''Billboard'' [[Pop 100]] airplay chart. The duo's debut album, ''[[The Stoop (album)|The Stoop]]'', was released by [[S-Curve Records|S-Curve]] in 2008, though it peaked outside of the top 100 in the United Kingdom, and the duo were dropped from the label. Following ''The Stoop'', Coppola released two more solo records: ''The Glass Wall'', in 2012, and ''Hypocrites'', in 2017. In addition to her solo work, Coppola has recorded two further albums as part of Little Jackie: ''[[Made4TV]]'', in 2011, and ''[[Queen of Prospect Park]]'', in 2014.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nCoppola grew up as the second-youngest of five children in [[Long Island]], New York.<ref name=\"PCOLLatimes\">{{cite web|last1=Gardner|first1=Elysa|title=She's a Rainbow|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/25/entertainment/ca-11775|website=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>  Coppola's lower-income family, headed by an African-American mother and Italian father,<ref name=PCOLGracenote>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracenote.com/search/artist.php?contributor_id=4175 |title=Gracenote. \"Imani Coppola Biography\" |publisher=Gracenote.com |date=1978-04-14 |accessdate=2010-05-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202160451/http://www.gracenote.com/search/artist.php?contributor_id=4175 |archivedate=February 2, 2009 }}</ref> did not fit in, and she and her family were picked on.<ref name=PCOLDailynews>Los Angeles Daily News.  \"Singer-Rapper Coppola takes her shot\" by Fred Shuster.

Between 1964 and 1969, he served, variously, as the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] correspondent, [[managing editor]], and editor-in-chief of ''[[Ramparts Magazine|Ramparts]]'' magazine in San Francisco.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Bomb in Every Issue: How the Short, Unruly Life of Ramparts Magazine Changed America|last=Richardson|first=Peter|publisher=The New Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1595585462|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> Scheer reported from [[Cambodia]], China, [[North Korea]], Russia, [[Latin America]] and the Middle East (including the [[Six-Day War]]), as well as on [[national security]] matters in the United States. While in Cuba, where he interviewed [[Fidel Castro]], Scheer obtained an introduction by the Cuban leader for the diary of [[Che Guevara]] \u2014 which Scheer had already obtained, with the help of French journalist [[Michele Ray]], for publication in ''Ramparts'' and by [[Bantam Books]]. After ''Ramparts'' collapsed, Scheer became a freelance writer who was published in major magazines including ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Lear's]]'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.\n\n==Congressional Run==\nIn the late 1960s, Scheer made a bid for elective office as an anti-Vietnam War candidate. He challenged U.S. Representative [[Jeffrey Cohelan]] in the 1966 Democratic primary. Cohelan was a liberal, but like most Democratic officeholders at that time, he supported the Vietnam War. Scheer lost, but won over 45% of the vote (and carried Berkeley), a strong enough showing against an incumbent that was a sign of New Left Sixties radicalism.\n\nIn 1968, he signed the \"[[Writers and Editors War Tax Protest]]\" pledge, vowing to refuse to pay taxes in protest against the Vietnam War.<ref>\"Writers and Editors War Tax Protest\" January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''</ref>\n\nIn July 1970, Scheer accompanied as a journalist a [[Black Panther Party]] delegation, led by [[Eldridge Cleaver]], who also wrote for ''Ramparts'', to North Korea, China, and Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org/document/114494 |title=Welcoming Message to Eldridge Cleaver, Kathleen Cleaver, and Robert Scheer upon their Arrival in North Korea |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=1970 |website=History and Public Policy Program Digital Archive |publisher=Wilson Center |accessdate=28 October 2013}}</ref> The delegation also contained people from the San Francisco Red Guard, the [[women's liberation movement]], the [[Peace and Freedom Party]], Newsreel, and the Movement for a Democratic Military.\n\nIn the [[1970 United States Senate elections#California|November 1970 California elections]], Scheer ran for the U.S. Senate as the nominee of the Peace and Freedom Party against Republican Senator [[George Murphy]] and Democratic Congressman [[John V. Tunney]]. Scheer received 56,731 votes and lost the election to Tunney.<ref>http://www.peaceandfreedom.org/home/about-us/historical-information/us-senate-candidates</ref>\n\n==''Los Angeles Times'' and Public Radio==\nAfter several years freelancing for magazines, including ''[[New Times (magazine)|New Times]]'' and ''Playboy,'' Scheer joined the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in 1976 as a reporter. There he met Narda Zacchino, a reporter whom he later married in the paper's news room. As a national correspondent for 17 years at the ''LA Times'', he wrote articles and series on diverse topics such as the [[Soviet Union]] during [[glasnost]], the Jews of Los Angeles, arms control, urban crises, national politics and the military, and covered several presidential elections. The ''LA Times'' entered Scheer's work for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] 11 times, and he was a finalist for the Pulitzer national reporting award for a series on the television industry.\n\nAfter Scheer left the ''LA Times'' in 1993, the paper granted him a weekly op-ed column which ran every Tuesday for the next 12 years until it was canceled in 2005. The column now appears in [[Truthdig]] and is distributed nationally by [[Creators Syndicate]]. Scheer is also a [[contributing editor]] for ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine.

After ''Ramparts'' collapsed, Scheer became a freelance writer who was published in major magazines including ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Lear's]]'' and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''.\n\n==Congressional Run==\nIn the late 1960s, Scheer made a bid for elective office as an anti-Vietnam War candidate. He challenged U.S. Representative [[Jeffrey Cohelan]] in the 1966 Democratic primary. Cohelan was a liberal, but like most Democratic officeholders at that time, he supported the Vietnam War.

There he met Narda Zacchino, a reporter whom he later married in the paper's news room. As a national correspondent for 17 years at the ''LA Times'', he wrote articles and series on diverse topics such as the [[Soviet Union]] during [[glasnost]], the Jews of Los Angeles, arms control, urban crises, national politics and the military, and covered several presidential elections. The ''LA Times'' entered Scheer's work for the [[Pulitzer Prize]] 11 times, and he was a finalist for the Pulitzer national reporting award for a series on the television industry.\n\nAfter Scheer left the ''LA Times'' in 1993, the paper granted him a weekly op-ed column which ran every Tuesday for the next 12 years until it was canceled in 2005.

(album)|F.B.I.]]'', standing for Fuck Being Indicted, under Russ Entertainment/[[Relativity Records]]. The Dayton Family was plagued with various legal problems, including Ira being incarcerated soon after release of ''F.B.I.'', which hindered the amount of work the group released.<ref name=\"qanda\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> In 1999, both Ira and Peterson released solo albums.
