Ayrton's 1884 patent was the first of many \u2013 from 1884 until her death, Hertha registered 26 patents: five on mathematical dividers, 13 on arc lamps and electrodes, the rest on the propulsion of air.\n\nIn 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes on electricity at Finsbury Technical College, delivered by [[William Edward Ayrton|Professor William Edward Ayrton]], a pioneer in [[electrical engineering]] and [[physics]] education and a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. On 6 May 1885 she married her former teacher, and thereafter assisted him with experiments in physics and electricity.<ref name=oxdnb/> She also began her own investigation into the characteristics of the electric arc.<ref name=\"IET Ayrton Bio\"/>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem.  In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for ''[[the Electrician]]'', explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE).<ref name=oxdnb/> Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was in 1958.<ref name=oxdnb/> She petitioned to present a paper before the [[Royal Society]] but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] in her stead in 1901.<ref name=Ogilvie/> Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc.<ref name=\"IET Ayrton Bio\"/> By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton's work in the field of [[electrical engineering]] was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900.<ref name=\"JWA Encyc Ayrton\"/> Her success there led the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees.\n\nIn 1902, Ayrton published ''The Electric Arc'', a summary of her research and work on the electric arc, with origins in her earlier articles from ''[[the Electrician]]'' published between 1895 and 1896. With this publication, her contribution to the field of [[electrical engineering]] began to be cemented. However, initially at least, Ayrton was not well received by the more prestigious and traditional scientific societies such as the [[Royal Society]]. In the aftermath of the publication of ''The Electric Arc'', Ayrton was proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society by renowned electrical engineer [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] in 1902.

In 1909 Ayrton opened the second day of the Knightsbridge \"Women's Exhibition and Sale of Work in the Colours\" which included new model bicycles painted in purple, white and green and raised from 50 stalls and tea etc. \u00a35,664 for the movement.<ref name=\":0\" /> Ayrton was with the delegation that went with [[Emmeline Pankhurst|Mrs Emily Pankhurst]] to see the Prime Minister and met his private secretary instead on 18 November 1910 ([[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]]). Ayrton permitted [[Christabel Pankhurst]] to transfer sums to her bank account to avoid confiscation in 1912, and hosted Mrs Pankhurst in times of recovery from imprisonment and force feeding. One attempt to re-arrest Mrs Pankhurst on 29 April 1913 to continue her sentence, was driven back by suffragettes picketing outside, but Mrs Pankhurst was eventually re-arrested outside Ayrton's home on her way to the funeral of [[Emily Davison]] (who was killed after running in front of the King's horse at the Derby).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Rise up, women! : the remarkable lives of the suffragettes|last=Diane|first=Atkinson|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2018|isbn=9781408844045|location=London|pages=146, 222, 314, 404, 525|oclc=1016848621}}</ref>\n\nAyrton was a close friend of the scientist [[Marie Curie]], and she gave her daughter, [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie|Ir\u00e8ne Curie]], Mathematics lessons.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=A lab of one's own : science and suffrage in the first World War|last=Fara |first=Patricia|publisher=|year=2018|isbn=9780198794981|edition=First|location=Oxford, United Kingdom|pages=67|oclc=989049156}}</ref> Although Curie typically opted to withhold her name from any petitions, Ayrton managed to persuade her to sign a protest against the imprisonment of suffragettes through her daughter.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIt was through suffrage activism, she met suffragist and co-founder of Cambridge's [[Girton College, Cambridge|Girton College]], [[Barbara Bodichon]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Out of the shadows : contributions of twentieth-century women to physics|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Byers, Nina., Williams, Gary A.|isbn=978-0521821971|location=Cambridge, UK|oclc=62891583|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/outofshadowscont0000unse}}</ref> Bodichon helped make it financially possible to attend Girton, and would go on to financially support Ayrton throughout her education and career including by bequeathing her estate to Ayrton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cwp.library.ucla.edu/articles/ayrton/ayrtonbio.html|title=Hertha Marks Ayrton|website=cwp.library.ucla.edu|access-date=2018-05-12}}</ref>\n\n== Later life and research ==\n\nAyrton delivered seven papers before the Royal Society between 1901 and 1926, the last posthumously.\n<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Primary and secondary vortices in oscillating fluids: their connection with skin friction\n| last = Ayrton | first = the late Mrs. H.\n| journal = Proc.

Ayrton's 1884 patent was the first of many \u2013 from 1884 until her death, Hertha registered 26 patents: five on mathematical dividers, 13 on arc lamps and electrodes, the rest on the propulsion of air.\n\nIn 1884 Ayrton began attending evening classes on electricity at Finsbury Technical College, delivered by [[William Edward Ayrton|Professor William Edward Ayrton]], a pioneer in [[electrical engineering]] and [[physics]] education and a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. On 6 May 1885 she married her former teacher, and thereafter assisted him with experiments in physics and electricity.<ref name=oxdnb/> She also began her own investigation into the characteristics of the electric arc.<ref name=\"IET Ayrton Bio\"/>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, electric [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] was in wide use for public lighting. The tendency of electric arcs to flicker and hiss was a major problem.  In 1895, Hertha Ayrton wrote a series of articles for ''[[the Electrician]]'', explaining that these phenomena were the result of oxygen coming into contact with the carbon rods used to create the arc. In 1899, she was the first woman ever to read her own paper before the [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]] (IEE).<ref name=oxdnb/> Her paper was entitled \"The Hissing of the Electric Arc\". Shortly thereafter, Ayrton was elected the first female member of the IEE; the next woman to be admitted to the IEE was in 1958.<ref name=oxdnb/> She petitioned to present a paper before the [[Royal Society]] but was not allowed because of her sex and \"The Mechanism of the Electric Arc\" was read by [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] in her stead in 1901.<ref name=Ogilvie/> Ayrton was also the first woman to win a prize from the Society, the Hughes Medal, awarded to her in 1906 in honour of her research on the motion of ripples in sand and water and her work on the electric arc.<ref name=\"IET Ayrton Bio\"/> By the late nineteenth century, Ayrton's work in the field of [[electrical engineering]] was recognised more widely, domestically and internationally. At the International Congress of Women held in London in 1899, she presided over the physical science section. Ayrton also spoke at the International Electrical Congress in Paris in 1900.<ref name=\"JWA Encyc Ayrton\"/> Her success there led the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] to allow women to serve on general and sectional committees.\n\nIn 1902, Ayrton published ''The Electric Arc'', a summary of her research and work on the electric arc, with origins in her earlier articles from ''[[the Electrician]]'' published between 1895 and 1896. With this publication, her contribution to the field of [[electrical engineering]] began to be cemented. However, initially at least, Ayrton was not well received by the more prestigious and traditional scientific societies such as the [[Royal Society]]. In the aftermath of the publication of ''The Electric Arc'', Ayrton was proposed as a Fellow of the Royal Society by renowned electrical engineer [[John Perry (engineer)|John Perry]] in 1902.

{"title_page": "Social media optimization", "text_new": "{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{Internet Marketing}}\n\n'''Social media optimization''' ('''SMO''') is the use of a number of outlets and communities to generate publicity to increase the awareness of a product, service brand or event. Types of social media involved include [[RSS feed]]s, [[Social bookmarking|social news and bookmarking sites]], as well as [[social networking site]]s, such as [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]],[[Twitter]], [[video sharing website]]s and [[blog]]ging sites. SMO is similar to [[search engine optimization]], in that the goal is to generate web traffic and increase awareness for a website. In general, social media optimization refers to optimizing a website and its content to encourage more users to use and share links to the [[website]] across social media and networking sites. SMO also refers to software tools that automate this process, or to website experts who undertake this process for clients.\n\nThe goal of SMO is to strategically create interesting online content, ranging from well-written text to eye-catching digital photos or video clips that encourages and entices people to engage with a website and then share this content, via its weblink, with their social media contacts and friends. Common examples of social media engagement are \"liking and commenting on posts, retweeting, embedding, sharing, and promoting content\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Win the game of Google-opoly: Unlocking the secret strategy of search engines|last = Bradley|first = S.

Publishers such as ''[[The Economist]]'' employ large social media teams to optimise their online posts and maximise traffic,<ref name=Preston>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/31/print-still-has-a-future-le-monde-aux-armes|title=Print still has a future, and Le Monde can prove it.

As search engines are increasingly utilizing the recommendations of users of social networks such as [[Reddit]], [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Pinterest]], [[Instagram]] to rank pages in the [[search engine result page]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/seo/why-search-engine-optimization/|title=Search the Daily Egg\n8 Reasons Why Your Website Needs Search Engine Optimization|last=|first=|date=|website=The Daily Egg|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=19/4/2020}}</ref> The implication is that when a webpage is shared or \"liked\" by a user on a social network, it counts as a \"vote\" for that webpage's quality. Thus, search engines can use such votes accordingly to properly ranked websites in search engine results pages. Furthermore, since it is more difficult to top the scales or influence the search engines in this way, search engines are putting more stock into social search.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2066668/Search-Engine-Optimization-in-an-Increasingly-Social-World|title=Search Engine Optimization in an Increasingly Social World|last=Enge|first=Eric|date=30 November 2010|publisher=Search Engine Watch|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>  This, coupled with increasingly [[personalized search]] based on interests and location, has significantly increased the importance of a social media presence in search engine optimization.  Due to personalized search results, location-based social media presences on websites such as [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], [[Google Places]], [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], and [[Yahoo! Local]] have become increasingly important. While social media optimization is related to [[search engine marketing]], it differs in several ways.  Primarily, SMO focuses on driving web traffic from sources ''other'' than search engines, though improved search engine ranking is also a benefit of successful social media optimization. Further, SMO is helpful to target particular geographic regions in order to target and reach potential customers. This helps in lead generation (finding new customers) and contributes to high conversion rates (i.e., converting previously uninterested individuals into people who are interested in a brand or organization).\n\n==Relationship with viral marketing==\nSocial media optimization is in many ways connected to the technique of [[viral marketing]] or \"viral seeding\" where [[word of mouth]] is created through the use of networking in [[social bookmarking]], [[video sharing|video]] and [[photo sharing]] websites.  An effective SMO campaign can harness the power of viral marketing; for example, 80% of activity on [[Pinterest]] is generated through \"repinning.\"{{cn|date=March 2020}} Furthermore, by following [[Lifestyle trends and media|social trends]] and utilizing alternative social networks, websites can retain existing followers while also attracting new ones. This allows businesses to build an online following and presence, all linking back to the company's website for increased traffic. For example, with an effective [[social bookmarking]] campaign, not only can website traffic be increased, but a site's rankings can also be increased. In a similar way, the engagement with [[blogs]] creates a similar result by sharing content through the use of [[RSS]] in the [[blogosphere]] and special blog search engines. Social media optimization is considered an integral part of an [[online reputation management]] (ORM) or search engine reputation management (SERM) strategy for organizations or individuals who care about their online presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/steve-cody/7-reasons-you-need-manage-your-online-presence-more-carefully.html|title=7 Reasons You Need to Manage Your Online Presence More Carefully|last=Cody|first=Steve|date=18 April 2014|publisher=Inc.com|accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref> SMO is one of six key influencers that affect Social Commerce Construct (SCC).\u00a0Online activities such as consumers' evaluations and advices on products and services constitute part of what creates a Social Commerce Construct (SCC).<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=C.H.|date=2020|title=Generation Difference of Post-90s in the Context of the Rise of Social Commerce.|url=http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/AMAE/Vol%2010_1_2.pdf|journal=Scientific Press International Limited|volume=10|pages=15\u201333|via=}}</ref>\n\nSocial media optimization is not limited to marketing and brand building.  Increasingly, smart businesses are integrating social media participation as part of their knowledge management strategy (i.e., product/service development, recruiting, [[employee engagement]] and turnover, brand building, customer satisfaction and relations, business development and more).  Additionally, social media optimization can be implemented to foster a community of the associated site, allowing for a healthy business-to-consumer (B2C) relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/big-ideas/042213-mchaturvedi-1937903.html|title=Effective Social Media Strategies \u2013 Four Tips, Four Benefits|last=Chaturvedi|first=Madhur|date=22 April 2013|publisher=Oracle.com|accessdate=2016-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and implementation==\nAccording to technologist [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]], the term \"social media optimization\" was first used and described by marketer Rohit Bhargava<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060829-150053 |publisher=blog.searchenginewatch.com |date=August 29, 2006 |title=Social Media Optimization: It's Like SEO, For Social Sites |accessdate=2007-09-06 |author=Sullivan, Danny |authorlink=Danny Sullivan (technologist) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820112850/http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060829-150053 |archivedate=August 20, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/introduction-to-social-media-optimization/182/|title=Introduction to Social Media Optimization|last=Olthuis|first=Cameron|date=15 August 2006|publisher=Search Engine Journal|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref> on his marketing blog in August 2006. In the same post, Bhargava established the five important rules of social media optimization. Bhargava believed that by following his rules, anyone could influence the levels of traffic and engagement on their site, increase popularity, and ensure that it ranks highly in search engine results. An additional 11 SMO rules have since been added to the list by other marketing contributors.\n\nThe 16 rules of SMO, according to one source, are as follows:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Paid, owned, earned: Maximising marketing returns in a socially connected world.|last = Burcher|first = N|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2012|isbn =9780749465636|location = London|pages = 104\u2013105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQnp-duPmbMC&pg=PR7&dq=%22Paid,+owned,+earned:+Maximising+marketing+returns+in+a+socially+connected+world%22#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20media%20optimization%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\n# Increase your linkability\n# Make tagging and bookmarking easy\n# Reward inbound links\n# Help your content to \"travel\" via sharing\n# Encourage the mashup, where users are allowed to remix content\n# Be a user resource, even if it doesn't help you (e.g., provide resources and information for users)\n# Reward helpful and valuable users\n# Participate (join the online conversation)\n# Know how to target your audience\n# Create new, quality content (\"[[web scraping]]\" of existing online content is ignored by good search engines)\n# Be \"real\" in the tone and style of the posts\n# Don't forget your roots; be humble\n# Don't be afraid to experiment, innovate, try new things and \"stay fresh\"\n# Develop an SMO strategy\n# Choose your SMO tactics wisely\n# Make SMO a key part of your marketing process and develop company [[best practice]]s\n\nBhargava's initial five rules were more specifically designed to SMO, while the list is now much broader and addresses everything that can be done across different social media platforms. According to author and CEO of TopRank Online Marketing, Lee Odden, a Social Media Strategy is also necessary to ensure optimization. This is a similar concept to Bhargava's list of rules for SMO.\n\nThe Social Media Strategy may consider:<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Optimize: How to attract and engage more customers by integrating SEO, social media, and content marketing.|last = Odden|first = L|publisher = Wiley|year = 2012|isbn =|location = NJ|pages =|url=https://archive.org/details/optimizehowtoatt0000odde|url-access = registration|quote = Social media optimization.}}</ref>\n\n#   Objectives e.g. creating brand awareness and using social media for external communications.\n#   Listening e.g. monitoring conversations relating to customers and business objectives.\n#   Audience e.g. finding out who the customers are, what they do, who they are influenced by, and what they frequently talk about. It is important to work out what customers want in exchange for their online engagement and attention.\n#   Participation and content e.g. establishing a presence and community online and engaging with users by sharing useful and interesting information.\n#   Measurement e.g. keeping a record of likes and comments on posts, and the number of sales to monitor growth and determine which tactics are most useful in optimizing social media.\n\nAccording to Lon Safko and David K. Brake in ''The Social Media Bible'', it is also important to act like a [[publisher]] by maintaining an effective organisational strategy, to have an original concept and unique \"edge\" that differentiates one's approach from competitors, and to experiment with new ideas if things do not work the first time.<ref name=\":0\" /> If a business is blog-based, an effective method of SMO is using widgets that allow users to share content to their personal social media platforms. This will ultimately reach a wider target audience and drive more traffic to the original post. Blog widgets and plug-ins for post-sharing are most commonly linked to Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, and Twitter. They occasionally also link to social media platforms such as StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and Pinterest.

There are three commonly used strategies to increase advertising reach on Facebook:\n\n# ''Improving the effectiveness of posts, achieved by adjusting the length and timing of posts to influence the number of likes and comments it receives. This will help the post reach a greater number of Facebook users, ultimately increasing its reach.''\n# ''Increasing network size, achieved by analyzing user behavior to determine how often to post and what type of content to post.''\n# ''Buying more reach, achieved by paying Facebook to advertise a post.''\n\nImproving effectiveness and increasing network size are organic approaches, while buying more reach is a paid approach which does not require any further action.<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Ballings|first = Michel|last2 = Van den Poel|first2 = Dirk|last3 = Bogaert|first3 = Matthias|date = 2016-03-01|title = Social media optimization: Identifying an optimal strategy for increasing network size on Facebook|journal = Omega|series = Business Analytics|volume = 59, Part A|pages = 15\u201325|doi = 10.1016/j.omega.2015.04.017}}</ref> Most businesses will attempt an \"organic\" approach to gaining a significant following before considering a paid approach. Because Facebook requires a login, it is important that posts are public to ensure they will reach the widest possible audience. Posts that have been heavily shared and interacted with by users are displayed as 'highlighted posts' at the top of newsfeeds. In order to achieve this status, the posts need to be engaging, interesting, or useful. This can be achieved by being spontaneous, asking questions, addressing current events and issues, and optimizing trending hashtags and keywords. The more engagement a post receives, the further it will spread and the more likely it is to feature on first in search results.\n\nAnother organic approach to Facebook optimization is cross-linking different social platforms. By posting links to websites or social media sites in the profile 'about' section, it is possible to direct traffic and ultimately increase search engine optimization. Another option is to share links to relevant videos and blog posts.<ref name=\":2\" /> Facebook Connect is a functionality that launched in 2008 to allow Facebook users to sign up to different websites, enter competitions, and access exclusive promotions by logging in with their existing Facebook account details. This is beneficial to users as they don't have to create a new login every time they want to sign up to a website, but also beneficial to businesses as Facebook users become more likely to share their content. Often the two are interlinked, where in order to access parts of a website, a user has to like or share certain things on their personal profile or invite a number of friends to like a page. This can lead to greater traffic flow to a website as it reaches a wider audience. Businesses have more opportunities to reach their target markets if they choose a paid approach to SMO. When Facebook users create an account, they are urged to fill out their personal details such as gender, age, location, education, current and previous employers, religious and political views, interests, and personal preferences such as movie and music tastes. Facebook then takes this information and allows advertisers to use it to determine how to best market themselves to users that they know will be interested in their product. This can also be known as micro-targeting. If a user clicks on a link to like a page, it will show up on their profile and newsfeed. This then feeds back into organic social media optimization, as friends of the user will see this and be encouraged to click on the page themselves. Although advertisers are buying mass reach, they are attracting a customer base with a genuine interest in their product. Once a customer base has been established through a paid approach, businesses will often run promotions and competitions to attract more organic followers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe number of businesses that use Facebook to advertise also holds significant relevance.

Types of social media involved include [[RSS feed]]s, [[Social bookmarking|social news and bookmarking sites]], as well as [[social networking site]]s, such as [[Facebook]], [[Instagram]],[[Twitter]], [[video sharing website]]s and [[blog]]ging sites. SMO is similar to [[search engine optimization]], in that the goal is to generate web traffic and increase awareness for a website. In general, social media optimization refers to optimizing a website and its content to encourage more users to use and share links to the [[website]] across social media and networking sites. SMO also refers to software tools that automate this process, or to website experts who undertake this process for clients.\n\nThe goal of SMO is to strategically create interesting online content, ranging from well-written text to eye-catching digital photos or video clips that encourages and entices people to engage with a website and then share this content, via its weblink, with their social media contacts and friends. Common examples of social media engagement are \"liking and commenting on posts, retweeting, embedding, sharing, and promoting content\".<ref>{{Cite book|title = Win the game of Google-opoly: Unlocking the secret strategy of search engines|last = Bradley|first = S.

Publishers such as ''[[The Economist]]'' employ large social media teams to optimise their online posts and maximise traffic,<ref name=Preston>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/31/print-still-has-a-future-le-monde-aux-armes|title=Print still has a future, and Le Monde can prove it.

As search engines are increasingly utilizing the recommendations of users of social networks such as [[Reddit]], [[Facebook]], [[Tumblr]], [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Pinterest]], [[Instagram]] to rank pages in the [[search engine result page]]s.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2017}} The implication is that when a webpage is shared or \"liked\" by a user on a social network, it counts as a \"vote\" for that webpage's quality. Thus, search engines can use such votes accordingly to properly ranked websites in search engine results pages. Furthermore, since it is more difficult to top the scales or influence the search engines in this way, search engines are putting more stock into social search.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2066668/Search-Engine-Optimization-in-an-Increasingly-Social-World|title=Search Engine Optimization in an Increasingly Social World|last=Enge|first=Eric|date=30 November 2010|publisher=Search Engine Watch|accessdate=17 July 2012}}</ref>  This, coupled with increasingly [[personalized search]] based on interests and location, has significantly increased the importance of a social media presence in search engine optimization.  Due to personalized search results, location-based social media presences on websites such as [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], [[Google Places]], [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], and [[Yahoo! Local]] have become increasingly important. While social media optimization is related to [[search engine marketing]], it differs in several ways.  Primarily, SMO focuses on driving web traffic from sources ''other'' than search engines, though improved search engine ranking is also a benefit of successful social media optimization. Further, SMO is helpful to target particular geographic regions in order to target and reach potential customers. This helps in lead generation (finding new customers) and contributes to high conversion rates (i.e., converting previously uninterested individuals into people who are interested in a brand or organization).\n\n==Relationship with viral marketing==\nSocial media optimization is in many ways connected to the technique of [[viral marketing]] or \"viral seeding\" where [[word of mouth]] is created through the use of networking in [[social bookmarking]], [[video sharing|video]] and [[photo sharing]] websites.  An effective SMO campaign can harness the power of viral marketing; for example, 80% of activity on [[Pinterest]] is generated through \"repinning.\"{{cn|date=March 2020}} Furthermore, by following [[Lifestyle trends and media|social trends]] and utilizing alternative social networks, websites can retain existing followers while also attracting new ones. This allows businesses to build an online following and presence, all linking back to the company's website for increased traffic. For example, with an effective [[social bookmarking]] campaign, not only can website traffic be increased, but a site's rankings can also be increased. In a similar way, the engagement with [[blogs]] creates a similar result by sharing content through the use of [[RSS]] in the [[blogosphere]] and special blog search engines. Social media optimization is considered an integral part of an [[online reputation management]] (ORM) or search engine reputation management (SERM) strategy for organizations or individuals who care about their online presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inc.com/steve-cody/7-reasons-you-need-manage-your-online-presence-more-carefully.html|title=7 Reasons You Need to Manage Your Online Presence More Carefully|last=Cody|first=Steve|date=18 April 2014|publisher=Inc.com|accessdate=10 February 2016}}</ref> SMO is one of six key influencers that affect Social Commerce Construct (SCC).\u00a0Online activities such as consumers' evaluations and advices on products and services constitute part of what creates a Social Commerce Construct (SCC).<ref name=\":03\">{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=C.H.|date=2020|title=Generation Difference of Post-90s in the Context of the Rise of Social Commerce.|url=http://www.scienpress.com/Upload/AMAE/Vol%2010_1_2.pdf|journal=Scientific Press International Limited|volume=10|pages=15\u201333|via=}}</ref>\n\nSocial media optimization is not limited to marketing and brand building.  Increasingly, smart businesses are integrating social media participation as part of their knowledge management strategy (i.e., product/service development, recruiting, [[employee engagement]] and turnover, brand building, customer satisfaction and relations, business development and more).  Additionally, social media optimization can be implemented to foster a community of the associated site, allowing for a healthy business-to-consumer (B2C) relationship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/profit/big-ideas/042213-mchaturvedi-1937903.html|title=Effective Social Media Strategies \u2013 Four Tips, Four Benefits|last=Chaturvedi|first=Madhur|date=22 April 2013|publisher=Oracle.com|accessdate=2016-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==Origins and implementation==\nAccording to technologist [[Danny Sullivan (technologist)|Danny Sullivan]], the term \"social media optimization\" was first used and described by marketer Rohit Bhargava<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060829-150053 |publisher=blog.searchenginewatch.com |date=August 29, 2006 |title=Social Media Optimization: It's Like SEO, For Social Sites |accessdate=2007-09-06 |author=Sullivan, Danny |authorlink=Danny Sullivan (technologist) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820112850/http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060829-150053 |archivedate=August 20, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.searchenginejournal.com/introduction-to-social-media-optimization/182/|title=Introduction to Social Media Optimization|last=Olthuis|first=Cameron|date=15 August 2006|publisher=Search Engine Journal|accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref> on his marketing blog in August 2006. In the same post, Bhargava established the five important rules of social media optimization. Bhargava believed that by following his rules, anyone could influence the levels of traffic and engagement on their site, increase popularity, and ensure that it ranks highly in search engine results. An additional 11 SMO rules have since been added to the list by other marketing contributors.\n\nThe 16 rules of SMO, according to one source, are as follows:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Paid, owned, earned: Maximising marketing returns in a socially connected world.|last = Burcher|first = N|publisher = Kogan Page|year = 2012|isbn =9780749465636|location = London|pages = 104\u2013105|url=https://books.google.com/?id=QQnp-duPmbMC&pg=PR7&dq=%22Paid,+owned,+earned:+Maximising+marketing+returns+in+a+socially+connected+world%22#v=onepage&q=%22Social%20media%20optimization%22&f=false}}</ref>\n\n# Increase your linkability\n# Make tagging and bookmarking easy\n# Reward inbound links\n# Help your content to \"travel\" via sharing\n# Encourage the mashup, where users are allowed to remix content\n# Be a user resource, even if it doesn't help you (e.g., provide resources and information for users)\n# Reward helpful and valuable users\n# Participate (join the online conversation)\n# Know how to target your audience\n# Create new, quality content (\"[[web scraping]]\" of existing online content is ignored by good search engines)\n# Be \"real\" in the tone and style of the posts\n# Don't forget your roots; be humble\n# Don't be afraid to experiment, innovate, try new things and \"stay fresh\"\n# Develop an SMO strategy\n# Choose your SMO tactics wisely\n# Make SMO a key part of your marketing process and develop company [[best practice]]s\n\nBhargava's initial five rules were more specifically designed to SMO, while the list is now much broader and addresses everything that can be done across different social media platforms. According to author and CEO of TopRank Online Marketing, Lee Odden, a Social Media Strategy is also necessary to ensure optimization. This is a similar concept to Bhargava's list of rules for SMO.\n\nThe Social Media Strategy may consider:<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title = Optimize: How to attract and engage more customers by integrating SEO, social media, and content marketing.|last = Odden|first = L|publisher = Wiley|year = 2012|isbn =|location = NJ|pages =|url=https://archive.org/details/optimizehowtoatt0000odde|url-access = registration|quote = Social media optimization.}}</ref>\n\n#   Objectives e.g. creating brand awareness and using social media for external communications.\n#   Listening e.g. monitoring conversations relating to customers and business objectives.\n#   Audience e.g. finding out who the customers are, what they do, who they are influenced by, and what they frequently talk about. It is important to work out what customers want in exchange for their online engagement and attention.\n#   Participation and content e.g. establishing a presence and community online and engaging with users by sharing useful and interesting information.\n#   Measurement e.g. keeping a record of likes and comments on posts, and the number of sales to monitor growth and determine which tactics are most useful in optimizing social media.\n\nAccording to Lon Safko and David K. Brake in ''The Social Media Bible'', it is also important to act like a [[publisher]] by maintaining an effective organisational strategy, to have an original concept and unique \"edge\" that differentiates one's approach from competitors, and to experiment with new ideas if things do not work the first time.<ref name=\":0\" /> If a business is blog-based, an effective method of SMO is using widgets that allow users to share content to their personal social media platforms. This will ultimately reach a wider target audience and drive more traffic to the original post. Blog widgets and plug-ins for post-sharing are most commonly linked to Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, and Twitter. They occasionally also link to social media platforms such as StumbleUpon, Tumblr, and Pinterest. Many sharing widgets also include user counters which indicate how many times the content has been liked and shared across different social media pages. This can influence whether or not new users will engage with the post, and also gives businesses an idea of what kind of posts are most successful at engaging audiences.

This is claimed proof enough of the association Sangama brothers had with the Hoysala family.<ref name=\"heras\">[[Fr. Henry Heras|Heras]] in Kamath (2001), p159. Heras wrote ''Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagar Empire'', 1927</ref>\n\nAccording to the historians Saletore, P.B. Desai and Henry Heras, the theory of capture of Harihara I and Bukka Raya I by the Sultan of Delhi and conversion to Islam is false and that the testimony of epigraphs proves that the area around [[Hampi]] constituted their homeland. The empire never had a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] origin. The patron saint of the early kings was saint [[Vidyaranya]], the 12th [[Shankaracharya]] of Sringeri in Karnataka, and this is proof enough of their unquestionable identity with the Kannada country.<ref name=\"convert\"/> About the Muslim records that claim a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] origin of Harihara I and Bukka Raya, these historians feel, the records are neither unanimous nor reliable in their claims. In those days of religious rigidity, it is too far-fetched to accept a theory of conversion to Islam and re-conversion to Hinduism while still managing to win the trust and loyalty of Hindu subjects in an hour of impending invasions.<ref name=\"convert\">Desai, Saletore and Henry Heras in Kamath 2001, p158</ref> According to Kamath, the great devotion the founders of the empire had in Lord Chennakeshava of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] and Lord Virupaksha of [[Hampi]] testifies to their origin from Kannada country, though in political and administrative matters, the Vijayanagar kings followed the Hoysala, Kakatiya, Chola framework in the various provincial regions of the empire. The Sangama brothers even signed their Sanskrit records in Kannada (as ''Srivirupaksha'') and  used their Kannada titles even in their Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit records. No Telugu titles were used by them.<ref name=\"numismatic\">Kamath (2001), p159</ref> A popular chieftain and patriot of those times, prince [[Kumara Rama]] of [[Kummata Durga]] or simply [[Kummata| Kummata Durga]] (capital of the tiny [[Kampili|Kampli]] kingdom in [[Bellary District]]) may have been related to Sangama, father of Harihar I. This evidence exists in a literary piece by poet Nanjunda (''Kumara Rama Charita''). According to Kamath, the early Vijayanagar kings raised memorials at Sandur, [[Chitradurga]] and [[Dharwad]] to sing the glory of Kumara Rama's valor and show their continued efforts to build an empire in his legacy. All this proves the matrimonial relations the Sangama family had with the Kummata family.<ref name=\"numismatic\">Kamath (2001), p159</ref>\n\nAiyangar opines that since the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] collapsed about 20 years before the demise of [[Veera Ballala III]] of Hoysala Empire in 1342 CE, and [[Hampi|Hosapattana]] was established as a second capital by Veera Ballala III (which eventually became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire) it would be impossible for Harihara, the founder of fledgling empire to attain such a high position in a short time without having close ties to Hoysala Empire.<ref name=\"swami_aiyengar\">{{Cite book|title=South India and Her Muhammadan Invaders|last=Aiyangar|first=S.

In 1326 AD [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] defeated and killed the king of Kampili. Among those taken prisoner were sons of Sangama, Hakka (Harihara I) and Bukka (Bukka Raya), both treasury officers of Kampili who were forced to convert to Islam. Some years later the brothers were sent back to govern Kampili. In 1336, The brothers laid the foundation of an independent kingdom, denying any subordination to the Tughluqs and became Hindu again.<ref name=\"Hindu\">''Hampi \u2013 A Travel Guide'', 2003, p27</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Suryanath U.

The Kings used titles such as ''Bhashegetappuva rayara ganda'', ''Moorurayaraganda'' and ''Arirayadatta'' which are pure Kannada language titles.

This is claimed proof enough of the association Sangama brothers had with the Hoysala family.<ref name=\"heras\">[[Fr. Henry Heras|Heras]] in Kamath (2001), p159. Heras wrote ''Aravidu Dynasty of Vijayanagar Empire'', 1927</ref>\n\nAccording to the historians Saletore, P.B. Desai and Henry Heras, the theory of capture of Harihara I and Bukka Raya I by the Sultan of Delhi and conversion to Islam is false and that the testimony of epigraphs proves that the area around [[Hampi]] constituted their homeland. The empire never had a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] origin. The patron saint of the early kings was saint [[Vidyaranya]], the 12th [[Shankaracharya]] of Sringeri in Karnataka, and this is proof enough of their unquestionable identity with the Kannada country.<ref name=\"convert\"/> About the Muslim records that claim a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] origin of Harihara I and Bukka Raya, these historians feel, the records are neither unanimous nor reliable in their claims. In those days of religious rigidity, it is too far-fetched to accept a theory of conversion to Islam and re-conversion to Hinduism while still managing to win the trust and loyalty of Hindu subjects in an hour of impending invasions.<ref name=\"convert\">Desai, Saletore and Henry Heras in Kamath 2001, p158</ref> According to Kamath, the great devotion the founders of the empire had in Lord Chennakeshava of [[Belur, Karnataka|Belur]] and Lord Virupaksha of [[Hampi]] testifies to their origin from Kannada country, though in political and administrative matters, the Vijayanagar kings followed the Hoysala, Kakatiya, Chola framework in the various provincial regions of the empire. The Sangama brothers even signed their Sanskrit records in Kannada (as ''Srivirupaksha'') and  used their Kannada titles even in their Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit records. No Telugu titles were used by them.<ref name=\"numismatic\">Kamath (2001), p159</ref> A popular chieftain and patriot of those times, prince [[Kumara Rama]] of [[Kummata Durga]] or simply [[Kummata| Kummata Durga]] (capital of the tiny [[Kampili|Kampli]] kingdom in [[Bellary District]]) may have been related to Sangama, father of Harihar I. This evidence exists in a literary piece by poet Nanjunda (''Kumara Rama Charita''). According to Kamath, the early Vijayanagar kings raised memorials at Sandur, [[Chitradurga]] and [[Dharwad]] to sing the glory of Kumara Rama's valor and show their continued efforts to build an empire in his legacy. All this proves the matrimonial relations the Sangama family had with the Kummata family.<ref name=\"numismatic\">Kamath (2001), p159</ref>\n\nAiyangar opines that since the [[Kakatiya dynasty]] collapsed about 20 years before the demise of [[Veera Ballala III]] of Hoysala Empire in 1342 CE, and [[Hampi|Hosapattana]] was established as a second capital by Veera Ballala III (which eventually became the capital of the Vijayanagara Empire) it would be impossible for Harihara, the founder of fledgling empire to attain such a high position in a short time without having close ties to Hoysala Empire.<ref name=\"swami_aiyengar\">{{Cite book|title=South India and Her Muhammadan Invaders|last=Aiyangar|first=S.

Venkataramanayya, ''The Early Muslim Expansion in South India'', 1942, University of Madras Press, Madras</ref>\n\n==Other theories of origin==\nA popular account says that the Hampi region was part of a [[Kampili]] kingdom in the 14th century when large parts of north India was under Muslim rule. In 1326 AD [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] defeated and killed the king of Kampili. Among those taken prisoner were sons of Sangama, Hakka (Harihara I) and Bukka (Bukka Raya), both treasury officers of Kampili who were forced to convert to Islam. Some years later the brothers were sent back to govern Kampili. In 1336, The brothers laid the foundation of an independent kingdom, denying any subordination to the Tughluqs and became Hindu again.<ref name=\"Hindu\">''Hampi \u2013 A Travel Guide'', 2003, p27</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Suryanath U.
