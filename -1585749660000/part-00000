He was national road champion in 1993 and 1994 and won [[Paris\u2013Tours]] in 1998, the first French winner in 42 years. Durand rode seven Tours de France, finishing last in the 1999 race. In [[1995 Tour de France|1995]] he was the surprise winner of the prologue, starting before it began raining. He wore the [[yellow jersey]] for two days. Durand won the [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]] in the [[1998 Tour de France|1998]] and [[1999 Tour de France]]; the latter year he also took the [[Lanterne Rouge]]. He retired at the end of 2004. He has since worked for [[Eurosport]] as a commentator.\n\n==Amateur career==\nDurand was born to a poor farming family in the Mayenne region of northern France.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 14 July 2000</ref> He started racing in the ''minime'' class, the very youngest, but never won a race there or in the older ''cadet'' category. \"It's difficult to win as a kid when you're neither a climber nor a sprinter,\" he said. \"For me, the most beautiful jersey in the world is the French champion's. Yes, when they play the [[Marseillaise]] for you after a championship and then you go and show it off for three weeks in the Tour de France, the national flag on your shoulders, it's emotion and pleasure every day.\"<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 14 July 2000</ref> As a senior, however, he won the national amateur team time-trial championship in 1988 with Laurent Bezault, Pascal Lino and Thierry Laurent. He turned professional in 1991.\n\n==Lone breaks==\nDurand became celebrated for long, lone attacks which sometimes succeeded but usually didn't. The French magazine, ''V\u00e9lo'', printed a monthly ''Jackym\u00e8tre'' to log the kilometres ridden at the head of races during the course of the season. Durand said: \"Fortunately, in cycling, it's not always the best who wins, otherwise we wouldn't win so often.\"<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref>\n\nHis riding style was encouraged by his first [[directeur sportif]], [[Cyrille Guimard]]. It brought him a seemingly suicidal win in the [[Tour of Flanders]] (''see below''). Guimard told him to attack early in the national championship at Ch\u00e2tellerault in 1993, to try his chance and to spoil those of [[Laurent Brochard]] and [[Luc Leblanc]].<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref> The writer, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Qu\u00e9net, said Guimard told Durand to attack far from the finish \"because he didn't want to see Laurent Brochard in blue, white and red and even less did he want a second consecutive title for Luc Leblanc, who was in disgrace in the Castorama team.\".<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref>\n\nOf the way he rode, Durand said:\n\n:I'm not a revolutionary of any sort, but on the bike, I've always refused to come out of a mould. It astonishes me that most riders are followers, even sheep. A lot of them, the only people who know they're in the Tour are their ''directeurs sportifs''. I couldn't do the job like that. They finish the Tour without having attacked once, maybe the whole of the season, even the whole of their career. I'd rather finish shattered and last having attacked a hundred times than finish 25th without having tried. Yes, I get ragged about it, but it's always in a friendly way. In the bunch, the guys know that ''Dudu'' is as likely to finish a long way behind them as first.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 14 July 2000</ref>\n\n==Tour of Flanders==\nDurand won the Ronde van Vlaanderen, or [[Tour of Flanders]], in 1992, 36 years after the last French winner, [[Jean Forestier]], in 1956. He broke away from the field with [[Thomas Wegm\u00fcller]] after a quarter of the race, with 217&nbsp;km still to ride.<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref> His success as an outsider, and after such a long lone ride, stayed in the memory of Belgian fans. Years later, Durand was stopped for speeding. The Belgian policeman who came to his car said, \"''Vous avez gagn\u00e9 le Tour des Flandres en nonante-deux\"'' (\"You won the Tour of Flanders in '92''\"'') - and let him drive on.\n\nDurand finished his career with Belgian teams. \"Winning the Ronde made me a bit of a naturalised Belgian,\" he said.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 14 July 2000</ref>\n\n==Doping and disqualification==\nDurand took drugs during the Tour de la C\u00f4te Picarde in 1996 and was given a one-month probationary suspension.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 9 January 1997</ref> He was disqualified during the Tour de France in 2002 for holding on to a car during the mountainous stage to the Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees. There had been complaints from riders, including the Czech, Jan Svorada, that he had done the same the previous year.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, France, 21 July 2002</ref>\n\nHis name was on the list of doping tests published by the [[French Senate]] on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the [[1998 Tour de France]] and found positive for [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] when retested in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/french-senate-releases-positive-epo-cases-from-1998-tour-de-france|title=French Senate releases positive EPO cases from 1998 Tour de France}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nDurand retired from racing in 2005 after receiving no team offers.<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref> He followed that year's Tour de France as representative of the supermarket chain, Champion.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, March 2005</ref> He is now a television commentator for Eurosport.\n\n==Private life==\nDurand stayed loyal to his first club, CC Renz\u00e9, throughout his career. He lives in [[Mauritius]].\n\nOn 25 November 2017, Durand's 80-year-old father, Henri Durand, was reported missing by his wife, Colette, after he went out for his usual bicycle ride and never returned. His body was found in a lake on 2 January 2018, in between [[Ballots, Mayenne|Ballots]] and [[Saint-Michel-de-la-Ro\u00eb]].

Guimard told him to attack early in the national championship at Ch\u00e2tellerault in 1993, to try his chance and to spoil those of [[Laurent Brochard]] and [[Luc Leblanc]].<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref> The writer, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Qu\u00e9net, said Guimard told Durand to attack far from the finish \"because he didn't want to see Laurent Brochard in blue, white and red and even less did he want a second consecutive title for Luc Leblanc, who was in disgrace in the Castorama team.\".<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref>\n\nOf the way he rode, Durand said:\n\n:I'm not a revolutionary of any sort, but on the bike, I've always refused to come out of a mould. It astonishes me that most riders are followers, even sheep. A lot of them, the only people who know they're in the Tour are their ''directeurs sportifs''. I couldn't do the job like that. They finish the Tour without having attacked once, maybe the whole of the season, even the whole of their career. I'd rather finish shattered and last having attacked a hundred times than finish 25th without having tried. Yes, I get ragged about it, but it's always in a friendly way. In the bunch, the guys know that ''Dudu'' is as likely to finish a long way behind them as first.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 14 July 2000</ref>\n\n==Tour of Flanders==\nDurand won the Ronde van Vlaanderen, or [[Tour of Flanders]], in 1992, 36 years after the last French winner, [[Jean Forestier]], in 1956. He broke away from the field with [[Thomas Wegm\u00fcller]] after a quarter of the race, with 217&nbsp;km still to ride.<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref> His success as an outsider, and after such a long lone ride, stayed in the memory of Belgian fans. Years later, Durand was stopped for speeding. The Belgian policeman who came to his car said, \"''Vous avez gagn\u00e9 le Tour des Flandres en nonante-deux\"'' (\"You won the Tour of Flanders in '92''\"'') - and let him drive on.\n\nDurand finished his career with Belgian teams. \"Winning the Ronde made me a bit of a naturalised Belgian,\" he said.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 14 July 2000</ref>\n\n==Doping and disqualification==\nDurand took drugs during the Tour de la C\u00f4te Picarde in 1996 and was given a one-month probationary suspension.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, 9 January 1997</ref> He was disqualified during the Tour de France in 2002 for holding on to a car during the mountainous stage to the Plateau de Beille in the Pyrenees. There had been complaints from riders, including the Czech, Jan Svorada, that he had done the same the previous year.<ref>L'\u00c9quipe, France, 21 July 2002</ref>\n\nHis name was on the list of doping tests published by the [[French Senate]] on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the [[1998 Tour de France]] and found positive for [[Erythropoietin|EPO]] when retested in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/french-senate-releases-positive-epo-cases-from-1998-tour-de-france|title=French Senate releases positive EPO cases from 1998 Tour de France}}</ref>\n\n==Retirement==\nDurand retired from racing in 2005 after receiving no team offers.<ref>V\u00e9lomania, France, February 2005</ref> He followed that year's Tour de France as representative of the supermarket chain, Champion.<ref>V\u00e9lo, France, March 2005</ref> He is now a television commentator for Eurosport.\n\n==Private life==\nDurand stayed loyal to his first club, CC Renz\u00e9, throughout his career. He lives in [[Mauritius]].\n\nOn 25 November 2017, Durand's 80-year-old father, Henri Durand, was reported missing by his wife, Colette, after he went out for his usual bicycle ride and never returned. His body was found in a lake on 2 January 2018, in between [[Ballots, Mayenne|Ballots]] and [[Saint-Michel-de-la-Ro\u00eb]]. An autopsy confirmed he had died from drowning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lecourrierdelamayenne.fr/actualite-23865-corps-repeche-a-ballots-la-victime-identifiee.html|title=Corps rep\u00each\u00e9 \u00e0 Ballots : la victime identifi\u00e9e - Le Courrier de la Mayenne|last=lecourrierdelamayenne.fr|website=www.lecourrierdelamayenne.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ouest-france.fr/pays-de-la-loire/laval-53000/sud-mayenne-le-corps-repeche-est-bien-celui-d-henri-durand-5483217|title=Sud-Mayenne: le corps rep\u00each\u00e9 est bien celui d'Henri Durand|work=Ouest-France.fr|access-date=2018-01-23|language=fr-FR}}</ref>\n\n==Major results==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n;1988\n:{{FRA}} National amateur team-trial champion\n;1989\n:Paris - Alen\u00e7on\n;1991\n:[[Grand Prix d'Isbergues]]\n;1992\n:[[Tour of Flanders]]\n;1993\n:Bol d'or des Mon\u00e9di\u00e8res\n:Bordeaux - Cauderan\n:Dun Le Palestel\n:{{FRA}} National road champion\n;1994\n:Lisieux\n:Monein\n:{{FRA}} National road champion\n:Saint-Chamond\n:[[1994 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n::Winner stage 10\n;1995\n:[[1995 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n::Winner prologue\n:Vienne\n;1996\n:Dun Le Palestel\n:Amiens\n;1998\n:Callac\n:[[Paris\u2013Tours]]\n:[[1998 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n::Winner stage 8\n::[[File:Jersey red number.svg|20px]] Winner [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]]\n:Vayrac\n;1999\n:Ronde d'Aix-en-Provence\n:Chateau-Chinon\n:[[1999 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n::[[File:Jersey red number.svg|20px]] Winner [[Combativity award in the Tour de France|combativity award]]\n;2000\n:Camors\n:Rognes\n:Toulouse\n;2001\n:[[Tro Bro L\u00e9on]]\n:Tartu Rattaralli\n;2004\n:Hellemmes\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://allezjackydurand.free.fr/ Jacky Durand fan web site]\n*{{Cycling Archives|8411}}\n*[http://histo.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/coureur/159.html Official Tour de France results for Jacky Durand]\n\n{{Tour de France combativity award winners}}\n{{Tour de France Lanterne Rouge}}\n{{Tour of Flanders winners}}\n{{French National Road Race Championships (men) |state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Durand, Jacky}}\n[[Category:French male cyclists]]\n[[Category:French Tour de France stage winners]]\n[[Category:Doping cases in cycling]]\n[[Category:French sportspeople in doping cases]]\n[[Category:Tour de France prologue winners]]\n[[Category:1967 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Cycling announcers]]\n[[Category:People from Laval, Mayenne]]\n[[Category:Tour de France cyclists]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Mayenne]]\n", "name_user": "Lepricavark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:added short description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacky_Durand"}

He last played for the [[TNT KaTropa]] of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. He won the 1999 PBA Rookie of the Year and led San Miguel to six championships (out of a total of eight) during his career. He is also a two-time member of the [[Philippine national basketball team]].\n\n==Amateur career==\nSeigle starred for his high school basketball team, leading them to winning 59 consecutive games and a state title. He then joined the Wagner College Seahawks after being recruited by coach [[Tim Capstraw]]. Seigle became a two-time Northeast Conference first-team selection for the Seahawks. Closing his college career with scoring 20-plus points in nine of his final ten games, he finished sixth in Wagner's all-time scoring list, with 1,652 total points scored, and also in the top ten all-time for field goals, 3-pointers and free throws.<ref name=\"silive.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.silive.com/sports/advance/gordon/index.ssf/2010/07/free-agent_basketball_madness.html |title=Free Agent Basketball Madness |access-date=July 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707082538/http://www.silive.com/sports/advance/gordon/index.ssf/2010/07/free-agent_basketball_madness.html |archive-date=July 7, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==PBA career==\n\n===San Miguel Beermen (1999\u20132011)===\n\n====Early years====\nIn 1999, San Miguel acquired Seigle as its direct hire [[Filipino-foreign]] cager, after the league instituted a rule for every team to have one Filipino-foreign cager acquired without going through the process of joining the rookie draft.

Their mother, Blesylda Yadao, is a [[Filipina]] while his father is [[United States|American]].\n\nDespite a huge showing in the 1999 All-Filipino Conference, the Beermen were eliminated by eventual champion [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Formula Shell]]. However, the Beermen won the 1999 Commissioner's Cup and the Governor's Cup, with Seigle, 1998 Rookie of the Year [[Danny Ildefonso]], [[Olsen Racela]] and imports Terquin Mott (Commissioner's Cup) and Lamont Strothers (Governor's Cup) leading the charge. At season's end, Seigle won the Rookie of the Year honors.<ref name=\"deal\"/> In 2000, Seigle continued to spark big numbers for San Miguel and led the team in regaining the Commissioner's and Governor's Cup titles. He set the league record winning 4 Finals MVP awards.\n\n====Injuries====\nIn his fourth season with the league, Seigle joined the RP National Training Pool, as preparation for the [[2002 Asian Games]] in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. Although he did sit a few games for guest RP teams Hapee and Selecta during the Governor's and Commissioner's Cup, Seigle managed to play in a number of exhibition games against foreign clubs. However, during a pre-Asian Games match against [[Qatar]] on September 22, 2002, Seigle suffered a torn right [[Achilles tendon]] after taking a shot.\n\nDue to the extent of the injury, Seigle missed the entire 2003 season. While there were hints of a possible return during the season, the team kept him on the injured list.<ref>{{cite news|last=Navarro|first=June|title=Beerman Danny Seigle reactivated|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=March 6, 2004|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZFc1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=iSUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1315,9066388|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> He made his much-awaited return to the team in the 2004 Fiesta Conference, albeit in a much limited role. It was the first time Seigle played for San Miguel since 2001. However, Seigle's old form resurfaced in the 2004-05 Philippine Cup, leading San Miguel to a third-place finish. In the 2005 Fiesta Conference, Danny helped the Beermen win their 17th title.\n\n====Return to Form====\nThe Philippine Cup put Seigle in the headlines as he scored at least 20+ points in 19 straight times during the conference breaking Alvin Patrimonio's previous record. It also helped San Miguel gain an outright semifinals berth while earning him the Best Player of the Conference Award, his second since 1999.<ref name=\"bags\">{{cite news|last=Navarro|first=June|title=Seigle bags second best player award|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=July 10, 2006|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zBozAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lCUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=518,4120189|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Air21 Express/Barako Bull (2011\u20132013)===\nIn the 2010-2011 season, after playing many successful years for San Miguel Beermen, Seigle was traded to the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21 Express]] along with [[Paul Artadi]], [[Dorian Pe\u00f1a]] and [[Dondon Hontiveros]].

(born June 14, 1976) is a Filipino-American basketball coach and retired player. He is a Coach of [[De La Salle Green Archers]] and team consultant for the [[San Miguel Alab Pilipinas]] of the [[ASEAN Basketball League]]. He last played for the [[TNT KaTropa]] of the [[Philippine Basketball Association]]. He won the 1999 PBA Rookie of the Year and led San Miguel to six championships (out of a total of eight) during his career. He is also a two-time member of the [[Philippine national basketball team]].\n\n==Amateur career==\nSeigle starred for his high school basketball team, leading them to winning 59 consecutive games and a state title. He then joined the Wagner College Seahawks after being recruited by coach [[Tim Capstraw]]. Seigle became a two-time Northeast Conference first-team selection for the Seahawks. Closing his college career with scoring 20-plus points in nine of his final ten games, he finished sixth in Wagner's all-time scoring list, with 1,652 total points scored, and also in the top ten all-time for field goals, 3-pointers and free throws.<ref name=\"silive.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.silive.com/sports/advance/gordon/index.ssf/2010/07/free-agent_basketball_madness.html |title=Free Agent Basketball Madness |access-date=July 5, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707082538/http://www.silive.com/sports/advance/gordon/index.ssf/2010/07/free-agent_basketball_madness.html |archive-date=July 7, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==PBA career==\n\n===San Miguel Beermen (1999\u20132011)===\n\n====Early years====\nIn 1999, San Miguel acquired Seigle as its direct hire [[Filipino-foreign]] cager, after the league instituted a rule for every team to have one Filipino-foreign cager acquired without going through the process of joining the rookie draft. Danny has an older brother named [[Andy Seigle|Andy]],<ref name=\"deal\">{{cite news|last=Reyes|first=Marc Anthony|title=Danny Seigle wants only 1 year SMB deal|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=January 20, 2001|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PX42AAAAIBAJ&sjid=hCUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3304,35117552|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> who was then still playing for the [[Talk 'N Text Tropang Texters|Mobiline Phone Pals]] by the time Danny himself was acquired by the Beermen. Their mother, Blesylda Yadao, is a [[Filipina]] while his father is [[United States|American]].\n\nDespite a huge showing in the 1999 All-Filipino Conference, the Beermen were eliminated by eventual champion [[Shell Turbo Chargers|Formula Shell]]. However, the Beermen won the 1999 Commissioner's Cup and the Governor's Cup, with Seigle, 1998 Rookie of the Year [[Danny Ildefonso]], [[Olsen Racela]] and imports Terquin Mott (Commissioner's Cup) and Lamont Strothers (Governor's Cup) leading the charge. At season's end, Seigle won the Rookie of the Year honors.<ref name=\"deal\"/> In 2000, Seigle continued to spark big numbers for San Miguel and led the team in regaining the Commissioner's and Governor's Cup titles. He set the league record winning 4 Finals MVP awards.\n\n====Injuries====\nIn his fourth season with the league, Seigle joined the RP National Training Pool, as preparation for the [[2002 Asian Games]] in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. Although he did sit a few games for guest RP teams Hapee and Selecta during the Governor's and Commissioner's Cup, Seigle managed to play in a number of exhibition games against foreign clubs. However, during a pre-Asian Games match against [[Qatar]] on September 22, 2002, Seigle suffered a torn right [[Achilles tendon]] after taking a shot.\n\nDue to the extent of the injury, Seigle missed the entire 2003 season. While there were hints of a possible return during the season, the team kept him on the injured list.<ref>{{cite news|last=Navarro|first=June|title=Beerman Danny Seigle reactivated|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=March 6, 2004|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZFc1AAAAIBAJ&sjid=iSUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1315,9066388|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref> He made his much-awaited return to the team in the 2004 Fiesta Conference, albeit in a much limited role. It was the first time Seigle played for San Miguel since 2001. However, Seigle's old form resurfaced in the 2004-05 Philippine Cup, leading San Miguel to a third-place finish. In the 2005 Fiesta Conference, Danny helped the Beermen win their 17th title.\n\n====Return to Form====\nThe Philippine Cup put Seigle in the headlines as he scored at least 20+ points in 19 straight times during the conference breaking Alvin Patrimonio's previous record. It also helped San Miguel gain an outright semifinals berth while earning him the Best Player of the Conference Award, his second since 1999.<ref name=\"bags\">{{cite news|last=Navarro|first=June|title=Seigle bags second best player award|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=July 10, 2006|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zBozAAAAIBAJ&sjid=lCUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=518,4120189|accessdate=June 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Air21 Express/Barako Bull (2011\u20132013)===\nIn the 2010-2011 season, after playing many successful years for San Miguel Beermen, Seigle was traded to the [[Barako Bull Energy|Air21 Express]] along with [[Paul Artadi]], [[Dorian Pe\u00f1a]] and [[Dondon Hontiveros]].

Its follow-up, \"[[Nobody's Wife (song)|Nobody's Wife]]\", was released the following year. After peaking at number two on the [[Dutch Top 40]], the single became a European hit, entering the top ten in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. \nBoth singles were included in her first studio album. Titled ''[[Together Alone (Anouk album)|Together Alone]]'', it topped the [[Dutch Albums Chart]] and also achieved commercial success across Europe.\n\nWith her second album, ''[[Urban Solitude]]'', Anouk failed to repeat her international success, but consolidated her career in the Netherlands and in Flanders. As of today, she has achieved eight number-one albums in her country, including the compilation ''[[Lost Tracks (Anouk album)|Lost Tracks]]'', featuring B-sides and alternate versions of her previous hits, and the live album ''Live at Gelredome'', released in 2008.\n\n==Albums==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions and certifications\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13em;\" | [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | [[MegaCharts|NL]]<br/><ref name=DutchAlbums>{{Cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?search=anouk&cat=a |publisher=Dutchcharts.nl.

Its follow-up, \"[[Nobody's Wife (song)|Nobody's Wife]]\", was released the following year. After peaking at number two on the [[Dutch Top 40]], the single became a European hit, entering the top ten in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. \nBoth singles were included in her first studio album. Titled ''[[Together Alone (Anouk album)|Together Alone]]'', it topped the [[Dutch Albums Chart]] and also achieved commercial success across Europe.\n\nWith her second album, ''[[Urban Solitude]]'', Anouk failed to repeat her international success, but consolidated her career in the Netherlands and in Flanders. As of today, she has achieved eight number-one albums in her country, including the compilation ''[[Lost Tracks (Anouk album)|Lost Tracks]]'', featuring B-sides and alternate versions of her previous hits, and the live album ''Live at Gelredome'', released in 2008.\n\n==Albums==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ List of albums, with selected chart positions and certifications\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:13em;\" | [[List of music recording certifications|Certifications]]\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | [[MegaCharts|NL]]<br/><ref name=DutchAlbums>{{Cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?search=anouk&cat=a |publisher=Dutchcharts.nl.

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word \"plandovati\" used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means \"odmarati\", and in English means \"to rest\".\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895</ref>. In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century the Hungarian empire started it's career and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two thirds of Hungary, including Banat. After the [[Ottoman]] siege of Vienna the Ottoman empire was slowly driven back again and the history of Plandi\u0161te gets more concrete.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* Pervan is serbian and means first, which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker doesnt't tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it's nothing more than a guess: in German it's common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Huangarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happend to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1787 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787)</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got it's present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].

The village has a population of 3,832, while Plandi\u0161te municipality has 11,336 inhabitants. One of municipality's best known landmarks is [[Kapetanovo Castle]], located in [[Stari Lec]].\n\n==Name==\nIn [[Serbian language|Serbian]], the village is known as \u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435 or ''Plandi\u0161te'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''Plandi\u0219te'', in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as ''Zichyfalva'', in [[German language|German]] as ''Zichydorf'' {{IPA-de|Z\u026ad\u0292idorf|pron}} , and in {{lang-mk|\u041f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435}}.\n\nThe name of the village derived from the word \"plandovati\" used in the local Serbian dialect, which in modern standard Serbian means \"odmarati\", and in English means \"to rest\".\n\n==History==\n=== World Politics running over Banat for centuries ===\nBanat as part of [[Pannonia]] was under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule from 9 BC to the end of the 4th century<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary#Before_895</ref>. In 5th century the [[Huns]] razed the land. In the 9th century the Hungarian empire started it's career and around 1000 AD the Banat became part of the prospering Hungarian empire. In 13th century [[Genghis Khan]] invaded Europe. After the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, the [[Ottoman|Turks]] took over two thirds of Hungary, including Banat. After the [[Ottoman]] siege of Vienna the Ottoman empire was slowly driven back again and the history of Plandi\u0161te gets more concrete.\n\n=== Settlements before Zichydorf ===\nIn the municipal area of Plandi\u0161te have been several places in medieval times: Bioseg, Terjan, Sarkac and Raros. These names still exist on 18th century maps <ref>https://mapire.eu/de/map/secondsurvey-hungary/embed/?bbox=2343817.2621939667%2C5657190.455042724%2C2362047.493439981%2C5662923.232164111&map-list=1&layers=5</ref>. \n\nAccording to Milleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> there were several different villages named Bioseg between 1375<ref>Pesti: Krasso, III, Nr. 86</ref> and 1550<ref>Pesty: Krasso, IV, Nr. 405</ref>. They were named O-Belzeg, Nagy-Belzeg und Pervan-Belzeg. The names mean: \n\n* Prefix ''bel-'' or ''bio-'' comes from Serbian ''belu'' which means white (compare to [[Belgrade]] / Beograd).\n* ''-zeg'' comes from Hungarian ''sziget'' meaning [[island]].\n* Pervan is serbian and means first, which is common at that time and area to distinct different places of the same name: simply give numbers.\n* Milleker doesnt't tell anything about ''O-''. Maybe it's nothing more than a guess: in German it's common to abbreviate ''Ober'' with ''O-'' meaning the village located on higher altitude.\n* ''Nagy'' is Huangarian and means ''big''.\n\nWhat happend to the villages during the reign of the Ottoman is unknown. When the Hungarians came back, of those villages only a few houses and the names were left. \n\nMilleker<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref> talks about a [[legend]], that at the today location of Plandi\u0161te there had been a [[battle]] between [[Prince_Eugene_of_Savoy|Prince Eugene]] and the Ottoman Empire during the [[Great_Turkish_War|Great Turkish War (1683-1699)]] most likely around 1686 (TODO check). What remained was a graveyard, which was discovered in 1889 during the erection of the train line from [[Zrenjanin]] to [[Margita]]. He suggests that Romanian [[Shepherd]]s founded Mormin\u021b which means cemetery in Romanian and thus might refer to exactly this battle and graveyard.\n\nFact is, in 1713 the village Mormin\u021b exists at the location of Plandi\u0161te with a count of 23 houses. <ref>Glasnik Jahrgang V, Nr 10, S. 15 1</ref> After the [[Austro-Turkish_War_(1716\u20131718)|Austro-Turkish War (1716\u20131718)]], it counted only 8<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s ev, 1, 26</ref>. In 1738 the Ottoman Turks stroke back destroying settlements along the Danube, including Mormin\u021b. The Turks advanced north over the next year, all the way to [[Temesvar]], the capital of Banat. After this invasion, the territory around Mormin\u021b was abandoned<ref>Szenkl\u00e4ray: Sz\u00e4s Beilage 6, S. 5</ref>.\n\n=== Austrians driving back the Ottoman ===\nThe Austrians and Hungarians joined forces and in 1738 pushed the Turks back south, across the Danube. The expulsion of the Turks brought organized settlement under the auspices of Habsburg. Austro-Hungarian military campaigns were based on German nobility - Counts, who served as generals to the Imperial Austrian Army. It was custom for the Austrian [[Emperor|Kaiser]] to reward each count with a piece of land from the newly conquered Banat. So Count Carl Zichy de V\u00e1sonke\u00f6, at that time [[president]] of the Hungarian Parliament (check! Milleker calls it \"Kammer\", maybe https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofkammer), became the owner of about 10,000 [[acres]] (check, usually they counted in [[Austrian]] Katastraljoch which is 0.57 [[ha]]) of land in the Plandi\u0161te area. Since he did not earn much money from the [[lease]] of this land he decided to take part in the colonization effort<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. \n\n=== Colonizing the Conquered Land ===\nIn 1782 [[Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]] started the third colonization into Banat which ended in 1887 <ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwabenzug#Dritter_gro%C3%9Fer_Schwabenzug_(1781%E2%80%931787)</ref>. Too late, in winter 1787 and spring 1788 the colony Zichydorf was established<ref>http://zichydorf.ferienwohnung-otterberg.de/Zichydorf/geschichte.htm</ref>. So they settled it with people from German Banat villages instead: [[Graba\u021b]], [[Jimbolia]] (Hatzfeld), [[Comlo\u0219u Mic]] (Ostern), [[Iecea Mic\u0103]] (Klein-Jetscha) and [[Iecea Mare]] (Gro\u00df-Jetscha). The new settlement consisted of 123 houses owning 34 [[Katastraljoch]]<ref>https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alte_Ma%C3%9Fe_und_Gewichte_(%C3%96sterreich)#Fl%C3%A4chenma%C3%9Fe</ref> (19,5 [[Hectare|ha]]) each. \n\nIn 1867 Austria adopted a dual monarchy known as the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Hungarian authorities later forced [[Magyarization]] to create a special Hungarian nation from a mixed population, which was mostly German, but also included Romanians, Serbs and Turks and several other ethnics. Magyarization resulted in the name change from German to Hungarian. So Zichydorf was renamed to Zichyfalva or Zichyhaza. Also the Hungarians built a lot of infrastructure like railroads and the [[Danube\u2013Tisa\u2013Danube Canal]].\n\n=== Modern times ===\nAfter the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1918 the new borders brought Zichyfalva into the state of Serbia, which became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia]] proclaimed the change of all place names to Serbian and so it was named Mariolana.\n\nDuring the German occupation in the [[Second World War]] the names of the settlements were returned to the German original names. Afterwards the place got it's present name Plandi\u0161te. Immigrants from other parts of the country arrived on the territory of the municipality, so that 18 ethnicities were represented in the again multi-ethnic population structure.\n\n==Inhabited places==\nPlandi\u0161te municipality includes the following villages:\n*Plandi\u0161te\n*[[Banatski Sokolac]]\n*[[Barice, Plandi\u0161te|Barice]]\n*[[Velika Greda]]\n*[[Veliki Gaj]]\n*[[Du\u017eine]]\n*[[Jermenovci]]\n*[[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]]\n*[[Laudonovac]]\n*[[Margita (Plandi\u0161te)|Margita]]\n*[[Markovi\u0107evo]]\n*[[Mileti\u0107evo]]\n*[[Stari Lec]]\n*[[Hajdu\u010dica]]\n\n==Demographics==\nHistorical population of the village:\n{{historical populations\n|align=none\n| cols = 2\n|1869|2,937\n|1880|2,636\n|1890|3,128\n|1900|3,192\n|1910|2,846\n|1921|3,120\n|1931|3,281\n|1948|3,040\n|1953|3,096\n|1961|3,509\n|1971|3,769\n|1981|4,122\n}}\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n;Municipality\n{{See also|Serbs in Vojvodina|Hungarians in Vojvodina|Macedonians in Serbia|Romani people of Vojvodina|Romanians in Vojvodina|Slovaks in Vojvodina|Serbian lands|List of Hungarian communities in Vojvodina}}\nAccording to the 2011 census, the municipality of Plandi\u0161te had a total population of 11,336, including:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/WebSite/Public/ReportResultView.aspx?rptKey=indId%3d18020101IND01%26102%3d80349%2636%3d0%2cG%2cO%2623%3d0%26111%3d01%2c02%2c03%2c04%2c05%2c06%2c07%2c08%2c09%2c10%2c11%2c12%2c13%2c14%2c15%2c16%2c17%2c18%2c19%2c20%2c21%2c22%2c23%2c24%2c25%2c26%26sAreaId%3d18020101%26dType%3dIdentificatorAndName%26lType%3dEnglish|title=Population by ethnicity \u2013 Plandi\u0161te|publisher=Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (SORS)|accessdate=4 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n*5,868 [[Serbs]] (51.76%)\n*1,280 [[Magyars|Hungarians]] (11.29%)\n*1,042 [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] (9.19%)\n*784 [[Romanians]] (7.92%)\n*616 [[Slovaks]] (5.43%)\n*281 [[Romani people|Romani]] (2.48%)\n*1,465 Others and undeclared (12.92%)\n\nSettlements with '''Serb''' ethnic majority are: Plandi\u0161te, [[Banatski Sokolac]], [[Velika Greda]], [[Veliki Gaj]], [[Du\u017eine]], [[Kupinik (Plandi\u0161te)|Kupinik]], [[Laudonovac]], [[Markovi\u0107evo]], [[Mileti\u0107evo]], and [[Stari Lec]].
