The model was originally positioned as a [[personal luxury car]], and typically offered in both [[Coup\u00e9|coupe]] and [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] forms until 1997, when the Regal became sedan-only due to the decline of the personal luxury coupe market. For certain model years between 1973 and 2004, the Regal shared bodies and powertrains with the similar [[Buick Century]], although the Regal was positioned as a more upmarket vehicle.\n\nThe Regal was discontinued in the North American market in 2004, being succeeded by the [[Buick LaCrosse]]. In 2008, a new version of the Regal was introduced for the Chinese market, which is a [[Rebadging|badge engineered]] version of the [[Opel Insignia]]. The new Regal was introduced to the North American market in 2011, positioned as a mid-size vehicle. A new model was introduced for 2018, which is offered in a [[liftback]] sedan and a \"TourX\" [[station wagon]] version.  GM plans to discontinue the Regal in the North American market after the 2020 model year, making Buick exclusively an SUV/CUV marque there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/04/buick-regal-discontinued-gm-general-motors/2607182001/|title=General Motors kills the Buick Regal: GM continues to cut passenger cars|last=Bomey|first=Nathan|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/386005/buick-regal-dead-after-2020my/|title=Buick Regal Dead After 2020MY Because Customers Want Crossovers|work=[[Motorsport Network|Motor1.com]]|last=Padeanu|first=Adrian|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30120611/buick-regal-dead/|title=Buick Regal Is Dead, Leaving Buick with an All-SUV Lineup|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Capparella|first=Joey|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation (1973) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name           = First generation\n| image          = File:1974 Buick Regal (26756596603).jpg\n| caption        = 1974 Buick Regal coupe\n| aka              = Buick Century Regal\n| model_years    = 1973\u20131977\n| assembly       = {{unbulleted list|United States: [[Flint, Michigan]] ([[Buick City]])|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]] ([[Framingham Assembly]])|[[Fremont, California]] ([[Fremont Assembly]])|[[Lakewood Heights, Atlanta|Lakewood Heights, Georgia]] ([[Lakewood Assembly]])}}\n| engine         = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (gasoline)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (gasoline)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| transmission   = {{unbulleted list|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|350]]'' automatic<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 .2F THM400 .2F THM375 .2F 3L80 .2F 3L80HD|400]]'' automatic<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| wheelbase      = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|112|in|mm|abbr=on}} (coupe)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} (sedan)<ref name=\"carbrochure\">{{cite web|author=Dusan Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/new/021110/1974%20Buick%20Century/1974%20Buick%20Century-06.html |title=File: 1974 Buick Century/1974 Buick Century-06 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>}}\n| length         = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|212|in|mm|abbr=on}} (coupe)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|216|in|mm|abbr=on}} (sedan)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| height        = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|53.3|in|mm|abbr=on}} (coupe)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|54.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} (sedan)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| body_style     = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| related        = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Century#1973.E2.80.931977|Buick Century]]|[[Chevrolet El Camino#Fourth generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Chevrolet El Camino]]|[[Chevrolet Chevelle#Third generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Chevrolet Malibu]]|[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Second generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass#Fourth Generation - 1973.E2.80.931977|Oldsmobile Cutlass]]|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme#Third generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]|[[Pontiac Grand Am#1973.E2.80.931975|Pontiac Grand Am]]|[[Pontiac Grand Prix#Third generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Pontiac Grand Prix]]}}\n| platform       = [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]]\n| layout         = [[FR layout]]\n| sp             = us\n}}\n\n[[File:Nona6.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Buick Regal coupe]]\n[[File:Buick-Regal-(A-body)-Vilnius-Lithuania-front.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Regal sedan]]\n[[File:Buick-Regal-(A-body)-Vilnius-Lithuania-back.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Regal sedan]]\n\n[[Buick]] had been the first GM division to bring a [[personal luxury car]] to market with its 1963 [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which [[Pontiac]] created with the 1969 [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] and [[Chevrolet]] with the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] the following year, 1970. At the same time, [[Oldsmobile]] added a formal notchback coup\u00e9 to its intermediate line, the [[Cutlass Supreme]], in 1970 and that model soon became Olds' best selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called \"Colonnade\" cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. In a curious name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick's intermediate line and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.\n\nA highly trimmed, two-door [[coupe]], the first Regal, officially marketed as the \"Century Regal Colonnade Hardtop coupe\", shared its front and rear styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and taillight lenses. The Regal shared the same \"Colonnade\" [[Hardtop|pillared hardtop]] roofline (a [[hardtop]] with [[Pillar (car)|B-pillars (center pillars)]] but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme as well as the lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.\n\nFor the first [[model year]] in 1973, the Regal nameplate was only used for Buick's version of the GM intermediate [[personal luxury car|personal luxury]] [[coupe]], but the following year gained a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] companion (there was no Regal [[station wagon]]).\n\nRegal interiors were generally more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on [[dashboard]] and [[door panel]]s, along with door-pull straps and [[bench seat]]s with center [[armrest]]s with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optionally available throughout the run was a 60/40 split bench seat with [[armrest]]. For 1976 and 1977, the Regal [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.\n\nThe model lasted five years with minimal changes, although there was a fairly substantial facelift in coupes for 1976 (sedans retained their original 1973 sheetmetal through 1977), which incorporated the recently-legalized rectangular headlights (horizontally mounted on coupes, and vertically on [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s\u2014much like the mid-1960s Pontiacs). The Regal coupe sold reasonably well, although it lagged behind the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme which had become the best-selling cars in America by 1976.\n\nThe Regal was most commonly powered by [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick's {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8]], which was standard equipment on all models for 1973 and 1974, and optional on coupes but standard on sedans from 1975 to 1977, and the larger [[Buick V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was optional for 1973 and 1974 models only. Starting in 1975, Regal coupes came standard with Buick's resurrected {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] previously offered on the 1964\u20131967 [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]; the engine's tooling had been sold to [[Kaiser Motors]] for use in [[Jeep]] models (Kaiser was purchased by American Motors in 1970 and Jeep became an AMC division) and sold back to GM by AMC in 1974. For 1975 and 1976, the Century and Regal were the only mid-sized cars in America to offer V6 engines. The bolt pattern for this vehicle is 5\u00d7{{convert|4+3/4|in|mm|1}}.\n\nThe Century designation was quietly dropped from the Regal for 1975.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1978) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = '87 Buick Regal Grand National (Auto classique A&W Ch\u00e2teauguay '12).JPG\n| caption = 1987 Buick Regal Grand National\n| model_years = 1978\u20131987\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| assembly = United States: {{ubl\n|[[Flint, Michigan]]\n|[[Lakewood Heights, Atlanta|Lakewood Heights, Georgia]]\n|[[Arlington, Texas]]\n|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]\n|[[Fremont, California]]\n|[[Pontiac, Michigan]]\n|[[Kansas City, Missouri]] (Leeds)\n}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|108|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| related = {{ubl\n|[[Buick Century]]\n|[[Chevrolet El Camino]]\n|[[Chevrolet Malibu]]\n|[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]\n|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]\n|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]\n|[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n|[[Pontiac Grand Am]]\n|[[Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n|[[Pontiac Le Mans]]\n}}\n| engine = {{ubl\n|{{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#3.2|Buick V6]]\n|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|Buick V6]]\n|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|Buick V6]] [[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]]\n|{{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick V6]]\n|{{convert|260|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|Oldsmobile Diesel]] [[V6 engine|V6]]\n|{{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#265|Pontiac V8]]\n|{{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|Pontiac V8]]\n|{{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile V8]]\n|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|Oldsmobile Diesel]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n| transmission = {{ubl\n|3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|THM200]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|THM200-4R]] automatic\n}}\n| body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| platform = [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] (1978\u20131981)<br />[[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] (1981\u20131987)\n| sp = us\n}}\n\nA downsized Regal appeared for the 1978 model year with Buick's new {{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] as standard equipment and a revised version of the venerable {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 as an option (which became standard for 1980). Initially, a three-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard but this was later replaced by an automatic.

Turbo versions were offered with either a two- or a four-barrel [[carburetor]]. The [[Buick LeSabre]] was also available with the turbocharged engine. The only other turbocharged cars available in the U.S. market in 1978 were imports from [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche 930|Porsche]] and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]. The Regal Sport Coupe also included a firm [[Car handling|handling]] suspension with larger tires and sport wheels.  Bucket seats and a center console with a T-shifter were also available.\n\nA major facelift for 1981 gave the Regal a much more aerodynamic profile, helping make it possible for the car to compete on the [[NASCAR]] racing circuit. The sloping [[Hood (car)|hood]] and nose of the car made it the favorite of several NASCAR teams. [[Richard Petty]] drove one to victory in the [[1981 Daytona 500]], and the car won a majority of the 1981 and 1982 seasons races and won the NASCAR manufacturers title in 1981 and 1982.\n\n[[V8 engine|V8]]s for street use were still available, but had shrunk to {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (1980 and 1981 only, [[Pontiac]] built), and the V6 was rapidly gaining popularity. From 1986 to 1987, the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|{{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was available as an option. The {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl V6 was standard. The [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|200-4R]] [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was an option with either engine.\n\nFor 1980, the Regal was offered in a special '''Somerset Limited Edition''' [[Trim level (automobile)|trim]] which featured unique tan and dark blue designer exterior paint, wire wheel covers, sport [[Wing mirror|mirrors]], and chrome Somerset badging. The interior had tan and blue plush [[velour]] [[Upholstery#Automobile upholstery|upholstery]], brushed [[Chrome plating#Automotive use|chrome]] trim, and additional Somerset badging. A Somerset Limited Edition model was also offered on the restyled 1981 Regal. It had unique dark sandstone and camel exterior paint, sport mirrors, and turbine wheels. The interior plush velour upholstery was camel with dark brown piping.\n\n=== Grand National, Turbo-T, T-Type, and GNX ===\nIn February 1982, the Regal Grand National debuted, which was named for the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series]] (the \"Grand National\" term was part of the Cup series nomenclature until 1986).<ref>http://legendarydreamcargarage.com/dreamcargarage/539</ref> Buick had won the Manufacturers Cup in 1981 and 1982, and wanted to capitalize on its success: \"What wins on Sunday, sells on Monday\". These 1982 cars were not painted black, which may confuse those not familiar with them. All started out as charcoal gray Regals that were shipped off to a subcontractor for finishing.\n\nOriginally intended for a run of 100 units, Cars and Concepts of [[Brighton, Michigan]], retrofitted 215 Regals with the GN package. Most obvious was the light silver gray firemist paint added to each side. Red [[Pinstriping#Automobiles|pinstripes]] and billboard shadow lettering proclaiming \"Buick\" were applied. The wheel opening moldings and [[rocker panel]] moldings were blacked out using black vinyl tape. Finally, a front air dam and [[rear spoiler]] were installed. On the inside, special \"Lear-Siegler\" seats were installed. These seats are fully adjustable and were covered with silver brandon cloth with black vinyl inserts. The front seat had Buick's \"6\" emblem embroidered onto them. Also, a special clock delete plate was added to the [[Dashboard|instrument panel]] which contained the yellow and orange \"6\" logo and the words \"Grand National Buick Motor Division\".)\n\nThe 1982 GN came with a [[naturally aspirated]] {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|125|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 2000&nbsp;rpm. Of the 215 Regal Grand Nationals produced in 1982, at least 35 were based on the Buick Regal Sport coupe package with the turbocharged {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|175|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2600&nbsp;rpm. There were only 2022 Sport coupes produced in 1982, and the number of cars with both the GN and Sport coupe packages is estimated to be fewer than 50.\n\nFor 1983, there was no Grand National. The Sport coupe model was renamed the [[T-Type]]; 3,732 were produced ({{convert|190|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 1600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&nbsp;rpm). The T-Type had been used on other Buicks, starting with the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] in 1981 (in 1979 and 1980, it was the S Type). The 1983 Regal T-Type featured tube [[Exhaust manifold|headers]], Hydro-Boost II [[brake]]s, 200-4R 4-speed overdrive trans and 3.42 [[rear axle]] (7.5\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/Future+Collectible%3A+1986+Buick+Grand+National*T_Type-66683.xhtml |title=Buick Grand National Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Buick T-Type (2669441886).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal T-Type]]\n\nFor 1984, the Grand National returned, now in all black paint. The [[turbocharged]] {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} became standard and was refined with [[sequential fuel injection]], [[distributor]]-less computer controlled [[Ignition system|ignition]], and boasted {{convert|200|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&nbsp;rpm. Only 5,204 turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2,000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year production of the computer controlled sequential fuel injection and distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year and model that started the development of the legendary [[intercooled]] Grand Nationals. The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the \"little V6\" easily kept up with the bigger V8s. [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of {{convert|10|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, while for the same year, the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Chevrolet Camaro]] V6 was listed at 17.0 and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette]] at 15.2 seconds.<ref name=cd_corvette>\n{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1984-chevrolet-corvette-c4-archived-road-test\n|title=1984 Corvette (C4) \n|date=1983-03-01\n|publisher=Car and Driver\n}}</ref> Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. All Grand Nationals had the [[Lear Siegler]]-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the T-Top option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals.\n\nFor 1986, a modified engine design with air-air intercooling boosted the performance even further to a specified {{convert|235|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|330|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&nbsp;rpm. The Grand Nationals (quantity 5,512) and T-Types (quantity 2,384) were both produced in 1986. For 1987, performance reached {{convert|245|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Buick dropped the T-Type package for Regal for 1987 models and opted for a \"T\" sport package instead. There were only 7,896 turbo Regals produced in 1986. In 1987, when turbo Regals reached their peak in popularity, a total of 27,590 turbo Regals were produced through December, with those models produced between September and December of that year window stickered as \"1987\u00bd Buick Grand National\" vehicles.\n\n[[File:WO2T.jpg|thumb|1987 Regal turbo-T Limited with rare blackout trim package]]\n\nFor 1987, a lightweight WE4 (turbo T) option was offered. Only 1,547 of this variant were produced. The differences between a WE4 and the Grand National were the interior trim package, wheels, exterior badging, aluminum bumper supports, and aluminum rear [[drum brake]]s as opposed to the Grand National's cast iron, making the WE4 a lighter and faster car. The rear spoiler was only available as a dealer installed option. Nineteen eighty-seven was the only year that the LC2 turbo option was available on any Regal, making it possible to even see a Limited with a vinyl [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]] and a [[power bulge]] turbo hood. Turbo Regal Limiteds were one of the rarest models of turbo Regals produced second only to the GNX at 1,035 turbo Limiteds. Turbo Regal Limiteds could be ordered with many options with most having chrome external trim but for $35 could have been built with the full black-out trim option making them extremely rare. Limiteds were treated to a very luxurious interior with plush carpeting and optional bench pillow seats and a [[Gear stick|column shift]]. The 1987 model would be the end of the manufacture of the [[Rear wheel drive|RWD]] \"G-Body\" Regal, but [[General Motors|GM]] had to extend the build of the Grand National to meet customer demand into December.\n[[File:Buick GNX (20206519195).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]\n[[File:Buick GNX (20180268696).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]\nFor the final year, 1987, Buick introduced the limited production GNX, for \"Grand National Experimental\", at $29,900. Made in partnership with [[Linamar|McLaren Performance Technologies]]/[[American Specialty Cars|ASC]], Buick produced only 547 GNs with the interior trim package, that were then sent off to [[Linamar|McLaren]] and upgraded into the Buick GNX. Buick underrated the GNX at {{Convert|276|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&nbsp;rpm and a very substantial {{convert|360|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3000&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=100661\n|title=1987 Buick Regal GNX\n|website=Carfolio.com\n|accessdate=2018-09-23\n|date=2013-02-28}}</ref> although actual output is {{convert|300|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GNXPerf\">{{cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~buickGNX/GNX/perf.htm |title=GNX Performance |work=BuickGNX.com |accessdate=2007-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630104145/http://home.att.net/~buickGNX/GNX/perf.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}</ref> This was created to be the \"Grand National to end all Grand Nationals.\" Changes made included a special [[Garrett AiResearch]] T-3 [[turbocharger]] with a ceramic-impeller blowing through a more efficient and significantly larger capacity [[intercooler]] with a \"Cermatel (ceramic-aluminum) coated\" pipe connecting the intercooler to the engine. A GNX specific E-EPROM, low-restriction exhaust with dual [[muffler]]s, reprogrammed turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with a custom [[torque converter]] and transmission cooler, and unique [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] cover/[[Panhard]] bar included more of the performance modifications. Exterior styling changes include vents located on each front fender, 16&nbsp;inch black mesh style wheels with VR-speed rated tires, and deletion of the hood and fender emblems. The interior changes of the GNX included a serial number on the dash plaque and a revised instrument cluster providing [[Stewart-Warner]] [[Analog device|analog gauges]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOMDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> including an analog turbo [[boost gauge]].

The GNX used a unique [[torque arm]] that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. The torque arm rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.\n\nThe stealthy appearance of the all-black GNX and Grand National (and the resemblance of its grill to his helmet's mouthpiece), coupled with the fact that the Grand National was initially released during the popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, earned it the title \"[[Darth Vader]]'s Car\". [[Car and Driver]] covered the GNX model's introduction with the headline \"Lord Vader, your car is ready.\"  Due to the turbocharged six cylinder engine, the Buick make, and the black paint Grand Nationals were sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Side\". The \"Dark Side\" contrasted with the more common V8 [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustangs]] and Camaros that were popular at the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Third generation (1988) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = Buick gray.jpg\n| caption = 1988\u20131989 Buick Regal Limited coupe\n| model_years = 1988&ndash;1996\n| production = 1987\u2013October 1996<ref>https://www.cars.com/reviews/chicagotribunecoms-view-1420689074485/</ref>\n| transmission = 4-speed automatic<br />1988\u201392: [[GM 4T60 transmission|4T60]]<br />1993\u201396: [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]]\n| engine = 2.8 L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Transverse|X]]'' [[V6]]<br />3.1 L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation II|X]]'' [[V6]]<br />3.8 L ''[[Buick V6 engine#3800 V6|Buick]]'' [[V6]]\n| assembly = [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada ([[GM Canada]])\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|107.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1988\u201389 2dr: {{convert|192.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1990\u201391 2dr: {{convert|191.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394 2dr: {{convert|193.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1995\u201396 2dr: {{convert|193.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1990\u201391 4dr: {{convert|194.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394 Custom & GS 4dr: {{convert|194.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394 Limited 4dr: {{convert|196|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1995 4dr: {{convert|193.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1996 4dr: {{convert|194.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|72.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = Sedan: {{convert|54.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|53|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Chevrolet Lumina#First generation .281990.E2.80.931994.29|Chevrolet Lumina]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme#Fifth generation .281988.E2.80.931997.29|Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Prix#Fifth generation .281988.E2.80.931996.29|Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n| platform = [[GM W platform|W-body]]\n| layout = [[FF layout]]\n| designer = \n| sp = us\n}}\n\n[[File:'88-'89 Buick Regal (Orange Julep).JPG|thumb|left|1988\u20131989 Buick Regal GS coupe]]\n[[File:Buick Regal 2 -- 10-30-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1990\u20131994 Buick Regal GS sedan]]\n[[File:1991 Buick Regal Limited.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Buick Regal Limited coupe]]\n[[File:Buick Regal coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1995\u20131996 Buick Regal coupe]]\n[[File:95-96 Buick Regal.jpg|thumb|left|1996 Buick Regal sedan]]\n\nA new Regal appeared in October 1987 on the [[GM W platform]] as the first vehicle on that platform;<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-08-30-8703050938-story.html</ref> this generation ran with few changes for nine years. Though the new Regal returned to Buick's original concept in being offered only as a coupe and in being aimed once again squarely at the personal luxury buyer, it departed from tradition in being the first front-wheel drive model, and in having no serious performance option or edition. Neither a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine nor a turbocharged [[V6]] was offered; the only engine available for 1988 was the Chevrolet 2.8&nbsp;L V6, producing {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom 1990, owing to the declining personal luxury car market, the Regal was again offered as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (as were the Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix the same year, the latter offered as a sedan for the first time).\n\nThe Regal was initially offered in base ''Custom'' and upscale ''Limited'' trim lines. For 1989, the ''[[Buick Gran Sport#Regal GS / Regal Gran Sport|Gran Sport]]'' trim line was added, featuring aluminum wheels, body side cladding and a console mounted shifter attached to the 4-speed automatic. For 1990, the Regal gained the option of the Buick 3.8&nbsp;L V6. The 3800 V6 was unique to the Regal, differentiating it from the mechanically similar [[Chevrolet Lumina]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all but the base ''Custom'' cars from 1992, and the grille was redesigned again for 1993. Along with the new look came an electronically controlled [[automatic transmission]] and [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]]-like rear lights and bumper. For 1993, a driver's side [[airbag]] was added, along with standard [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] on all models, standard power windows, and {{convert|20|hp|0|abbr=on}} more in the base engine due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder head. The ''Limited'' coupe was deleted; only the ''Custom'' and ''Gran Sport (GS)'' coupes remained. Dual airbags were new for 1995 along with a new interior.\n\nFor 1996, the larger {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V6 engine became the ''3800 Series II'' and gained {{convert|35|hp|0|abbr=on}}. {{citation needed span|Although 1996 was the last model year of this model, sales continued into 1997 as the replacement model was late (arriving in January 1997).|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== Engines ===\n* 1988\u20131989 2.8&nbsp;L (170&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation II|Chevrolet LB6]] [[MPFI|MFI]] [[V6]], {{Convert|125|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|160|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1989\u20131993 3.1&nbsp;L (191&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation II|Chevrolet LH0]] MFI V6, {{Convert|140|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|180|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1994\u20131996 3.1&nbsp;L (191&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation III|Chevrolet L82]] SFI V6, {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|185|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n* 1990\u20131995 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[L27 Naturally Aspirated|Buick L27]] V6, {{Convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|220|lbft|0|abbr=on}}\n* 1996 3.8&nbsp;L (231&nbsp;in\u00b3) [[Buick V6 engine#L36 Naturally Aspirated|Buick L36]] V6, {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|225|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== {{anchor|Fourth}} Fourth generation (1997) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Fourth generation\n| image = Buick Regal GSE.jpg\n| caption = Buick Regal (US)\n| aka = Chevrolet Lumina (Philippines)\n| production = {{ubl | 1996\u20132004 | China: 1999&ndash;2008 || Philippines: 2005&ndash;2006 }}\n| model_years = North America: 1997&ndash;2004\n| assembly = {{unbulleted list|Canada: [[Oshawa, Ontario]], [[GM Canada]]|China: [[Shanghai]], [[Shanghai GM]]}}\n| predecessor = \n| successor = [[Buick LaCrosse]]\n| body_style = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| layout = [[FF layout]]\n| platform = [[GM W platform|W-body 2nd Gen]]\n| engine = 2.0 L ''[[Family II engine#L34|L34]]'' [[Inline-four engine|I4]] (China)<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#China|LB8]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (China)<br />3.0&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LW9|LW9]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (China)<br />3.8 L [[Buick V6 engine#Series II|3800 Series II]] [[V6]]\n| transmission = 5-speed manual (China, 2.0 L only) <br /> 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T60-E|4T60-E]] automatic <br /> 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E]] automatic <br /> 4-speed [[GM 4T60-E transmission#4T65-E|4T65-E HD]] automatic\n| wheelbase = {{convert|109.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|196.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|72.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|56.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| weight = \n| related = {{unbulleted list |[[Buick Century#1997.E2.80.932005|Buick Century]]|[[Chevrolet Impala#Eighth|Chevrolet Impala]]|[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Sixth|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]|[[Oldsmobile Intrigue]]|[[Pontiac Grand Prix#Sixth generation .281997.E2.80.932003.29|Pontiac Grand Prix]]}}\n| designer = Wayne Cherry<br />Wayne Kady (1993)\n| sp = us\n}}\n{{see also|Buick Century#1997\u20132005|l1=Buick Century \u00a7 1997\u20132005}}\n\n[[File:Buick Regal.jpg|thumb|left|1997\u20132004 Buick Regal sedan]]\n\nFor the 1997 model year, the Century and Regal once again rode upon the same platform; the revised [[GM W platform|W platform]] that was shared with the [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]], the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]].<ref>https://adage.com/article/news/buick-s-regal-read-costly-web-launch/263/</ref> The Regal coupe was discontinued.\n\nDifferences between the Regal and Century were mostly cosmetic. As the upmarket version, the Regal offered larger engines and fancier trim, and once again boasted a newer version of the 3.8&nbsp;L V6. While the Century was mainly a reliable, economy-minded car based upon the W-body, the Regal was fitted with many amenities, including heated leather seats (optional on the Century), a [[Monsoon speakers|Monsoon]] 8-speaker surround sound system, dual climate control, and expansive interior space. Few changes occurred during this version's seven-year run. It offered 5-passenger seating on all trim levels like the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue (formerly Cutlass Supreme), unlike their predecessors that had optional 6-passenger seating and the Buick Century (formerly built on the [[GM A platform|A platform]]) which had standard 6-passenger seating.\n\nThis period held the fastest Buick since the days of the 1991\u20131996 Roadmaster, the Buick Regal GS. This car was now [[supercharged]] instead of turbocharged, and produced {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. When introduced in January 1997,<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-08-11-9608110276-story.html</ref> Buick advertised the Regal GS as \"The official car of the supercharged family\".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoghkBiMmQk</ref> Buick also released two other model types, the LSE and the GSE. The LSE stayed with the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} engine with upgrades and the GSE stayed with the {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} supercharged engine with upgrades.

They offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for both LS and GS models. Like the GS Buicks that came before it, the SLP GSX came in three power train packages, referred to as stages. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. If you opted for the Stage 2 package, a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components \u2014 good for an extra 20 horsepower. The range-topping Stage 3 package added a 3.5-inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to crank up the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at {{convert|270|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|312|lbft|abbr=on|0}} of torque. Since the parts were available from SLP over the counter for many years, there have been quite a few Regal GS sedans that have been cloned into a GSX for both appearance and performance purposes. Though the model didn\u2019t officially debut until 2003, a licensed SLP dealer could perform the transformation on any Regal GS from 1997 to 2004. A true GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit.<ref>https://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/buick-regal-gsx-it-lives-up-to-its-performance-heritage.html/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |title=SLP Buick Regal GSX |work=Fabini's Auto Trim Co |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710215458/http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Joseph Abboud Edition===\nFrom 2001 to 2004 Buick offered a [[Joseph Abboud]] appearance package on both the GS and LS models.

The Chinese market Regal has different front- and rear-end styling compared to the North American version and different engines, including the 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Family II engine#L34|L34]]'', the 2.5&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LB8|LB8]]'' V6 and the 3.0&nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LW9|LW9]]'' V6. Gearbox choices were a 4-speed automatic for V6 models, while four-cylinder variants are paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox. V6 models had a set of black dashboard gauges, while the four-cylinder models had white dashboard gauges.  These models also had slightly different names: the entry-level model was the ''New Century'', with more upscale models carrying the ''GL'' and ''GLX'' names. Later, ''G'' and ''GS'' models were added. Production for this generation ended in November 2008 in China being replaced the Opel Insignia based Regal. The Chinese-built Regal was also sold in the Philippines from 2005 to 2008 as the Chevrolet Lumina, where it replaced the [[Opel Vectra]].

The foregoing are all part of a Driver Confidence package, while collision preparation, which pre-loads the brake system ahead of an imminent collision, and adaptive cruise control are available separately.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lamm|first=John|title=2014 Buick Regal / Regal GS|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-buick-regal-photos-and-info-news|work=Car and Driver|accessdate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"6\" |Shanghai GM Regal Engines (Petrol)\n|-\n!Engine model\n!Type\n!Displacement\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Year\n|-\n![[GM Family 1 engine#Generation III|'''1.6T''']]\n| rowspan=\"5\" |I4\n|1,598 cc\n|{{Convert|179|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm\n|{{Convert|220|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2,200\u20135,400 rpm\n| rowspan=\"3\" |2008\u20132017\n|-\n![[GM Family II engine|2.0]]\n|1,998 cc\n|{{Convert|147|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm\n|{{Convert|190|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,600 rpm\n|-\n![[GM Ecotec engine#LDK|2.0T SIDI]]\n|1,998 cc\n|220 PS (162&nbsp;kW; 218&nbsp;hp) at 5,300 rpm\n|{{Convert|350|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 2,000\u20134,000 rpm\n|-\n![[GM Ecotec engine#LE5|2.4]]\n|2,384 cc\n|170 PS (125&nbsp;kW; 168&nbsp;hp) at 6,400 rpm\n|{{Convert|225|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm\n|2008\u20132010\n|-\n![[GM Ecotec engine#LAF|2.4 SIDI]]\n|2,384 cc\n|{{Convert|186|PS|kW hp|abbr=on}} at 6,200 rpm\n|{{Convert|240|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800 rpm\n|2011\u20132017\n|}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Sixth generation (2018) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Sixth generation\n| image = 2018 Buick Regal Sportback Preferred II FWD, Ebony Twilight Metallic, front right.jpg\n| caption = 2018 Buick Regal Sportback\n| aka = {{unbulleted list|{{ill|\u522b\u514b\u541b\u5a01|zh|vertical-align=sup}} (Buick Regal; China)|[[Opel Insignia]] (Europe)|[[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Insignia (United Kingdom)|[[Holden Commodore (ZB)]] (Australia)}}\n| production = 2017\u2013present<!--Until production has stopped, production dates should be \"present\" - DO NOT change to \"2020\"-->\n| model_years = 2018\u2013present<br>2018\u2013present ([[North America]])<!--Until production has stopped, production dates should be \"present\" - DO NOT change to \"2020\"-->\n| assembly = [[Germany]]: [[R\u00fcsselsheim am Main|R\u00fcsselsheim]] ([[Opel Automobile GmbH]])<br/>[[China]]: [[Shanghai]] ([[SAIC-GM]])\n| designer = Mark Adams<br />Malcolm Ward\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (China only)<br/>5-door [[fastback]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/2018-Buick-Regal-Sportback-Overview-c27060|title=Review of New Buick Regal}}</ref> (sportback)<br/>5-door [[Station wagon|wagon]]<ref name=\"wagon\">{{cite web|title=2018 Buick Regal Wagon Confirmed During Dealer Meeting|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2016/05/2018-buick-regal-wagon-confirmed-during-dealer-meeting/|last=Szymkowski|first=Sean|website=GM Authority|date=May 30, 2016|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}</ref>\n| platform = [[GM Epsilon platform#E2XX|E2XX platform]]\n| related = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick LaCrosse]]|[[Chevrolet Malibu]]}}\n| layout = [[FF layout]] / [[F4 layout]]\n| engine = {{unbulleted list\n  |1.5 L ''[[GM small gasoline engine#LFV|LFV]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] ([[turbocharger|turbo]]) (China only)\n  |1.8 L [[Straight-4|I4]] (hybrid gasoline/electric) (30H China only)\n  |2.0 L ''[[GM Ecotec engine#LTG|LTG]]'' [[Straight-4|I4]] (turbo)\n  |3.6 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LGX|LGX]]'' [[V6]]\n}}\n| transmission = [[AWF8F35|AWF8F45]] (8-speed) (I4 [[All-wheel drive|AWD]])<br>GM 9-speed Hydramatic 9T65 (I4 [[Front-wheel drive|FWD]], V6 [[All-wheel drive|AWD]])<br>[[Continuously Variable Transmission|CVT]] (30H China only)\n| wheelbase = {{convert|111.4|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|192.7|in|mm|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|196.4|in|mm|abbr=on}} (TourX)\n| width = {{convert|73.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|57.3|in|mm|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|58.4|in|mm|abbr=on}} (TourX)\n| sp = us\n| predecessor = \n}}[[File:Buick Regal 2.0T IMG 20180417 111121.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Regal sedan, rear view|alt=]]On April 4, 2017, an all-new sixth generation Buick Regal was introduced at GM's Design Dome in [[Warren, Michigan]] as a 2018 model in both [[Hatchback|liftback]] and [[station wagon]] versions.

The model was originally positioned as a [[personal luxury car]], and typically offered in both [[Coup\u00e9|coupe]] and [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] forms until 1997, when the Regal became sedan-only due to the decline of the personal luxury coupe market. For certain model years between 1973 and 2004, the Regal shared bodies and powertrains with the similar [[Buick Century]], although the Regal was positioned as a more upmarket vehicle.\n\nThe Regal was discontinued in the North American market in 2004, being succeeded by the [[Buick LaCrosse]]. In 2008, a new version of the Regal was introduced for the Chinese market, which is a [[Rebadging|badge engineered]] version of the [[Opel Insignia]]. The new Regal was introduced to the North American market in 2011, positioned as a mid-size vehicle. A new model was introduced for 2018, which is offered in a [[liftback]] sedan and a \"TourX\" [[station wagon]] version.  GM plans to discontinue the Regal in the North American market after the 2020 model year, making Buick exclusively an SUV/CUV marque there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/12/04/buick-regal-discontinued-gm-general-motors/2607182001/|title=General Motors kills the Buick Regal: GM continues to cut passenger cars|last=Bomey|first=Nathan|website=USA TODAY|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motor1.com/news/386005/buick-regal-dead-after-2020my/|title=Buick Regal Dead After 2020MY Because Customers Want Crossovers|work=[[Motorsport Network|Motor1.com]]|last=Padeanu|first=Adrian|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30120611/buick-regal-dead/|title=Buick Regal Is Dead, Leaving Buick with an All-SUV Lineup|work=[[Car and Driver]]|last=Capparella|first=Joey|date=4 December 2019|accessdate=4 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n== First generation (1973) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name           = First generation\n| image          = File:1974 Buick Regal (26756596603).jpg\n| caption        = 1974 Buick Regal coupe\n| aka              = Buick Century Regal\n| model_years    = 1973\u20131977\n| assembly       = {{unbulleted list|United States: [[Flint, Michigan]] ([[Buick City]])|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]] ([[Framingham Assembly]])|[[Fremont, California]] ([[Fremont Assembly]])|[[Lakewood Heights, Atlanta|Lakewood Heights, Georgia]] ([[Lakewood Assembly]])}}\n| engine         = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V6 engine#231|Buick]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]] (gasoline)|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (gasoline)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} ''[[Buick V8 engine#455|Buick]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (gasoline)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| transmission   = {{unbulleted list|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|350]]'' automatic<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|3-speed ''[[Turbo-Hydramatic]] [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 .2F THM400 .2F THM375 .2F 3L80 .2F 3L80HD|400]]'' automatic<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| wheelbase      = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|112|in|mm|abbr=on}} (coupe)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|116|in|mm|abbr=on}} (sedan)<ref name=\"carbrochure\">{{cite web|author=Dusan Ristic-Petrovic |url=http://oldcarbrochures.com/new/021110/1974%20Buick%20Century/1974%20Buick%20Century-06.html |title=File: 1974 Buick Century/1974 Buick Century-06 |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-08}}</ref>}}\n| length         = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|212|in|mm|abbr=on}} (coupe)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|216|in|mm|abbr=on}} (sedan)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| height        = {{unbulleted list|{{convert|53.3|in|mm|abbr=on}} (coupe)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>|{{convert|54.1|in|mm|abbr=on}} (sedan)<ref name=\"carbrochure\"/>}}\n| body_style     = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]]\n| related        = {{unbulleted list|[[Buick Century#1973.E2.80.931977|Buick Century]]|[[Chevrolet El Camino#Fourth generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Chevrolet El Camino]]|[[Chevrolet Chevelle#Third generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Chevrolet Malibu]]|[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo#Second generation|Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass#Fourth Generation - 1973.E2.80.931977|Oldsmobile Cutlass]]|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme#Third generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]|[[Pontiac Grand Am#1973.E2.80.931975|Pontiac Grand Am]]|[[Pontiac Grand Prix#Third generation .281973.E2.80.931977.29|Pontiac Grand Prix]]}}\n| platform       = [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]]\n| layout         = [[FR layout]]\n| sp             = us\n}}\n\n[[File:Nona6.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Buick Regal coupe]]\n[[File:Buick-Regal-(A-body)-Vilnius-Lithuania-front.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Regal sedan]]\n[[File:Buick-Regal-(A-body)-Vilnius-Lithuania-back.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Regal sedan]]\n\n[[Buick]] had been the first GM division to bring a [[personal luxury car]] to market with its 1963 [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which [[Pontiac]] created with the 1969 [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] and [[Chevrolet]] with the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] the following year, 1970. At the same time, [[Oldsmobile]] added a formal notchback coup\u00e9 to its intermediate line, the [[Cutlass Supreme]], in 1970 and that model soon became Olds' best selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called \"Colonnade\" cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. In a curious name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick's intermediate line and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.\n\nA highly trimmed, two-door [[coupe]], the first Regal, officially marketed as the \"Century Regal Colonnade Hardtop coupe\", shared its front and rear styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and taillight lenses. The Regal shared the same \"Colonnade\" [[Hardtop|pillared hardtop]] roofline (a [[hardtop]] with [[Pillar (car)|B-pillars (center pillars)]] but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme as well as the lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.\n\nFor the first [[model year]] in 1973, the Regal nameplate was only used for Buick's version of the GM intermediate [[personal luxury car|personal luxury]] [[coupe]], but the following year gained a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] companion (there was no Regal [[station wagon]]).\n\nRegal interiors were generally more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on [[dashboard]] and [[door panel]]s, along with door-pull straps and [[bench seat]]s with center [[armrest]]s with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optionally available throughout the run was a 60/40 split bench seat with [[armrest]]. For 1976 and 1977, the Regal [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.\n\nThe model lasted five years with minimal changes, although there was a fairly substantial facelift in coupes for 1976 (sedans retained their original 1973 sheetmetal through 1977), which incorporated the recently-legalized rectangular headlights (horizontally mounted on coupes, and vertically on [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s\u2014much like the mid-1960s Pontiacs). The Regal coupe sold reasonably well, although it lagged behind the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme which had become the best-selling cars in America by 1976.\n\nThe Regal was most commonly powered by [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick's {{convert|350|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8]], which was standard equipment on all models for 1973 and 1974, and optional on coupes but standard on sedans from 1975 to 1977, and the larger [[Buick V8 engine#455|{{convert|455|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was optional for 1973 and 1974 models only. Starting in 1975, Regal coupes came standard with Buick's resurrected {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] previously offered on the 1964\u20131967 [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]; the engine's tooling had been sold to [[Kaiser Motors]] for use in [[Jeep]] models (Kaiser was purchased by American Motors in 1970 and Jeep became an AMC division) and sold back to GM by AMC in 1974. For 1975 and 1976, the Century and Regal were the only mid-sized cars in America to offer V6 engines. The bolt pattern for this vehicle is 5\u00d7{{convert|4+3/4|in|mm|1}}.\n\nThe Century designation was quietly dropped from the Regal for 1975.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Second generation (1978) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = '87 Buick Regal Grand National (Auto classique A&W Ch\u00e2teauguay '12).JPG\n| caption = 1987 Buick Regal Grand National\n| model_years = 1978\u20131987\n| layout = [[FR layout]]\n| assembly = United States: {{ubl\n|[[Flint, Michigan]]\n|[[Lakewood Heights, Atlanta|Lakewood Heights, Georgia]]\n|[[Arlington, Texas]]\n|[[Framingham, Massachusetts]]\n|[[Fremont, California]]\n|[[Pontiac, Michigan]]\n|[[Kansas City, Missouri]] (Leeds)\n}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|108|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| related = {{ubl\n|[[Buick Century]]\n|[[Chevrolet El Camino]]\n|[[Chevrolet Malibu]]\n|[[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]]\n|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass]]\n|[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]\n|[[Pontiac Bonneville]]\n|[[Pontiac Grand Am]]\n|[[Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n|[[Pontiac Le Mans]]\n}}\n| engine = {{ubl\n|{{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#3.2|Buick V6]]\n|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|Buick V6]]\n|{{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#LD5|Buick V6]] [[Turbocharger|Turbocharged]]\n|{{convert|252|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Buick V6 engine#4.1|Buick V6]]\n|{{convert|260|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|Oldsmobile Diesel]] [[V6 engine|V6]]\n|{{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#265|Pontiac V8]]\n|{{convert|301|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|Pontiac V8]]\n|{{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|Chevrolet]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|Oldsmobile V8]]\n|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine|Oldsmobile Diesel]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n}}\n| transmission = {{ubl\n|3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n|3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200|THM200]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|THM200-4R]] automatic\n}}\n| body_style = 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]<br />5-door [[station wagon]]\n| platform = [[GM A platform (RWD)|A-body]] (1978\u20131981)<br />[[GM G platform (RWD)|G-body]] (1981\u20131987)\n| sp = us\n}}\n\nA downsized Regal appeared for the 1978 model year with Buick's new {{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] as standard equipment and a revised version of the venerable {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 as an option (which became standard for 1980). Initially, a three-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard but this was later replaced by an automatic. At the time of introduction, Regals were available exclusively as [[coup\u00e9]]s with the [[Buick Century|Century]] nameplate applied to bread-and-butter sedans and [[station wagon]]s.<ref name=\"buick\">{{Cite book | ref = SCBuick | title = Standard Catalog of Buick, 1903-2004 | edition = 3 | first = John | last = Gunnell | publisher = Krause Publications, Inc. | location = Iola, WI | page = 182 | date = 2004 | isbn = 0-87349-760-0 }}</ref> In January 1982 the Century was replaced by an all-new car on the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (1982)|A platform]], which meant that the Regal gained a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon - essentially facelifted and [[Badge|rebadged]] versions of the previous year's [[rear-wheel drive]] Century. It was the first time the name appeared on a full model lineup. The wagon was discontinued after 1983, and the sedan dropped from the lineup the next year.<ref name=stdB>[[#SCBuick|Gunnell]], pp. 218, 224</ref> This generation Regal lasted ten years. The base model was equipped with softer-riding luxury [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and did not offer a manual transmission in later years.\n\n[[File:Buick Regal -- 08-14-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1978\u20131979 Buick Regal]]\n[[File:Regal A-Body.JPG|thumb|left|1980 Buick Regal]]\n[[File:1982 Buick Regal Wagon two-tone green, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1982 Buick Regal Estate Wagon]]\n[[File:Buick Regal G-Body.jpg|thumb|left|1982\u20131987 Buick Regal]]\n\nThe 1978 Regal could be equipped with a {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharged]] V6 engine with [[automatic transmission]], and was known as a Regal Sport Coupe. Turbo versions were offered with either a two- or a four-barrel [[carburetor]]. The [[Buick LeSabre]] was also available with the turbocharged engine. The only other turbocharged cars available in the U.S. market in 1978 were imports from [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche 930|Porsche]] and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]. The Regal Sport Coupe also included a firm [[Car handling|handling]] suspension with larger tires and sport wheels.  Bucket seats and a center console with a T-shifter were also available.\n\nA major facelift for 1981 gave the Regal a much more aerodynamic profile, helping make it possible for the car to compete on the [[NASCAR]] racing circuit. The sloping [[Hood (car)|hood]] and nose of the car made it the favorite of several NASCAR teams. [[Richard Petty]] drove one to victory in the [[1981 Daytona 500]], and the car won a majority of the 1981 and 1982 seasons races and won the NASCAR manufacturers title in 1981 and 1982.\n\n[[V8 engine|V8]]s for street use were still available, but had shrunk to {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (1980 and 1981 only, [[Pontiac]] built), and the V6 was rapidly gaining popularity. From 1986 to 1987, the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|{{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was available as an option. The {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl V6 was standard. The [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|200-4R]] [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was an option with either engine.\n\nFor 1980, the Regal was offered in a special '''Somerset Limited Edition''' [[Trim level (automobile)|trim]] which featured unique tan and dark blue designer exterior paint, wire wheel covers, sport [[Wing mirror|mirrors]], and chrome Somerset badging. The interior had tan and blue plush [[velour]] [[Upholstery#Automobile upholstery|upholstery]], brushed [[Chrome plating#Automotive use|chrome]] trim, and additional Somerset badging. A Somerset Limited Edition model was also offered on the restyled 1981 Regal. It had unique dark sandstone and camel exterior paint, sport mirrors, and turbine wheels. The interior plush velour upholstery was camel with dark brown piping.\n\n=== Grand National, Turbo-T, T-Type, and GNX ===\nIn February 1982, the Regal Grand National debuted, which was named for the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series]] (the \"Grand National\" term was part of the Cup series nomenclature until 1986).<ref>http://legendarydreamcargarage.com/dreamcargarage/539</ref> Buick had won the Manufacturers Cup in 1981 and 1982, and wanted to capitalize on its success: \"What wins on Sunday, sells on Monday\". These 1982 cars were not painted black, which may confuse those not familiar with them. All started out as charcoal gray Regals that were shipped off to a subcontractor for finishing.\n\nOriginally intended for a run of 100 units, Cars and Concepts of [[Brighton, Michigan]], retrofitted 215 Regals with the GN package. Most obvious was the light silver gray firemist paint added to each side. Red [[Pinstriping#Automobiles|pinstripes]] and billboard shadow lettering proclaiming \"Buick\" were applied. The wheel opening moldings and [[rocker panel]] moldings were blacked out using black vinyl tape. Finally, a front air dam and [[rear spoiler]] were installed. On the inside, special \"Lear-Siegler\" seats were installed. These seats are fully adjustable and were covered with silver brandon cloth with black vinyl inserts. The front seat had Buick's \"6\" emblem embroidered onto them. Also, a special clock delete plate was added to the [[Dashboard|instrument panel]] which contained the yellow and orange \"6\" logo and the words \"Grand National Buick Motor Division\".)\n\nThe 1982 GN came with a [[naturally aspirated]] {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|125|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 2000&nbsp;rpm. Of the 215 Regal Grand Nationals produced in 1982, at least 35 were based on the Buick Regal Sport coupe package with the turbocharged {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|175|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2600&nbsp;rpm. There were only 2022 Sport coupes produced in 1982, and the number of cars with both the GN and Sport coupe packages is estimated to be fewer than 50.\n\nFor 1983, there was no Grand National. The Sport coupe model was renamed the [[T-Type]]; 3,732 were produced ({{convert|190|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 1600&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&nbsp;rpm). The T-Type had been used on other Buicks, starting with the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] in 1981 (in 1979 and 1980, it was the S Type). The 1983 Regal T-Type featured tube [[Exhaust manifold|headers]], Hydro-Boost II [[brake]]s, 200-4R 4-speed overdrive trans and 3.42 [[rear axle]] (7.5\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/Future+Collectible%3A+1986+Buick+Grand+National*T_Type-66683.xhtml |title=Buick Grand National Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Buick T-Type (2669441886).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal T-Type]]\n\nFor 1984, the Grand National returned, now in all black paint. The [[turbocharged]] {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} became standard and was refined with [[sequential fuel injection]], [[distributor]]-less computer controlled [[Ignition system|ignition]], and boasted {{convert|200|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&nbsp;rpm. Only 5,204 turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2,000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year production of the computer controlled sequential fuel injection and distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year and model that started the development of the legendary [[intercooled]] Grand Nationals. The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the \"little V6\" easily kept up with the bigger V8s. [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of {{convert|10|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, while for the same year, the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Chevrolet Camaro]] V6 was listed at 17.0 and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette]] at 15.2 seconds.<ref name=cd_corvette>\n{{Cite web\n|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1984-chevrolet-corvette-c4-archived-road-test\n|title=1984 Corvette (C4) \n|date=1983-03-01\n|publisher=Car and Driver\n}}</ref> Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. All Grand Nationals had the [[Lear Siegler]]-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the T-Top option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals.\n\nFor 1986, a modified engine design with air-air intercooling boosted the performance even further to a specified {{convert|235|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|330|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2400&nbsp;rpm. The Grand Nationals (quantity 5,512) and T-Types (quantity 2,384) were both produced in 1986. For 1987, performance reached {{convert|245|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Buick dropped the T-Type package for Regal for 1987 models and opted for a \"T\" sport package instead. There were only 7,896 turbo Regals produced in 1986. In 1987, when turbo Regals reached their peak in popularity, a total of 27,590 turbo Regals were produced through December, with those models produced between September and December of that year window stickered as \"1987\u00bd Buick Grand National\" vehicles.\n\n[[File:WO2T.jpg|thumb|1987 Regal turbo-T Limited with rare blackout trim package]]\n\nFor 1987, a lightweight WE4 (turbo T) option was offered. Only 1,547 of this variant were produced. The differences between a WE4 and the Grand National were the interior trim package, wheels, exterior badging, aluminum bumper supports, and aluminum rear [[drum brake]]s as opposed to the Grand National's cast iron, making the WE4 a lighter and faster car. The rear spoiler was only available as a dealer installed option. Nineteen eighty-seven was the only year that the LC2 turbo option was available on any Regal, making it possible to even see a Limited with a vinyl [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]] and a [[power bulge]] turbo hood. Turbo Regal Limiteds were one of the rarest models of turbo Regals produced second only to the GNX at 1,035 turbo Limiteds. Turbo Regal Limiteds could be ordered with many options with most having chrome external trim but for $35 could have been built with the full black-out trim option making them extremely rare. Limiteds were treated to a very luxurious interior with plush carpeting and optional bench pillow seats and a [[Gear stick|column shift]]. The 1987 model would be the end of the manufacture of the [[Rear wheel drive|RWD]] \"G-Body\" Regal, but [[General Motors|GM]] had to extend the build of the Grand National to meet customer demand into December.\n[[File:Buick GNX (20206519195).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]\n[[File:Buick GNX (20180268696).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]\nFor the final year, 1987, Buick introduced the limited production GNX, for \"Grand National Experimental\", at $29,900. Made in partnership with [[Linamar|McLaren Performance Technologies]]/[[American Specialty Cars|ASC]], Buick produced only 547 GNs with the interior trim package, that were then sent off to [[Linamar|McLaren]] and upgraded into the Buick GNX. Buick underrated the GNX at {{Convert|276|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4400&nbsp;rpm and a very substantial {{convert|360|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 3000&nbsp;rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]],<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=100661\n|title=1987 Buick Regal GNX\n|website=Carfolio.com\n|accessdate=2018-09-23\n|date=2013-02-28}}</ref> although actual output is {{convert|300|bhp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"GNXPerf\">{{cite web|url=http://home.att.net/~buickGNX/GNX/perf.htm |title=GNX Performance |work=BuickGNX.com |accessdate=2007-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630104145/http://home.att.net/~buickGNX/GNX/perf.htm |archivedate=June 30, 2007 }}</ref> This was created to be the \"Grand National to end all Grand Nationals.\" Changes made included a special [[Garrett AiResearch]] T-3 [[turbocharger]] with a ceramic-impeller blowing through a more efficient and significantly larger capacity [[intercooler]] with a \"Cermatel (ceramic-aluminum) coated\" pipe connecting the intercooler to the engine. A GNX specific E-EPROM, low-restriction exhaust with dual [[muffler]]s, reprogrammed turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with a custom [[torque converter]] and transmission cooler, and unique [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] cover/[[Panhard]] bar included more of the performance modifications. Exterior styling changes include vents located on each front fender, 16&nbsp;inch black mesh style wheels with VR-speed rated tires, and deletion of the hood and fender emblems. The interior changes of the GNX included a serial number on the dash plaque and a revised instrument cluster providing [[Stewart-Warner]] [[Analog device|analog gauges]],<ref>{{cite book |title=Popular Mechanics |date=March 1987 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOMDAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> including an analog turbo [[boost gauge]]. Performance was measured faster than the [[Ferrari F40]] and the [[Porsche 930]] with a [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] time of 12.7 seconds at {{Convert|113.1|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} (0.3 and 0.8 seconds quicker, 2.9 and {{convert|13.3|mph|0|abbr=on}} faster) and a 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 4.6 seconds (0.4 and 0.3 seconds quicker, respectively).<ref>[http://imgur.com/gallery/uzXOy], ''MotorTrend'', accessed Aug 11, 2016.</ref>\nGNX #001 is the 1986 prototype currently owned by Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US. The GNX used a unique [[torque arm]] that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. The torque arm rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.\n\nThe stealthy appearance of the all-black GNX and Grand National (and the resemblance of its grill to his helmet's mouthpiece), coupled with the fact that the Grand National was initially released during the popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, earned it the title \"[[Darth Vader]]'s Car\". [[Car and Driver]] covered the GNX model's introduction with the headline \"Lord Vader, your car is ready.\"  Due to the turbocharged six cylinder engine, the Buick make, and the black paint Grand Nationals were sometimes referred to as the \"Dark Side\". The \"Dark Side\" contrasted with the more common V8 [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustangs]] and Camaros that were popular at the time.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Third generation (1988) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = Buick gray.jpg\n| caption = 1988\u20131989 Buick Regal Limited coupe\n| model_years = 1988&ndash;1996\n| production = 1987\u2013October 1996<ref>https://www.cars.com/reviews/chicagotribunecoms-view-1420689074485/</ref>\n| transmission = 4-speed automatic<br />1988\u201392: [[GM 4T60 transmission|4T60]]<br />1993\u201396: [[GM 4T60-E transmission|4T60-E]]\n| engine = 2.8 L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Transverse|X]]'' [[V6]]<br />3.1 L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#Generation II|X]]'' [[V6]]<br />3.8 L ''[[Buick V6 engine#3800 V6|Buick]]'' [[V6]]\n| assembly = [[Oshawa, Ontario]], Canada ([[GM Canada]])\n| body_style = 2-door [[coupe]]<br />4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| wheelbase = {{convert|107.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| length = 1988\u201389 2dr: {{convert|192.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1990\u201391 2dr: {{convert|191.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394 2dr: {{convert|193.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1995\u201396 2dr: {{convert|193.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1990\u201391 4dr: {{convert|194.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394 Custom & GS 4dr: {{convert|194.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1992\u201394 Limited 4dr: {{convert|196|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1995 4dr: {{convert|193.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1996 4dr: {{convert|194.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|72.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = Sedan: {{convert|54.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|53|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Chevrolet Lumina#First generation .281990.E2.80.931994.29|Chevrolet Lumina]]<br />[[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme#Fifth generation .281988.E2.80.931997.29|Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]]<br />[[Pontiac Grand Prix#Fifth generation .281988.E2.80.931996.29|Pontiac Grand Prix]]\n| platform = [[GM W platform|W-body]]\n| layout = [[FF layout]]\n| designer = \n| sp = us\n}}\n\n[[File:'88-'89 Buick Regal (Orange Julep).JPG|thumb|left|1988\u20131989 Buick Regal GS coupe]]\n[[File:Buick Regal 2 -- 10-30-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1990\u20131994 Buick Regal GS sedan]]\n[[File:1991 Buick Regal Limited.jpg|thumb|left|1991 Buick Regal Limited coupe]]\n[[File:Buick Regal coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1995\u20131996 Buick Regal coupe]]\n[[File:95-96 Buick Regal.jpg|thumb|left|1996 Buick Regal sedan]]\n\nA new Regal appeared in October 1987 on the [[GM W platform]] as the first vehicle on that platform;<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-08-30-8703050938-story.html</ref> this generation ran with few changes for nine years. Though the new Regal returned to Buick's original concept in being offered only as a coupe and in being aimed once again squarely at the personal luxury buyer, it departed from tradition in being the first front-wheel drive model, and in having no serious performance option or edition. Neither a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine nor a turbocharged [[V6]] was offered; the only engine available for 1988 was the Chevrolet 2.8&nbsp;L V6, producing {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom 1990, owing to the declining personal luxury car market, the Regal was again offered as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (as were the Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix the same year, the latter offered as a sedan for the first time).\n\nThe Regal was initially offered in base ''Custom'' and upscale ''Limited'' trim lines. For 1989, the ''[[Buick Gran Sport#Regal GS / Regal Gran Sport|Gran Sport]]'' trim line was added, featuring aluminum wheels, body side cladding and a console mounted shifter attached to the 4-speed automatic. For 1990, the Regal gained the option of the Buick 3.8&nbsp;L V6. The 3800 V6 was unique to the Regal, differentiating it from the mechanically similar [[Chevrolet Lumina]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all but the base ''Custom'' cars from 1992, and the grille was redesigned again for 1993. Along with the new look came an electronically controlled [[automatic transmission]] and [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]]-like rear lights and bumper.

As the upmarket version, the Regal offered larger engines and fancier trim, and once again boasted a newer version of the 3.8&nbsp;L V6. While the Century was mainly a reliable, economy-minded car based upon the W-body, the Regal was fitted with many amenities, including heated leather seats (optional on the Century), a [[Monsoon speakers|Monsoon]] 8-speaker surround sound system, dual climate control, and expansive interior space. Few changes occurred during this version's seven-year run. It offered 5-passenger seating on all trim levels like the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue (formerly Cutlass Supreme), unlike their predecessors that had optional 6-passenger seating and the Buick Century (formerly built on the [[GM A platform|A platform]]) which had standard 6-passenger seating.\n\nThis period held the fastest Buick since the days of the 1991\u20131996 Roadmaster, the Buick Regal GS. This car was now [[supercharged]] instead of turbocharged, and produced {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. When introduced in January 1997,<ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-08-11-9608110276-story.html</ref> Buick advertised the Regal GS as \"The official car of the supercharged family\".<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoghkBiMmQk</ref> Buick also released two other model types, the LSE and the GSE. The LSE stayed with the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on|0}} engine with upgrades and the GSE stayed with the {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on|0}} supercharged engine with upgrades. Also, in 2000 Buick came out with a concept GSX that had an intercooled 3.8&nbsp;L, but was supercharged rather than turbocharged. It had {{convert|295.24|hp|abbr=on}}\n\nThe North American Regal was replaced in 2005 by the [[Buick LaCrosse]], also built on the W platform.

The Regal GS's PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. The Regal LS was EPA rated at 19/30 MPG city/freeway while the supercharged Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway.\n\n=== Regal LSX and GSX (SLP Performance) ===\n[[File:Buick_Regal_GSX.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Regal GSX]]\nIn the 2003 and 2004 model years, Buick, in collaboration with SLP Performance, came out with the Buick Regal GSX. They offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for both LS and GS models. Like the GS Buicks that came before it, the SLP GSX came in three power train packages, referred to as stages. The Stage 1 package added 10 horsepower with the addition of a dual stainless steel cat-back exhaust system and free-flowing cold air induction system. If you opted for the Stage 2 package, a Hypertech Power Programmer with an SLP custom calibration tune was included with the Stage 1 components \u2014 good for an extra 20 horsepower. The range-topping Stage 3 package added a 3.5-inch smaller diameter supercharger pulley to crank up the boost. With an advertised 30 more horsepower than stock, the Stage 3 GSX was conservatively rated at {{convert|270|hp|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|312|lbft|abbr=on|0}} of torque. Since the parts were available from SLP over the counter for many years, there have been quite a few Regal GS sedans that have been cloned into a GSX for both appearance and performance purposes. Though the model didn\u2019t officially debut until 2003, a licensed SLP dealer could perform the transformation on any Regal GS from 1997 to 2004. A true GSX can be verified from an SLP door jamb label with the correct part number for the kit.<ref>https://www.cheatsheet.com/automobiles/buick-regal-gsx-it-lives-up-to-its-performance-heritage.html/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |title=SLP Buick Regal GSX |work=Fabini's Auto Trim Co |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710215458/http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |archivedate=2011-07-10 }}</ref>\n\n===Joseph Abboud Edition===\nFrom 2001 to 2004 Buick offered a [[Joseph Abboud]] appearance package on both the GS and LS models.

Gearbox choices were a 4-speed automatic for V6 models, while four-cylinder variants are paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox. V6 models had a set of black dashboard gauges, while the four-cylinder models had white dashboard gauges.  These models also had slightly different names: the entry-level model was the ''New Century'', with more upscale models carrying the ''GL'' and ''GLX'' names. Later, ''G'' and ''GS'' models were added. Production for this generation ended in November 2008 in China being replaced the Opel Insignia based Regal. The Chinese-built Regal was also sold in the Philippines from 2005 to 2008 as the Chevrolet Lumina, where it replaced the [[Opel Vectra]].

Mounier, who was the child of peasants, was a brilliant scholar at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1929, when he was only twenty-four, he came under the influence of the French writer [[Charles P\u00e9guy]], to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement. Mounier's personalism became a main influence of the [[non-conformists of the 1930s]].\n\n[[Peter Maurin]] used to say wherever he went, \"There is a man in France called Emmanuel Mounier. He wrote a book called ''The Personalist Manifesto''. You should read that book.\"\n\nHe taught at the [[Lyc\u00e9e du Parc]] at [[Lyon]] and at the Lycee Fran\u00e7ais Jean Monnet at [[Brussels]].\n\nAlthough Mounier was critical of the [[Moscow Trials]] of the 1930s, he has been criticized by the historian [[Tony Judt]], among others, for his failure to condemn the excesses of [[Stalinism]] in the [[postwar period]].<ref>Judt, Tony.  ''Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944\u20131956''  (2011, New York University Press).</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Mounier commented in a restrained manner on the newly-elected [[Pope Pius XII]] remaining silent on the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]. Thus, Mounier has been attributed with indirectly originating the [[black legend]] about [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pius XII's alleged silence on the Holocaust]].<ref>[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/34104?eng=y The Black Legend of Pius XII Was Invented by a Catholic: Mounier]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* ''La pens\u00e9e de Charles P\u00e9guy'', Plon, coll. \"Roseau d'Or\", 1931.\n* ''R\u00e9volution personnaliste et communautaire'', Paris, \u00c9d.

Mounier, who was the child of peasants, was a brilliant scholar at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In 1929, when he was only twenty-four, he came under the influence of the French writer [[Charles P\u00e9guy]], to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement. Mounier's personalism became a main influence of the [[non-conformists of the 1930s]].\n\n[[Peter Maurin]] used to say wherever he went, \"There is a man in France called Emmanuel Mounier. He wrote a book called ''The Personalist Manifesto''. You should read that book.\"\n\nHe taught at the [[Lyc\u00e9e du Parc]] at [[Lyon]] and at the Lycee Fran\u00e7ais Jean Monnet at [[Brussels]].\n\nAlthough Mounier was critical of the [[Moscow Trials]] of the 1930s, he has been criticized by the historian [[Tony Judt]], among others, for his failure to condemn the excesses of [[Stalinism]] in the [[postwar period]].<ref>Judt, Tony.  ''Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944\u20131956''  (2011, New York University Press).</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Mounier commented in a restrained manner on the newly-elected [[Pope Pius XII]] remaining silent on the [[Italian invasion of Albania]]. Thus, Mounier has been attributed with indirectly originating the [[black legend]] about [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pius XII's alleged silence on the Holocaust]].<ref>[http://chiesa.espresso.repubblica.it/articolo/34104?eng=y The Black Legend of Pius XII Was Invented by a Catholic: Mounier]</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* ''La pens\u00e9e de Charles P\u00e9guy'', Plon, coll. \"Roseau d'Or\", 1931.\n* ''R\u00e9volution personnaliste et communautaire'', Paris, \u00c9d.

{"title_page": "Emmanuel Berl", "text_new": "'''Emmanuel Berl''' (2 August 1892 \u2013 21 September 1976) was a [[France|French]] [[journalist]], [[historian]] and [[essayist]]. He was born at [[Le V\u00e9sinet]] in the modern ''[[Departments of France|d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Yvelines]], and is buried in the [[Montparnasse Cemetery]], Paris. In 1937 he married the singer, composer and film actress [[Mireille Hartuch]]; she had nicknamed him \"Th\u00e9odore\" (which is what appears on their tomb). Berl was the cousin of [[Lisette de Brinon]].\n\n==Biography==\nEmmanuel Berl was from an upper middle class [[Jewish]] family related to [[Bergson]] and [[Proust]] and the novelist and screenwriter Monique Lange. He studied [[philosophy]] before  volunteering for the armed services in 1914. Discharged in 1917 with a respiratory disease after having received the [[Croix de guerre]] (or, war cross), he joined the [[surrealists]], especially working with [[Louis Aragon]], [[Gaston Bergery]] and his former schoolmate from the Lyc\u00e9e Carnot, [[Pierre Drieu La Rochelle]]. In 1927, Berl and La Rochelle published a short-lived periodical: ''Les Derniers Jours''.  In 1928, with \u00c9douard Berth, [[Marcel D\u00e9at]], [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]] and [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]], he took part in the editing of the ''Cahiers bleus'' which had just launched [[George Valois]]. The same year, he met [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]] to whom he dedicated his ''Mort de la pens\u00e9e bourgeoise'', a satire in which Emmanuel Berl called for a more committed culture and literature.\n\nDuring the 1930s, he entered politics on the side of the radicals.  After working for the weekly ''Monde'', in 1932 he launched the weekly ''Marianne'', which was the leading weekly on the left until the appearance of ''Vendredi'' in 1935.  In it, he defended a political line favourable to the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] but his intransigent [[pacifism]] and his equal refusal of both [[fascist]] and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]] led him to adopt [[heterodox]] positions and to show his curiosity and sympathies in [[neosocialism|neo-socialism]].  He clashed with the left because he favoured equipping France with a large and strong army.   He stated: \"''Je suis pour la force et contre la violence''\" (\"I am for force and against violence\").\n\nIn 1937, [[\u00c9ditions Gallimard]] sold ''Marianne''. Emmanuel Berl resigned from the paper and founded a new weekly: ''Le Pav\u00e9 de Paris'', which he led until the exodus from Paris in 1940.

Therefore, early on, his party often played a disproportionately important role in the formation of French governments, and he even led the cabinet in 1952 and from 1955 to 1956. Faure was a leader of the more conservative wing of the party, opposing the party's [[left-wing|left]], under [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nFaure's views changed during the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], and after initial opposition to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (he voted against presidential election by universal suffrage in the 1962 referendum), he eventually became a Gaullist. De Gaulle's party, the [[Gaullist Party|Union for the New Republic]], sent him on an unofficial mission to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1963. In government he served in successive ministries: Agriculture (1966\u20131968), National Education (1968\u20131969, where he was responsible for pushing through reform of the universities), and Social Affairs (1972\u20131973). He declined to be a candidate at the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], but supported [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] against the Gaullist candidate, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nHe had the reputation of a careerist and the nickname of \"weathercock\". He replied with humour, \"it is not the weathercock which turns; it is the wind!\"\n\nHe was a member of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] for the ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Jura (department)|Jura]] from 1946 to 1958, and for the ''d\u00e9partment'' of [[Doubs (department)|Doubs]] from 1967 to 1980. He presided over the [[French National Assembly]] from 1973 to 1978. He sought another term as Assembly President in 1978 but was defeated by Chaban-Delmas. Faure was a senator from 1959 to 1967 for Jura and again, in 1980, for Doubs. In 1978, he became a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn the regional, departmental and local levels, Edgar Faure was mayor of [[Port-Lesney]] (Jura) from 1947 to 1971 and from 1983 to 1988 and the mayor of [[Pontarlier]] between 1971 and 1977; he served as president of the General Council of the Jura ''d\u00e9partment'' from 1949 to 1967, then member of the General Council of the Doubs from 1967 to 1979, president of the council of the [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] ''[[R\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gion]]'' (1974\u20131981, 1982\u20131988).

At the end of the war, he served as French counsel for the prosecution at the [[Nuremberg Trials]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xHGdCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT78&lpg=PT78&dq=Edgar+Faure+French+counsel+for+the+prosecutor+at+the+Nuremberg+Trials.&source=bl&ots=jcBmxXZVgZ&sig=BmGF6I2BaO35EYONUyC6WtbeQqw&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Edgar%20Faure%20French%20counsel%20for%20the%20prosecutor%20at%20the%20Nuremberg%20Trials.&f=false|title=The Nuremberg Trials: The Nazis brought to justice|last=Macdonald|first=Alexander|date=2015-09-08|publisher=Arcturus Publishing|isbn=9781784281267|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, he was elected to the [[French Parliament]] as a Radical.<ref name=brit/> While the popularity of his party declined to less than 10% of the total vote, none of the other parties was able to gain a clear majority. Therefore, early on, his party often played a disproportionately important role in the formation of French governments, and he even led the cabinet in 1952 and from 1955 to 1956. Faure was a leader of the more conservative wing of the party, opposing the party's [[left-wing|left]], under [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nFaure's views changed during the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]], and after initial opposition to the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (he voted against presidential election by universal suffrage in the 1962 referendum), he eventually became a Gaullist. De Gaulle's party, the [[Gaullist Party|Union for the New Republic]], sent him on an unofficial mission to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1963. In government he served in successive ministries: Agriculture (1966\u20131968), National Education (1968\u20131969, where he was responsible for pushing through reform of the universities), and Social Affairs (1972\u20131973). He declined to be a candidate at the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], but supported [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] against the Gaullist candidate, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].\n\nHe had the reputation of a careerist and the nickname of \"weathercock\". He replied with humour, \"it is not the weathercock which turns; it is the wind!\"\n\nHe was a member of the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] for the ''d\u00e9partement'' of [[Jura (department)|Jura]] from 1946 to 1958, and for the ''d\u00e9partment'' of [[Doubs (department)|Doubs]] from 1967 to 1980. He presided over the [[French National Assembly]] from 1973 to 1978. He sought another term as Assembly President in 1978 but was defeated by Chaban-Delmas. Faure was a senator from 1959 to 1967 for Jura and again, in 1980, for Doubs. In 1978, he became a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nOn the regional, departmental and local levels, Edgar Faure was mayor of [[Port-Lesney]] (Jura) from 1947 to 1971 and from 1983 to 1988 and the mayor of [[Pontarlier]] between 1971 and 1977; he served as president of the General Council of the Jura ''d\u00e9partment'' from 1949 to 1967, then member of the General Council of the Doubs from 1967 to 1979, president of the council of the [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] ''[[R\u00e9gion in France|r\u00e9gion]]'' (1974\u20131981, 1982\u20131988).
