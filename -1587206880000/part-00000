So I guess I feel a bit analogous to what these songs become to me\u2014you know little ways for me to explore my record collection, explore the world of sound that I'm fascinated by, and also sometimes get a different perspective on memories and emotions I've been mulling over that they find voice in these songs\".<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nGotye revealed that the second single from the album, \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", was not lyrically the result of a single break-up. \"It wasn't about one specific relationship,\" explained De Backer in an interview, \"but it was definitely drawn from various experiences I've had in relationships breaking up, and in the parts of the more reflective parts of the song, in the aftermath and the memory of those different relationships and what they were and how they broke up and what's going on in everyone's minds. Yeah, so it's an amalgam of different feelings but not completely made up as such.\"<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nDespite the album's huge success, Gotye revealed in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone Australia]]'' that he initially battled with indecision and depression while making the album, which in turn became the subject matter of songs like \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (with a central theme of [[impostor syndrome]]) and \"Save Me\". He stated: \"There were points that I thought I wouldn't be able to finish a record I was really into or that I'd give up at some stage.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Treuen |first=Jason |url=http://jasontreuen.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/rolling-stone-gotyes-mad-world/ |title=Rolling Stone: Gotye's Mad World |work=[[Rolling Stone Australia]] |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an interview in ''The Age'', the track \"State of the Art\" is about a secondhand 1970s organ Gotye's parents purchased.

It included the hit \"[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]\", which reached and topped charts worldwide.

He claimed, \"The mirror reflects on artwork and it is all very related to self-reflection and introspection on the album.\"<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Gotye also revealed that the album would see a release in June or July 2011, with a single to precede the release,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> along with the fact that the album would be similar to its predecessor in terms of diversity.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> Gotye went on to reveal that the release of the album was delayed for over five months due to the composition and recording of a single track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gotye.com/news.html|title=News|work=Gotye|access-date=25 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924082621/http://gotye.com/news.html|archive-date=24 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOn 19 May 2011, it was announced that this album would be released on 19 August 2011, with the album to be launched the following day at the [[Sydney Opera House]] as part of the Graphic Festival, with animators and a ten-piece orchestra as part of Gotye's performance.<ref name=\"undercover.fm\">{{cite web|url=http://www.undercover.fm/news/14797-gotye-debuts-new-album-at-the-opera-house |title=Gotye Debuts New Album At The Opera House - Undercover.fm News |publisher=Undercover.fm |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=10 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907015200/http://www.undercover.fm/news/14797-gotye-debuts-new-album-at-the-opera-house |archivedate=7 September 2011 }}</ref> Gotye was also to issue a follow-up single to \"Eyes Wide Open\" titled \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", on 11 July 2011.<ref name=\"undercover.fm\"/> Upon the announcement of the track listing, Gotye also revealed that there would be a DVD accompanying the record which would include music videos and documentaries.<ref name=\"gotye.com\">{{cite web|url=http://gotye.com/|title=Home|work=Gotye|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222113644/http://gotye.com/|archivedate=22 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, controversy erupted on 5 July 2011, when the video for the new single, \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", was leaked online via the [[Austereo Radio Network]]'s [[Take 40 Australia|Take 40]] website.

It was eventually released as the fifth single from Making Mirrors in Australia on 27 February 2012.\n\n==Concept and themes==\nShortly before its release, Gotye spoke to the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] about the significance of the artwork, the title, and how it symbolises the creative and introspective process of recording the album; \"It's more about reflection - the look at yourself that a mirror offers and also the way it gives you a different perspective on things around you. So I guess I feel a bit analogous to what these songs become to me\u2014you know little ways for me to explore my record collection, explore the world of sound that I'm fascinated by, and also sometimes get a different perspective on memories and emotions I've been mulling over that they find voice in these songs\".<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nGotye revealed that the second single from the album, \"Somebody That I Used to Know\", was not lyrically the result of a single break-up. \"It wasn't about one specific relationship,\" explained De Backer in an interview, \"but it was definitely drawn from various experiences I've had in relationships breaking up, and in the parts of the more reflective parts of the song, in the after-math and the memory of those different relationships and what they were and how they broke up and what's going on in everyone's minds. Yeah, so it's an amalgam of different feelings but not completely made up as such.\"<ref name=\"abc.net.au\"/>\n\nDespite the album's huge success, Gotye revealed in an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone Australia]]'' that he initially battled with indecision and depression while making the album, which in turn became the subject matter of songs like \"Smoke and Mirrors\" (with a central theme of [[impostor syndrome]]) and \"Save Me\". He stated: \"There were points that I thought I wouldn't be able to finish a record I was really into or that I'd give up at some stage.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Treuen |first=Jason |url=http://jasontreuen.wordpress.com/2011/10/30/rolling-stone-gotyes-mad-world/ |title=Rolling Stone: Gotye's Mad World |work=[[Rolling Stone Australia]] |date=30 October 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAccording to an interview in ''The Age'', the track \"State of the Art\" is about a secondhand 1970s organ Gotye's parents purchased.
