The majority of the season was contested by the reigning champions, [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], along with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. The title was eventually won by Manchester United, after Liverpool and Newcastle's failure to win in their penultimate games of the season; at 75 points it is the lowest points total for a Premier League champion and lowest since the [[Three points for a win|3-1-0 points system]] was introduced in the [[1981\u201382 Football League|1981\u201382 season]].\n\n[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] \u2013 despite spending millions of pounds on high-profile foreign players like [[Emerson (footballer, born 1972)|Emerson]], [[Fabrizio Ravanelli]] (who scored 31 goals in all competitions), [[Branco (footballer)|Branco]] and [[Gianluca Festa]] \u2013 were relegated on the final day of the season and were on the losing side in both the FA Cup and League Cup finals. Middlesbrough finished in 19th place, but they would have been placed outside the relegation zone without a three-point deduction imposed for unilaterally postponing a December 1996 fixture at [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], with the Middlesbrough board blaming the decision on the absence of 23 players ill or injured.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4597743.stm \"Football's biggest punishments\".] Retrieved 20 September 2006.</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/funny_old_game/2592133.stm \"Funny Old Game|Happened on this day \u2013 20 December\".] Retrieved 20 September 2006.</ref> This sanction meant [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], who had been in the top division since 1967, finished in 17th place and avoided relegation. The decision was controversial and later resurfaced in 2006\u201307 when [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League#Relegation controversy|West Ham escaped a points deduction]] and subsequently avoided relegation.\n\nAnother relegation place went to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who sacked manager [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]] in December. [[Stuart Pearce]] took over as temporary player-manager, spending three months in charge and winning the January 1996 Manager of the Month award. In March, Pearce quit as manager to be replaced by [[Dave Bassett]], formerly of Crystal Palace. Also relegated, due to a 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon in their last game of the season, were Sunderland, who were leaving [[Roker Park]] after 99 years and relocating to the 42,000-seat [[Stadium of Light]] on the banks of the [[River Wear]] for the start of the 1997\u201398 season in [[Football League Championship|Division One]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1995\u201396 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (both teams returning to the top flight after a five-year absence) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (immediately returning to the top flight after a season's absence). This was also both Sunderland and Derby County's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], ending their top flight spells of seven, thirteen and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1996\u201397 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.509103 |long=-1.884786 |label_size=80|label=[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.728569 |long=-2.489206 |label_size=80|label=[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|{{nowrap|Blackburn Rovers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.448111 |long=-1.495611 |label_size=80|label=[[Coventry City F.C.|{{nowrap|Coventry City}}]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.914911 |long=-1.447233 |label_size=80|label=[[Derby County F.C.|{{nowrap|Derby County}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.611402 |long=-1.082508 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.578219 |long=-1.216822 |label_size=80|label=[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974    |long=-1.614    |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.939936 |long=-1.132886 |label_size=80|label=[[Nottingham Forest F.C.|{{nowrap|Nottingham Forest}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.370342 |long=-1.470853 |label_size=80|label=[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|{{nowrap|Sheffield Wednesday}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.914400 |long=-1.388200 |label_size=80|label=[[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]|position=bottom}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]<br/>\n[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]<br/>\n[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.531944 |long=0.039444|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.398333 |long=-0.085556|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!

The decision was controversial and later resurfaced in 2006\u201307 when [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League#Relegation controversy|West Ham escaped a points deduction]] and subsequently avoided relegation.\n\nAnother relegation place went to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who sacked manager [[Frank Clark (footballer)|Frank Clark]] in December. [[Stuart Pearce]] took over as temporary player-manager, spending three months in charge and winning the January 1996 Manager of the Month award. In March, Pearce quit as manager to be replaced by [[Dave Bassett]], formerly of Crystal Palace. Also relegated, due to a 1\u20130 defeat to Wimbledon in their last game of the season, were Sunderland, who were leaving [[Roker Park]] after 99 years and relocating to the 42,000-seat [[Stadium of Light]] on the banks of the [[River Wear]] for the start of the 1997\u201398 season in [[Football League Championship|Division One]].\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[1995\u201396 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (both teams returning to the top flight after a five-year absence) and [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] (immediately returning to the top flight after a season's absence). This was also both Sunderland and Derby County's first season in the Premier League. They replaced [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] and [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]], ending their top flight spells of seven, thirteen and one year respectively.\n\n===Stadiums and Locations===\n{{location map+ |England |width=440 |float=right |caption=Locations of the 1996\u201397 Premier League teams |places=\n{{location map~ |England |lat=51.5155|long=-0.0922|label_size=80|label=London|mark=Blue pog.svg|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.509103 |long=-1.884786 |label_size=80|label=[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.728569 |long=-2.489206 |label_size=80|label=[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|{{nowrap|Blackburn Rovers}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.448111 |long=-1.495611 |label_size=80|label=[[Coventry City F.C.|{{nowrap|Coventry City}}]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.914911 |long=-1.447233 |label_size=80|label=[[Derby County F.C.|{{nowrap|Derby County}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.438846 |long=-2.966285 |label_size=80|label=[[Everton F.C.|Everton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.704069 |long=-1.341731 |label_size=80|label=[[Leeds United F.C.|{{nowrap|Leeds United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.611402 |long=-1.082508 |label_size=80|label=[[Leicester City F.C.|{{nowrap|Leicester City}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.430845 |long=-2.960823 |label_size=80|label=[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]|position=bottom}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.47     |long=-2.25     |label_size=80|label=[[Manchester United F.C.|{{nowrap|Manchester&nbsp;United}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.578219 |long=-1.216822 |label_size=80|label=[[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]]\n|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.974    |long=-1.614    |label_size=80|label=[[Newcastle United F.C.|{{nowrap|Newcastle United}}]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=52.939936 |long=-1.132886 |label_size=80|label=[[Nottingham Forest F.C.|{{nowrap|Nottingham Forest}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=53.370342 |long=-1.470853 |label_size=80|label=[[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|{{nowrap|Sheffield Wednesday}}]]|position=right}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=50.905826 |long=-1.390975 |label_size=80|label=[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]|position=left}}\n{{location map~ |England |lat=54.914400 |long=-1.388200 |label_size=80|label=[[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]|position=bottom}}\n\n<!--DISPLAY OF LONDON TEAMS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER-->\n{{Location map~ |England |mark=TransparentPlaceholder.png |marksize=1 |lat=55.7 |long=-0.2 |label_size=80|label='''[[Football in London|London]]&nbsp;teams:'''<br />\n[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<br />\n[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]<br />\n[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham&nbsp;Hotspur]]<br/>\n[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]<br/>\n[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]\n|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+|Greater London\n |width=300\n |float=right\n |caption=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |alt=Greater London Premier League football clubs\n |places =\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.552 |long=-0.097 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=left}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.481667 |long=-0.191111 |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n {{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.5974   |long=-0.0716   |mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|{{nowrap|Tottenham<br />Hotspur}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.531944 |long=0.039444|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[West Ham United F.C.|{{nowrap|West Ham United}}]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ |Greater London |lat=51.398333 |long=-0.085556|mark=Blue pog.svg |label='''[[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]]'''|label_size=75|marksize=|position=right}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n!

It melded top 40 hits (omitting some teen-oriented songs) with an adult delivery by its high-profile air staff. The day started with ''The B-100 [[Morning zoo|Morning Zoo]]'' starring Bobby Rich, Scott Kenyon, Pat Gaffey, and Frank Anthony \u2014 collectively known as \"The Rich Brothers\". Other personalities from this era included Gary Kelley, Gene Knight (who is now heard on [[KXSN]]), Danny Romero (who eventually landed at [[KABC-TV]] in Los Angeles), [[Ellen K|Ellen K. Thomas]], and John Fox.\n\nJeff and Jer became the new [[morning drive]] hosts at B-100 in 1991, but would leave in April 1993 for [[KLNV|KKLQ-FM]]. Replacing them were John Landers and Jools Brandt, followed by Larry Himmel, who had also succeeded \"Shotgun\" Tom Kelly in mornings on B-100 in 1979. After Jeff and Jer departed, the station's ratings began to decline.\n\n====Star 100.7====\nOn May 16, 1994, Midwest Television announced that KFMB-FM would change formats. After the announcement, the station began a 3-week [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunt]] dubbed \"The Great Radio Experiment\", where the station tested formats such as all-[[1970s in music|1970s hits]], [[Country music|country]], all-[[Elvis]], [[modern rock]], \"party songs\", an \"[[MTV]]\"-style [[top 40]] format, [[classic rock]], all-[[Motown]], and [[children's music]], each lasting for a day, and allowed listeners to vote for the new format.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-05-13.pdf |title='San Diego's Great Radio Experiment' Begins! |magazine=Radio & Records |page=15 |date=May 13, 1994 |access-date=July 28, 2018 }}</ref> On June 6 at midnight, KFMB-FM relaunched as \"Star 100.7\" and retained the hot AC format, though with a more current and upbeat focus than B-100.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-06-10.pdf |title=BDS: Far From Reality |magazine=Radio & Records |page=14 |date=June 10, 1994 |access-date=July 28, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nStar 100.7 was a personality-oriented station, with an initial air staff made up of Shawn Ireland and Donna Davis in mornings, Kim Morrison in middays, Dave Smiley in afternoons, Dominica in evenings, and China More in overnights. Later on, the station's air staff consisted of Jeff and Jer (who returned in May 1997) in mornings, Anita Rush in middays, [[XHRM-FM]] morning hosts Jagger and Kristi in afternoons (after they left for [[KMYI]] in 2002, they would be replaced with Gregg Simms, Jen Sewell and Sara Kiani), and Ricky Lopez at nights (who would later be replaced with a repeat of Jeff and Jer dubbed ''Jeff and Jer Primetime''). The station also aired the ''[[The Bob and Sheri Show|Bob and Sheri]]'' [[radio syndication|syndicated]] morning drive show in the early morning hours for a brief period in late 2004 and early 2005 (the show broadcasts from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]).\n\n===100.7 Jack FM===\n[[File:1007jackfmlogo.png|250px|thumb|left|Logo as \"100.7 Jack FM\"]]\n\"Star 100.7\" continued until April 6, 2005 at 9:55 a.m., when the station began stunting with a five-minute ticking clock and a mysterious voice saying \"closer...closer\", which ended with an alarm going off and a female announcer saying \"Bye Star\".

In April 2014, [[Mediabase]] added KFMB-FM to its hot AC panel, reflecting its shift from adult hits to a modern rock-leaning hot AC format.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/128957/mediabase-announces-panel-changes |title=Mediabase Announces Panel Changes |website=AllAccess |publisher=All Access Music Group |date=April 22, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n====Morning shows on Jack: Monique and the Man; The DSC====\nTypically, Jack FM stations do not have disc jockeys. However, in September 2005, KFMB-FM conducted a nationwide search for morning show talent, with the winner receiving a $1-million, five-year contract. The station chose [[Hispanic]] comedian Monique Marvez and former Star 100.7 DJs Greg and Sara. The show was called ''Monique and the Man''; Greg was the 'Man' and Sara was a co-host. The show started on January 23, 2006 and ended in 2009. KFMB-FM had no morning show until ''Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw'' took over on August 2, 2010. The show, previously on KGB-FM, helped boost the station's morning ratings.\n\n===100.7 KFM-BFM===\nOn October 6, 2015, Midwest Television announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with Local Media San Diego LLC, which operates three stations [[City of license|licensed]] to [[Tijuana]] but broadcasting in English for the San Diego [[media market]]: [[XETRA-FM]] (91.1 FM), [[XHITZ-FM]] (90.3 FM), and [[XHRM-FM]] (92.5 FM).

The day started with ''The B-100 [[Morning zoo|Morning Zoo]]'' starring Bobby Rich, Scott Kenyon, Pat Gaffey, and Frank Anthony \u2014 collectively known as \"The Rich Brothers\".

The station also aired the ''[[The Bob and Sheri Show|Bob and Sheri]]'' [[radio syndication|syndicated]] morning drive show in the early morning hours for a brief period in late 2004 and early 2005 (the show broadcasts from [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] in the [[Eastern Time Zone]]).\n\n===100.7 Jack FM===\n[[File:1007jackfmlogo.png|250px|thumb|left|Logo as \"100.7 Jack FM\"]]\n\"Star 100.7\" continued until April 6, 2005 at 9:55 a.m., when the station began stunting with a five-minute ticking clock and a mysterious voice saying \"closer...closer\", which ended with an alarm going off and a female announcer saying \"Bye Star\".

However, in September 2005, KFMB-FM conducted a nationwide search for morning show talent, with the winner receiving a $1-million, five-year contract. The station chose [[Hispanic]] comedian Monique Marvez and former Star 100.7 DJs Greg and Sara. The show was called ''Monique and the Man''; Greg was the 'Man' and Sara was a co-host. The show started on January 23, 2006 and ended in 2009. KFMB-FM had no morning show until ''Dave, Shelly and Chainsaw'' took over on August 2, 2010.

By 1520 a succession of weak emperors had brought the country into a state of civil war (see [[L\u00ea Dynasty#Civil war|L\u00ea Dynasty's civil war]]). For the next 20 years the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] and [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords|Nguy\u1ec5n]] clans fought as allies against the usurper [[M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung]] who took the throne of the emperor [[L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng]]. When L\u00ea dynasty was restored in 1533,The [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] still in the power and retreated to [[Cao Bang]] gradually. Both [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] and [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords|Nguy\u1ec5n]] joined together as the alliance to against the M\u1ea1c dynasty to restore fully territory of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to L\u00ea. In theory, they both were fighting on behalf of the L\u00ea Emperor [[L\u00ea Trang T\u00f4ng]] but in reality, the Emperor was a figurehead with little or no power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Apart==\nThe prime mover in the period from 1525 onwards was [[Nguyen Kim]]. His daughter married the young head of the Tr\u1ecbnh family [[Trinh Kiem]]. Around 1530, the rebels of Le Dynasty royalist were forced into exile in Lan Xang (modern-day [[Laos]]) but they gathered a new army and captured some southern provinces of [[Dai Viet]]. In 1545, Nguyen Kim and subsequently his eldest son [[Nguyen Uong]] was assassinated and his son-in-law, Trinh Kiem, took control over the Royal army after that. 13 years later (in 1558) Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m gave the rulership over the southernmost province of [[Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province|Quang Nam]] to [[Nguyen Hoang]], the second son of Nguyen Kim and his wife's brother. The suspicious causes of death of his father and brother and the takeover of his brother in law probably caused bitter resentment in Nguyen Hoang and the later rivalry between the 2 families. For the next 55 years, Nguyen Hoang ruled [[Quang Nam]]. He gradually asserted his control over the province and extended his control south into the remaining [[Champa]] lands. Periodically, he sent military forces north to help the Trinh in their long fight against the M\u1ea1c dynasty. In 1570 Trinh Kiem died and was succeeded by his second son [[Trinh Tung]], a vigorous leader who captured [[Hanoi]] from the M\u1ea1c king in 1572. However, the M\u1ea1c emperor ([[Mac Mau Hop]]) recaptured the city the next year. 20 years later, Trinh Tung, again captured Hanoi and executed [[Mac Mau Hop]] in 1592. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1593, Nguyen Hoang went personally to the court, bringing money and an army to help destroy the remaining Mac armies. Once the M\u1ea1c were defeated, Nguyen Hoang held the office of Grand Vizier for the next 7 years. However, his nephew Trinh Tung became increasingly wary of Nguyen Hoang's influence in the court and tried to put him under surveillance by having Ho\u00e0ng near him at all time. Nguyen Hoang adopted Trinh Tung's 2 important generals as his nephews and incited them to rebel against their commander. When the rebels stormed the court, Trinh Tung fled with the Emperor while Ho\u00e0ng took to the Southern Provinces, never to return. In 1600 the old Nguyen ruler broke relations with the [[Trinh]] court and titled himself as the ''Vuong'' (a term meaning prince or king). Hoang died in 1613.\nThe new leader of the Nguyen, [[Nguyen Phuc Nguyen]], continued his father's policy of defiance, but also initiated friendly relations with the Europeans sailing into the area. A foreign trading post was set up in [[Hoi An]]. By 1615 the Nguyen were producing their own bronze cannons with the aid of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] engineers. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==The first campaign==\n[[Image:Vietnam1650.GIF|250px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing (roughly) the areas controlled by the Tr\u1ecbnh, Nguy\u1ec5n, M\u1ea1c, and Champa about the year 1640]]\nIn 1620, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean officially refused to send taxes to the court in Hanoi. A formal demand was made to the Nguy\u1ec5n to submit to the authority of the court, and it was formally refused. In 1623 Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f9ng died and was succeeded by his son [[Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng]]. Now Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng made a formal demand for submission, and again Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean refused. Finally in 1627 open warfare broke out between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n. For four months a large Tr\u1ecbnh army battled against the Nguy\u1ec5n army but were unable to defeat them. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The result of this war was that Vietnam had effectively been partitioned into [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern and southern]] regions, with the Tr\u1ecbnh controlling most of the north and the Nguy\u1ec5n controlling most of the south; the dividing line was the [[Gianh River]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]]. This border was very close to the [[17th parallel north|Seventeenth parallel]] (in actuality the [[B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River]] located just to the south in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]), which was imposed as the border between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Partition of Vietnam]] (1954\u201375). {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nWhile the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled over a much more populous territory, the Nguy\u1ec5n had several advantages. First, they were on the defensive. Second, the Nguy\u1ec5n were able to take advantage of their contacts with the Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, to purchase advanced European weapons and hire European military experts in fortifications. Third, the geography was favorable to them, as the flat land suitable for large organized armies is very narrow at this point of Vietnam; the mountains nearly reach to the sea. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nAfter the first assault, the Nguy\u1ec5n built two massive fortified lines which stretched a few miles from the sea to the hills. The walls were built north of [[Hu\u1ebf]] near the city of [[\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi]]. The Nguy\u1ec5n defended these lines against numerous Tr\u1ecbnh offensives which lasted till 1672.<ref name=Dupuy/> The story from this time is that the great military engineer was a Vietnamese general who was hired away from the Tr\u1ecbnh court by the Nguy\u1ec5n. This man is given the credit in Vietnam for the successful design of the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. Against the walls the Tr\u1ecbnh mustered an army of 100,000 men, 500 elephants, and 500 large ships (Dupuy \"Encyclopedia of Military History\" pg. 596). The initial attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n wall was unsuccessful. The attacks lasted for several years. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Later campaigns==\n[[Image:VN rifles.jpg|350px|left|thumb|Upper:Goa style arquebuses - Probably were widespread in Vietnam during the 17th century]]\n\nIn 1633 the Tr\u1ecbnh tried an amphibious assault on the Nguy\u1ec5n to get around the wall. The Tr\u1ecbnh fleet was defeated by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet at the battle of Nhat-Le.<ref name=Dupuy/> Around 1635 the Tr\u1ecbnh copied the Nguy\u1ec5n and sought military aid from the Europeans. Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng hired the Dutch to make cannons and ships for the Royal army. In 1642-43, the Tr\u1ecbnh army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. With the aid of the Dutch cannons, the Tr\u1ecbnh army broke through the first wall but failed to break through the second. At sea, the Tr\u1ecbnh, with their Dutch ships ''[[Kievit]]'', ''Nachtegaels'' and ''[[Woekende Book]]'' were destroyed in a humiliating defeat by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet with their Chinese style galleys.<ref>Reid p. 230.</ref><ref>Hoang, p. 83.</ref><ref>Wiest, p. 23.</ref><ref>Li, p. 96.</ref><ref>Weiss, p. 176.</ref> Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng staged yet another offensive in 1648 but at the battle of Truong Duc, the Royal army was badly beaten by the Nguy\u1ec5n.<ref name=Dupuy/> The new L\u00ea king died around this time, perhaps as a result of the defeat. This now left the door open for the Nguy\u1ec5n to finally go on the offensive. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Nguy\u1ec5n offensive==\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n launched their own invasion of northern Vietnam in 1653. The Nguy\u1ec5n army attacked north and defeated the weakened Royal army. [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]] was captured. Then [[H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province]] fell to the Nguy\u1ec5n army. In the following year, Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng died as Nguy\u1ec5n forces made attacks into [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]]. Under a new Tr\u1ecbnh Lord, the capable [[Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c]], the Royal army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n army and defeated it. The Nguy\u1ec5n were fatally weakened by a division between their two top generals who refused to cooperate with each other. In 1656 the Nguy\u1ec5n army was driven back all the way to their original walls. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c tried to break the walls of the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1661 but this attack, like so many before it, failed to break through the walls. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==The end of the fight==\nIn 1672, the Tr\u1ecbnh army made a last effort to conquer the Nguy\u1ec5n. The attacking army was under the command of Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c's son, [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n]], while the defending army was under the command of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n]]'s son Prince [[:vi:T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Hi\u1ec7p (t\u01b0\u1edbng ch\u00faa Nguy\u1ec5n)|Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1eadn]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The attack, like all the previous attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n walls, failed. This time the two sides agreed to a peace. With mediation supplied by the government of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n finally agreed to end the fighting by making the [[Linh River]] the border between their lands (1673). Although the Nguy\u1ec5n nominally accepted the L\u00ea King as the ruler of Vietnam, the reality was, the Nguy\u1ec5n ruled the south, and the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled the north. This division continued for the next 100 years. The border between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n was strongly guarded but peaceful.\n{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Conquest of Hu\u1ebf - 1775==\nThe long peace came to an end in 1774. At the time, the Nguy\u1ec5n were under heavy assault from [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] army and part of their force had been defeated in recent fighting in [[Cambodia]]. The result was, the army in the north defending Hu\u1ebf was weak. [[Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m|Tr\u1ecbnh Sam]], one of the last Tr\u1ecbnh Lords and ruler of the north, launched his attack on the Nguy\u1ec5n on 15 November 1774. For the first time, the Nguy\u1ec5n walls were broken and captured. In February 1775, the Nguy\u1ec5n capital of Hu\u1ebf was captured by the Royal (Tr\u1ecbnh) army. After some fighting with the army of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n, a treaty was signed and the Tr\u1ecbnh army left the destruction of the Nguy\u1ec5n to the southern rebels. A dozen years later the Tr\u1ecbnh Lords would be thrown out of Vietnam by the youngest and most popular of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:ThuyenchienDaiViet2.JPG|left|200 px|thumb|The model of a riverine warship (''[[M\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ed3ng]])'' during Tr\u1ecbnh's era in XVII.]]\n\n==Legacy==\nTo fight against the larger and more powerful Imperial army under Tr\u1ecbnh clan, Nguy\u1ec5n lords actively expanded their territory to the South into the former land of the Champa empire.

By 1520 a succession of weak emperors had brought the country into a state of civil war (see [[L\u00ea Dynasty#Civil war|L\u00ea Dynasty's civil war]]). For the next 20 years the [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] and [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords|Nguy\u1ec5n]] clans fought as allies against the usurper [[M\u1ea1c \u0110\u0103ng Dung]] who took the throne of the emperor [[L\u00ea Cung Ho\u00e0ng]]. When L\u00ea dynasty was restored in 1533,The [[M\u1ea1c dynasty]] still in the power and retreated to [[Cao Bang]] gradually. Both [[Tr\u1ecbnh lords|Tr\u1ecbnh]] and [[Nguy\u1ec5n lords|Nguy\u1ec5n]] joined together as the alliance to against the M\u1ea1c dynasty to restore fully territory of \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t to L\u00ea. In theory, they both were fighting on behalf of the L\u00ea Emperor [[L\u00ea Trang T\u00f4ng]] but in reality, the Emperor was a figurehead with little or no power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Apart==\nThe prime mover in the period from 1525 onwards was [[Nguyen Kim]]. His daughter married the young head of the Tr\u1ecbnh family [[Trinh Kiem]]. Around 1530, the rebels of Le Dynasty royalist were forced into exile in Lan Xang (modern-day [[Laos]]) but they gathered a new army and captured some southern provinces of [[Dai Viet]]. In 1545, Nguyen Kim and subsequently his eldest son [[Nguyen Uong]] was assassinated and his son-in-law, Trinh Kiem, took control over the Royal army after that. 13 years later (in 1558) Tr\u1ecbnh Ki\u1ec3m gave the rulership over the southernmost province of [[Qu\u1ea3ng Nam Province|Quang Nam]] to [[Nguyen Hoang]], the second son of Nguyen Kim and his wife's brother. The suspicious causes of death of his father and brother and the takeover of his brother in law probably caused bitter resentment in Nguyen Hoang and the later rivalry between the 2 families. For the next 55 years, Nguyen Hoang ruled [[Quang Nam]]. He gradually asserted his control over the province and extended his control south into the remaining [[Champa]] lands. Periodically, he sent military forces north to help the Trinh in their long fight against the M\u1ea1c dynasty. In 1570 Trinh Kiem died and was succeeded by his second son [[Trinh Tung]], a vigorous leader who captured [[Hanoi]] from the M\u1ea1c king in 1572. However, the M\u1ea1c emperor ([[Mac Mau Hop]]) recaptured the city the next year. 20 years later, Trinh Tung, again captured Hanoi and executed [[Mac Mau Hop]] in 1592. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nIn 1593, Nguyen Hoang went personally to the court, bringing money and an army to help destroy the remaining Mac armies. Once the M\u1ea1c were defeated, Nguyen Hoang held the office of Grand Vizier for the next 7 years. However, his nephew Trinh Tung became increasingly wary of Nguyen Hoang's influence in the court and tried to put him under surveillance by having Ho\u00e0ng near him at all time. Nguyen Hoang adopted Trinh Tung's 2 important generals as his nephews and incited them to rebel against their commander. When the rebels stormed the court, Trinh Tung fled with the Emperor while Ho\u00e0ng took to the Southern Provinces, never to return. In 1600 the old Nguyen ruler broke relations with the [[Trinh]] court and titled himself as the ''Vuong'' (a term meaning prince or king). Hoang died in 1613.\nThe new leader of the Nguyen, [[Nguyen Phuc Nguyen]], continued his father's policy of defiance, but also initiated friendly relations with the Europeans sailing into the area. A foreign trading post was set up in [[Hoi An]]. By 1615 the Nguyen were producing their own bronze cannons with the aid of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] engineers. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==The first campaign==\n[[Image:Vietnam1650.GIF|250px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing (roughly) the areas controlled by the Tr\u1ecbnh, Nguy\u1ec5n, M\u1ea1c, and Champa about the year 1640]]\nIn 1620, Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean officially refused to send taxes to the court in Hanoi. A formal demand was made to the Nguy\u1ec5n to submit to the authority of the court, and it was formally refused. In 1623 Tr\u1ecbnh T\u00f9ng died and was succeeded by his son [[Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng]]. Now Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng made a formal demand for submission, and again Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Nguy\u00ean refused. Finally in 1627 open warfare broke out between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n. For four months a large Tr\u1ecbnh army battled against the Nguy\u1ec5n army but were unable to defeat them. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The result of this war was that Vietnam had effectively been partitioned into [[Northern and southern Vietnam|northern and southern]] regions, with the Tr\u1ecbnh controlling most of the north and the Nguy\u1ec5n controlling most of the south; the dividing line was the [[Gianh River]] in [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]]. This border was very close to the [[17th parallel north|Seventeenth parallel]] (in actuality the [[B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River]] located just to the south in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]), which was imposed as the border between [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Partition of Vietnam]] (1954\u201375). {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nWhile the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled over a much more populous territory, the Nguy\u1ec5n had several advantages. First, they were on the defensive. Second, the Nguy\u1ec5n were able to take advantage of their contacts with the Europeans, specifically the Portuguese, to purchase advanced European weapons and hire European military experts in fortifications. Third, the geography was favorable to them, as the flat land suitable for large organized armies is very narrow at this point of Vietnam; the mountains nearly reach to the sea. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nAfter the first assault, the Nguy\u1ec5n built two massive fortified lines which stretched a few miles from the sea to the hills. The walls were built north of [[Hu\u1ebf]] near the city of [[\u0110\u1ed3ng H\u1edbi]]. The Nguy\u1ec5n defended these lines against numerous Tr\u1ecbnh offensives which lasted till 1672.<ref name=Dupuy/> The story from this time is that the great military engineer was a Vietnamese general who was hired away from the Tr\u1ecbnh court by the Nguy\u1ec5n. This man is given the credit in Vietnam for the successful design of the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. Against the walls the Tr\u1ecbnh mustered an army of 100,000 men, 500 elephants, and 500 large ships (Dupuy \"Encyclopedia of Military History\" pg. 596). The initial attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n wall was unsuccessful. The attacks lasted for several years. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Later campaigns==\n[[Image:VN rifles.jpg|350px|left|thumb|Upper:Goa style arquebuses - Probably were widespread in Vietnam during the 17th century]]\n\nIn 1633 the Tr\u1ecbnh tried an amphibious assault on the Nguy\u1ec5n to get around the wall. The Tr\u1ecbnh fleet was defeated by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet at the battle of Nhat-Le.<ref name=Dupuy/> Around 1635 the Tr\u1ecbnh copied the Nguy\u1ec5n and sought military aid from the Europeans. Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng hired the Dutch to make cannons and ships for the Royal army. In 1642-43, the Tr\u1ecbnh army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n walls. With the aid of the Dutch cannons, the Tr\u1ecbnh army broke through the first wall but failed to break through the second. At sea, the Tr\u1ecbnh, with their Dutch ships ''[[Kievit]]'', ''Nachtegaels'' and ''[[Woekende Book]]'' were destroyed in a humiliating defeat by the Nguy\u1ec5n fleet with their Chinese style galleys.<ref>Reid p. 230.</ref><ref>Hoang, p. 83.</ref><ref>Wiest, p. 23.</ref><ref>Li, p. 96.</ref><ref>Weiss, p. 176.</ref> Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng staged yet another offensive in 1648 but at the battle of Truong Duc, the Royal army was badly beaten by the Nguy\u1ec5n.<ref name=Dupuy/> The new L\u00ea king died around this time, perhaps as a result of the defeat. This now left the door open for the Nguy\u1ec5n to finally go on the offensive. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Nguy\u1ec5n offensive==\nThe Nguy\u1ec5n launched their own invasion of northern Vietnam in 1653. The Nguy\u1ec5n army attacked north and defeated the weakened Royal army. [[Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh Province]] was captured. Then [[H\u00e0 T\u0129nh Province]] fell to the Nguy\u1ec5n army. In the following year, Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng died as Nguy\u1ec5n forces made attacks into [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]]. Under a new Tr\u1ecbnh Lord, the capable [[Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c]], the Royal army attacked the Nguy\u1ec5n army and defeated it. The Nguy\u1ec5n were fatally weakened by a division between their two top generals who refused to cooperate with each other. In 1656 the Nguy\u1ec5n army was driven back all the way to their original walls. Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c tried to break the walls of the Nguy\u1ec5n in 1661 but this attack, like so many before it, failed to break through the walls. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==The end of the fight==\nIn 1672, the Tr\u1ecbnh army made a last effort to conquer the Nguy\u1ec5n. The attacking army was under the command of Tr\u1ecbnh T\u1ea1c's son, [[Tr\u1ecbnh C\u0103n]], while the defending army was under the command of [[Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac T\u1ea7n]]'s son Prince [[:vi:T\u00f4n Th\u1ea5t Hi\u1ec7p (t\u01b0\u1edbng ch\u00faa Nguy\u1ec5n)|Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Thu\u1eadn]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The attack, like all the previous attacks on the Nguy\u1ec5n walls, failed. This time the two sides agreed to a peace. With mediation supplied by the government of the [[Kangxi Emperor]], the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n finally agreed to end the fighting by making the [[Linh River]] the border between their lands (1673). Although the Nguy\u1ec5n nominally accepted the L\u00ea King as the ruler of Vietnam, the reality was, the Nguy\u1ec5n ruled the south, and the Tr\u1ecbnh ruled the north. This division continued for the next 100 years. The border between the Tr\u1ecbnh and the Nguy\u1ec5n was strongly guarded but peaceful.\n{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n==Conquest of Hu\u1ebf - 1775==\nThe long peace came to an end in 1774. At the time, the Nguy\u1ec5n were under heavy assault from [[T\u00e2y S\u01a1n]] army and part of their force had been defeated in recent fighting in [[Cambodia]]. The result was, the army in the north defending Hu\u1ebf was weak. [[Tr\u1ecbnh S\u00e2m|Tr\u1ecbnh Sam]], one of the last Tr\u1ecbnh Lords and ruler of the north, launched his attack on the Nguy\u1ec5n on 15 November 1774. For the first time, the Nguy\u1ec5n walls were broken and captured. In February 1775, the Nguy\u1ec5n capital of Hu\u1ebf was captured by the Royal (Tr\u1ecbnh) army. After some fighting with the army of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n, a treaty was signed and the Tr\u1ecbnh army left the destruction of the Nguy\u1ec5n to the southern rebels. A dozen years later the Tr\u1ecbnh Lords would be thrown out of Vietnam by the youngest and most popular of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n brothers.  {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n[[File:ThuyenchienDaiViet2.JPG|left|200 px|thumb|The model of riverine warship (''[[M\u00f4ng \u0110\u1ed3ng]])'' during Tr\u1ecbnh's era in XVII.]]\n\n==Legacy==\nTo fight against the larger and more powerful Imperial army under Tr\u1ecbnh clan, Nguy\u1ec5n lords actively expanded their territory to the South into the former land of the Champa empire. They annexed much of the area that is now the southern half of Vietnam. Both sides were enthusiastic in foreign technologies and welcoming to outsiders. From foreign traders, craftsmen and mercenaries (mostly from Portugal, Holland, China and Japan), both sides acquired advanced civil and military technologies such as mechanics, shipbuilding and artillery construction, as well as cultural and religious elements.

The original Ferndale High School was played by a North Shore college until the studio relocated.\nWhen cast members are hired their contracts are either 4&nbsp;days, 1&nbsp;week, 2&nbsp;weeks, 6&nbsp;weeks, 6&nbsp;months or a year.\n\nWhile the name Shortland Street is based on an actual street in Auckland CBD, the only place where the scenes are actually filmed in Auckland CBD is the fictitious Q Road, which is the actual [[Karangahape Road]], better known as K' Rd.\n\n[[HDTV|High definition]] production of Shortland Street started in early 2011, with the first HD episode broadcast on 18 April 2011 on the [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview HD]] and [[Sky Network Television|Sky]] platforms.\n\nOn 24 July 2018 It was announced that the show will air six nights a week starting in September 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/news/entertainment/shortland-street-to-air-six-nights-a-week/|title=Shortland Street to air six nights a week|last=Herald|first=NZ|access-date=2018-07-25}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 March 2020, due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the show was reduced to three nights a week, as production was postponed.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/shortland-street-air-monday-wednesday-due-coronavirus-disruption |title=Shortland Street to air from Monday to Wednesday due to coronavirus disruption |date=23 March 2020 |work=TVNZ |access-date=5 April 2020 |language=en-NZ}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nThe show has had a reputation for being raunchy and controversial with the very first episode of the show featuring a sex scene between resident \"Dr. Love\" [[Chris Warner]] and his aerobics instructor.

Six months later in April 1994 to 2000, it was shown in an early evening timeslot, first at 17:10-17:40 and, later at 17:30\u201318:00. Eventually the serial was moved back to the lunchtime slot, 13:00\u201313:30, from 12 June 2000 and it remained here for over two years.\n\n[[Meridian Broadcasting|Meridian]] become the second region to start the series in mid 1993 around early afternoons until late 2002. Anglia start in April 1994 and followed central pattern, of the 17.10 slot, dropped the series around 2000.\n\nFrom May 1994, Border, Granada started showing the series as a replacement for ''[[A Country Practice]]'', broadcast in the afternoons, at the own pace, although did use the early-evening example. In January 1995, Tyne tees and Yorkshire started the series as a replacement for ''[[The Young Doctors]]''. By 1999, Granada, [[Yorkshire Television]] and Tyne tees dropped the series entirely, opting for local programming instead, while Border switched the series to 17.10 slot  by 2001 it was back in the afternoon slot until it dropped in the summer of 2003.\n\n[[Grampian Television]] also started the series in 1994 but it was dropped in late 1998.  [[Scottish Television]] have never shown ''Shortland Street''.\n[[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] started the series in August 1994, showing the series in the afternoons, at the own piece, including early-evening example for a short time. The series was dropped in early 2000 but reappeared in by May 2000.\n\nFrom January 2003, the [[Carlton Television|Carlton]]-owned ITV regions including [[ITV Central|Central Television]], [[ITV Westcountry|Westcountry]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] and Carlton-London [[networked]] ''Shortland Street'' in an afternoon slot, 1430\u20131500, Monday to Wednesday, with a Thursday episode added a few months later. A special programme was aired (presented by [[Michael Galvin]] and [[Angela Bloomfield]]) introducing new viewers from [[ITV Westcountry|Westcountry]] and Carlton-London to the show. However, ''Shortland Street'' failed to attract a significant audience in its new afternoon slot and it was axed completely by ITV and was last shown on 28 August 2003, finishing at episode 2367.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shortlandst.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/NEWS.htm|title=Shortland Street News|publisher=blueyonder.co.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223161802/http://www.shortlandst.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/NEWS.htm|archivedate=23 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Central had shown the serial consecutively for over 10&nbsp;years.\n\n''Shortland Street'' returned to British screens on 23 August 2010, when [[Sky Living|Living]] began airing two episodes a day from the 2007 season with episodes 3736/3737 which originally aired in New Zealand on 21/22 May 2007 beginning on 23 August 2010 at 15.00\u201316.00 (and repeated at 10.00 the following morning).

The series centers on the monster hunter [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and his efforts to avenge his mother's murder. Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series, new characters with unique skills are available.\n\nThe series alludes to [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Hideki Kamiya created ''Devil May Cry'' after a failed attempt to develop a ''[[Resident Evil]]''; Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features, something which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]] and writer [[Bingo Morihashi]]. Capcom announced a new game, ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' (developed by [[Ninja Theory]] and Capcom), during the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. A high-definition remastering of the three [[PlayStation 2]] titles was released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012, and in 2018 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]. The latest game is ''[[Devil May Cry 5]]'', which was released on March 8, 2019.\n\nThe series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to  [[comic book]]s, [[novelization]]s, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of [[action figure]]s. Critical response to the gameplay [[Combo (video games)|combos]] has been positive, although the games' narrative was considered simple until the third installment.\n\n==<span id=\"Overview\"></span>Game overview==\n{{Video game timeline\n| 2001 = ''Devil May Cry''\n| 2003 = ''Devil May Cry 2''\n| 2005 = ''Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening''\n| 2008 = Devil May Cry 4''\n| 2012 = ''Devil May Cry HD Collection''\n| 2013 = ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]''\n| 2019 = ''Devil May Cry 5''\n}}\n* ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]'': Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly-stylized combat; a high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings, while avoiding damage. Although the game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action. In later games, the system was modified; players had to vary their attacks to maintain their style rank. The style rank is graded during combat with letters: from worst to best, D, C, B, A, and S. They are also represented by words beginning with the first letter of the class: \"Dull\" for D, for example. The third game introduced \"SS\" and \"SSS\" ranks, and player performance on each [[Level (video gaming)|level]] is ranked similarly.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref> The Devil Trigger enables a player's character to assume a devilish form with additional powers (based on their current weapon), while the character's strength and speed increase and health is slowly restored.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'' [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] is generally the games' lead character, although most of the games offer other playable characters. The ability to perform combination attacks in mid-air and evasion and weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen.\n[[File:Devilmaycrygameplay.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot|Dante attacks an enemy with the sword Alastor. The word \"Cool!\" assesses the player's performance in combat.]]\n* ''[[Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening]]'' added a selection of gameplay styles, allowing the player to focus on favorite techniques or weapons: swords (swordmaster), guns (gunslinger), evasion (trickster) or defense (royal guard). Each of the four styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to cycle through a character's melee weaponry (Devil Arms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles |title=List of styles in Devil May Cry 3 |publisher=devilmaycry.org |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917091001/http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles/ |archivedate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game was re-released as ''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition'' with new skills for Dante and the ability to play as Vergil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition Review|author=Dunhan, Jeremy|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310023352/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' had a major innovation: Nero's (the main character) Devil Bringer arm, which gives players the ability to pull distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed.

Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing a number of hellgates, sealing Temen-Ni-Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and the aid of a powerful priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and Vergil.\n\nThe plot begins with ''Devil May Cry 3'', a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil.<ref>''Arkham:'' Is your name Dante?

Dante's dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is joined by [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lady|Lady]], who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge.<ref>''Jester:'' It was quite a ride, you know!

\u30af\u30e9\u30a4|Debiru Mei Kurai|lead=yes}} is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[hack and slash]] video game series developed and published by [[Capcom]] and created by [[Hideki Kamiya]]. The series centers on the demon hunter [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] and his efforts to avenge his mother's murder. Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series, new characters with unique skills are available.\n\nThe series alludes to [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Hideki Kamiya created ''Devil May Cry'' after a failed attempt to develop a ''[[Resident Evil]]''; Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features, something which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by [[Hideaki Itsuno]] and writer [[Bingo Morihashi]]. Capcom announced a new game, ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]'' (developed by [[Ninja Theory]] and Capcom), during the 2010 [[Tokyo Game Show]]. A high-definition remastering of the three [[PlayStation 2]] titles was released for [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2012, and in 2018 for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[Xbox One]] and [[Personal computer|PC]]. The latest game is ''[[Devil May Cry 5]]'', which was released on March 8, 2019.\n\nThe series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to  [[comic book]]s, [[novelization]]s, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of [[action figure]]s. Critical response to the gameplay [[Combo (video games)|combos]] has been positive, although the games' narrative was considered simple until the third installment.\n\n==<span id=\"Overview\"></span>Game overview==\n{{Video game timeline\n| 2001 = ''Devil May Cry''\n| 2003 = ''Devil May Cry 2''\n| 2005 = ''Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening''\n| 2008 = Devil May Cry 4''\n| 2012 = ''Devil May Cry HD Collection''\n| 2013 = ''[[DmC: Devil May Cry]]''\n| 2019 = ''Devil May Cry 5''\n}}\n* ''[[Devil May Cry (video game)|Devil May Cry]]'': Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly-stylized combat; a high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings, while avoiding damage. Although the game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action. In later games, the system was modified; players had to vary their attacks to maintain their style rank. The style rank is graded during combat with letters: from worst to best, D, C, B, A, and S. They are also represented by words beginning with the first letter of the class: \"Dull\" for D, for example. The third game introduced \"SS\" and \"SSS\" ranks, and player performance on each [[Level (video gaming)|level]] is ranked similarly.<ref name=\"booklet\">{{cite book|title = Devil May Cry Instruction Booklet|publisher=[[Capcom]]| year = 2001}}</ref> The Devil Trigger enables a player's character to assume a devilish form with additional powers (based on their current weapon), while the character's strength and speed increase and health is slowly restored.<ref name=\"booklet\"/> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 2]]'' [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]] is generally the games' lead character, although most of the games offer other playable characters. The ability to perform combination attacks in mid-air and evasion and weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen.\n[[File:Devilmaycrygameplay.jpg|thumb|alt=Screenshot|Dante attacks an enemy with the sword Alastor. The word \"Cool!\" assesses the player's performance in combat.]]\n* ''[[Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening]]'' added a selection of gameplay styles, allowing the player to focus on favorite techniques or weapons: swords (swordmaster), guns (gunslinger), evasion (trickster) or defense (royal guard). Each of the four styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to cycle through a character's melee weaponry (Devil Arms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles |title=List of styles in Devil May Cry 3 |publisher=devilmaycry.org |accessdate=April 3, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917091001/http://www.devilmaycry.org/devil-may-cry-3/styles/ |archivedate=September 17, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The game was re-released as ''Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition'' with new skills for Dante and the ability to play as Vergil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|title=Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition Review|author=Dunhan, Jeremy|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=IGN|accessdate=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310023352/http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/23/devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening-special-edition-review|archive-date=March 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> \n* ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'' had a major innovation: Nero's (the main character) Devil Bringer arm, which gives players the ability to pull distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed. Nero is also armed with a sword which can be throttled up, allowing players to pre-charge it for extra damage on the next hit; with precise timing, it can be charged after each attack for extra damage and style.

Sparda stops Mundus from conquering the human world by sealing a number of hellgates, sealing Temen-Ni-Gru (the last portal) with a ritual requiring his blood and the aid of a powerful priestess. Sparda meets Eva, who gives birth to his twin sons Dante and Vergil.\n\nThe plot begins with ''Devil May Cry 3'', a year after Dante has a falling-out with Vergil.<ref>''Arkham:'' Is your name Dante? Son of Sparda? ''Dante:'' Where did you hear that? ''Arkham:'' From your brother. He sent this invitation to you. Please accept it. ''Dante:'' Invitation huh?

Where does the time go? No doubt you've got some fun planned for me. Right Vergil? (''Devil May Cry 3'') Capcom, 2005</ref> Dante is defeated in Temen-Ni-Gru by Vergil, who takes his locket and leaves with Arkham. Dante's dormant devil power revives him, and he resumes pursuing his brother. Vergil wants to use the pendants their mother gave them in a ritual to create a portal to the Demon World. The battle is joined by [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lady|Lady]], who wants to avenge her mother's death by Arkham; Arkham manipulated the three into completing the ritual, which would allow him to acquire Sparda's sword: the Force Edge.<ref>''Jester:'' It was quite a ride, you know! If any of you had died before getting here, our little plan would have gone to waste! Therefore, my job was to get you to battle each other in order to weaken you. But at the same time, I needed to guide you here and make sure you were kept alive. I even went so far as dressing like a complete idiot!

The portal begins to close, and Vergil approaches it. Dante pleads with his brother not to go, but Vergil leaps into the Demon World before the portal closes. Vergil is tested and encounters Mundus, his mother's killer. When Lady returns to the human world, she coins the phrase \"devil may cry\"; Dante uses it for the shop.<ref>''Lady:'' Are you crying?

(''Devil May Cry'') Capcom, 2001</ref> Dante and Trish escape as the island collapses, and work together in the Devil Never Cry shop.\n\nIn the ''Devil May Cry: The Animated Series'' anime, Trish is a demon hunter; Dante is the bodyguard of Patty, a young heiress who becomes obsessed with him. Patty's mother is descended from a sorcerer who sealed the power of Abigail, an ancient devil lord. Patty is targeted by Sid, a demon seeking Abigail's power. Lady and Trish fight demons summoned by Sid, and Dante kills him. \n\nDante is invited by [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Lucia|Lucia]] in ''Devil May Cry 2'' to meet her mother, [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Matier|Matier]].

Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the Premier League from 22 to 20, only two clubs were promoted instead of the usual three, Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1994-95.html England 1994/95]</ref>\n\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won the Premier League and qualified for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], while [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] qualified for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] also qualified for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] as [[1996 FA Cup Final|runners-up]] of the [[1995\u201396 FA Cup|FA Cup]] which was won by Manchester United.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] emerged as possible title contenders early in the season, while [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough's]] early promise saw them occupy fourth place in late October, but an injury crisis saw their league form slump, and they could only manage a 12th-place finish. Most of the campaign was a two-horse race between Manchester United and Newcastle United. The two sides played on 27 December, with Newcastle 10 points ahead in the league. A 2\u20130 home win for Manchester United cut the gap to seven points, and two days later they beat Queens Park Rangers 2\u20131 to reduce the gap to just four points. But a 4\u20131 defeat at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] on New Year's Day and a 0\u20130 draw with Aston Villa allowed Newcastle to establish a 12-point lead in January.\n\nManchester United and Newcastle met again in early March, and a goal by [[Eric Cantona]] gave Manchester United a 1\u20130 away win and cut the gap to a single point. With one game left of the season, Manchester United led the Premier League by two points, having taken lead of the league halfway through March and stayed on top ever since. In case of the two clubs being tied for first place, the Premier League made preliminary preparations for a championship play-off match at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/may/arsenal-and-chelsea-may-meet-in-play-off.html |title=Arsenal and Chelsea may face play-off |work=www.premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617015715/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/may/arsenal-and-chelsea-may-meet-in-play-off.html |archivedate=17 June 2015 }}</ref> For Newcastle to win their first title since 1927, they had to win against Tottenham and hope that Middlesbrough beat their [[Manchester|Mancunian]] rivals. But the Premier League title went to [[Old Trafford]] as Manchester United won 3\u20130 and Newcastle could only manage a 1\u20131 draw with Tottenham.\n\nDespite the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] never looked like serious title challengers, their best chance of success coming in the [[1995\u201396 Football League Cup|League Cup]], where they reached the semi-finals, losing on away goals to Aston Villa. However, the [[North London]] side still qualified for the UEFA Cup by finishing fifth.\n\nTitle holders Blackburn recorded the lowest ever finish by a Premier League title-holder by finishing 7th. This record was matched by Manchester United in [[2013\u201314 Premier League|2013\u201314]] and broken by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]] and again by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in [[2016\u201317 Premier League|2016\u201317]].\n\nSix days after clinching their third league title in four seasons, Manchester United became the first team to complete a second league championship and [[FA Cup]] double when a Cantona goal gave them a 1\u20130 win over Liverpool in the [[1996 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engcup1996.html England \u2013 FA Challenge Cup 1995\u20131996<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Premier League relegation places went to Bolton, Queens Park Rangers and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Bolton had spent a large proportion of their first Premier League season bottom of the table. Manchester City failed to beat Liverpool on the final day of the season, consigning them to the final relegation place on goal difference behind Southampton and Coventry City.\n\n===English performance in European competition===\n[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], the 1994\u201395 Premier League champions, finished bottom of their group in the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#cc European Competitions 1995\u201396<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115153950/http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#cc |date=15 January 2013 }}</ref> [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were knocked out of the [[UEFA Cup]] in the first round, with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] both being knocked out at the second round.<ref name=\"UEFA Cup results 1995-96\">[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#uefa European Competitions 1995\u201396<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] were beaten in the second round of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#cwc European Competitions 1995\u201396<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The only English team still in European competition after Christmas were [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who reached the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]].<ref name=\"UEFA Cup results 1995-96\" />\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top eighteen teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the [[1994\u201395 Football League First Division|First Division]].

[[Carling]] Premiership''' for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth season of the competition, since its formation in 1992. Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the Premier League from 22 to 20, only two clubs were promoted instead of the usual three, Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/engpaul/FLA/1994-95.html England 1994/95]</ref>\n\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] won the Premier League and qualified for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], while [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] qualified for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] also qualified for the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] as [[1996 FA Cup Final|runners-up]] of the [[1995\u201396 FA Cup|FA Cup]] which was won by Manchester United.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] emerged as possible title contenders early in the season, while [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough's]] early promise saw them occupy fourth place in late October, but an injury crisis saw their league form slump, and they could only manage a 12th-place finish. Most of the campaign was a two-horse race between Manchester United and Newcastle United. The two sides played on 27 December, with Newcastle 10 points ahead in the league. A 2\u20130 home win for Manchester United cut the gap to seven points, and two days later they beat Queens Park Rangers 2\u20131 to reduce the gap to just four points. But a 4\u20131 defeat at [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]] on New Year's Day and a 0\u20130 draw with Aston Villa allowed Newcastle to establish a 12-point lead in January.\n\nManchester United and Newcastle met again in early March, and a goal by [[Eric Cantona]] gave Manchester United a 1\u20130 away win and cut the gap to a single point. With one game left of the season, Manchester United led the Premier League by two points, having taken lead of the league halfway through March and stayed on top ever since. In case of the two clubs being tied for first place, the Premier League made preliminary preparations for a championship play-off match at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/may/arsenal-and-chelsea-may-meet-in-play-off.html |title=Arsenal and Chelsea may face play-off |work=www.premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |date=15 May 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617015715/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/news/news/2012-13/may/arsenal-and-chelsea-may-meet-in-play-off.html |archivedate=17 June 2015 }}</ref> For Newcastle to win their first title since 1927, they had to win against Tottenham and hope that Middlesbrough beat their [[Manchester|Mancunian]] rivals. But the Premier League title went to [[Old Trafford]] as Manchester United won 3\u20130 and Newcastle could only manage a 1\u20131 draw with Tottenham.\n\nDespite the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] never looked like serious title challengers, their best chance of success coming in the [[1995\u201396 Football League Cup|League Cup]], where they reached the semi-finals, losing on away goals to Aston Villa. However, the [[North London]] side still qualified for the UEFA Cup by finishing fifth.\n\nTitle holders Blackburn recorded the lowest ever finish by a Premier League title-holder by finishing 7th. This record was matched by Manchester United in [[2013\u201314 Premier League|2013\u201314]] and broken by [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]] and again by [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in [[2016\u201317 Premier League|2016\u201317]].\n\nSix days after clinching their third league title in four seasons, Manchester United became the first team to complete a second league championship and [[FA Cup]] double when a Cantona goal gave them a 1\u20130 win over Liverpool in the [[1996 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/engcup1996.html England \u2013 FA Challenge Cup 1995\u20131996<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nThe Premier League relegation places went to Bolton, Queens Park Rangers and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Bolton had spent a large proportion of their first Premier League season bottom of the table. Manchester City failed to beat Liverpool on the final day of the season, consigning them to the final relegation place on goal difference behind Southampton and Coventry City.\n\n===English performance in European competition===\n[[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]], the 1994\u201395 Premier League champions, finished bottom of their group in the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#cc European Competitions 1995\u201396<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115153950/http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#cc |date=15 January 2013 }}</ref> [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were knocked out of the [[UEFA Cup]] in the first round, with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] both being knocked out at the second round.<ref name=\"UEFA Cup results 1995-96\">[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#uefa European Competitions 1995\u201396<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] were beaten in the second round of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]].<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/ec/ec199596.html#cwc European Competitions 1995\u201396<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The only English team still in European competition after Christmas were [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], who reached the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Cup]].<ref name=\"UEFA Cup results 1995-96\" />\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top eighteen teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the [[1994\u201395 Football League First Division|First Division]].

Surveying outstanding contributions to the arts and sciences from ancient times to the mid-twentieth century, Murray attempts to quantify and explain human accomplishment worldwide in the fields of arts and sciences by calculating the amount of space allocated to them in reference works, an area of research sometimes referred to as [[historiometry]].\n\n==Index scores==\nMurray ranks the leading 4,000 innovators in several fields of human accomplishment from 800 BC to 1950. In each field Murray identifies a number of sources (leading encyclopedias, histories and surveys) providing information about the leading figures in the field. The rankings are made from information in these sources. A raw score is determined based on how many sources mention and on how much space in each source is devoted to a person. Then these raw scores are normalized so that the lowest score is 1 and the highest score is 100. The resulting scores are called \"Index Scores\".\n\n== Analysis ==\nAccording to Murray's analysis, accomplishment has not been uniformly distributed. For example, in Italian [[Renaissance]], accomplishment was concentrated in Florence and Venice. In the British Isles, around London, the industrial north, and lowland Scotland. Another result of his analysis was that most innovation has been accomplished by men, not women, and Europeans, not other ethnic and cultural groups.\n\nThere is a relationship between closeness to elite universities and human accomplishment (but not between non-elite universities and accomplishment). Furthermore, innovation is self-reinforcing: Where there has been innovation, likely more will occur.\n\nThe book argued that \"Streams of accomplishment are fostered by political regimes that give de facto freedom of action to their potential artists and scholars\". This means freedom of expression and innovation. It does not necessarily mean democracy although [[totalitarianism]] suppressed innovation. War and civil unrest did not affect innovation.\n\nReligious liberty increased innovation. Jews had \"sparse representation in European arts and sciences through the beginning of the 19C\", but within a century Jews were disproportionately represented (except in astronomy). This coincided with the emancipation of Jews who earlier had been denied legal rights and access to universities and public office.\n\nThe highest scoring woman in a category was [[Murasaki Shikibu]] among Japanese literature. The highest in western literature was [[Virginia Woolf]]. The highest in science was [[Marie Curie]].\n\n== Decline ==\nMurray argued that the world's per capita progress in the sciences and especially the arts have declined, usually starting sometimes in the nineteenth century. In part this is due to [[diminishing returns]]. In the final chapters he abandons empirical analysis, writing  \"I cannot supply quantitative measures\", and the analysis is \"less quantitative, more speculative, and definitely more opinionated.\" He argued, based on [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', that innovation is increased by beliefs that life has a purpose and that the function of life is to fulfill that purpose; by beliefs about transcendental goods and a sense of goodness, truth and beauty; and by beliefs that individuals can act efficaciously as individuals, and a culture that enables them to do so. Murray argued that there is an absence of this in the current [[secularist]] and [[Nihilism|nihilist]] society which has caused the decline.\n\n== Reviews ==\n\nThe [[American Library Association]]: \"Achievements that require mental and spiritual effort are the highest forms of human endeavor, Murray says. He has scanned the most reputable biographical dictionaries and histories of the arts, philosophy, and sciences to find who and what, during 800 B.C.-1950, are mentioned in them.

The greatest achievements of India, China, Japan, and Islam occurred well before the West took off during the Renaissance, and each of those cultures valued duty, family, and consensus, whereas the West prefers individualism, the sine qua non of scientific debate and discovery. Further, the scientific method was a set of Western \"meta-inventions\" (Murray's term) that arose, fortunately, simultaneously with the ratification of Thomism, with its dual emphasis on faith and reason, by the most important cultural force in the West, the Roman Catholic Church. Of overarching importance to great achievements in any culture, Murray argues, are the sense that life has purpose and belief in ideals of beauty, truth, and goodness. This book probably won't get Murray in as much hot water as ''[[The Bell Curve]]'' (1994) did.

[[National Library of New Zealand|Alexander Turnbull Library]], [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]].]]\n[[Australia]] has over 160 grape varieties distrbuted on 146,244 hectares (ha) across all six states, [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Western Australia]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] (see [[Australian wine]]). These activities are concentrated in the southern part of the continent and only where the ''[[terroir]]'' - that is, [[Soil|soil types]], [[Microclimate|local climate]], [[Irrigation|availability of irrigation]] and so on - is suited to viticulture.<ref>Jones, Gregory. \"Climate, Grapes, and Wine: Terroir and the Importance of Climate to Winegrape Production.\" GuildSomm, 12 August 2015.[https://www.guildsomm.com/public_content/features/articles/b/gregory_jones/posts/climate-grapes-and-wine] Accessed 20 March 2020.</ref>\n\nTogether, the three sectors of the industry, [[Viticulture|grape growing]], [[winemaking]] and [[Enotourism|wine tourism]], play a major role in Australia's economy. In the 2018-2019 financial year, they contributed AU$45.5 billion to the national income.<ref name=MarketBulletin178>Wine Australia. \"Australian wine sector\u2019s contribution to the Australian economy grows to $45.5 billion.\" ''Market Bulletin'', Issue 178, Wine Australia, 2019.[https://www.wineaustralia.com/news/market-bulletin/issue-178] Accessed 18 March 2020.</ref> In addition, many other businesses benefit from the services they provide to the wine industry.<ref>This was summarised in a 1995 report to the Australian government which said: <blockquote>Some cater exclusively for grapegrowers or wineries (eg harvesting contractors, bottling companies and fermentation equipment suppliers), but many also supply other industries in the region (although the wine industry may be their major customer). Included in this latter category are: transport companies; metal fabricators (eg manufacturers of stainless steel tanks); manufacturers of viticultural machinery; label manufacturers; suppliers of fertilisers and chemicals; consultants specialising in viticulture services; accounting and legal firms; and suppliers of packaging materials.\" (''Winegrape and Wine Industry in Australia: A Report by the Committee of Inquiry into the Winegrape and Wine Industry'', June 1995. pp. 72-73.[https://www.pc.gov.au/research/supporting/wine-grape/winegrap.pdf] Accessed 7 April 2020.)</blockquote></ref>\n\n==Wine grape varieties overview==\nAs of 2018<ref>Karlsson, Britt. \"Australia\u2019s most popular grape varieties.\" Edited by Britt and Per Karlsson.

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product.

Now there are almost 160 other varieties in Australia's vineyards. \n\nSome are planted only in small quantities and are being used by winemakers for specialised products.<ref>For a detailed exploration of Australia's rare varieties, see Higgs, Darby. \"Alternative Wine Grape Varieties in Australia.\" Vinodiversity.[https://www.vinodiversity.com/varieties.html] Accessed 5 March 2020.</ref> Others are experiencing an ever-increasing demand either for use in the blending process or as wines carrying their names on the labels.

''Vines, Grapes & Wines: A wine drinker's guide to grape varieties.'' Mitchell Beazley, 1986. p. 50. {{ISBN|1-85732-999-6}}.</ref>\n\n===Implications of road transport===\nAlthough there are some winemakers who use only grapes grown in their own vineyards, not all winegrowers are winemakers, and the opposite is also true. This means some winegrowers sell part or all of their output to others, and for an industry spread across all six states on a large continent, road transport plays a major role in moving stock from one place to another.\n\nReports on the actual volume of grapes and wine being transported each year are hard to find. In trying to calculate this by comparing the volume of grapes grown per region with the volume of where they were processed by region, Chris Quirk wrote of bulk transportation:<blockquote>\"This is difficult to track but it could be in the order of half a million litres a week. It is therefore difficult to accurately compare the significance of one wine region over another. Modern technology has clouded the issue.\"<ref>Quirk, Chris. \"Growing Areas.\" The Great Australian Wine Book. Edited by Robert Mayne. Reed Books, 1983. p. 496. {{ISBN|0-7301-0101-0}}. Considering the age of this book and the fact that Australia's volume of output has greatly increased since then, it could be safely estimated that the volume transported by road would now be significantly more than half a million litres.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobinson commented on this with some irony: <blockquote>\"The importance of trucking should not be underestimated. The typical large winery is probably based in South Australia, often in the Barossa, but will buy in grapes from as far afield as Coonawarra, the irrigated interior and possibly even the Hunter Valley in New South Wales. (Conversely, it has been a source of persistent irritation to South Australians that they have long provided so much fruit to bolster the reputations of wineries based in New South Wales.)\"<ref>Robinson, \"Australia.\" ''Wine regions.''[https://www.jancisrobinson.com/learn/wine-regions/australia] Accessed 7 March 2020.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe problem in devising the Lists below from available sources was in determining whether wine regions showing in relation to each variety related to where it was grown or where it used in producing an end-product. As a result, the column headed \"Location - Growers and Makers\" contains both.\n\n==Government rules and regulations==\nThe wine industry operates under the ''Wine Australia Act 2013''<ref name=WineAct>''Wine Australia Act 2013.''
