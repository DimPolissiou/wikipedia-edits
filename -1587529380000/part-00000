It is the fourth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 5)|fifth season]].\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, after the [[Crystalline Entity]]\u2014which years earlier killed the colonists of [[Omicron Theta]]\u2014attacks another colony, [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] joins forces with scientist Kila Marr to hunt it down. Marr has been searching for the entity for years, ever since it destroyed her son. But Picard's determination to find a peaceful way to stop the creature's onslaught of humanity is at odds with Marr's obsession with revenge.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Commander Riker]], [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], and [[Doctor Crusher]] are visiting the Melona IV colony, when the [[Crystalline Entity]] appears and begins tearing up the planetary surface. Although the rapid evacuation is mostly successful, two of the colonists (including one in whom Riker expressed a possible romantic interest) die in the onslaught.\n\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]] sets out in pursuit of the Entity, with the help of Kila Marr, who is a [[astrobiology|xenobiologist]] and expert on the creature. Marr does not trust Data, as she is aware that Data's brother [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]] has assisted the Entity in the past. [[Captain Picard]] hopes to challenge this perception by having Data work closely with Doctor Marr.\n\nSoon Marr reveals the source of her prejudice: her 16-year-old son was killed by the Entity at [[Omicron Theta]], which was also Data's homeworld. Over time she comes to understand that Data and Lore are quite different androids. Picard tells Marr that he does not intend to kill the Entity without first attempting to communicate with it. Marr is skeptical of this approach, but she and Data work out a method for talking to the Entity.

It is the fourth episode of the [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 5)|fifth season]].\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]]. In this episode, after the [[Crystalline Entity]]\u2014which years earlier killed the colonists of [[Omicron Theta]]\u2014attacks another colony, [[Jean-Luc Picard|Picard]] joins forces with scientist Kila Marr to hunt it down. Marr has been searching for the entity for years, ever since it destroyed her son. But Picard's determination to find a peaceful way to stop the creature's onslaught of humanity is at odds with Marr's obsession with revenge.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Commander Riker]], [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], and [[Doctor Crusher]] are visiting the Melona IV colony, when the [[Crystalline Entity]] appears and begins tearing up the planetary surface. Although the rapid evacuation is mostly successful, two of the colonists (including one in whom Riker expressed a possible romantic interest) die in the onslaught.\n\nThe [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]] sets out in pursuit of the Entity, with the help of Kila Marr, who is a [[astrobiology|xenobiologist]] and expert on the creature. Marr does not trust Data, as she is aware that Data's brother [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]] has assisted the Entity in the past. [[Captain Picard]] hopes to challenge this perception by having Data work closely with Doctor Marr.\n\nSoon Marr reveals the source of her prejudice: her 16-year-old son was killed by the Entity at [[Omicron Theta]], which was also Data's homeworld. Over time she comes to understand that Data and Lore are quite different androids. Picard tells Marr that he does not intend to kill the Entity without first attempting to communicate with it. Marr is skeptical of this approach, but she and Data work out a method for talking to the Entity. During their research, Marr discovers Data is programmed with the memories and experiences of the Omicron Theta colony, including those of her dead son. Data tells her about how much her son admired her work as a scientist. At Marr's request, Data reads extracts from her son's journals, in the teenager's voice. Marr tells Data that as long as he functions, her son is alive.\n\nThe Enterprise locates the Entity and begins sending a series of graviton pulses toward it.

VTV now is the largest television network in the nation, broadcast in nine FTA channels and available internationally via satellite. VTV also operates the largest cable network ([[VTVCab]]) and a DTH satellite service. These carry the nine FTA VTV channels: VTV1, VTV2, VTV3, VTV4, VTV5, VTV6, VTV7, VTV8, VTV9 ; twenty-three Vietnamese subscription channels: VTVCab1 ([[VIE Gi\u1ea3i Tr\u00ed]] ), VTVCab2 ([[Phim Vi\u1ec7t]]), VTVCab3 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV]]), VTVCab4 ([[V\u0103n Ho\u00e1/LOVE]]), VTVCab5 ([[E Channel]]), [[VTVCab6]] (Hay TV), VTVCab7 ([[O2TV]]), VTVCab8 ([[BiBi]]), VTVCab9 ([[Info TV]]), VTVCab10 ([[VIE Dramas]]), VTVCab11 ([[TV Shopping]], now Northern VGS SHOP), VTVCab12 ([[Style TV]]), VTVCab14 ([[Lotte \u0110\u1ea5t Vi\u1ec7t Homeshopping]], now VShopping), VTVCab15 ([[UM Channel]]), VTVCab16 ([[B\u00f3ng \u0110\u00e1 TV]]), VTVCab17 ([[Yeah1 TV]]), VTVCab 18 ([[Th\u1ec3 Thao TV HD Tin t\u1ee9c]]), VTVCab19 ([[Film]]), VTVCab20 ([[V Family]]), VTVCab 21 (BiBi+), VTVCab 22 ([[Life TV]]), VTVCab 23 ([[Golf TV]]) & about 45 local & international channels.\n[[File:VTC logo 2018.svg|right|frameless|293x293px]]\n\n===Vietnam Multimedia Corporation (VTC)===\n\n{{Main|Vietnam Multimedia Corporation}}\n\nVTC operates five national channels and is the first provider of digital terrestrial television (DTT) in Vietnam.  VTC's DTT service is a subscription service though unauthorized cloning of the signal is rampant.\n\nVTC is a Vietnamese state-owned corporation under Ministry of Post and Telematics (currently the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]])  . It has 4 FTA channels, which is VTC1 - the generalist and news channel, VTC5 - the entertainment channel, TodayTV-VTC7 - the entertainment and series channel, and VTC9 -the Vietnamese entertainment channel, and a number of subscription channels including [[VTC2]] - the economic & ICT channel, [[VTC3]] - The sport & entertainment channel, [[VTC4]] - the fashion and style channel, [[VTC6]] - the movie channel.

It is operated by [[Vietnam Multimedia Corporation]], owners of VTC.\n\nFrom 1/1/2014, VTC Television Network separated from VTC Corporations and transferred to the [[Ministry of Information and Communication]]. From 27/6/2015 the network was transferred to the Radio the [[ Voice of Vietnam ]] and become the television enterprise agency of the network.\n\n===Local stations===\n{{Main|List of local stations in Vietnam}}\n[[File:Logo of Ho Chi Minh Television.svg|252x252px|right]]\nThese include [[Hanoi Radio Television]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTV). The latter is available over most of the [[Mekong Delta]].\n\n===Other subscription TV===\nSince 1991, hotels, restaurants, clubs, government offices and diplomatic organizations in Vietnam have been permitted under license to install and operate satellite dishes to bring in foreign programming. Nowadays, most of people in large cities (such as [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]]) subscribe to a cable network. The largest network is [[VCTV (Vietnam)|VCTV]]/[[VTVCab]] (a division of VTV), follows by that of [[Ho Chi Minh City Television]] (HTVC), [[Hanoi TV]] (HCAtv/Hanoicab), and [[Saigontourist Cable Television Company|Saigon Tourist Cable Service]] (SCTV) - a joint venture between VTV and Saigon Tourist company. The latest payTV supplier is K+ which is a joint venture between Vietnam Cable Television (VTVCab) and [[Canal+]], first broadcast in later 2009 via [[Direct To Home]] (DTH), and An Vi\u00ean Television Service, owned by Audio Visual Global JSC, first broadcast in 2011 via both [[DVB-T2]] [[digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) and [[Direct To Home]] (DTH)\n\n==Radio==\n[[File:Vovlogo.png|270x270px|right]]\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] radio transmission was made on September 2, 1945, when [[Ho Chi Minh]] read out the [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nPrior to 1945, Vietnamese people were banned from owning radio receivers, and broadcasting was under control of the [[French Indochina|French colonial government]], which established the first radio station in Vietnam, Radio Saigon, in the late 1920s.\n\nVietnam's national radio station, now called the [[Voice of Vietnam]], started broadcasting from Hanoi just a week after the declaration of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Radio Hanoi]] operated as a propaganda tool of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Viet Nam]].\n\n[[South Vietnam]] set up its own network in Saigon in 1955.\n\nFollowing [[History of Vietnam#Aftermath of the Vietnam War and Reunification|Reunification]], all of the radio stations were combined into the Voice of Vietnam, which became the national radio station in 1978.\n\nToday, VOV strives to offer diverse, high-quality programming and in every aspect of mass media. It broadcasts on many channels, repeated on [[AM broadcasting|Medium wave (MW) AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[shortwave|shortwave (SW) AM]] bands throughout Vietnam and the rest of the world:\n* VOV1 (MW and SW) - news, current affairs and music\n* VOV2 (MW and SW) - cultural and artistic programs\n* VOV3 (FM) - music & entertainment\n* VOV4 (MW) - [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic minority language]] programming\n* VOV5 (MW) - world service broadcasts in 11 foreign languages\n* VOV Transportation (FM) - updating information during rush hours to help people travel smoothly through traffic jams.\n* VOV English 24/7 (FM) - English-language programs\n* VOV 89 (FM) - health and safety consumering\n* VOV News - a website containing news and other aspects\n* VOVTV( Television Channel)- nationally broadcast which aims at delivering update news every 30 minutes per program\n* VOV newspaper 'the Voice of Vietnam'- a printed version with more in-depth contents of VOVnews website\nAs of 2004, it was estimated that VOV's programs reached more than 90% of all households in Vietnam.\n\nIn addition, most cities and provinces has their own radio stations.\n* *[https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193140/http://www.delicest.com/2013/09/radio-stations-viet-nam-nghe-truc-tuyen.html Vietnam Radio Stations Online Full List Updated 2013 ] Listen all Vietnam AM / FM Radio Stations Online\n\n==Newspapers==\nAs Vietnam moves toward a free-market economy with its [[doi moi]] measures, the government has relied on the print media to keep the public informed about its policies. The measure has had the effect of almost doubling the numbers of newspapers and magazines since 1996.\n\nThe first [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese-language]] newspaper was the French-sponsored ''Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh Bao'', established in Saigon in 1869. In the years that followed, both the nationalistic and the colonial sides relied on newspapers as a propaganda tool. During the final period of French colonialism many reporters were arrested and imprisoned and several newspaper offices closed by the authorities.\n\nFor Ho Chi Minh's revolutionary side, Vietnamese journalists covered the [[First Indochina War]]. After the war, presses were set up in Hanoi and the basis for the country's newspaper industry as it exists today was formed, with the main [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Nhan Dan]]'' (''The People''), established in 1951.\n\nCurrent large Vietnamese-language newspapers include ''[[Tuoi Tre]]'' (''Youth'', published in [[Ho Chi Minh City]], described as a \"reformist\" newspaper), ''[[Thanh Nien]]'' (''Youth''), ''[[Ng\u01b0\u1eddi Lao \u0110\u1ed9ng]]'' (''Labour'' or ''The Worker''), ''[[Tien Phong (newspaper)|Tien Phong]]'' (''Vanguard''), ''[[Sai Gon Giai Phong]]'' (''Liberated Saigon''), and ''[[H\u00e0n\u1ed9im\u1edbi]]'' (''New Hanoi'').
