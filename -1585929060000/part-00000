In 1788, the Ratification Convention for New York State included [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]. They assembled at the courthouse on Market Street and ratified the [[United States Constitution]], and New York State entered the new union as the eleventh of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] to become the United States. In 1799, a new seal was created for the city.\n\nPoughkeepsie was a major center for whale rendering, and the industry flourished during the 19th century through shipping, millineries, paper mills, and several breweries along the Hudson River, including some owned by [[Matthew Vassar]], founder of [[Vassar College]]. Families built palatial weekend homes nearby, such as the [[Astor family|Astors]], Rogers, and [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], due to the area's natural beauty and proximity to New York City. The [[Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site|Vanderbilt Mansion]] is located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie in the town of [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]] and is registered as a national historic site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists during the late 19th century.

In 1788, the Ratification Convention for New York State included [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[John Jay]], and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]]. They assembled at the courthouse on Market Street and ratified the [[United States Constitution]], and New York State entered the new union as the eleventh of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]] to become the United States. In 1799, a new seal was created for the city.\n\nPoughkeepsie was a major center for whale rendering, and the industry flourished during the 19th century through shipping, millineries, paper mills, and several breweries along the Hudson River, including some owned by [[Matthew Vassar]], founder of [[Vassar College]]. Families built palatial weekend homes nearby, such as the [[Astor family|Astors]], Rogers, and [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], due to the area's natural beauty and proximity to New York City. The [[Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site|Vanderbilt Mansion]] is located several miles up the Hudson from Poughkeepsie in the town of [[Hyde Park, New York|Hyde Park]] and is registered as a national historic site; it is considered to be a sterling example of the mansions built by American industrialists during the late 19th century. The city is home to the [[Bardavon 1869 Opera House]], the oldest continuously operating entertainment venue in the state.\n\n==Geography==\nThe city of Poughkeepsie is located on the western edge of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], in [[Downstate New York]]'s [[Hudson Valley|Hudson River Valley Area]].\n\nIt is bordered by the town of [[Lloyd, New York|Lloyd]] across the [[Hudson River]] to the west and by the [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|town of Poughkeepsie]] on the north, east and south.

The top college teams would attend along with tens of thousands of spectators. Poughkeepsie was known as the rowing capital of the world. Spectators watched from the hills and bluffs overlooking the river and from chartered boats and trains that followed the races along the entire length of the course; which were longer than present-day races, with varsity eights rowing a {{Convert|4|mi|adj=on}} race. When the rowing association moved the regatta to other venues, the Mid-Hudson Rowing Association was formed to preserve rowing in the area. It successfully lobbied to preserve the regatta's facilities for use by area high schools and club rowing programs.

Its back, sides and tail may be different shades of brown and grey, with many scales having a wide blackish edge. These dark-marked scales occur in diagonal rows so that the marks align to form broken [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] of variable length that are inclined backward and downward. The lowermost lateral scales often have an anterior yellow edge. The dorsal scales are smooth and without keels. The round-snouted head and neck are usually noticeably darker than the body (glossy black in winter, dark brown in summer), the darker colour allowing the snake to heat itself while exposing only a smaller portion of the body at the burrow entrance. The eye is of average size with a blackish brown iris and without a noticeable coloured rim around the pupil.\n\nIt has 23 rows of [[dorsal scales]] at midbody, between 55 and 70 divided [[subcaudal scales]], and one [[anal scale]].\n\nThe inland taipan averages approximately {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} in total length, although larger specimens can reach total lengths of {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reptilepark.com.au/animals.asp?catID=16&ID=112|title=Fierce Snake (Inland Taipan)|publisher=Australian Reptile Park|accessdate=2009-11-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929220811/http://www.reptilepark.com.au/animals.asp?catID=16&ID=112|archivedate=2009-09-29|df=}}</ref> Its [[fangs]] are between 3.5 and 6.2&nbsp;mm long (shorter than those of the coastal taipan).<ref name=\"billabongsanctuary.com.au\"/>\n\n===Seasonal adaptation===\nInland taipans adapt to their environment by changing the colour of the skin during seasonal changes. They tend to become lighter during summer and darker during the winter. This seasonal colour change serves the purpose of thermoregulation, allowing the snake to absorb more light in the colder months.\n\n==Breeding==\nInland taipan produce clutches of between one dozen and two dozen eggs. The eggs hatch two months later. The eggs are usually laid in abandoned animal burrows and deep crevices. Reproduction rate depends in part on their diet: if there is not enough food, then the snake will reproduce less.\n\n[[Captivity (animal)|Captive]] snakes generally live for 10 to 15 years.

Its back, sides and tail may be different shades of brown and grey, with many scales having a wide blackish edge. These dark-marked scales occur in diagonal rows so that the marks align to form broken [[Chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] of variable length that are inclined backward and downward. The lowermost lateral scales often have an anterior yellow edge. The dorsal scales are smooth and without keels. The round-snouted head and neck are usually noticeably darker than the body (glossy black in winter, dark brown in summer), the darker colour allowing the snake to heat itself while exposing only a smaller portion of the body at the burrow entrance. The eye is of average size with a blackish brown iris and without a noticeable coloured rim around the pupil.\n\nIt has 23 rows of [[dorsal scales]] at midbody, between 55 and 70 divided [[subcaudal scales]], and one [[anal scale]].\n\nThe inland taipan averages approximately {{convert|1.8|m|ft}} in total length, although larger specimens can reach total lengths of {{convert|2.5|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reptilepark.com.au/animals.asp?catID=16&ID=112|title=Fierce Snake (Inland Taipan)|publisher=Australian Reptile Park|accessdate=2009-11-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929220811/http://www.reptilepark.com.au/animals.asp?catID=16&ID=112|archivedate=2009-09-29|df=}}</ref> Its [[fangs]] are between 3.5 and 6.2&nbsp;mm long (shorter than those of the coastal taipan).<ref name=\"billabongsanctuary.com.au\"/>\n\n===Seasonal adaptation===\nInland taipans adapt to their environment by changing the colour of the skin during seasonal changes. They tend to become lighter during summer and darker during the winter. This seasonal colour change serves the purpose of thermoregulation, allowing the snake to absorb more light in the colder months.\n\n==Breeding==\nInland taipan produce clutches of between one dozen and two dozen eggs. The eggs hatch two months later. The eggs are usually laid in abandoned animal burrows and deep crevices. Reproduction rate depends in part on their diet: if there is not enough food, then the snake will reproduce less.\n\n[[Captivity (animal)|Captive]] snakes generally live for 10 to 15 years.
