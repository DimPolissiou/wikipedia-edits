During the marathon, brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|Dzhokhar]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] detonate two bombs, causing widespread panic. A young couple, Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, are injured and taken to separate hospitals, where they are both required to have their legs amputated. Steve Woolfenden, a family man, is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo, who is taken by the police to a safe location.\n\nFBI agent Richard DesLauriers is assigned to investigate the bombings in collaboration with  Boston police commissioner [[Ed Davis (police commissioner)|Ed Davis]], while Saunders searches for evidence and helps people that have been injured or separated from their loved ones in the chaos, including Patrick, Jessica, Steven and Leo. FBI analysts review footage of the bombing and identify Dzhokhar and Tamerlan as suspects, but DesLauriers is reluctant to release their pictures to the public without further evidence. His hand is forced when the pictures are leaked to the press, while Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese's men begin conducting door-to-door searches for the pair.\n\nDzhokhar and Tamerlan kill officer [[Sean Collier]] in a failed attempt to [[Theft|steal]] his pistol, and then carjack student Dun Meng, telling him of their plans to conduct another bombing in [[New York City]]. Just as Dzhokhar enters the [[Shell Gas]] station [[convenience store]], Meng escapes from the vehicle, and runs away fearfully to the [[Mobil]] Gas Station so that he can call the police; the brothers flee in the stolen car. Saunders arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair, which leads to an armed confrontation. Several officers are injured in the ensuing shootout, where the brothers use both firearms and bombs. While Tamerlan is shooting, Pugliese fires at his ankle, wounding him and hindering his ability to gather more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage while he makes a last stand. As Tamerlan is subdued by the police, Dzhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him as he escapes in the chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell and Dzhokhar's college friends are detained by the [[Hostage Rescue Team|FBI Hostage Rescue Team]] and questioned by the [[High-Value Interrogation Group]]. Russell refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, paraphrasing the Quran in defiance, while Dzhokhar's friends appear oblivious to his plans, despite having earlier found bomb components in his possessions. A local man named David Henneberry later finds Dzhokhar hiding under the sheets of his boat and calls the police. Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff, as Saunders and his colleagues celebrate.

During the marathon, brothers [[Dzhokhar Tsarnaev|Dzhokhar]] and [[Tamerlan Tsarnaev]] detonate two bombs, causing widespread panic. A young couple, Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, are injured and taken to separate hospitals, where they are both required to have their legs amputated. Steve Woolfenden, a family man, is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo, who is taken by the police to a safe location.\n\nFBI agent Richard DesLauriers is assigned to investigate the bombings in collaboration with  Boston police commissioner [[Ed Davis (police commissioner)|Ed Davis]], while Saunders searches for evidence and helps people that have been injured or separated from their loved ones in the chaos, including Patrick, Jessica, Steven and Leo. FBI analysts review footage of the bombing and identify Dzhokhar and Tamerlan as suspects, but DesLauriers is reluctant to release their pictures to the public without further evidence. His hand is forced when the pictures are leaked to the press, while Watertown Police Sergeant Jeffrey Pugliese's men begin conducting door-to-door searches for the pair.\n\nDzhokhar and Tamerlan kill officer [[Sean Collier]] in a failed attempt to [[steal]] his pistol, and then carjack student Dun Meng, telling him of their plans to conduct another bombing in [[New York City]]. Just as Dzhokhar enters the [[Shell Gas]] station [[convenience store]], Meng escapes from the vehicle, and runs away fearfully to the [[Mobil]] Gas Station so that he can call the police; the brothers flee in the stolen car. Saunders arrives at the scene, learns of the brothers' plan and is given the stolen car's GPS tracking number, leading police to the pair, which leads to an armed confrontation. Several officers are injured in the ensuing shootout, where the brothers use both firearms and bombs. While Tamerlan is shooting, Pugliese fires at his ankle, wounding him and hindering his ability to gather more explosives. Tamerlan orders Dzhokhar to run to New York City to continue the rampage while he makes a last stand. As Tamerlan is subdued by the police, Dzhokhar runs over his brother in his flight, killing him as he escapes in the chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, Tamerlan's wife Katherine Russell and Dzhokhar's college friends are detained by the [[Hostage Rescue Team|FBI Hostage Rescue Team]] and questioned by the [[High-Value Interrogation Group]]. Russell refuses to disclose any knowledge of her husband's illegal activities, paraphrasing the Quran in defiance, while Dzhokhar's friends appear oblivious to his plans, despite having earlier found bomb components in his possessions. A local man named David Henneberry later finds Dzhokhar hiding under the sheets of his boat and calls the police. Dzhokhar is quickly surrounded and arrested after a brief standoff, as Saunders and his colleagues celebrate. The Boston police are invited to attend a [[Boston Red Sox]] game, where [[David Ortiz]] thanks them for their heroism and tells them to \"stay strong\".\n\nDzhokhar was convicted on thirty counts and sentenced to death by [[lethal injection]] and is currently waiting for his appeal in [[ADX Florence|federal prison]]; his three college friends were arrested for obstructing the bombing investigation and authorities are continuing to seek information regarding Russell's possible involvement in the bombings.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mark Wahlberg]] as [[Boston Police Department]] Sergeant Tommy Saunders \n* [[Kevin Bacon]] as Richard DesLauriers, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Boston field office\n* [[John Goodman]] as Boston Police Commissioner [[Ed Davis (police commissioner)|Ed Davis]]<ref name=\"GoodmanCast\" />\n* [[J.

While [[paddle]]s and [[sail]]s are still used on some smaller boats, most modern ships are propelled by mechanical systems consisting of an electric motor or engine turning a [[propeller]], or less frequently, in [[pump-jet]]s, an [[impeller]]. [[Marine engineering]] is the discipline concerned with the [[engineering design process]] of marine [[propulsion system]]s.\n\nManpower, in the form of paddles, and sail were the first forms of marine propulsion. Rowed [[galley]]s, some equipped with sail, also played an important early role. The first advanced mechanical means of marine propulsion was the \n[[marine steam engine]], introduced in the early 19th century. During the 20th century it was replaced by [[Two-stroke diesel engine|two-stroke]] or [[four-stroke diesel engine]]s, outboard motors, and [[gas turbine engine]]s on faster ships.  [[nuclear marine propulsion|Marine nuclear reactors]], which appeared in the 1950s,  produce steam to propel [[warship]]s and [[icebreaker]]s; commercial application, attempted late that decade, failed to catch on. [[Electric motor]]s using electric battery storage have been used for propulsion on [[submarine]]s and [[electric boat]]s and have been proposed for energy-efficient propulsion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/imt/electricship/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517060017/http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/imt/electricship/ |archivedate=2009-05-17 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment in [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) [[internal combustion engine|fueled engines]] are gaining recognition for their low emissions and cost advantages. [[Stirling engines]], which are quieter, smoother running, propel a number of [[Applications of the Stirling engine#Marine engines|small submarines]] in order to run as quietly as possible. Its design is not used in civilian marine application due to lower total efficiency than internal combustion engines or power turbines. \n\n==Power sources==\n===Pre-mechanisation===\n[[File:Mozambique - traditional sailboat.jpg|thumb|A wind propelled fishing boat in [[Mozambique]]]]\nUntil the application of the coal-fired [[steam engine]] to ships in the early 19th century, [[oars]] or the [[wind]] were the principal means of watercraft propulsion.  Merchant ships predominantly used sail, but during periods when [[naval warfare]] depended on ships closing to [[battering ram|ram]] or to fight hand-to-hand, [[galley]] were preferred for their manoeuvrability and speed.  The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] navies that fought in the [[Peloponnesian War]] used [[trireme]]s, as did the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] at the [[Battle of Actium]].  The development of [[naval gunnery]] from the 16th century onward vaulted broadside weight ahead of manoeuvrability; this led to the dominance of the sail-powered warship over the following three centuries.\n\nIn modern times, human propulsion is found mainly on small boats or as auxiliary propulsion on sailboats. Human propulsion includes the push pole, rowing, and pedals.\n\nPropulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by [[standing rigging|stays]], and controlled by [[running rigging|lines]] made of [[rope]].  Sails were the dominant form of commercial propulsion until the late nineteenth century, and continued to be used well into the twentieth century on routes where wind was assured and coal was not available, such as in the South American [[nitrate trade]].  Sails are now generally used for recreation and racing, although innovative applications of [[kite]]s/[[royal (sail)|royal]]s, [[turbosail]]s, [[rotorsail]]s, [[wingsail]]s, [[windmill ship|windmills]] and [[SkySails]]'s own kite buoy-system have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\n\n===Reciprocating steam engines===\n[[File:SS Ukkopekka steam engine.jpg|thumb|{{SS|Ukkopekka}} uses a triple expansion [[steam engine]]]]\n[[File:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|How a Triple expansion steam engine works]]\n{{main|Marine steam engine}}\nThe development of [[reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] steamships was a complex process.  Early steamships were fueled by wood, later ones by coal or fuel oil.  Early ships used stern or side [[Paddle steamer|paddle wheels]], which gave way to screw [[propeller]]s.\n\nThe first commercial success accrued to [[Robert Fulton]]'s ''[[North River Steamboat]]'' (often called ''Clermont'') in US in 1807, followed in [[Europe]] by the {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=on|0}} {{PS|Comet||2}} of 1812.  Steam propulsion progressed considerably over the rest of the 19th century.  Notable developments include the steam [[surface condenser]], which eliminated the use of sea water in the ship's boilers.  This, along with improvements in boiler technology, permitted higher steam pressures, and thus the use of higher efficiency [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion]] (compound) engines.  As the means of transmitting the engine's power, paddle wheels gave way to more efficient screw propellers.\n\nMultiple expansion steam engines became widespread in the late 19th century.  These engines exhausted steam from a high pressure cylinder to a lower pressure cylinder, giving a large increase in efficiency.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}</ref>\n\n===Steam turbines===\nSteam turbines were fueled by [[coal]] or, later, [[fuel oil]] or [[nuclear power]].  The marine [[steam turbine]] developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons]]<ref>[[Aurel Stodola|A Stodola]] (1927) ''Steam and Gas Trubines''. McGraw-Hill.</ref> raised the power-to-weight ratio.  He achieved publicity by demonstrating it unofficially in the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|0}} ''[[Turbinia]]'' at the [[Spithead]] [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Naval Review]] in 1897.  This facilitated a generation of high-speed liners in the first half of the 20th century, and rendered the reciprocating steam engine obsolete; first in warships, and later in merchant vessels.\n\nIn the early 20th century, heavy fuel oil came into more general use and began to replace coal as the fuel of choice in steamships.  Its great advantages were convenience, reduced manpower by removal of the need for [[coal trimmer|trimmers]] and stokers, and reduced space needed for fuel bunkers.\n===Turbo-electric transmission ===\nTurbo-electric transmission uses electric generators to convert the mechanical energy of a turbine (steam or gas) into electric energy and electric motors to convert it back into mechanical energy to power the driveshafts.  An advantage of turbo-electric transmission is that it allows the adaptation of high-speed turbines to slow turning propellers or wheels without a heavy and complex gearbox. It has the advantage of being able to provide electricity for the ship or train's other electrical systems, such as lighting, computers, radar, and communications equipment.\n[[File:USS New Mexico BB-40 1921.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|6}}, {{liy|1917}}, was the World's first turbo-electric battleship.]]\n\n===Diesel===\nIn the second half of the 20th century, rising fuel costs almost led to the demise of the steam turbine.  Most new ships since around 1960 have been built with [[diesel engine]]s, both Four or two-Stroke. The last major passenger ship built with steam turbines was ''[[Pacific Sky|Fairsky]]'', launched in 1984.  Similarly, many steam ships were re-engined to improve [[fuel efficiency]].  One high-profile example was the 1968 built ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' which had her steam turbines replaced with a [[diesel-electric]] propulsion plant in 1986.\n\nMost new-build ships with steam turbines are specialist vessels such as nuclear-powered vessels, and certain merchant vessels (notably [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] (LNG) and coal carriers) where the cargo can be used as [[bunker fuel]].\n\n====LNG carriers====\nNew [[LNG carrier]]s (a high growth area of shipping) continue to be built with steam turbines.  The natural gas is stored in a liquid state in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] vessels aboard these ships, and a small amount of 'boil off' gas is needed to be constantly withdrawn in order to maintain the pressure and temperature inside the vessels within operating limits.  The 'boil off' gas provides the fuel for the ship's boilers, which further provide steam for the turbines, the simplest way to deal with the excessive 'boil off' gas.  However, technology to operate [[internal combustion engine]]s (modified marine two-stroke diesel engines) on this gas has improved, and such engines are starting to appear in LNG carriers. \nAlso constantly improving tank designs allow reaching greater thermal efficiency, therefore less 'boil off' naturally occurs.  Developments have also been made in the process of re-liquifying 'boil off' gas, letting it be returned to the cryogenic tanks as a liquid.  The financial returns on LNG are potentially greater than the cost of the marine-grade fuel oil burnt in conventional diesel engines, so the re-liquefaction process is starting to be used on diesel engine propelled LNG carriers.  Another factor driving the change from turbines to diesel engines for LNG carriers is the shortage of steam turbine qualified seagoing engineers.    With the lack of turbine powered ships in other shipping sectors, and the rapid rise in size of the worldwide LNG fleet, not enough have been trained to meet the demand.  It may be that the days are numbered for marine steam turbine propulsion systems, even though all but sixteen of the orders for new LNG carriers at the end of 2004 were for steam turbine propelled ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informare.it/news/forum/2005/brs/lng-auk.asp |title=informare \u2013 Forum of Shipping and Logistics |publisher=Informare.it |accessdate=2009-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110035/http://www.informare.it/news/forum/2005/brs/lng-auk.asp |archivedate=2009-01-03 }}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:NSsavannah-1962.jpg|thumb|{{ship|NS|Savannah}} was the first [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] cargo ship]]\n\n====Nuclear-powered steam turbines====\n{{main|Nuclear marine propulsion}}\nIn these vessels, the [[nuclear reactor]] heats water to create steam to drive the turbines.  When first developed, very low prices of diesel oil limited nuclear propulsion's commercial attraction. The advantages of its fuel-price security, greater safety and low emissions were unable to overcome the higher initial costs of a nuclear power plant. In 2019, nuclear propulsion is rare except in some [[Navy]] and specialist vessels such as [[icebreaker]]s.  In large [[aircraft carrier]]s, the space formerly used for ship's bunkerage is used instead to bunker aviation fuel.  In [[submarine]]s, the ability to run submerged at high speed and in relative quiet for long periods holds obvious advantages.  A few naval [[cruiser]]s have also employed nuclear power; as of 2006, the only ones remaining in service are the [[Russia]]n {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|4}}.  An example of a non-military ship with [[nuclear marine propulsion]] is the {{sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|1}} with {{convert|75000|shp|-1|lk=on}}. In an ice-breaker, an advantage is fuel security and safety in demanding arctic conditions.  The commercial experiment of the {{ship|NS|Savannah}} ended before the dramatic fuel price increases of the 1970s. The Savannah also suffered from an inefficient design, being partly for passengers and partly for cargo.\n\nIn recent times, there is some renewed interest in commercial nuclear shipping. Fuel oil prices are now much higher. Nuclear-powered cargo ships could lower costs associated with carbon dioxide emissions and travel at higher cruise speeds than conventional diesel powered vessels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html |title=Full steam ahead for nuclear shipping |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2011-02-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223175319/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html |archivedate=2010-12-23 }}</ref>\n\n===Reciprocating diesel engines===\n[[Image:MainEngine1.JPG|thumb|A modern [[diesel engine]] aboard a cargo ship]]\n[[File:Diesel engine Uniflow.PNG|thumb|Intake and exhaust flow in a 2-stroke heavy-duty[[diesel engine]] ]]\n\nMost modern ships use a reciprocating [[diesel engine]] as their prime mover, due to their operating simplicity, robustness and fuel economy compared to most other prime mover mechanisms.  The rotating [[crankshaft]] can be directly coupled to the propeller with slow speed engines, via a reduction gearbox for medium and high speed engines, or via an alternator and electric motor in diesel-electric vessels. The rotation of the crankshaft is connected to the camshaft or a hydraulic pump on an [[Intelligent Diesel Engine|intelligent diesel]].\n\nThe reciprocating marine diesel engine first came into use in 1903 when the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel electric]] rivertanker [[Vandal (tanker)|''Vandal'']] was put into service by [[Branobel]].  Diesel engines soon offered greater efficiency than the steam turbine, but for many years had an inferior power-to-space ratio.  The advent of turbocharging however hastened their adoption, by permitting greater power densities.\n\nDiesel engines today are broadly classified according to\n*Their operating cycle: [[two-stroke engine]] or [[four-stroke engine]]\n*Their construction: [[crosshead]], [[trunk engine|trunk]], or [[opposed piston engine|opposed piston]]\n*Their speed\n**Slow speed: any engine with a maximum operating speed up to 300&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]] (rpm), although most large two-stroke slow speed diesel engines operate below 120&nbsp;rpm.  Some very long stroke engines have a maximum speed of around 80&nbsp;rpm.  The largest, most powerful engines in the world are slow speed, two stroke, crosshead diesels.\n**Medium speed: any engine with a maximum operating speed in the range 300\u20131000&nbsp;rpm.  Many modern four-stroke medium speed diesel engines have a maximum operating speed of around 500&nbsp;rpm.\n**High speed: any engine with a maximum operating speed above 1000&nbsp;rpm.\n[[File:Marine-propulsion-system.jpg|thumb|4-Stroke Marine Diesel Engine System]]\nMost modern larger merchant ships use either slow speed, two stroke, crosshead engines, or medium speed, four stroke, trunk engines.  Some smaller vessels may use high speed diesel engines.\n\nThe size of the different types of engines is an important factor in selecting what will be installed in a new ship.  Slow speed two-stroke engines are much taller, but the footprint required is smaller than that needed for equivalently rated four-stroke medium speed diesel engines.  As space above the waterline is at a premium in passenger ships and ferries (especially ones with a car deck), these ships tend to use multiple medium speed engines resulting in a longer, lower engine room than that needed for two-stroke diesel engines.  Multiple engine installations also give redundancy in the event of mechanical failure of one or more engines, and the potential for greater efficiency over a wider range of operating conditions.\n\nAs modern ships' propellers are at their most efficient at the operating speed of most slow speed diesel engines, ships with these engines do not generally need gearboxes.  Usually such propulsion systems consist of either one or two propeller shafts each with its own direct drive engine.  Ships propelled by medium or high speed diesel engines may have one or two (sometimes more) propellers, commonly with one or more engines driving each propeller shaft through a gearbox.  Where more than one engine is geared to a single shaft, each engine will most likely drive through a clutch, allowing engines not being used to be disconnected from the gearbox while others keep running.  This arrangement lets maintenance be carried out while under way, even far from port.\n\n===LNG Engines===\nShipping companies are required to comply with the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and the [[MARPOL 73/78|International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]] emissions rules. Dual fuel engines are fueled by either marine grade diesel, heavy fuel oil, or liquefied natural gas (LNG). A [[Marine LNG Engine]] has multiple fuel options, allowing vessels to transit without relying on one type of fuel.  Studies show that LNG is the most efficient of fuels, although limited access to LNG fueling stations limits the production of such engines.  Vessels providing services in the LNG industry have been retrofitted with dual-fuel engines, and have been proved to be extremely effective.  Benefits of dual-fuel engines include fuel and operational flexibility, high efficiency, low emissions, and operational cost advantages.\nLiquefied natural gas engines offer the marine transportation industry with an environmentally friendly alternative to provide power to vessels.  In 2010, STX Finland and Viking Line signed an agreement to begin construction on what would be the largest environmentally friendly cruise ferry.  Construction of NB 1376 will be completed in 2013.  According to Viking Line, vessel NB 1376 will primarily be fueled by liquefied natural gas. Vessel NB 1376 nitrogen oxide emissions will be almost zero, and sulphur oxide emissions will be at least 80% below the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) standards.\nCompany profits from tax cuts and operational cost advantages has led to the gradual growth of LNG fuel use in engines.\n<ref>LNG World News.

Gas turbines are commonly used in combination with other types of engine.  Most recently, {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} has had gas turbines installed in addition to [[diesel engines]].  Because of their poor thermal efficiency at low power (cruising) output, it is common for ships using them to have diesel engines for cruising, with gas turbines reserved for when higher speeds are needed. However, in the case of passenger ships the main reason for installing gas turbines has been to allow a reduction of emissions in sensitive environmental areas or while in port.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCP/is_1_26/ai_n6100061|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224153308/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCP/is_1_26/ai_n6100061|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-02-24|title=Return of the turbine \u2013 Cruise Travel|publisher=FindArticles.com|date=2004-07-01|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref>  Some warships, and a few modern cruise ships have also used steam turbines to improve the efficiency of their gas turbines in a [[combined cycle]], where [[waste heat]] from a gas turbine exhaust is utilized to boil water and create steam for driving a steam turbine.  In such combined cycles, thermal efficiency can be the same or slightly greater than that of diesel engines alone; however, the grade of fuel needed for these gas turbines is far more costly than that needed for the diesel engines, so the running costs are still higher.\n\n===Stirling engines===\nSince the late 1980s, Swedish shipbuilder [[Kockums]] has built a number of successful Stirling engine powered submarines.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = The Kockums Stirling AIP system&nbsp;\u2013 proven in operational service | publisher = Kockums | url = http://www.sesusa.org/submarine.pdf | accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Kockums\">Kockums (a)</ref> The submarines store compressed oxygen to allow more efficient and cleaner external fuel combustion when submerged, providing heat for the Stirling engine's operation.

In the case of medium to high power Stirling engines, a [[radiator]] is generally required to transfer the heat from the engine to the ambient air. Stirling marine engines have the advantage of using the ambient temperature water. Placing the cooling radiator section in seawater rather than ambient air allows for the radiator to be smaller. The engine's cooling water may be used directly or indirectly for heating and cooling purposes of the ship.  The Stirling engine has potential for surface-ship propulsion, as the engine's larger physical size is less of a concern.\n\n===Electric===\n{{seealso|Electric boat}}\nBattery generated electric propulsion first appeared in the latter part of the 19th century, powering small lake boats.  These relied entirely on [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] for electric current to power their propellers.  [[Electric Launch Company|Elco]] (the Electric Launch Company) evolved into the industry leader, later expanding into other forms of vessel, including the iconic World War II [[PT boat]].\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century electric propulsion was adapted to use in [[submarine]]s. As underwater propulsion driven exclusively by heavy batteries was both slow and of limited range and timespan, rechargeable battery banks were developed.  Submarines were primarily powered by combined [[diesel-electric]] systems on the surface, which were much faster and allowed for dramatically expanded range, charging their battery systems as necessary for still limited subsurface action and duration. The [[Plunger (experimental submarine)|Holland V]] submarine led to the adoption of this system by the [[U.S. Navy]], followed by the [[British Royal Navy]].\n\nTo expand the range and duration of the submarine during World War II the German [[Kriegsmarine]] developed a [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] system, which allowed the diesel-electric system to be utilized while the submarine was all but completely submerged. Finally, in 1952, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']] was launched, the world's first nuclear powered submarine, which eliminated the restrictions of both diesel fuel and limited duration battery propulsion.\n\n[[Electric boat#List of battery-electric ships|Several short-range ships are built as (or converted to) pure electric vessels]]. This includes some powered by batteries which are recharged from shore, and some [[shore-power]]ed by [[Electric boat#Wired electric boats|electrical cables]], [[Straussee Ferry|either]] [[Canby Ferry|overhead]] or [[Kastellet ferry|submerged]] (no batteries).\n\nOn November 12, 2017 [[Guangzhou Shipyard International]] (GSI) launched what may be the world's first all-electric, battery-powered inland coal carrier. The 2,000 dwt vessel will carry bulk cargo for up to 40 nautical miles per charge.

These include:\n\n===Propeller===\n{{Main|Propeller}}\nMarine propellers are also known as \"screws\". There are many variations of marine screw systems, including twin, contra-rotating, controllable-pitch, and nozzle-style screws.  While smaller vessels tend to have a single screw, even very large ships such as tankers, container ships and bulk carriers may have single screws for reasons of fuel efficiency.  Other vessels may have twin, triple or quadruple screws.  Power is transmitted from the engine to the screw by way of a propeller shaft, which may be connected to a gearbox.\n\n===Paddle wheel===\n[[File:Paddle wheel small.jpg|thumb|Left: original paddle wheel from a paddle steamer.<br>Right: detail of a paddle steamer.]]\n{{See also|Paddle steamer|Pedalo}}\nThe paddle wheel is a large wheel, generally built of a [[steel frame]]work, upon the outer edge of which are fitted numerous paddle blades (called ''floats'' or ''buckets'').  The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels underwater.  Rotation of the paddle wheel produces [[thrust]], forward or backward as required.  More advanced paddle wheel designs have featured ''feathering'' methods that keep each paddle blade oriented closer to vertical while it is in the water; this increases efficiency.  The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.\n\nPaddle wheels have been superseded by screws, which are a much more efficient form of propulsion.  Nevertheless, paddle wheels have two advantages over screws, making them suitable for vessels in  shallow rivers and constrained waters: first, they are less likely to be clogged by obstacles and debris; and secondly, when contra-rotating, they allow the vessel to spin around its own vertical axis.  Some vessels had a single screw in addition to two paddle wheels, to gain the advantages of both types of propulsion.\n\n===Pump jet===\n{{main|pump-jet}}\nA '''pump-jet''', '''hydrojet''', '''water jet''', or '''jet drive''' uses a [[ducted propeller]] ([[axial-flow pump]]), [[centrifugal pump]], or mixed flow pump to create a jet of water for propulsion.\n\nThese incorporate an intake for source water and a nozzle to direct its flow out, generating momentum, and in most cases, employing thrust vectoring to steer the craft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonmarine.co.nz/includes/files_cms/file/JetTorque%2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120110527/http://hamiltonmarine.co.nz/includes/files_cms/file/JetTorque%2008.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-20 }}</ref>\n\nPump-jets are found on [[personal watercraft]], shallow-draft river boats, and torpedoes.\n\n===Sail===\n{{main|Forces on sails}}\nThe purpose of [[sail]]s is to use [[wind]] [[energy]] to propel the [[sailboat|vessel]], [[ice boat|sled]], [[sailboard|board]], [[land sailing|vehicle]] or  [[windmill sail|rotor]].\n\n===Voith-Schneider cyclo-rotor===\n[[Image:VSPreal.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Voith Schneider Propeller]]\nA [[Voith Schneider Propeller]] (VSP) is a practical [[cyclorotor]] that provides instant thrust in any direction.

While [[paddle]]s and [[sail]]s are still used on some smaller boats, most modern ships are propelled by mechanical systems consisting of an electric motor or engine turning a [[propeller]], or less frequently, in [[pump-jet]]s, an [[impeller]]. [[Marine engineering]] is the discipline concerned with the [[engineering design process]] of marine [[propulsion system]]s.\n\nManpower, in the form of paddles, and sail were the first forms of marine propulsion. Rowed [[galley]]s, some equipped with sail, also played an important early role. The first advanced mechanical means of marine propulsion was the \n[[marine steam engine]], introduced in the early 19th century. During the 20th century it was replaced by [[Two-stroke diesel engine|two-stroke]] or [[four-stroke diesel engine]]s, outboard motors, and [[gas turbine engine]]s on faster ships.  [[nuclear marine propulsion|Marine nuclear reactors]], which appeared in the 1950s,  produce steam to propel [[warship]]s and [[icebreaker]]s; commercial application, attempted late that decade, failed to catch on. [[Electric motor]]s using electric battery storage have been used for propulsion on [[submarine]]s and [[electric boat]]s and have been proposed for energy-efficient propulsion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/imt/electricship/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517060017/http://www.ivt.ntnu.no/imt/electricship/ |archivedate=2009-05-17 }}</ref>\n\nDevelopment in [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) [[internal combustion engine|fueled engines]] are gaining recognition for their low emissions and cost advantages. [[Stirling engines]], which are quieter, smoother running, propel a number of [[Applications of the Stirling engine#Marine engines|small submarines]] in order to run as quietly as possible. Its design is not used in civilian marine application due to lower total efficiency than internal combustion engines or power turbines. \n\n==Power sources==\n===Pre-mechanisation===\n[[File:Mozambique - traditional sailboat.jpg|thumb|A wind propelled fishing boat in [[Mozambique]]]]\nUntil the application of the coal-fired [[steam engine]] to ships in the early 19th century, [[oars]] or the [[wind]] were the principal means of watercraft propulsion.  Merchant ships predominantly used sail, but during periods when [[naval warfare]] depended on ships closing to [[battering ram|ram]] or to fight hand-to-hand, [[galley]] were preferred for their manoeuvrability and speed.  The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] navies that fought in the [[Peloponnesian War]] used [[trireme]]s, as did the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] at the [[Battle of Actium]].  The development of [[naval gunnery]] from the 16th century onward vaulted broadside weight ahead of manoeuvrability; this led to the dominance of the sail-powered warship over the following three centuries.\n\nIn modern times, human propulsion is found mainly on small boats or as auxiliary propulsion on sailboats. Human propulsion includes the push pole, rowing, and pedals.\n\nPropulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by [[standing rigging|stays]], and controlled by [[running rigging|lines]] made of [[rope]].  Sails were the dominant form of commercial propulsion until the late nineteenth century, and continued to be used well into the twentieth century on routes where wind was assured and coal was not available, such as in the South American [[nitrate trade]].  Sails are now generally used for recreation and racing, although innovative applications of [[kite]]s/[[royal (sail)|royal]]s, [[turbosail]]s, [[rotorsail]]s, [[wingsail]]s, [[windmill ship|windmills]] and [[SkySails]]'s own kite buoy-system have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.\n\n===Reciprocating steam engines===\n[[File:SS Ukkopekka steam engine.jpg|thumb|{{SS|Ukkopekka}} uses a triple expansion [[steam engine]]]]\n[[File:Triple expansion engine animation.gif|thumb|How a Triple expansion steam engine works]]\n{{main|Marine steam engine}}\nThe development of [[reciprocating engine|piston-engined]] steamships was a complex process.  Early steamships were fueled by wood, later ones by coal or fuel oil.  Early ships used stern or side [[Paddle steamer|paddle wheels]], which gave way to screw [[propeller]]s.\n\nThe first commercial success accrued to [[Robert Fulton]]'s ''[[North River Steamboat]]'' (often called ''Clermont'') in US in 1807, followed in [[Europe]] by the {{convert|45|ft|m|adj=on|0}} {{PS|Comet||2}} of 1812.  Steam propulsion progressed considerably over the rest of the 19th century.  Notable developments include the steam [[surface condenser]], which eliminated the use of sea water in the ship's boilers.  This, along with improvements in boiler technology, permitted higher steam pressures, and thus the use of higher efficiency [[Steam engine#Multiple expansion engines|multiple expansion]] (compound) engines.  As the means of transmitting the engine's power, paddle wheels gave way to more efficient screw propellers.\n\nMultiple expansion steam engines became widespread in the late 19th century.  These engines exhausted steam from a high pressure cylinder to a lower pressure cylinder, giving a large increase in efficiency.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Industrial Power in the United States, 1730\u20131930, Vol. 2: Steam  Power |last1=Hunter |first1= Louis C.|year=1985 |ref=harv| publisher =University Press of Virginia|location= Charolttesville}}</ref>\n\n===Steam turbines===\nSteam turbines were fueled by [[coal]] or, later, [[fuel oil]] or [[nuclear power]].  The marine [[steam turbine]] developed by Sir [[Charles Algernon Parsons]]<ref>[[Aurel Stodola|A Stodola]] (1927) ''Steam and Gas Trubines''. McGraw-Hill.</ref> raised the power-to-weight ratio.  He achieved publicity by demonstrating it unofficially in the {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on|0}} ''[[Turbinia]]'' at the [[Spithead]] [[Fleet Review, Royal Navy#Queen Victoria|Naval Review]] in 1897.  This facilitated a generation of high-speed liners in the first half of the 20th century, and rendered the reciprocating steam engine obsolete; first in warships, and later in merchant vessels.\n\nIn the early 20th century, heavy fuel oil came into more general use and began to replace coal as the fuel of choice in steamships.  Its great advantages were convenience, reduced manpower by removal of the need for [[coal trimmer|trimmers]] and stokers, and reduced space needed for fuel bunkers.\n===Turbo-electric transmission ===\nTurbo-electric transmission uses electric generators to convert the mechanical energy of a turbine (steam or gas) into electric energy and electric motors to convert it back into mechanical energy to power the driveshafts.  An advantage of turbo-electric transmission is that it allows the adaptation of high-speed turbines to slow turning propellers or wheels without a heavy and complex gearbox. It has the advantage of being able to provide electricity for the ship or train's other electrical systems, such as lighting, computers, radar, and communications equipment.\n[[File:USS New Mexico BB-40 1921.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|New Mexico|BB-40|6}}, {{liy|1917}}, was the World's first turbo-electric battleship.]]\n\n===Diesel===\nIn the second half of the 20th century, rising fuel costs almost led to the demise of the steam turbine.  Most new ships since around 1960 have been built with [[diesel engine]]s, both Four or two-Stroke. The last major passenger ship built with steam turbines was ''[[Pacific Sky|Fairsky]]'', launched in 1984.  Similarly, many steam ships were re-engined to improve [[fuel efficiency]].  One high-profile example was the 1968 built ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' which had her steam turbines replaced with a [[diesel-electric]] propulsion plant in 1986.\n\nMost new-build ships with steam turbines are specialist vessels such as nuclear-powered vessels, and certain merchant vessels (notably [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] (LNG) and coal carriers) where the cargo can be used as [[bunker fuel]].\n\n====LNG carriers====\nNew [[LNG carrier]]s (a high growth area of shipping) continue to be built with steam turbines.  The natural gas is stored in a liquid state in [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] vessels aboard these ships, and a small amount of 'boil off' gas is needed to be constantly withdrawn in order to maintain the pressure and temperature inside the vessels within operating limits.  The 'boil off' gas provides the fuel for the ship's boilers, which further provide steam for the turbines, the simplest way to deal with the excessive 'boil off' gas.  However, technology to operate [[internal combustion engine]]s (modified marine two-stroke diesel engines) on this gas has improved, and such engines are starting to appear in LNG carriers. \nAlso constantly improving tank designs allow reaching greater thermal efficiency, therefore less 'boil off' naturally occurs.  Developments have also been made in the process of re-liquifying 'boil off' gas, letting it be returned to the cryogenic tanks as a liquid.  The financial returns on LNG are potentially greater than the cost of the marine-grade fuel oil burnt in conventional diesel engines, so the re-liquefaction process is starting to be used on diesel engine propelled LNG carriers.  Another factor driving the change from turbines to diesel engines for LNG carriers is the shortage of steam turbine qualified seagoing engineers.    With the lack of turbine powered ships in other shipping sectors, and the rapid rise in size of the worldwide LNG fleet, not enough have been trained to meet the demand.  It may be that the days are numbered for marine steam turbine propulsion systems, even though all but sixteen of the orders for new LNG carriers at the end of 2004 were for steam turbine propelled ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informare.it/news/forum/2005/brs/lng-auk.asp |title=informare \u2013 Forum of Shipping and Logistics |publisher=Informare.it |accessdate=2009-04-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110035/http://www.informare.it/news/forum/2005/brs/lng-auk.asp |archivedate=2009-01-03 }}{{unreliable source?|date=December 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:NSsavannah-1962.jpg|thumb|{{ship|NS|Savannah}} was the first [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear-powered]] cargo ship]]\n\n====Nuclear-powered steam turbines====\n{{main|Nuclear marine propulsion}}\nIn these vessels, the [[nuclear reactor]] heats water to create steam to drive the turbines.  When first developed, very low prices of diesel oil limited nuclear propulsion's commercial attraction. The advantages of its fuel-price security, greater safety and low emissions were unable to overcome the higher initial costs of a nuclear power plant. In 2019, nuclear propulsion is rare except in some [[Navy]] and specialist vessels such as [[icebreaker]]s.  In large [[aircraft carrier]]s, the space formerly used for ship's bunkerage is used instead to bunker aviation fuel.  In [[submarine]]s, the ability to run submerged at high speed and in relative quiet for long periods holds obvious advantages.  A few naval [[cruiser]]s have also employed nuclear power; as of 2006, the only ones remaining in service are the [[Russia]]n {{sclass-|Kirov|battlecruiser|4}}.  An example of a non-military ship with [[nuclear marine propulsion]] is the {{sclass-|Arktika|icebreaker|1}} with {{convert|75000|shp|-1|lk=on}}. In an ice-breaker, an advantage is fuel security and safety in demanding arctic conditions.  The commercial experiment of the {{ship|NS|Savannah}} ended before the dramatic fuel price increases of the 1970s. The Savannah also suffered from an inefficient design, being partly for passengers and partly for cargo.\n\nIn recent times, there is some renewed interest in commercial nuclear shipping. Fuel oil prices are now much higher. Nuclear-powered cargo ships could lower costs associated with carbon dioxide emissions and travel at higher cruise speeds than conventional diesel powered vessels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html |title=Full steam ahead for nuclear shipping |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2011-02-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223175319/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Full_steam_ahead_for_nuclear_shipping_1811101.html |archivedate=2010-12-23 }}</ref>\n\n===Reciprocating diesel engines===\n[[Image:MainEngine1.JPG|thumb|A modern [[diesel engine]] aboard a cargo ship]]\n[[File:Diesel engine Uniflow.PNG|thumb|Intake and exhaust flow in a 2-stroke heavy-duty[[diesel engine]] ]]\n\nMost modern ships use a reciprocating [[diesel engine]] as their prime mover, due to their operating simplicity, robustness and fuel economy compared to most other prime mover mechanisms.  The rotating [[crankshaft]] can be directly coupled to the propeller with slow speed engines, via a reduction gearbox for medium and high speed engines, or via an alternator and electric motor in diesel-electric vessels. The rotation of the crankshaft is connected to the camshaft or a hydraulic pump on an [[Intelligent Diesel Engine|intelligent diesel]].\n\nThe reciprocating marine diesel engine first came into use in 1903 when the [[diesel-electric transmission|diesel electric]] rivertanker [[Vandal (tanker)|''Vandal'']] was put into service by [[Branobel]].  Diesel engines soon offered greater efficiency than the steam turbine, but for many years had an inferior power-to-space ratio.  The advent of turbocharging however hastened their adoption, by permitting greater power densities.\n\nDiesel engines today are broadly classified according to\n*Their operating cycle: [[two-stroke engine]] or [[four-stroke engine]]\n*Their construction: [[crosshead]], [[trunk engine|trunk]], or [[opposed piston engine|opposed piston]]\n*Their speed\n**Slow speed: any engine with a maximum operating speed up to 300&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute]] (rpm), although most large two-stroke slow speed diesel engines operate below 120&nbsp;rpm.  Some very long stroke engines have a maximum speed of around 80&nbsp;rpm.  The largest, most powerful engines in the world are slow speed, two stroke, crosshead diesels.\n**Medium speed: any engine with a maximum operating speed in the range 300\u20131000&nbsp;rpm.  Many modern four-stroke medium speed diesel engines have a maximum operating speed of around 500&nbsp;rpm.\n**High speed: any engine with a maximum operating speed above 1000&nbsp;rpm.\n[[File:Marine-propulsion-system.jpg|thumb|4-Stroke Marine Diesel Engine System]]\nMost modern larger merchant ships use either slow speed, two stroke, crosshead engines, or medium speed, four stroke, trunk engines.  Some smaller vessels may use high speed diesel engines.\n\nThe size of the different types of engines is an important factor in selecting what will be installed in a new ship.  Slow speed two-stroke engines are much taller, but the footprint required is smaller than that needed for equivalently rated four-stroke medium speed diesel engines.  As space above the waterline is at a premium in passenger ships and ferries (especially ones with a car deck), these ships tend to use multiple medium speed engines resulting in a longer, lower engine room than that needed for two-stroke diesel engines.  Multiple engine installations also give redundancy in the event of mechanical failure of one or more engines, and the potential for greater efficiency over a wider range of operating conditions.\n\nAs modern ships' propellers are at their most efficient at the operating speed of most slow speed diesel engines, ships with these engines do not generally need gearboxes.  Usually such propulsion systems consist of either one or two propeller shafts each with its own direct drive engine.  Ships propelled by medium or high speed diesel engines may have one or two (sometimes more) propellers, commonly with one or more engines driving each propeller shaft through a gearbox.  Where more than one engine is geared to a single shaft, each engine will most likely drive through a clutch, allowing engines not being used to be disconnected from the gearbox while others keep running.  This arrangement lets maintenance be carried out while under way, even far from port.\n\n===LNG Engines===\nShipping companies are required to comply with the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and the [[MARPOL 73/78|International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]] emissions rules. Dual fuel engines are fueled by either marine grade diesel, heavy fuel oil, or liquefied natural gas (LNG). A [[Marine LNG Engine]] has multiple fuel options, allowing vessels to transit without relying on one type of fuel.  Studies show that LNG is the most efficient of fuels, although limited access to LNG fueling stations limits the production of such engines.  Vessels providing services in the LNG industry have been retrofitted with dual-fuel engines, and have been proved to be extremely effective.  Benefits of dual-fuel engines include fuel and operational flexibility, high efficiency, low emissions, and operational cost advantages.\nLiquefied natural gas engines offer the marine transportation industry with an environmentally friendly alternative to provide power to vessels.  In 2010, STX Finland and Viking Line signed an agreement to begin construction on what would be the largest environmentally friendly cruise ferry.  Construction of NB 1376 will be completed in 2013.  According to Viking Line, vessel NB 1376 will primarily be fueled by liquefied natural gas. Vessel NB 1376 nitrogen oxide emissions will be almost zero, and sulphur oxide emissions will be at least 80% below the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) standards.\nCompany profits from tax cuts and operational cost advantages has led to the gradual growth of LNG fuel use in engines.\n<ref>LNG World News.

Gas turbines are commonly used in combination with other types of engine.  Most recently, {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} has had gas turbines installed in addition to [[diesel engines]].  Because of their poor thermal efficiency at low power (cruising) output, it is common for ships using them to have diesel engines for cruising, with gas turbines reserved for when higher speeds are needed. However, in the case of passenger ships the main reason for installing gas turbines has been to allow a reduction of emissions in sensitive environmental areas or while in port.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCP/is_1_26/ai_n6100061|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224153308/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCP/is_1_26/ai_n6100061|url-status=dead|archive-date=2006-02-24|title=Return of the turbine \u2013 Cruise Travel|publisher=FindArticles.com|date=2004-07-01|accessdate=2009-04-21}}</ref>  Some warships, and a few modern cruise ships have also used steam turbines to improve the efficiency of their gas turbines in a [[combined cycle]], where [[waste heat]] from a gas turbine exhaust is utilized to boil water and create steam for driving a steam turbine.  In such combined cycles, thermal efficiency can be the same or slightly greater than that of diesel engines alone; however, the grade of fuel needed for these gas turbines is far more costly than that needed for the diesel engines, so the running costs are still higher.\n\n===Stirling engines===\nSince the late 1980s, Swedish shipbuilder [[Kockums]] has built a number of successful Stirling engine powered submarines.<ref>{{cite web | author = | title = The Kockums Stirling AIP system&nbsp;\u2013 proven in operational service | publisher = Kockums | url = http://www.sesusa.org/submarine.pdf | accessdate=2011-06-07}}</ref><ref name=\"Kockums\">Kockums (a)</ref> The submarines store compressed oxygen to allow more efficient and cleaner external fuel combustion when submerged, providing heat for the Stirling engine's operation.

In the case of medium to high power Stirling engines, a [[radiator]] is generally required to transfer the heat from the engine to the ambient air. Stirling marine engines have the advantage of using the ambient temperature water. Placing the cooling radiator section in seawater rather than ambient air allows for the radiator to be smaller. The engine's cooling water may be used directly or indirectly for heating and cooling purposes of the ship.  The Stirling engine has potential for surface-ship propulsion, as the engine's larger physical size is less of a concern.\n\n===Electric===\n{{seealso|Electric boat}}\nBattery generated electric propulsion first appeared in the latter part of the 19th century, powering small lake boats.  These relied entirely on [[lead-acid battery|lead-acid batteries]] for electric current to power their propellers.  [[Electric Launch Company|Elco]] (the Electric Launch Company) evolved into the industry leader, later expanding into other forms of vessel, including the iconic World War II [[PT boat]].\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century electric propulsion was adapted to use in [[submarine]]s. As underwater propulsion driven exclusively by heavy batteries was both slow and of limited range and timespan, rechargeable battery banks were developed.  Submarines were primarily powered by combined [[diesel-electric]] systems on the surface, which were much faster and allowed for dramatically expanded range, charging their battery systems as necessary for still limited subsurface action and duration. The [[Plunger (experimental submarine)|Holland V]] submarine led to the adoption of this system by the [[U.S. Navy]], followed by the [[British Royal Navy]].\n\nTo expand the range and duration of the submarine during World War II the German [[Kriegsmarine]] developed a [[Submarine snorkel|snorkel]] system, which allowed the diesel-electric system to be utilized while the submarine was all but completely submerged. Finally, in 1952, the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']] was launched, the world's first nuclear powered submarine, which eliminated the restrictions of both diesel fuel and limited duration battery propulsion.\n\n[[Electric boat#List of battery-electric ships|Several short-range ships are built as (or converted to) pure electric vessels]]. This includes some powered by batteries which are recharged from shore, and some [[shore-power]]ed by [[Electric boat#Wired electric boats|electrical cables]], [[Straussee Ferry|either]] [[Canby Ferry|overhead]] or [[Kastellet ferry|submerged]] (no batteries).\n\nOn November 12, 2017 [[Guangzhou Shipyard International]] (GSI) launched what may be the world's first all-electric, battery-powered inland coal carrier. The 2,000 dwt vessel will carry bulk cargo for up to 40 nautical miles per charge.

These include:\n\n===Propeller===\n{{Main|Propeller}}\nMarine propellers are also known as \"screws\". There are many variations of marine screw systems, including twin, contra-rotating, controllable-pitch, and nozzle-style screws.  While smaller vessels tend to have a single screw, even very large ships such as tankers, container ships and bulk carriers may have single screws for reasons of fuel efficiency.  Other vessels may have twin, triple or quadruple screws.  Power is transmitted from the engine to the screw by way of a propeller shaft, which may be connected to a gearbox.\n\n===Paddle wheel===\n[[File:Paddle wheel small.jpg|thumb|left|Left: original paddle wheel from a paddle steamer.<br>Right: detail of a paddle steamer.]]\n{{See also|Paddle steamer|Pedalo}}\nThe paddle wheel is a large wheel, generally built of a [[steel frame]]work, upon the outer edge of which are fitted numerous paddle blades (called ''floats'' or ''buckets'').  The bottom quarter or so of the wheel travels underwater.  Rotation of the paddle wheel produces [[thrust]], forward or backward as required.  More advanced paddle wheel designs have featured ''feathering'' methods that keep each paddle blade oriented closer to vertical while it is in the water; this increases efficiency.  The upper part of a paddle wheel is normally enclosed in a paddlebox to minimise splashing.\n\nPaddle wheels have been superseded by screws, which are a much more efficient form of propulsion.  Nevertheless, paddle wheels have two advantages over screws, making them suitable for vessels in  shallow rivers and constrained waters: first, they are less likely to be clogged by obstacles and debris; and secondly, when contra-rotating, they allow the vessel to spin around its own vertical axis.  Some vessels had a single screw in addition to two paddle wheels, to gain the advantages of both types of propulsion.\n\n===Pump jet===\n{{main|pump-jet}}\nA '''pump-jet''', '''hydrojet''', '''water jet''', or '''jet drive''' uses a [[ducted propeller]] ([[axial-flow pump]]), [[centrifugal pump]], or mixed flow pump to create a jet of water for propulsion.\n\nThese incorporate an intake for source water and a nozzle to direct its flow out, generating momentum, and in most cases, employing thrust vectoring to steer the craft.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonmarine.co.nz/includes/files_cms/file/JetTorque%2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-10-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120110527/http://hamiltonmarine.co.nz/includes/files_cms/file/JetTorque%2008.pdf |archivedate=2018-01-20 }}</ref>\n\nPump-jets are found on [[personal watercraft]], shallow-draft river boats, and torpedoes.\n\n===Sail===\n{{main|Forces on sails}}\nThe purpose of [[sail]]s is to use [[wind]] [[energy]] to propel the [[sailboat|vessel]], [[ice boat|sled]], [[sailboard|board]], [[land sailing|vehicle]] or  [[windmill sail|rotor]].\n\n===Voith-Schneider cyclo-rotor===\n[[Image:VSPreal.jpg|right|thumb|100px|Voith Schneider Propeller]]\nA [[Voith Schneider Propeller]] (VSP) is a practical [[cyclorotor]] that provides instant thrust in any direction.

Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]]'' the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to [[Silvanus Thompson]]. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ''Acad\u00e9mie'' on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, [[Gabriel Lippmann]].<ref name=\"robert7\"/> Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] had published his own finding in Berlin.<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\"/>\n\nAt that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\" She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\"/> On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\"/>\n\nIn July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"[[polonium]]\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain [[partitions of Poland|partitioned among three empires]] ([[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], and [[German Empire|Prussian]]).<ref name=\"psb111\"/> On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"[[radium]]\", from the [[Latin]] word for \"ray\".<ref name=\"psb112\"/><ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/><ref name=\"The Discovery of Radioactivity\"/> In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"[[radioactivity]]\".<ref name=\"psb111\"/>\n\nTo prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/> Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element [[bismuth]], and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/> Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to [[barium]], and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.<ref name=\"williams\"/> The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential [[crystallization]]. From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of [[radium chloride]] was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/><ref name=\"Williams332\"/> She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a [[half-life]] of only 138 days.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/>\n\nBetween 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to [[radium]], diseased, [[tumor|tumour-forming]] cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.<ref>\"Marie Sklodowska Curie\", ''[[Encyclopedia of World Biography]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, Detroit, Gale, 2004, pp. 339\u201341.

It seemed to contradict the principle of the conservation of energy and therefore forced a reconsideration of the foundations of physics. On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated. In medicine, the radioactivity of radium appeared to offer a means by which cancer could be successfully attacked.<ref name=\"Williams332\"/>}}\n\nIf Curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. To attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman.

Influenced by these two important discoveries, Curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.<ref name=\"psb111\"/><ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity\"/>\n\nShe used an innovative technique to investigate samples. Fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the [[electrometer]], a sensitive device for measuring electric charge.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity\"/> Using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. Using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity\"/> She [[hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of [[molecule]]s but must come from the [[atom]] itself.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity\"/> This hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity\"/><ref name=\"robert4\"/>\n\nIn 1897, her daughter [[Ir\u00e8ne Joliot-Curie|Ir\u00e8ne]] was born. To support her family, Curie began teaching at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]].<ref name=\"psb112\"/> The Curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to ESPCI.<ref name=\"psb112\"/> The shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/> They were unaware of the deleterious effects of [[Radioactive contamination|radiation exposure]] attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. ESPCI did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.<ref name=\"psb112\"/><ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/><ref name=\"Marie Curie&nbsp;\u2013 Student in Paris 2\"/>\n\nCurie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, [[pitchblende]] and [[torbernite]] (also known as chalcolite).<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/> Her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. She concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/><ref name=\"robert5\"/> She began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element [[thorium]] was also radioactive.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity\"/> Pierre Curie was increasingly intrigued by her work.

Had not Becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the ''[[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences]]'' the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity (and even a Nobel Prize), would instead have gone to [[Silvanus Thompson]]. Curie chose the same rapid means of publication. Her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ''Acad\u00e9mie'' on 12 April 1898 by her former professor, [[Gabriel Lippmann]].<ref name=\"robert7\"/> Even so, just as Thompson had been beaten by Becquerel, so Curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, [[Gerhard Carl Schmidt]] had published his own finding in Berlin.<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\"/>\n\nAt that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what Curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: \"The fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium.\" She later would recall how she felt \"a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible.\"<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\"/> On 14 April 1898, the Curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. They did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tonnes of the ore.<ref name=\"Robert Reid p. 65\"/>\n\nIn July 1898, Curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element they named \"[[polonium]]\", in honour of her native Poland, which would for another twenty years remain [[partitions of Poland|partitioned among three empires]] ([[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]], and [[German Empire|Prussian]]).<ref name=\"psb111\"/> On 26 December 1898, the Curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named \"[[radium]]\", from the [[Latin]] word for \"ray\".<ref name=\"psb112\"/><ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/><ref name=\"The Discovery of Radioactivity\"/> In the course of their research, they also coined the word \"[[radioactivity]]\".<ref name=\"psb111\"/>\n\nTo prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/> Pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element [[bismuth]], and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/> Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to [[barium]], and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach.<ref name=\"williams\"/> The Curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential [[crystallization]]. From a tonne of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of [[radium chloride]] was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/><ref name=\"Williams332\"/> She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a [[half-life]] of only 138 days.<ref name=\"Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity 2\"/>\n\nBetween 1898 and 1902, the Curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to [[radium]], diseased, [[tumor|tumour-forming]] cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.<ref>\"Marie Sklodowska Curie\", ''[[Encyclopedia of World Biography]]'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, Detroit, Gale, 2004, pp. 339\u201341.

On the experimental level the discovery of radium provided men like Ernest Rutherford with sources of radioactivity with which they could probe the structure of the atom. As a result of Rutherford's experiments with alpha radiation, the nuclear atom was first postulated.

Triangular trade usually evolves when a region has [[export]] commodities that are not required in the region from which its major [[import]]s come. Triangular trade thus provides a method for rectifying [[trade imbalance]]s between the above regions.\n\nHistorically the particular routes were also shaped by the powerful influence of [[winds in the Age of Sail|winds and currents]] during the [[age of sail]].  For example, from the main trading nations of Western Europe, it was much easier to sail westwards after first going ''south'' of [[30th parallel north|30 N latitude]] and reaching the so-called \"[[trade winds]]\"; thus arriving in the Caribbean rather than going straight west to the [[Northern America|North American mainland]]. Returning from North America, it is easiest to follow the [[Gulf Stream]] in a northeasterly direction using the [[westerlies]]. A similar triangle to this, called the ''[[volta do mar]]'' was already being used by the Portuguese, before [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyage, to sail to the [[Canary Islands]] and the [[Azores]]. Columbus simply expanded this triangle outwards, and his route became the main way for Europeans to reach, and return from, the Americas.\n\n==Atlantic triangular slave trade==\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Atlantic slave trade|Slave Coast of West Africa}}\n\nThe best-known triangular trading system is the transatlantic [[slave trade]] that operated from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between [[West Africa]],  [[Caribbean]] or [[Americas|America]]n colonies and the [[Europe]]an colonial powers, with the northern colonies of [[British North America]], especially [[New England]], sometimes taking over the role of Europe.<ref>[http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm About.com: The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade].

Merchants purchased raw [[sugar]] (often in its liquid form, [[molasses]]) from plantations in the Caribbean and shipped it to New England and Europe, where it was sold to distillery companies that produced rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase rum, furs, and lumber in New England which merchants shipped to Europe.  With the profits from the European sales, merchants purchased Europe's manufactured goods, including tools and weapons.  Then the merchants shipped those manufactured goods, along with the American sugar and rum, to West Africa where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of slaves in Brazil, the Caribbean islands, and the American South were then used to buy more sugar, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.\n[[File:Luxborough galley burnt nearly to the water, 25 June 1727.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The loss of the slaver ''[[Luxborough Galley]]'' in 1727  (\"I.C. 1760\"), lost in the last leg of the triangular trade, between the Caribbean and Britain.]]\n[[File:North Atlantic Gyre.png|thumb|[[North Atlantic Gyre]]]]\nThe first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as [[copper]], [[cloth]], trinkets, [[slave beads]], [[guns]] and [[ammunition]].<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Scotland and the Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=2012-01-03 }}.

When the ships did reach their intended ports, only about 90% of the passengers survived the journey across the middle passage.

The team was managed by former MLB star [[Monte Cross]]. After getting 97 hits with a .300 batting average, Murphy moved on to the Baltimore Orioles. Before he made his pro debut, Murphy played as a ringer, more or less, for the Honsdale of the semi-pro Anthracite League.<ref name=\"sabr.org\"/>\n\nMurphy played in his first major league game on August 26, 1912.

He would go on steal 111 bases throughout his career in the majors. \n  \nMurphy had played for an A's team that was one of the best in the American League. However, after the underdog [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] upset and swept the A's in the 1914 World Series, an angry Connie Mack sold off or outright released his best players. Murphy was one of the few hold overs on a depleted A's squad.

After seven players were implicated in the fix, Murphy replaced the now suspended Buck Weaver at third base. The suspension took its toll on the White Sox, who quickly fell out of contention.

After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

While still in college, Ritter traveled to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and West Germany to perform in plays. Ritter graduated in 1970.<ref name=lipton>{{cite magazine| last=Lipton| first=Michael A.| title=Acting His Age| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| magazine=People| date=December 16, 2002| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107160642/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20138768,00.html| archivedate=November 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Film and television===\n[[File:John Ritter 1977.jpg|thumb|Ritter as [[Jack Tripper]], 1977]]\nRitter headlined several stage performances. After his graduation from USC in 1970, his first TV acting experience was a campus revolutionary in the TV series ''[[Dan August]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]] and future ''Three's Company'' co-star [[Norman Fell]]. Ritter made his film debut in the 1971 Disney film ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]''. He made guest appearances on the television series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', and many others. He had a recurring role as the Reverend Matthew Fordwick on the drama series ''[[The Waltons]]'' from October 1972 to December 1976. Because he was not a weekly cast member, he had time to pursue other roles, which he did until December 1976, when he left for a starring role in the hit sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (the Americanized version of the 1970s British [[Thames Television]] series ''[[Man About the House]]'') in 1977. In 1978, Ritter played [[Ringo Starr]]'s manager on the TV special ''[[Ringo (1978 film)|Ringo]]''. In 1982, Ritter provided the voice of Peter Dickinson in ''[[The Flight of Dragons]]''.\n\nRitter became a household name playing struggling culinary student [[Jack Tripper]] with two female roommates. Ritter co-starred opposite [[Joyce DeWitt]] and [[Suzanne Somers]], and then later [[Jenilee Harrison]] and [[Priscilla Barnes]]. Much of the comedy centered around Jack's pretending to be gay to keep the old-fashioned landlords appeased over the seemingly sordid living arrangements. The series spent several seasons near the top of the TV ratings in the U.S. before ending in 1984. A year-long spin-off ''[[Three's a Crowd]]'' ensued, as the Jack Tripper character has a live-in girlfriend and runs his own bistro. The original series has been seen continuously in reruns and is available on DVD. During the run of ''Three's Company'', Ritter appeared in the films ''[[Hero at Large]]'', ''[[Americathon]]'', and ''[[They All Laughed]]''. In 1986, he played the role of Dad in the music video for [[Graham Nash]]'s song \"Innocent Eyes\" from the [[Innocent Eyes (Graham Nash album)|album of the same name]].\n\n''[[Hooperman]]'' was Ritter's first regular television role after ''Three's Company''. Detective Harry Hooperman inherits a run-down apartment building and hires Susan Smith ([[Debrah Farentino]]) to run it. A relationship follows, and Hooperman must juggle work, love, and the antics of Bijoux the dog. In 1988, John was nominated for both an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/john-ritter |title=John Ritter Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |date=September 12, 2003 |accessdate=December 12, 2014}}</ref> and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his work on ''Hooperman''. Ritter won a [[People's Choice Awards|People's Choice Award]] for this role. From 1992 to 1995, Ritter returned to television for three seasons as John Hartman, aide to a U.S. Senator in ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. This series starred [[Markie Post]] as Georgie Anne Lahti and [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Billy Bob Davis. He also played Garry Lejeune / Roger Tramplemain in the production ''Noises Off'' in 1992.\n\nAfter his time on television, he appeared in a number of movies, most notably ''[[Problem Child (film)|Problem Child]]'' and its [[Problem Child 2|first sequel]]. He played the lead role in [[Blake Edwards]]' 1989 film ''[[Skin Deep (1989 film)|Skin Deep]]'', appeared in the film version of ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'', rejoined Billy Bob Thornton in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning ''[[Sling Blade]]'' (playing a kindhearted, gay, discount-store manager), and co-starred with [[Olivier Gruner]] in the 1996 action film ''Mercenary''. Ritter starred in many made-for-TV movies, including ''Gramps'' (1995), co-starring with [[Andy Griffith]], Rob Hedden's ''The Colony'' (1995) with [[Hal Linden]], [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[It (miniseries)|It]]'', ''Danielle Steel's Heartbeat'' with [[Polly Draper]], and ''[[It Came From the Sky (film)|It Came From the Sky]]'' in 1999 with [[Yasmine Bleeth]].\n\nRitter also made guest appearances on TV shows, such as ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'', ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]],'' ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', and an episode of ''[[Law & Order: SVU]]'' (2002). He also provided the voice of the [[Clifford (character)|title character]] in the animated children's show ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog (TV series)|Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', a role for which he received four [[Daytime Emmy Award|Emmy]] nominations. His final film was ''[[Stanley's Dinosaur Round-Up]]'' (2006), an animated direct-to-DVD film based on the television series, which was dedicated to his memory.\n\nAt the time of his death he was starring in ''[[8 Simple Rules|8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter]]''.\n\n===Theater===\nRitter played Claude Pichon in ''[[The Dinner Party (play)|The Dinner Party]]'' (2000) at the [[Music Box Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], which was written by [[Neil Simon]].

The purpose of the JRF is to provide accurate information to the general public about the disease and its risk factors, provide support to individuals who have thoracic aortic disease or have lost a loved one to the disease, and improve the identification of individuals at risk for aortic dissections and the treatment of thoracic aortic disease through medical research. Yasbeck worked with the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston]] (UTHealth) to establish the John Ritter Research Program in Aortic and Vascular Diseases with the goal of preventing premature deaths due to aortic dissection by identifying genetic mutations that predispose individuals to thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Film===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
