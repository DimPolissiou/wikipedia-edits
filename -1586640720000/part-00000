Through multiple twists and turns, Kate is able to find the shocking truth to what happened to Janet.\n\n==Plot==\nThe year is 1979, and Janet Mandelbaum has just been given tenure in the English department at [[Harvard University]]. Although Janet is excited, many of her male colleagues seem to be dissatisfied with Janet's recent award. Soon after her award, Janet's old friend [[Kate Fansler]] comes to work at Harvard and is able to give support to her friend. While there Kate encounters her old friend Moon Mandelbaum, Janet's ex-husband, and meets other professors in the English Department. Kate learns through her new colleagues that Janet is not fitting in well at the university. In fact, many people find Janet to strange and unlikable.\n\nAfter an incident when Janet was found in a bathtub, presumably drunk, Janet becomes embarrassed and both Moon and Kate notice the change in her mood. As her friend, Kate hopes that this situation does not harm Janet's credibility at the university, although she finds that many of the professors no longer care for Janet. Although Kate defends Janet, it is no use. Many people ridicule Janet and seem to have no desire to get to know her better.\n\nOne day while Kate is in her office, she received a phone call from Professor Clarkville (another member of the English department). Clarkville explained to Kate that he has found Janet dead in the men's restroom. Immediately the question is \"Was Janet killed by a fellow professor\"? Kate seemed skeptical of this idea because she knew that other than not being liked, no one had anything to gain from Janet's death. Kate decided that she is going to investigate this peculiar death. One of the first few pieces she learned is that Janet death was caused from [[cyanide]] and Janet's body was moved to the men's restroom after her death; but where and when she actually died is still a mystery to Kate and the police.\n\nKate then visits Professor Clarkville to further discuss the situation. To her surprise, Clarkville explains that he did not know of Janet much before finding her in the men's restroom. He also says that he did not think that Janet should have come to Harvard. Immediately Kate becomes very leery of Clarkville and his confessions to Kate.\n\nBack at her office, Kate is contemplating all the different circumstances surrounding Janet's death. While she is working, she receives a phone call from Moon. Moon tells Kate he is in jail under the charges of murder for Janet's death but assures Kate he is not responsible for what happened. Moon reveals that he did have possession of cyanide long ago but tells Kate that it is locked away in a safe back in [[Minneapolis]].\n\nKate now has three suspects for Janet's death: Clarkville, Moon, and Luellen May (a fellow professor who found Janet passed out in the bathtub at a party). After a visit from Janet's brother and a tour of Janet's old apartment, Kate begins to put some ideas together about what really happened to Janet. Kate then visits with Clarkville once more to discuss his finding of Janet's body. In the meeting, Clarkville explains that the last time anyone had seen Janet alive was in the department meeting. During the meeting, Janet had become hysterical about an issue that caused a lot of tension in the room. Kate then gets Clarkville to admit to moving Janet's body to the men's room for her to be 'discovered'. Clarkville explains that he had originally found Janet in the chairman's office dead and decided to move her to a restroom (the men's room was the closest) and reported finding her there. Kate then is granted access to Janet's office at the university and finds a poem that she believes is the biggest clue to Janet's death.\n\nKate finally rules that Janet's death was a suicide. She reveals that she stole the cyanide from Moon and after the amount of stress and tension she had endured at the university, she decided to end her own life.<ref>{{cite book |title=Death In A Tenured Position |author=Amanda Cross |publisher=The Ballantine Publishing Group |date=1981}}</ref>\n\n==Main characters==\nKate Fansler\n\nJanet Mandelbaum\n\nMoon Mandelbaum\n\nProfessor Clarkville\n\nJohn Cunningham\n\nSylvia\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the major themes in the novel is [[feminism]] and discrimination against women. [[Carolyn Gold Heilbrun]] herself was a professor in the English department at [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and she says that she experienced many instances of discrimination during her career.

It is a close relative of the small white, ''[[Pieris rapae]]''.\n\nThe large white is common throughout [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]].\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe large white is common throughout Europe, north [[Africa]], and [[Asia]] to the [[Himalayas]] often in agricultural areas, meadows and parkland. It has managed to establish a population in [[South Africa]] and in 1995 it was predicted to spread to Australia and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/butterflies/pieridae/pieris_brassicae.htm |title=Pieris brassicae |publisher=Biodiversityexplorer.org |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=1995|title=The Large Cabbage White, ''Pieris brassicae'', extends its range to South Africa | journal= The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation |volume=107 |page=174 |issn=0013-8916 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/94965#page/204/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nThe large white is a strong flier and the British population is reinforced in most years by migrations from the continent.  Scattered reports of the large white from the north-eastern United States (New York, Rhode Island and Maine) over the past century are of a dubious nature and indicate either accidental transport or intentional release.  Such introductions threaten to establish this agricultural pest in North America.\n\nIn 2010 the butterfly was found in [[Nelson, New Zealand]] where it is known as the great white butterfly.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/3823358/Great-white-butterfly-found-in-Nelson|title=Great white butterfly found in Nelson|last=Moore|first=Bill|date=17 June 2010|work=Nelson Mail|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> It is classed as an unwanted pest due to the potential effect on crops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/files/pests/great-white-cabbage-butterfly-fact-sheet.pdf|title=Great white cabbage butterfly|publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry|accessdate=18 December 2012}}</ref> For a limited period in October 2013 the [[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)|Department of Conservation]] offered a monetary reward for the capture of the butterfly.<ref>[http://www.3news.co.nz/Wanted-great-white-butterfly-preferably-dead/tabid/423/articleID/314571/Default.aspx Wanted: Great white butterfly, preferably dead].

The first instar follows hatching of the egg into large white larvae. The larvae are a light yellow in colour with distinctive brown heads and have soft bodies. The larvae appear as if they are very hairy. Following a moulting, the larvae enter the second instar. They have [[tubercles]] covered with black hair. In the third instar, large white larvae display more activity. This instar is when the larvae are observed to eat voraciously, and cause significant amounts of damage to their host plant. At this point, they are observed to be more yellow in colour, studded with black dots. Following the third instar, the larvae go through the fourth instar, with similar appearances as the larvae of the third instar, but with more aggrandized size and feeding behaviour. The large white larvae are observed to be cylindrical, robust, and elongated by the fifth instar, yellow in colour<ref name=\":11\" /> and with bright colouration on their abdomen and thorax. They are also observed to have a grey and black head. This instar requires maximum food quality and quantity in order to aid in full development, otherwise the larva dies before becoming an adult butterfly.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":8\">Metspalu, L., K.

The female also has two black spots on each forewing.  The underside of each wing is a pale greenish and serves as excellent [[camouflage]] when at rest. The black markings are generally darker in the summer brood. The large white butterfly's wingspan reaches 5 to 6.5&nbsp;cm on average.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n====Male====\n{{Lepidopteran glossary hatnote}}\n\nThe upperside of the male is creamy white. The forewing is irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at the base and along costa for a short distance.  The apex and termen above vein 2 are more or less broadly black with the inner margin of the black area containing a regular even curve.  In one or two specimens a small longitudinally narrow black spot was found in interspace 3. Hindwing: uniform, irrorated with black scales at base, a large black subcostal spot before the apex, and in a few specimens indications of black scaling on the termen anteriorly. The underside of the forewing is white, slightly irrorated with black scales at the base of cell and along costa.  The apex is light ochraceous brown with a large black spot in outer half of interspace 1 and another quadrate black spot at base of interspace 3. The hindwing is light ochraceous brown, closely irrorated with minute black scales.  The subcostal black spot before the apex shows through from the upperside. The antennae are black and white at apex.  The head, thorax, and abdomen are black, with some white hairs, where underneath is whitish.<ref name=\"Bingham\">{{cite book |last1=Bingham |first1=C.T. |authorlink=Charles Thomas Bingham |title=The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma |url=https://archive.org/details/butterflies02bingiala |volume=II |edition=1st |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor and Francis, Ltd.]] |location=London |year=1907 }}</ref>\n\n====Female====\nThe upperside of the female is similar to that of the male, but the irroration of black scales at the bases of the wings is more extended.  The black area on apex and termen of forewing is broader, its inner margin less evenly curved.  A conspicuous large, black spot also exists in the outer half of interspace 1 near the base of interspace 3. On the hindwing the subcostal black spot before the apex is much larger and more prominent. The underside is similar to that of the male but the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing is a light ochraceous yellow, not ochraceous brown.  The black discal spots on forewing are much larger. The antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen of the females are the same as for the male.<ref name=\"Bingham\" />\n\n==Habitat==\nThe large white butterfly's habitat consists of large, open spaces, as well as farms and vegetable gardens, because of the availability of its food source. Some favoured locations include walls, fences, tree trunks, and often their food plant, which is important for large white survival since they need to have access to their food source for survival. They primarily hover around these locations, which should contain both wild and cultivated [[Cruciferous vegetables|crucifer]], as well as [[oil-seed rape]], cabbages, and [[Brussels sprouts]].<ref name=\":0\">Carter, D.

This means that, though some female butterflies can have more than one mate, most of the large white females only have one male mate at a time through a monogamous mating system.<ref>Karlsson, B. \"Male Reproductive Reserves in Relation to Mating System in Butterflies: A Comparative Study.\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 263.1367 (1996): 187-92.

Web. 24 Oct. 2013.</ref>\n\n===Life cycle===\n\n====Oviposition====\nThese female butterflies oviposit in clusters on the undersides of leaves because the larvae prefer the morphology of leaf undersides over the upper surface of leaves. To oviposit, the female butterflies use the tip of the abdomen and arrange the ova in specific batches.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe pre-oviposition period, which lasts three to eight days, provides ample time for these butterflies to mate.<ref>Scott, James A. \"Mate-Locating Behavior of Butterflies.\" American Midland Naturalist 91.1 (1974): 103-17. Print.</ref> Females tend to use their forelegs to drum on the surfaces of their intended leaves as a test of the plant's suitability for breeding. If they find a suitable surface, female large whites oviposit two to three days following [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]]. They oviposit approximately six to seven times in eight days. The females can pair up to mate again approximately five or more days after the previous mating.<ref name=\":5\">W. A. L. David and B. O. C. Gardiner (1962).

They favour green surfaces in particular to display [[oviposition]] behaviour. This colour preference could be due to the fact that the large white's food source also acts as a host plant for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMost females choose nectar plants like [[buddleia]] or [[thistles]],<ref name=\":7\">Rowlings, Matt. \"Large White.\" Pieris Brassicae - Field Notes.

Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Caterpillars and eggs of Large White butterfly - geograph.org.uk - 1009228.jpg|thumb|Eggs and newly hatched caterpillars]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar).jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Migration===\nThe large whites are found throughout most of [[Eurasia]], though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLarge white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate [[Equator]] during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed.<ref name=\":4\">Feltwell, John. Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry, and Physiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linnaeus). The Hague: W. Junk, 1982. Print.</ref> However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Hibernation===\nLarge white broods in the north have not been seen to [[Overwintering|overwinter]], or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Pullin, A. S., J. S. Bale, and X. L. R. Fontaine. \"Physiological Aspects of Diapause and Cold Tolerance during Overwintering in Pieris Brassicae.\" Physiological Entomology 16.4 (1991): 447-56. Print.</ref>\n\n===Territorial behaviour===\nMales do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant [[sexual dimorphism]] between the male and female large white butterflies.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Diet and food selection===\n\nLarge white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes.<ref name=\":3\" /> In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n \nPlants with [[Glucosinolate|mustard-oil glucosides]] are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours,<ref name=\":3\" /> and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n \nHowever, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[steroid]]s; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower [[nectar]].\n\n===Predators===\nLarge white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Arachnid]]; some species of [[mammal]]s, one of [[reptile]]s, one species of [[insectivorous plant]], and species in [[amphibian]] orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Aposematism===\nLarge white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an [[aposematic]] species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the [[larval]], [[pupal]], and [[imago]] stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=aposem2>{{cite journal|last=Lyytinen|first=Anne|author2=Alatalo, Rauno V. |author3=Lindstr\u00f6m, Leena |author4= Mappes, Johanna |title=Are European White Butterflies Aposematic?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=November 1999|volume=13|issue=7/8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.1023/A:1011081800202|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mappes/publications/Lyytinen_etal_01_evoeco.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Aposematism is not entirely related to [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of ''[[Papilio machaon]]''.<ref name=aposematism>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=edited by David L.|title=Insect defenses: adaptive mechanisms and strategies of prey and predators|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791406168|pages=182\u2013183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jpxkhS7O0p0C&pg=PA175&dq=pieris+brassicae+mullerian+mimicry#v=snippet&q=brassicae&f=false|author2=Schmidt, Justin O.}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to people==\n\n===Role as pests===\nThe crops most susceptible to ''P. brassicae'' damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' ([[cabbage]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], and their allies), particularly [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]], [[Rapeseed|rape]], [[Rutabaga|swede]], and [[turnip]]. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of ''P. brassicae'' are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, ''P. brassicae'' are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons.

It is a close relative of the small white, ''[[Pieris rapae]]''.\n\nThe large white is common throughout [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[Asia]].\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe large white is common throughout Europe, north [[Africa]], and [[Asia]] to the [[Himalayas]] often in agricultural areas, meadows and parkland. It has managed to establish a population in [[South Africa]] and in 1995 it was predicted to spread to Australia and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biodiversityexplorer.org/butterflies/pieridae/pieris_brassicae.htm |title=Pieris brassicae |publisher=Biodiversityexplorer.org |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|year=1995|title=The Large Cabbage White, ''Pieris brassicae'', extends its range to South Africa | journal= The Entomologist's Record and Journal of Variation |volume=107 |page=174 |issn=0013-8916 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/94965#page/204/mode/1up}}</ref>\n\nThe large white is a strong flier and the British population is reinforced in most years by migrations from the continent.  Scattered reports of the large white from the north-eastern United States (New York, Rhode Island and Maine) over the past century are of a dubious nature and indicate either accidental transport or intentional release.

They turn into a darker yellow within twenty-four hours of being oviposited. A few hours prior to hatching, they will become black in colour, and the shell will become more transparent, and the larvae will appear visible.<ref name=\":11\">Molet, T. 2011.

The first instar follows hatching of the egg into large white larvae. The larvae are a light yellow in colour with distinctive brown heads and have soft bodies. The larvae appear as if they are very hairy. Following a moulting, the larvae enter the second instar. They have [[tubercles]] covered with black hair. In the third instar, large white larvae display more activity. This instar is when the larvae are observed to eat voraciously, and cause significant amounts of damage to their host plant. At this point, they are observed to be more yellow in colour, studded with black dots. Following the third instar, the larvae go through the fourth instar, with similar appearances as the larvae of the third instar, but with more aggrandized size and feeding behaviour. The large white larvae are observed to be cylindrical, robust, and elongated by the fifth instar, yellow in colour<ref name=\":11\" /> and with bright colouration on their abdomen and thorax. They are also observed to have a grey and black head. This instar requires maximum food quality and quantity in order to aid in full development, otherwise the larva dies before becoming an adult butterfly.<ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":8\">Metspalu, L., K.

The female also has two black spots on each forewing.  The underside of each wing is a pale greenish and serves as excellent [[camouflage]] when at rest. The black markings are generally darker in the summer brood. The large white butterfly's wingspan reaches 5 to 6.5&nbsp;cm on average.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n====Male====\n{{Lepidopteran glossary hatnote}}\n\nThe upperside of the male is creamy white. The forewing is irrorated (sprinkled) with black scales at the base and along costa for a short distance.  The apex and termen above vein 2 are more or less broadly black with the inner margin of the black area containing a regular even curve.  In one or two specimens a small longitudinally narrow black spot was found in interspace 3. Hindwing: uniform, irrorated with black scales at base, a large black subcostal spot before the apex, and in a few specimens indications of black scaling on the termen anteriorly. The underside of the forewing is white, slightly irrorated with black scales at the base of cell and along costa.  The apex is light ochraceous brown with a large black spot in outer half of interspace 1 and another quadrate black spot at base of interspace 3. The hindwing is light ochraceous brown, closely irrorated with minute black scales.  The subcostal black spot before the apex shows through from the upperside. The antennae are black and white at apex.  The head, thorax, and abdomen are black, with some white hairs, where underneath is whitish.<ref name=\"Bingham\">{{cite book |last1=Bingham |first1=C.T. |authorlink=Charles Thomas Bingham |title=The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma |url=https://archive.org/details/butterflies02bingiala |volume=II |edition=1st |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor and Francis, Ltd.]] |location=London |year=1907 }}</ref>\n\n====Female====\nThe upperside of the female is similar to that of the male, but the irroration of black scales at the bases of the wings is more extended.  The black area on apex and termen of forewing is broader, its inner margin less evenly curved.  A conspicuous large, black spot also exists in the outer half of interspace 1 near the base of interspace 3. On the hindwing the subcostal black spot before the apex is much larger and more prominent. The underside is similar to that of the male but the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing is a light ochraceous yellow, not ochraceous brown.  The black discal spots on forewing are much larger. The antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen of the females are the same as for the male.<ref name=\"Bingham\" />\n\n==Habitat==\nThe large white butterfly's habitat consists of large, open spaces, as well as farms and vegetable gardens, because of the availability of its food source. Some favoured locations include walls, fences, tree trunks, and often their food plant, which is important for large white survival since they need to have access to their food source for survival. They primarily hover around these locations, which should contain both wild and cultivated [[Cruciferous vegetables|crucifer]], as well as [[oil-seed rape]], cabbages, and [[Brussels sprouts]].<ref name=\":0\">Carter, D.

This means that, though some female butterflies can have more than one mate, most of the large white females only have one male mate at a time through a monogamous mating system.<ref>Karlsson, B. \"Male Reproductive Reserves in Relation to Mating System in Butterflies: A Comparative Study.\" Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences 263.1367 (1996): 187-92.

Web. 24 Oct. 2013.</ref>\n\n===Life cycle===\n\n====Oviposition====\nThese female butterflies oviposit in clusters on the undersides of leaves because the larvae prefer the morphology of leaf undersides over the upper surface of leaves. To oviposit, the female butterflies use the tip of the abdomen and arrange the ova in specific batches.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe pre-oviposition period, which lasts three to eight days, provides ample time for these butterflies to mate.<ref>Scott, James A. \"Mate-Locating Behavior of Butterflies.\" American Midland Naturalist 91.1 (1974): 103-17. Print.</ref> Females tend to use their forelegs to drum on the surfaces of their intended leaves as a test of the plant's suitability for breeding. If they find a suitable surface, female large whites oviposit two to three days following [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]]. They oviposit approximately six to seven times in eight days. The females can pair up to mate again approximately five or more days after the previous mating.<ref name=\":5\">W. A. L. David and B. O. C. Gardiner (1962).

They favour green surfaces in particular to display [[oviposition]] behaviour. This colour preference could be due to the fact that the large white's food source also acts as a host plant for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMost females choose nectar plants like [[buddleia]] or [[thistles]],<ref name=\":7\">Rowlings, Matt. \"Large White.\" Pieris Brassicae - Field Notes.

Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Caterpillars and eggs of Large White butterfly - geograph.org.uk - 1009228.jpg|thumb|Eggs and newly hatched caterpillars]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar).jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Migration===\nThe large whites are found throughout most of [[Eurasia]], though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLarge white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate [[Equator]] during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed.<ref name=\":4\">Feltwell, John. Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry, and Physiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linnaeus). The Hague: W. Junk, 1982. Print.</ref> However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Hibernation===\nLarge white broods in the north have not been seen to [[Overwintering|overwinter]], or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Pullin, A. S., J. S. Bale, and X. L. R. Fontaine. \"Physiological Aspects of Diapause and Cold Tolerance during Overwintering in Pieris Brassicae.\" Physiological Entomology 16.4 (1991): 447-56. Print.</ref>\n\n===Territorial behaviour===\nMales do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant [[sexual dimorphism]] between the male and female large white butterflies.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Diet and food selection===\n\nLarge white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes.<ref name=\":3\" /> In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n \nPlants with [[Glucosinolate|mustard-oil glucosides]] are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours,<ref name=\":3\" /> and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n \nHowever, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[steroid]]s; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower [[nectar]].\n\n===Predators===\nLarge white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Arachnid]]; some species of [[mammal]]s, one of [[reptile]]s, one species of [[insectivorous plant]], and species in [[amphibian]] orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Aposematism===\nLarge white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an [[aposematic]] species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the [[larval]], [[pupal]], and [[imago]] stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=aposem2>{{cite journal|last=Lyytinen|first=Anne|author2=Alatalo, Rauno V. |author3=Lindstr\u00f6m, Leena |author4= Mappes, Johanna |title=Are European White Butterflies Aposematic?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=November 1999|volume=13|issue=7/8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.1023/A:1011081800202|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mappes/publications/Lyytinen_etal_01_evoeco.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Aposematism is not entirely related to [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of ''[[Papilio machaon]]''.<ref name=aposematism>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=edited by David L.|title=Insect defenses: adaptive mechanisms and strategies of prey and predators|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791406168|pages=182\u2013183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jpxkhS7O0p0C&pg=PA175&dq=pieris+brassicae+mullerian+mimicry#v=snippet&q=brassicae&f=false|author2=Schmidt, Justin O.}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to people==\n\n===Role as pests===\nThe crops most susceptible to ''P. brassicae'' damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' ([[cabbage]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], and their allies), particularly [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]], [[Rapeseed|rape]], [[Rutabaga|swede]], and [[turnip]]. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of ''P. brassicae'' are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, ''P. brassicae'' are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web|title=Pieris brassicae|url=http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/webfm_send/1177|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n* ''Pieris brassicae azorensis'' \n* ''Pieris brassicae brassicae''\n* ''Pieris brassicae ottonis''\n* ''[[Pieris brassicae wollastoni]]'' [[extinction | \u2020]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madeiran large white]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|26em}}\n{{Commons category|position=left|Pieris brassicae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Pieris brassicae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q26764}}\n\n[[Category:Pieris (butterfly)|brassicae]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Africa]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Asia]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of India]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Iran]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Butterflies described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n", "name_user": "Stavast22", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMorphology:Sub-title language consistency, Latin or English, but not both.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_brassicae"}

Among the leading local drivers of that era were Butch Gardner and the \u2018Pennsylvania coal miner\u2019, Mike (Little) Serokman.<ref name=speedway-about>{{cite web|title=About|url=http://www.jennerstown.org/about/|website=Jennerstown Speedway|accessdate=3 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] a smaller, lighted dirt quarter mile track was built in the infield in 1953. Laird Brunner became the first weekly promoter to present stock car racing, which had replaced the midgets as the post-war entertainment craze sweeping the nation. At that time the half-mile was abandoned. The half mile track was again rebuilt in 1967 and was used briefly. Brunner was followed by the successful promotional team of Carmen Amica/Dick Basserman, who guided the speedway during the early 1960s. Other promoters during the quarter mile era included Lou Smith and George Kittey.

In terms of content, the magazine features news, interviews, and reviews covering all five live-action series, [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|the animated series]], the [[Star Trek (film series)|film series]], and other official media, including books and computer games.\n\n==Publication history==\n''Star Trek Magazine'' was the first regular magazine to be published by [[Titan Magazines]] and is its longest-running title. It was launched in February 1995 as '''''Star Trek Monthly''''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starlogged.blogspot.ie/2015/10/1995-star-trek-magazine-launch-ad-titan.html |title=1995: ''STAR TREK MAGAZINE'' Launch Ad (Titan Magazines) |publisher=STARLOGGED! |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref> soon after the first broadcast of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''.\n\nEarly in its run, the magazine featured reprints of several [[Star Trek (comics)#DC|DC Comics-produced comics]], but this ended after issue 22.\n\nWith issue 113, the publication went to a bi-monthly release schedule, and increased its page count from 68 to 100. Before this change, various issues were special \"bumper\" releases (100 pages, costing \u00a34.99, usually with a gift \u2013 typically a Titan-released ''Trek'' book) to commemorate a specific occasion, such as the 30th and 35th anniversaries, the end of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', and others.\n\nA separate North American edition of the magazine came into being in August 2006, otherwise synchronized with the UK version for contents, due in part to the loss of the ''Star Trek: Communicator'' in 2005, which had aggravated the previous 2003 loss of ''Star Trek: The Magazine'', leaving the home market devoid of any and all \"official\" ''Star Trek''' franchise magazines. Issue #1 of the run \u2013 bi-monthly like the UK edition \u2013 was released on 22 August 2006. Numbering of the UK edition maintained its internal continuity, with the US #1 being relatively the same as UK issue 128. Later US editions returned to 68 pages in length, with the additional UK pages being inserted in the form of a supplement at the centre of the magazine. This practice was quickly discontinued, and the various editions were standardized with issue 134.\n\nThe magazine is now printed in the United States rather than the UK, meaning that US distribution now takes place some time before UK release. A special cover is available for specialist comic shops ordering via the Diamond Previews magazine.\n\nFor issue 137, and all subsequent 100-page editions, a new binding format and magazine size was introduced. The issue was perfect bound (instead of saddle-stitched), and measured 8 inches wide \u00d7 11 inches high (instead of 9 \u00d7 12).

In terms of content, the magazine features news, interviews, and reviews covering all five live-action series, [[Star Trek: The Animated Series|the animated series]], the [[Star Trek (film series)|film series]], and other official media, including books and computer games.\n\n==Publication history==\n''Star Trek Magazine'' was the first regular magazine to be published by [[Titan Magazines]] and is its longest-running title. It was launched in February 1995 as '''''Star Trek Monthly''''',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://starlogged.blogspot.ie/2015/10/1995-star-trek-magazine-launch-ad-titan.html |title=1995: ''STAR TREK MAGAZINE'' Launch Ad (Titan Magazines) |publisher=STARLOGGED! |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}</ref> soon after the first broadcast of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. \n\nEarly in its run, the magazine featured reprints of several [[Star Trek (comics)#DC|DC Comics-produced comics]], but this ended after issue 22.\n\nWith issue 113, the publication went to a bi-monthly release schedule, and increased its page count from 68 to 100. Before this change, various issues were special \"bumper\" releases (100 pages, costing \u00a34.99, usually with a gift \u2013 typically a Titan-released ''Trek'' book) to commemorate a specific occasion, such as the 30th and 35th anniversaries, the end of ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', and others.\n\nA separate North American edition of the magazine came into being in August 2006, otherwise synchronized with the UK version for contents, due in part to the loss of the ''Star Trek: Communicator'' in 2005, which had aggravated the previous 2003 loss of ''Star Trek: The Magazine'', leaving the home market devoid of any and all \"official\" ''Star Trek''' franchise magazines. Issue #1 of the run \u2013 bi-monthly like the UK edition \u2013 was released on 22 August 2006. Numbering of the UK edition maintained its internal continuity, with the US #1 being relatively the same as UK issue 128. Later US editions returned to 68 pages in length, with the additional UK pages being inserted in the form of a supplement at the centre of the magazine. This practice was quickly discontinued, and the various editions were standardized with issue 134.\n\nThe magazine is now printed in the United States rather than the UK, meaning that US distribution now takes place some time before UK release. A special cover is available for specialist comic shops ordering via the Diamond Previews magazine.\n\nFor issue 137, and all subsequent 100-page editions, a new binding format and magazine size was introduced. The issue was perfect bound (instead of saddle-stitched), and measured 8 inches wide \u00d7 11 inches high (instead of 9 \u00d7 12). The following issue retained the size, but returned to saddle-stitching. With this issue, the UK edition lost its 100-page length, becoming 68 pages long.\n\nThe frequency with which the title has been published has further varied over the years, with an increase in output to eight issues a year in early 2009 (with issue 143), followed by a decrease to quarterly (along with an additional yearly publication) from 2012 onwards.

Several types of diesel locomotive have been developed, differing mainly in the means by which mechanical power is conveyed to the [[driving wheel]]s.\n\nEarly [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] locomotives and railcars used [[kerosene]] and [[gasoline]] as their fuel. [[Rudolf Diesel]] patented his first [[Diesel engine|compression ignition engine]]<ref>{{cite patent |inventor=Rudolf Diesel |country=U.S. |number=608,845 |fdate=15 July 1895 |issue-date=9 August 1898 |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT608845&id=vQVgAAAAEBAJ&dq=608845 |title=Internal-combustion engine}}</ref> in 1898, and steady improvements to the design of diesel engines reduced their physical size and improved their power-to-weight ratios to a point where one could be mounted in a locomotive. Internal combustion engines only operate efficiently within a limited [[torque]] range, and while low power gasoline engines could be coupled to mechanical [[transmission (mechanics)|transmissions]], the more powerful diesel engines required the development of new forms of transmission.<ref>Arnold Heller:  ''Der Automobilmotor im Eisenbahnbetriebe'', Leipzig 1906, reprinted by Salzwasserverlag 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-86444-240-7}}</ref><ref>[http://www.zeno.org/Roell-1912/A/Elektrische+Eisenbahnen R\u00f6ll: ''Enzyklop\u00e4die des Eisenbahnwesens'' \u2192 ''Elektrische Eisenbahnen'', there go to ''VII.

In 1930, Armstrong Whitworth of the United Kingdom delivered two {{convert|1200|hp|kW|abbr=on}} locomotives using [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer]]-designed engines to [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway]] of Argentina. In 1933, diesel-electric technology developed by [[Maybach]] was used to propel the [[DRG Class SVT 877]], a high-speed intercity two-car set, and went into series production with other streamlined car sets in Germany starting in 1935. In the United States, diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934, largely through the research and development efforts of [[General Motors]] dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the [[Budd Company]].\n\nThe economic recovery from [[World War II]] caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries. They offered greater flexibility and performance than [[steam locomotive]]s, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs. Diesel\u2013hydraulic transmissions were introduced in the 1950s, but, from the 1970s onwards, diesel\u2013electric transmissions have dominated.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==History==\n===Adaptation for rail use===\n[[File:Priestmann Oil Engine - Fig 150 p461 The Steam engine and gas and oil engines John Perry.PNG|thumb|Diagram of Priestman oil engine from ''The Steam engine and gas and oil engines'' (1900) by John Perry]]\n[[File:Acsev56.jpg|thumb|Petrol-electric [[Weitzer railmotor]], first 1903, series 1906]]\nThe earliest recorded example of the use of an internal combustion engine in a railway locomotive is the prototype designed by [[William Dent Priestman]], which was examined by [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin]] in 1888 who described it as a \"[Priestman oil engine] mounted upon a truck which is worked on a temporary line of rails to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes.\"<ref>{{citation| magazine = The Engineer| date = 24 April 1956| page = 254| title = Motive power for British Railways| url = http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/5/56/Er19560824.pdf| volume = 202| access-date = 28 February 2014| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140304150727/http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/images/5/56/Er19560824.pdf| archive-date = 4 March 2014| url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url = |journal = The Electrical Review| volume =22|page = 474| date= 4 May 1888|quote = A small double cylinder engine has been mounted upon a truck, which is worked on a temporary line of rails, in order to show the adaptation of a petroleum engine for locomotive purposes, on tramways}}</ref> In 1894, a {{convert|20|hp|kW|abbr=on}} two-axle machine built by [[Priestman Brothers]] was used on the [[Hull Docks]].<ref>{{citation|journal = Diesel Railway Traction|volume = 17|year= 1963 |page=25| quote=In one sense a dock authority was the earliest user of an oil-engined locomotive, for it was at the Hull docks of the North Eastern Railway that the Priestman locomotive put in its short period of service in 1894}}</ref><ref>{{citation| url=| title = railway Locomotives| page  =42| first  =John R.|last = Day| first2= Basil Knowlman|last2 = Cooper| year  =1960|quote=The diesel has quite a long history, and the first one ran as far back as 1894.

The response to this law was to electrify high-traffic rail lines. However, electrification was uneconomical to apply to lower-traffic areas.\n\nThe first regular use of diesel\u2013electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications, which were more forgiving than mainline applications of the limitations of contemporary diesel technology and where the idling economy of diesel relative to steam would be most beneficial.  GE entered a collaboration with the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) and [[Ingersoll-Rand]] (the \"AGEIR\" consortium) in 1924 to produce a prototype {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"boxcab\" locomotive delivered in July 1925. This locomotive demonstrated that the diesel\u2013electric power unit could provide many of the benefits of an [[electric locomotive]] without the railroad having to bear the sizeable expense of electrification.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=25-27}} The unit successfully demonstrated, in switching and local freight and passenger service, on ten railroads and three industrial lines.<ref>Evolution of the American Diesel Locomotive, J Parker Lamb 2007, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34863-0}}, p.29</ref>  Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.  However, the [[Great Depression]] curtailed demand for Westinghouse's electrical equipment, and they stopped building locomotives internally, opting to supply electrical parts instead.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=28-30}}\n\nIn June 1925, [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] outshopped a prototype diesel\u2013electric locomotive for \"special uses\" (such as for runs where water for steam locomotives was scarce) using electrical equipment from [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Company]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Railroads To Try Diesel Locomotive |newspaper=Special to the New York Times |date=February 18, 1925 |page=1}}</ref> Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=283}} Industry sources were beginning to suggest \u201cthe outstanding advantages of this new form of motive power\u201d.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=27}}  In 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}  However, these early diesels proved expensive and unreliable, with their high cost of acquisition relative to steam unable to be realized in operating cost savings as they were frequently out of service.  It would be another five years before diesel-electric propulsion would be successfully used in mainline service, and nearly ten years before it would show real potential to fully replace steam.\n\nBefore diesel power could make inroads into mainline service, the limitations of diesel engines circa 1930&nbsp;\u2014 low power-to-weight ratios and narrow output range&nbsp;\u2014 had to be overcome.  A major effort to overcome those limitations was launched by [[General Motors]] after they moved into the diesel field with their acquisition of the [[Winton Engine Company]], a major manufacturer of diesel engines for marine and stationary applications, in 1930. Supported by the General Motors Research Division, GM's [[Cleveland Diesel Engine Division|Winton Engine Corporation]] sought to develop diesel engines suitable for high-speed mobile use.  The first milestone in that effort was delivery in early 1934 of the Winton 201A, a [[two-stroke]], [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots-supercharged]], [[Uniflow scavenging|uniflow-scavenged]], [[Unit injector|unit-injected]] [[diesel engine]] that could deliver the required performance for a fast, lightweight passenger train.  The second milestone, and the one that got American railroads moving towards diesel, was the 1938 delivery of GM's  [[EMD 567|Model 567]] engine that was designed specifically for locomotive use, bringing a fivefold increase in life of some mechanical parts and showing its potential for meeting the rigors of freight service.<ref name=Kettering>{{cite conference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuUiAQAAMAAJ|title=History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine |author=Kettering, E.W. |date={{date|1951-11-29|dmy}} |publisher=Electro-Motive Division, General Motors Corporation |conference=ASME 1951 Annual Meeting |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey}}</ref>\n\nDiesel\u2013electric railroad locomotion entered  mainline service when the [[Burlington Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific]] used custom-built diesel \"[[streamliner]]s\" to haul passengers, starting in late 1934.<ref name=\"Stover 212\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=RasMTuyGFYifsQLC3sGzCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Diesel Streamliners Now Link Coast-to-Coast\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1937</ref> Burlington's ''[[Burlington Zephyr|Zephyr]]'' trainsets evolved from articulated three-car sets with 600&nbsp;hp power cars in 1934 and early 1935, to the ''Denver Zephyr'' semi-articulated ten car trainsets pulled by cab-booster power sets introduced in late 1936.  Union Pacific started diesel streamliner service between Chicago and Portland Oregon in June 1935, and in the following year would add Los Angeles and Oakland California, and Denver Colorado to the destinations of diesel streamliners out of Chicago.  The Burlington and Union Pacific streamliners were built by the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Pullman-Standard|Pullman-Standard Company]], respectively, using the new Winton engines and power train systems designed by GM's [[Electro-Motive Corporation]].  EMC's experimental [[EMC 1800 hp B-B|1800 hp B-B]] locomotives of 1935 demonstrated the multiple-unit control systems used for the cab/booster sets and the twin-engine format used with the later ''Zephyr'' power units.  Both of those features would be used in EMC's later production model locomotives.  The lightweight diesel streamliners of the mid-1930s demonstrated the advantages of diesel for passenger service with breakthrough schedule times, but diesel locomotive power would not fully come of age until regular series production of mainline diesel locomotives commenced and it was shown suitable for full-size passenger and freight service.\n\n====First American series production locomotives====\nFollowing their 1925 prototype, the AGEIR consortium produced 25 more units of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"60 ton\" [[ALCO boxcab|AGEIR boxcab]] [[switcher|switching locomotives]] between 1925 and 1928 for several New York City railroads, making them the first series-produced diesel locomotives.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=209\u2013211}}  The consortium also produced seven twin-engine \"100 ton\" boxcabs and one hybrid trolley/battery unit with a diesel-driven charging circuit.  ALCO acquired the [[McIntosh & Seymour]] Engine Company in 1929 and entered series production of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single-cab switcher units in 1931.  ALCO would be the pre-eminent builder of switch engines through the mid-1930s and would adapt the basic switcher design to produce versatile and highly successful, albeit relatively low powered, road locomotives.\n\nGM, seeing the success of the custom streamliners, sought to expand the market for diesel power by producing standardized locomotives under their [[Electro-Motive Corporation]]. In 1936, EMC's new factory started production of switch engines.  In 1937, the factory started producing their new [[EMD E-unit|E series]] streamlined passenger locomotives, which would be upgraded with more reliable purpose-built engines in 1938.  Seeing the performance and reliability of the new [[EMD 567|567 model]] engine in passenger locomotives, EMC was eager to demonstrate diesel's viability in freight service.\n\nFollowing the successful 1939 tour of [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMC's]] [[EMD FT|FT]] demonstrator freight locomotive set, the stage was set for dieselization of American railroads.  In 1941, [[ALCO-GE]] introduced the [[ALCO RS-1|RS-1]] road-switcher that occupied its own market niche while EMD's [[EMD F-unit|F series]] locomotives were sought for mainline freight service.  The US entry into World War II slowed conversion to diesel; the War Production Board put a halt to building new passenger equipment and gave naval uses priority for diesel engine production.  During the [[Big Inch|petroleum crisis of 1942-43]], coal-fired steam had the advantage of not using fuel that was in critically short supply.   EMD was later allowed to increase the production of its FT locomotives and ALCO-GE was allowed to produce a limited number of [[DL-109]] road locomotives, but most in the locomotive business were restricted to making switch engines and steam locomotives.\n\nIn the early postwar era, EMD dominated the market for mainline locomotives with their E and F series locomotives.  ALCO-GE in the late 1940s produced switchers and road-switchers that were successful in the short-haul market.  However, EMD launched their [[EMD GP7|GP series]] road-switcher locomotives in 1949, which displaced all other locomotives in the freight market including their own F series locomotives.  GE subsequently dissolved its partnership with ALCO and would emerge as EMD's main competitor in the early 1960s, eventually taking the top position in the locomotive market from EMD.\n\nEarly diesel\u2013electric locomotives in the United States used direct current (DC) traction motors, but alternating current (AC) motors came into widespread use in the 1990s, starting with the [[EMD SD70 series|Electro-Motive SD70MAC]] in 1993 and followed by the [[GE AC4400CW|General Electric's AC4400CW]] in 1994 and [[GE AC6000CW|AC6000CW]] in 1995.<ref>Solomon, Brian, ''Locomotive'', 2001, pp 120, 130</ref>\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Europe===\n====First functional diesel vehicles====\n[[File:Limousin2010RVT01.jpg|thumb|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] & [[Germany|German]] co-production: world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcar 1914]]\nIn 1914, world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcars were produced for the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]].

Therefore, diesel traction became economical for [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]] before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After a few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.\n\n====Diesel railcars for regional traffic====\n[[File:Autorail Renault VH2211 Mulhouse FRA 001.jpg|thumb|Renault VH, [[History of rail transport in France|France]], 1933/34]]\nDiesel-powered or \"oil-engined\" railcars, generally diesel\u2013mechanical, were developed by various European manufacturers in the 1930s, e.g. by [[William Beardmore and Company]] for the [[Canadian National Railways]] (the [[Beardmore Tornado]] engine was subsequently used in the [[R101]] airship). Some of those series for regional traffic were begun with gasoline motors and then continued with diesel motors, such as Hungarian BC<sup>mot</sup> (The class code doesn't tell anything but \"railmotor with 2nd and 3rd class seats\".), 128 cars built 1926 \u2013 1937, or German [[Wismar railbus]]es (57 cars 1932 \u2013 1941). In France, the first diesel railcar was [[Renault VH]], 115 units produced 1933/34.\nIn Italy, after 6 Gasoline cars since 1931, Fiat and [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] built a lot of diesel railmotors, more than 110 from 1933 to 1938 and 390 from 1940 to 1953, [[FS Class ALn 772|Class 772]] known as ''Littorina'', and Class ALn 900.\n\n====High-speed railcars====\nIn the 1930s, streamlined highspeed diesel railcars were developed in several countries:\n* In Germany, the [[Flying Hamburger]] was built in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two coach diesel railcar (in English terminology a DMU2) started service at [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of [[DRG Class SVT 137]] with 33 more highspeed DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 (\"Hamburg\" series), 18 DMU 3 (\"Leipzig\" and \"K\u00f6ln\" series), and 2 DMU 4 (\"Berlin\" series).\n* French [[SNCF]] classes XF 1000 and XF 1100 comprised 11 high-speed DMUs, also called TAR, built 1934\u20131939.\n* In Hungary, [[Ganz Works]] built the {{Interlanguage link|Arp\u00e1d railmotor|hu|Aamot|de|M\u00c1V-Baureihe \u00c1rp\u00e1d}}, a kind of a luxurious railbus in a series of 7 items since 1934, and started to build the {{Interlanguage link|Hargita (DMU){{!}}Hargita|hu|Hargita motorvonat}} in 1944.\n\n====Further developments====\n[[File:LMS 10000 at Derby.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class D16/1]], since 1948]]In 1945, a batch of 30 Baldwin diesel\u2013electric locomotives, [[Baldwin 0-6-6-0 1000]], was delivered from the United States to the railways of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1947, the London Midland & Scottish Railway introduced the first of a pair of {{convert|1600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Co-Co diesel\u2013electric locomotives (later [[British Rail Class D16/1]]) for regular use in the United Kingdom, although British manufacturers such as Armstrong Whitworth had been exporting diesel locomotives since 1930.

Generally, diesel traction in Italy was of less importance than in other countries, as it was amongst the most advanced countries in the electrification of the main lines and, as a result of Italian geography, even on many domestic connections freight transport over sea is cheaper than rail transport.\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Asia===\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, starting in the 1920s, some petrol-electric railcars were produced.

The engine must be allowed to continue to run when the locomotive is stopped.\n\n===Diesel\u2013mechanical===\n[[File:DieselMechanicalLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|Schematic illustration of a diesel mechanical locomotive]]\n\nA diesel\u2013mechanical locomotive uses a [[Transmission (mechanics)|mechanical transmission]] in a fashion similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low speed [[shunting (rail)|shunting]] (switching) locomotives, lightweight [[multiple unit]]s and self-propelled [[railcar]]s.\n\n[[File:D2069 at Doncaster Works.JPG|thumb|left|A [[British Rail Class 03]] diesel\u2013mechanical [[shunter]] with a [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] under the cab.]]\nThe mechanical transmissions used for railroad propulsion are generally more complex and much more robust than standard-road versions.  There is usually a [[fluid coupling]] interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic (planetary)]] type to permit shifting while under load.  Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by [[Hudswell Clarke]].\n\nDiesel\u2013mechanical propulsion is limited by the difficulty of building a reasonably sized transmission capable of coping with the power and [[torque]] required to move a heavy train.  A number of attempts to use diesel\u2013mechanical propulsion in high power applications have been made (e.g., the {{convert|1500|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail 10100]] locomotive), although none have proved successful in the end.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diesel\u2013electric{{Anchor|Diesel-electric}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{see also|Diesel\u2013electric transmission}}\n{{For|locomotives powered by both external electricity and diesel fuel|#Electro-diesel}}\n{{for|locomotives powered by a combination of diesel or fuel cells and batteries or ultracapacitors|hybrid train}}\n[[File:DieselElectricLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of diesel\u2013electric locomotive]]\nIn a '''diesel\u2013electric''' locomotive, the diesel engine drives either an electrical [[Electric generator|DC generator]] (generally, less than {{convert|3000|hp}} net for traction), or an electrical [[alternator|AC alternator-rectifier]] (generally {{convert|3000|hp}} net or more for traction), the output of which provides power to the [[traction motor]]s that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.\n\nThe important components of diesel\u2013electric propulsion are the diesel engine (also known as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), the main generator/alternator-rectifier, traction motors (usually with four or six axles), and a control system consisting of the engine [[governor (device)|governor]] and electrical or electronic components, including [[switchgear]], [[rectifiers]] and other components, which control or modify the electrical supply to the traction motors. In the most elementary case, the generator may be directly connected to the motors with only very simple switchgear.\n\n[[File:Metra Locomotives F40PH-2 & MP36PH-3S.jpg|thumb|left|The [[EMD F40PH]] (left) and [[MPI MPXpress]]-series MP36PH-3S (right) [[locomotive]]s [[Railway coupling|coupled]] together by [[Metra]] use [[diesel\u2013electric transmission]].]]\n[[File:2\u0422\u042d10\u041c-0870,_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f,_\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c,_\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f_\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_(Trainpix_184374).jpg|thumb|Soviet [[TE10|2TE10M]] locomotive]]\nOriginally, the traction motors and generator were [[direct current|DC]] machines. Following the development of high-capacity [[silicon rectifiers]] in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an [[alternator]] using a [[diode bridge]] to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in the generator.  Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed of the possibility of a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a [[flashover (electrical)|flashover]], which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.\n\nCurrent North American practice is for four axles for high-speed passenger or \"time\" freight, or for six axles for lower-speed or \"manifest\" freight. The most modern units on \"time\" freight service tend to have six axles underneath the frame. Unlike those in \"manifest\" service, \"time\" freight units will have only four of the axles connected to traction motors, with the other two as idler axles for weight distribution.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the development of high-power [[Variable-frequency drive|variable-voltage/variable-frequency]] (VVVF) drives, or \"traction inverters,\" allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor commutator and brushes.  The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better able to cope with overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.\n\n[[File:CSX locomotive cab.jpg|thumb|right|Engineer's controls in a diesel\u2013electric locomotive cab. The lever near bottom-centre is the throttle and the lever visible at bottom left is the automatic brake valve control.]]\n\n====Diesel\u2013electric control====\n[[File:S3DieselElectricLocomotiveSRM.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montreal Locomotive Works|MLW]] model S-3 produced in 1957 for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] adhering to designs by [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]].]]\nA diesel\u2013electric locomotive's power output is independent of road speed, as long as the unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop [[tractive effort]] (also referred to as drawbar pull or [[tractive force]], which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel\u2013electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.\n\n====Throttle operation====\n[[File:116U-rabmash.jpg|thumb|Cab of the Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 11 \u2014 throttle]]\nThe prime mover's [[Power (physics)|power]] output is primarily determined by its rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a [[governor (device)|governor]] or similar mechanism. The governor is designed to react to both the throttle setting, as determined by the engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running (see [[Control theory]]). \n\nLocomotive power output, and thus speed, is typically controlled by the engine driver using a stepped or \"notched\" [[throttle]] that produces [[binary data|binary]]-like electrical signals corresponding to throttle position. This basic design lends itself well to [[multiple unit]] (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a [[consist]] respond in the same way to throttle position. Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of [[Multiple-unit train control#Locomotive applications|trainlines]] (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit.  For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions if there are up to 14 stages of throttling.\n\nNorth American locomotives, such as those built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] or [[General Electric]], have nine throttle positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many [[UK]]-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews depending upon the throttle setting, such as \"run 3\" or \"notch 3\".\n\nIn older locomotives, the throttle mechanism was [[ratchet (device)|ratcheted]] so that it was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull the throttle from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion (\"throttle stripping\", an operating rules violation on many railroads). Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in [[train]] loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.\n\nWhen the throttle is in the idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors will not be connected to the main generator and the generator's field windings will not be excited (energized) \u2014 the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in \"neutral\". Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into neutral while the engine is running.\n\nTo set the locomotive in motion, the [[reverser handle|reverser control handle]] is placed into the correct position (forward or reverse), the [[air brake (rail)|brake]] is released and the throttle is moved to the run 1 position (the first power notch). An experienced engine driver can accomplish these steps in a coordinated fashion that will result in a nearly imperceptible start. The positioning of the reverser and movement of the throttle together is conceptually like shifting an automobile's automatic transmission into gear while the engine is idling.\n\nPlacing the throttle into the first power position will cause the traction motors to be connected to the main generator and the latter's field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running \"light\" (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance the throttle as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.\n\nAs the throttle is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate to the prime mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on the requirements of the train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved the throttle to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.\n\nThe propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. \nCurrent technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30% of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to {{convert|120000|lbf|kN}} of [[tractive force]] for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. \nIn fact, a [[consist]] of such units can produce more than enough [[drawbar pull]] at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad [[slang]] as \"jerking a lung\"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, \"jerking a lung\" could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of [[fail-safe]] [[air brake (rail)|automatic train brakes]] installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.\n\n====Propulsion system operation====\n[[File:3000hp curve ver2.jpg|thumb|350px|Typical main generator constant power curve at \"notch 8\"]]\n[[File:116U-left-corridore-diesel.jpg|thumb|Left corridor of power compartment of Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 3 \u2014 alternator, 4 \u2014 rectifier, 6 \u2014 diesel]]\nA locomotive's control system is designed so that the main generator [[electrical power]] output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, as well as the way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (''see power curve graph for notch 8'').\n\nIn older designs, the prime mover's governor and a companion device, the load regulator, play a central role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual engine speed ([[feedback]]). The governor has two external control outputs: [[fuel injector]] setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation.  The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM.  Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.\n\nThe load regulator is essentially a large [[potentiometer]] that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.  The load regulator's job is relatively complex, because although the prime mover's power output is proportional to RPM and fuel rate, the main generator's output is not (which characteristic was not correctly handled by the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard]] elevator- and hoist-type drive system that was initially tried in early locomotives). Instead, a quite complex electro-hydraulic [[Woodward, Inc.|Woodward]] governor was employed. Today, this important function would be performed by the Engine control unit, itself being a part of the Locomotive control unit.\n[[File:Russian Diesel Locomotive TEP80.JPG|right|thumb|Russian diesel locomotive [[TEP80]]]]\n[[File:EMD 567.jpg|thumb|An [[EMD 567|EMD 12-567B]] supercharged 12-cylinder diesel engine (square \"hand holes\"), stored pending rebuild, and missing some components, most notably the two [[Roots-type supercharger]]s, with a 16-567C or D 16-cylinder engine (round \"hand holes\").]]\nAs the load on the engine changes, its rotational speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through a change in the engine speed feedback signal.  The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and [[torque]] (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.\n\nIn newer designs controlled by a \u201ctraction computer,\u201d each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or \u201ckW reference\u201d, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or \u201ckW feedback\u201d, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays a central role in this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a \u201cback-up\u201d in case of engine overload.  Modern locomotives fitted with [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however, a \u201cvirtual\u201d load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.\n\nTraction motor performance is controlled either by varying the DC voltage output of the main generator, for DC motors, or by varying the frequency and voltage output of the [[Variable-frequency drive|VVVF]] for AC motors.  With DC motors, various connection combinations are utilized to adapt the drive to varying operating conditions.\n\nAt standstill, main generator output is initially low voltage/high current, often in excess of 1000 [[ampere]]s per motor at full power.  When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, as well as the capacity of the main generator itself.  Torque in a [[Traction motor|series-wound motor]] is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum [[tractive effort]], enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile [[automatic transmission]] at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.\n\nAs the locomotive accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures will start to generate a [[counter-electromotive force]] (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose the output of the main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as \"transition,\" a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.\n\nTransition methods include:\n* Series / Parallel or \"motor transition\".\n** Initially, pairs of motors are connected in series across the main generator. At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the main generator.\n* \"Field shunting\", \"field diverting\", or \"weak fielding\".\n** Resistance is connected in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.\n\nBoth methods may also be combined, to increase the operating speed range.\n* Generator / rectifier transition\n** Reconnecting the two separate internal main generator [[alternator|stator windings]] of two rectifiers from parallel to series to increase the output voltage.\n\nIn older locomotives, it was necessary for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the [[ammeter|load meter]] (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better-operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.\n\nModern locomotives incorporate traction ''inverters'', AC to DC, capable of delivering 1,200 volts (earlier traction ''generators'', DC to DC, were capable of delivering only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in silicon diode technology. With the capability of delivering 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the need for \"transition\" was eliminated.\n\n====Dynamic braking====\n{{Main|Dynamic brake}}\nA common option on diesel\u2013electric locomotives is [[Dynamic braking|dynamic (rheostatic) braking]].\n\nDynamic braking takes advantage of the fact that the [[traction motor]] armatures are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a [[electrical generator|generator]] by separately exciting the field winding.  When dynamic braking is utilized, the traction control circuits are configured as follows:\n* The field winding of each traction motor is connected across the main generator.\n* The armature of each traction motor is connected across a forced-air-cooled [[resistor|resistance grid]] (the dynamic braking grid) in the roof of the locomotive's hood.\n* The prime mover RPM is increased and the main generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.\n\nThe aggregate effect of the above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the dynamic braking grid.  A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling.  Consequently, the fan is powered by the output of the traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.\n\nUltimately, the source of the energy dissipated in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures.  Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake.  As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16&nbsp;km/h (10&nbsp;mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and [[axle]]s.\n\nDynamic braking is particularly beneficial when operating in mountainous regions; where there is always the danger of a runaway due to overheated friction brakes during descent.  In such cases, dynamic brakes are usually applied in conjunction with the [[air brake (rail)|air brakes]], the combined effect being referred to as [[blended brake|blended braking]].  The use of blended braking can also assist in keeping the slack in a long train stretched as it crests a grade, helping to prevent a \"run-in\", an abrupt bunching of train slack that can cause a derailment.  Blended braking is also commonly used with [[commuter train]]s to reduce wear and tear on the mechanical brakes that is a natural result of the numerous stops such trains typically make during a run.\n\n====Electro-diesel====\n[[File:GE Genesis P32AC-DM 202 MNCRR Ossining.jpg|thumb|[[Metro-North]]'s [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|GE Genesis P32AC-DM]] electro-diesel locomotive can also operate off of [[third-rail]] electrification.]]\n{{Main|Electro-diesel locomotive}}\nThese special locomotives can operate as an [[electric locomotive]] or as a diesel locomotive.  The [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations]] operate dual-mode diesel\u2013electric/third-rail ([[Overhead line|catenary]] on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and [[New York City]] because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in [[Manhattan]] tunnels.  For the same reason, [[Amtrak]] operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area.  [[British Rail]] operated dual diesel\u2013electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power.  This allowed railway yards to remain un-electrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.\n\n===Diesel\u2013hydraulic===\n<!-- The material on torque converters is confusing and somewhat inaccurate.

A torque converter consists of three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the [[stator]]) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission in an automobile. Another method is to provide several torque converters each with a range of variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.\n\n=====Locomotives=====\n[[File:Western Warship and Hymek.jpg|thumb|right|British Rail diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotives: [[British Rail Class 52|Class 52 \"Western\"]], [[British Rail Class 42|Class 42 \"Warship\"]] and [[British Rail Class 35|Class 35 \"Hymek\"]]]]\nDiesel-hydraulic locomotives are less efficient than diesel\u2013electrics.

The ''Cristiani Compressed Steam System'' used a diesel engine to power a compressor to drive and recirculate steam produced by a boiler; effectively using steam as the power transmission medium, with the diesel engine being the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]<ref>[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/compsteam/compsteam.htm The Paragon-Cristiani Compressed Steam System] ''dslef.dsl.pipex.com''</ref>\n\n===Diesel\u2013pneumatic===\nThe diesel-pneumatic locomotive was of interest in the 1930s because it offered the possibility of converting existing steam locomotives to diesel operation.  The frame and cylinders of the steam locomotive would be retained and the boiler would be replaced by a diesel engine driving an [[air compressor]].  The problem was low [[thermal efficiency]] because of the large amount of energy wasted as heat in the air compressor.  Attempts were made to compensate for this by using the diesel exhaust to re-heat the compressed air but these had limited success.  A German proposal of 1929 did result in a prototype<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/diesair/diesair.htm |title=A German Diesel-Pneumatic Locomotive |publisher=Douglas-self.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> but a similar British proposal of 1932, to use an [[LNER Class R1]] locomotive, never got beyond the design stage.\n\n==Multiple-unit operation==\n[[File:GM-EMD 2000.jpg|thumb|Diesel\u2013electric locomotive built by EMD for service in the UK and continental Europe.]]\nMost diesel locomotives are capable of [[multiple-unit train control]] (MU) as a means of increasing [[horsepower]] and [[tractive effort]] when hauling heavy trains. All [[North America]]n locomotives, including export models, use a standardized [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin [[jumper cable]] between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a [[consist]] are referred to as [[trainline (railroad)|trainlines]]. \nThe result is that all locomotives in a [[consist]] behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.\n\nThe ability to couple diesel\u2013electric locomotives in an MU fashion was first introduced in the [[EMD FT]] four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]] instead of conventional [[Railway coupling|knuckle couplers]] and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive.  Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit.  Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).\n\nIn mountainous regions, it is common to interpose [[helper locomotive]]s in the middle of the train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of [[tensile stress|stress]] applied to the [[Railway coupling#Drawgear|draft gear]] of the car coupled to the head-end power.  The helper units in such [[distributed power]] configurations are controlled from the lead unit's cab through coded radio signals.  Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.\n\n===Cab arrangements===\nCab arrangements vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. has traditionally been for a cab at one end of the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or [[B unit]]s) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.\n\n===Cow-calf===\n{{Main|Cow-calf}}\nIn North American railroading, a [[cow-calf]] set is a pair of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) equipped with a driving cab, the other (the calf) without a cab, and controlled from the cow through cables.  Cow-calf sets are used in heavy switching and [[hump yard]] service. Some are radio controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab. This arrangement is also known as [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave]]. Where two connected units were present, [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] called these TR-2s (approximately {{convert|2,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}); where three units, TR-3s (approximately {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}).\n\nCow-calves have largely disappeared as these engine combinations exceeded their economic lifetimes many years ago.\n\nPresent North American practice is to pair two {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]] or [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] road switchers, often nearly worn-out and very soon ready for rebuilding or scrapping, and to utilize these for so-called \"transfer\" uses, for which the TR-2, TR-3 and TR-4 engines were originally intended, hence the designation TR, for \"transfer\".\n\nOccasionally, the second unit may have its prime-mover and traction alternator removed and replaced by concrete or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from the master unit. As a 16-cylinder prime-mover generally weighs in the {{convert|36,000|lb|adj=on}} range, and a {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} traction alternator generally weighs in the {{convert|18,000|lb|adj=on}} range, this would mean that {{convert|54,000|lb|abbr=on}} would be needed for ballast.\n\nA pair of fully capable \"Dash 2\" units would be rated {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}}. A \"Dash 2\" pair where only one had a prime-mover/alternator would be rated {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}}, with all power provided by master, but the combination benefits from the tractive effort provided by the slave as engines in transfer service are seldom called upon to provide {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} much less {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}} on a continuous basis.\n\n==Fittings and appliances==\n\n===Flameproofing===\nA standard diesel locomotive presents a very low fire risk but \u201cflame proofing\u201d can reduce the risk even further.  This involves fitting a water-filled box to the exhaust pipe to quench any red-hot carbon particles that may be emitted.  Other precautions may include a fully insulated electrical system (neither side earthed to the frame) and all electric wiring enclosed in conduit.\n\nThe flameproof diesel locomotive has replaced the [[fireless steam locomotive]] in areas of high fire risk such as [[oil refineries]] and [[ammunition dump]]s.  Preserved examples of flameproof diesel locomotives include:\n* ''Francis Baily of Thatcham'' (ex-[[RAF Welford]]) at [[Southall Railway Centre]]\n* ''Naworth'' (ex-[[National Coal Board]]) at the [[South Tynedale Railway]]<ref>[http://www.strps.org.uk/str/stocklist/locos/04-Naworth.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106030908/http://www.strps.org.uk/str/stocklist/locos/04-Naworth.htm |date=January 6, 2009 }}</ref>\nLatest development of the \"Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System\u201d does not need the water supply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200210/000020021002A0274001.php/ |title=Development of the Flameproof Diesel Vehicle Applied New Exhaust Gas Dry Type Treatment System |publisher=Sciencelinks.jp |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2011-08-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217004508/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200210/000020021002A0274001.php/ |archivedate=2012-02-17 }}</ref>\n\n===Lights===\n[[File:Canadian National diesels southbound on the Norfolk Southern near Polaris Mall in Columbus, Ohio (2092116881).jpg|thumb|right|A [[Canadian National Railway]] train showing the placement of the headlight and ditch lights on the locomotive.]]\nThe lights fitted to diesel locomotives vary from country to country. North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) and a pair of ditch lights. The latter are fitted low down at the front and are designed to make the locomotive easily visible as it approaches a [[grade crossing]]. Older locomotives may be fitted with a Gyralite or [[Mars Light]] instead of the ditch lights.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{See also|Diesel exhaust}}\nAlthough diesel locomotives generally emit less sulphur dioxide, a major [[Pollution|pollutant]] to the environment, and greenhouse gases than steam locomotives, they are not completely clean in that respect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |title=Engineering gets $1 million grant to make locomotives leaner, greener |publisher=Northern Illinois University |last=King |first=Joe |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910064330/http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref> Furthermore, like other diesel powered vehicles, they emit [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]] and [[fine particles]], which are a risk to public health. In fact, in this last respect diesel locomotives may perform worse than steam locomotives.\n\nFor years, it was thought by American government scientists who measure [[air pollution]] that diesel locomotive engines were relatively clean and emitted far less health-threatening emissions than those of diesel trucks or other vehicles; however, the scientists discovered that because they used faulty estimates of the amount of fuel consumed by diesel locomotives, they grossly understated the amount of pollution generated annually. After revising their calculations, they concluded that the annual emissions of nitrogen oxide, a major ingredient in [[smog]] and [[acid rain]], and soot would be by 2030 nearly twice what they originally assumed.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/13/AR2006081300530.html | title = Attention to Locomotives' Emissions Renewed | work = Washington Post | last = Eilperin | first = Juliet | date = 2006-08-14 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-02-14/news/ct-met-metra-air-testing-20110213_1_scott-fruin-outbound-trains-oldest-trains | title = Metra finds 'alarming' pollution on some trains | work = Chicago Tribune | last = Hawthorne | first = Michael | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}</ref> In Europe, where most major railways have been electrified, there is less concern.\n\nThis would mean that diesel locomotives would be releasing more than 800,000 tons of nitrogen oxide and 25,000 tons of soot every year within a quarter of a century, in contrast to the EPA's previous projections of 480,000 tons of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and 12,000 tons of soot. Since this was discovered, to reduce the effects of the diesel locomotive on [[human]]s (who are breathing the noxious emissions) and on [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s, it is considered practical to install traps in the diesel engines to reduce pollution levels<ref>{{cite news | url = http://topnews.us/content/238438-study-installed-traps-diesel-engines-reduce-pollution-levels | title = Study: Installed Traps In Diesel Engines Reduce Pollution Levels | work = Top News | last = Wilkins | first = Davell | date = 2011-04-13 | accessdate = 2011-08-06 }}</ref> and other forms (e.g., use of [[biodiesel]]).\n\nDiesel locomotive pollution has been of particular concern in the city of [[Chicago]].

''See''  [[List of low emissions locomotives]].\n\nOther technologies that are being deployed to reduce locomotive emissions and fuel consumption include \"Genset\" switching locomotives and hybrid [[Green Goat]] designs.

Both designs reduce pollution below EPA Tier II standards and cut or eliminate emissions during idle.\n\n==Advantages over steam==\nAs diesel locomotives advanced, the cost of manufacturing and operating them dropped, and they became cheaper to own and operate than steam locomotives. In North America, [[steam locomotive]]s were custom-made for specific railway routes, so economies of scale were difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=10}} Though more complex to produce with exacting manufacturing tolerances ({{convert|1/10000|in|adj=on|disp=or}} for diesel, compared with {{convert|1/100|in|adj=on}} for steam), diesel locomotive parts were easier to mass-produce. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] offered almost five hundred steam models in its heyday, while [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] offered fewer than ten diesel varieties.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=19}} In the United Kingdom, [[British Railways]] built steam locomotives to standard designs from 1951 onwards. These included standard, interchangeable parts, making them cheaper to produce than the diesel locomotives then available. The capital cost per [[Tractive force|drawbar horse power]] was \u00a313 6s (steam), \u00a365 (diesel), \u00a369 7s (turbine) and \u00a317 13s (electric).<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Railway Magazine |date=January 1951 |pages=60\u201361 |title=Standardisation and Comparative Costs of Motive Power on B.R.}}</ref>\n\nDiesel locomotives offer significant operating advantages over steam locomotives.<ref>[http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html], Phil Jern \"How to Boot a Steam Locomotive\" (1990) San Diego Railroad Museum.</ref> They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives continue to have two-person crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked [[multiple working|in multiple]] with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives in a single train \u2014 something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered for use as a single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train. With steam traction, a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to [[double heading]] with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.\n\nDiesel engines can be started and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel locomotive has the potential to incur no fuel costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. A diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. Automatic start/stop systems are available which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When the unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine to warm the coolant and other systems.<ref>[http://www.ztr.com/smartstart.php SmartStart\u00ae IIe - Automatic Engine Start/Stop System]. Ztr.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.</ref>\n\nSteam locomotives require intensive maintenance, lubrication, and cleaning before, during, and after use. Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold can take many hours. They can be kept in readiness between uses with a low fire, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply is not frozen.\n\nThe maintenance and operational costs of steam locomotives were much higher than diesels. Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant that there was no feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=12-17}} With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator's fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Modern diesel locomotive engines are designed to allow the power assemblies (systems of working parts and their block interfaces) to be replaced while keeping the main block in the locomotive, which greatly reduces the time that a locomotive is out of revenue-generating service when it requires maintenance.<ref name=\"Kettering\" />\n\nSteam engines required large quantities of coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs.<ref name=\"Stover 213\">Stover, 213</ref> Further, the [[thermal efficiency]] of steam was considerably less than that of diesel engines. Diesel's theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a compression ignition engine of 36% (compared with 6\u201310% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=14}}\n\nHowever, one study published in 1959 suggested that many of the comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly. mostly because diesels were newer.

In the United States, diesel-electric propulsion was brought to high-speed mainline passenger service in late 1934, largely through the research and development efforts of [[General Motors]] dating back to the late 1920s and advances in lightweight car body design by the [[Budd Company]].\n\nThe economic recovery from [[World War II]] caused the widespread adoption of diesel locomotives in many countries. They offered greater flexibility and performance than [[steam locomotive]]s, as well as substantially lower operating and maintenance costs.

The response to this law was to electrify high-traffic rail lines. However, electrification was uneconomical to apply to lower-traffic areas.\n\nThe first regular use of diesel\u2013electric locomotives was in [[Switcher|switching]] (shunter) applications, which were more forgiving than mainline applications of the limitations of contemporary diesel technology and where the idling economy of diesel relative to steam would be most beneficial.  GE entered a collaboration with the [[American Locomotive Company]] (ALCO) and [[Ingersoll-Rand]] (the \"AGEIR\" consortium) in 1924 to produce a prototype {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"boxcab\" locomotive delivered in July 1925. This locomotive demonstrated that the diesel\u2013electric power unit could provide many of the benefits of an [[electric locomotive]] without the railroad having to bear the sizeable expense of electrification.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=25-27}} The unit successfully demonstrated, in switching and local freight and passenger service, on ten railroads and three industrial lines.<ref>Evolution of the American Diesel Locomotive, J Parker Lamb 2007, Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-253-34863-0}}, p.29</ref>  Westinghouse Electric and Baldwin collaborated to build switching locomotives starting in 1929.  However, the [[Great Depression]] curtailed demand for Westinghouse's electrical equipment, and they stopped building locomotives internally, opting to supply electrical parts instead.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=28-30}}\n\nIn June 1925, [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] outshopped a prototype diesel\u2013electric locomotive for \"special uses\" (such as for runs where water for steam locomotives was scarce) using electrical equipment from [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Company]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Railroads To Try Diesel Locomotive |newspaper=Special to the New York Times |date=February 18, 1925 |page=1}}</ref> Its twin-engine design was not successful, and the unit was scrapped after a short testing and demonstration period.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=283}} Industry sources were beginning to suggest \u201cthe outstanding advantages of this new form of motive power\u201d.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=27}}  In 1929, the [[Canadian National Railways]] became the first North American railway to use diesels in mainline service with two units, 9000 and 9001, from Westinghouse.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=409}}  However, these early diesels proved expensive and unreliable, with their high cost of acquisition relative to steam unable to be realized in operating cost savings as they were frequently out of service.  It would be another five years before diesel-electric propulsion would be successfully used in mainline service, and nearly ten years before it would show real potential to fully replace steam.\n\nBefore diesel power could make inroads into mainline service, the limitations of diesel engines circa 1930&nbsp;\u2014 low power-to-weight ratios and narrow output range&nbsp;\u2014 had to be overcome.  A major effort to overcome those limitations was launched by [[General Motors]] after they moved into the diesel field with their acquisition of the [[Winton Engine Company]], a major manufacturer of diesel engines for marine and stationary applications, in 1930. Supported by the General Motors Research Division, GM's [[Cleveland Diesel Engine Division|Winton Engine Corporation]] sought to develop diesel engines suitable for high-speed mobile use.  The first milestone in that effort was delivery in early 1934 of the Winton 201A, a [[two-stroke]], [[Roots-type supercharger|Roots-supercharged]], [[Uniflow scavenging|uniflow-scavenged]], [[Unit injector|unit-injected]] [[diesel engine]] that could deliver the required performance for a fast, lightweight passenger train.  The second milestone, and the one that got American railroads moving towards diesel, was the 1938 delivery of GM's  [[EMD 567|Model 567]] engine that was designed specifically for locomotive use, bringing a fivefold increase in life of some mechanical parts and showing its potential for meeting the rigors of freight service.<ref name=Kettering>{{cite conference |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QuUiAQAAMAAJ|title=History and Development of the 567 Series General Motors Locomotive Engine |author=Kettering, E.W. |date={{date|1951-11-29|dmy}} |publisher=Electro-Motive Division, General Motors Corporation |conference=ASME 1951 Annual Meeting |location=Atlantic City, New Jersey}}</ref>\n\nDiesel\u2013electric railroad locomotion entered  mainline service when the [[Burlington Railroad]] and [[Union Pacific]] used custom-built diesel \"[[streamliner]]s\" to haul passengers, starting in late 1934.<ref name=\"Stover 212\"/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=79oDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA165&dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&hl=en&ei=RasMTuyGFYifsQLC3sGzCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q&f=true \"Diesel Streamliners Now Link Coast-to-Coast\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1937</ref> Burlington's ''[[Burlington Zephyr|Zephyr]]'' trainsets evolved from articulated three-car sets with 600&nbsp;hp power cars in 1934 and early 1935, to the ''Denver Zephyr'' semi-articulated ten car trainsets pulled by cab-booster power sets introduced in late 1936.  Union Pacific started diesel streamliner service between Chicago and Portland Oregon in June 1935, and in the following year would add Los Angeles and Oakland California, and Denver Colorado to the destinations of diesel streamliners out of Chicago.  The Burlington and Union Pacific streamliners were built by the [[Budd Company]] and the [[Pullman-Standard|Pullman-Standard Company]], respectively, using the new Winton engines and power train systems designed by GM's [[Electro-Motive Corporation]].  EMC's experimental [[EMC 1800 hp B-B|1800 hp B-B]] locomotives of 1935 demonstrated the multiple-unit control systems used for the cab/booster sets and the twin-engine format used with the later ''Zephyr'' power units.  Both of those features would be used in EMC's later production model locomotives.  The lightweight diesel streamliners of the mid-1930s demonstrated the advantages of diesel for passenger service with breakthrough schedule times, but diesel locomotive power would not fully come of age until regular series production of mainline diesel locomotives commenced and it was shown suitable for full-size passenger and freight service.\n\n====First American series production locomotives====\nFollowing their 1925 prototype, the AGEIR consortium produced 25 more units of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \"60 ton\" [[ALCO boxcab|AGEIR boxcab]] [[switcher|switching locomotives]] between 1925 and 1928 for several New York City railroads, making them the first series-produced diesel locomotives.{{sfn|Pinkepank|1973|p=209\u2013211}}  The consortium also produced seven twin-engine \"100 ton\" boxcabs and one hybrid trolley/battery unit with a diesel-driven charging circuit.  ALCO acquired the [[McIntosh & Seymour]] Engine Company in 1929 and entered series production of {{convert|300|hp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} single-cab switcher units in 1931.  ALCO would be the pre-eminent builder of switch engines through the mid-1930s and would adapt the basic switcher design to produce versatile and highly successful, albeit relatively low powered, road locomotives.\n\nGM, seeing the success of the custom streamliners, sought to expand the market for diesel power by producing standardized locomotives under their [[Electro-Motive Corporation]]. In 1936, EMC's new factory started production of switch engines.  In 1937, the factory started producing their new [[EMD E-unit|E series]] streamlined passenger locomotives, which would be upgraded with more reliable purpose-built engines in 1938.  Seeing the performance and reliability of the new [[EMD 567|567 model]] engine in passenger locomotives, EMC was eager to demonstrate diesel's viability in freight service.\n\nFollowing the successful 1939 tour of [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMC's]] [[EMD FT|FT]] demonstrator freight locomotive set, the stage was set for dieselization of American railroads.  In 1941, [[ALCO-GE]] introduced the [[ALCO RS-1|RS-1]] road-switcher that occupied its own market niche while EMD's [[EMD F-unit|F series]] locomotives were sought for mainline freight service.  The US entry into World War II slowed conversion to diesel; the War Production Board put a halt to building new passenger equipment and gave naval uses priority for diesel engine production.  During the [[Big Inch|petroleum crisis of 1942-43]], coal-fired steam had the advantage of not using fuel that was in critically short supply.   EMD was later allowed to increase the production of its FT locomotives and ALCO-GE was allowed to produce a limited number of [[DL-109]] road locomotives, but most in the locomotive business were restricted to making switch engines and steam locomotives.\n\nIn the early postwar era, EMD dominated the market for mainline locomotives with their E and F series locomotives.  ALCO-GE in the late 1940s produced switchers and road-switchers that were successful in the short-haul market.  However, EMD launched their [[EMD GP7|GP series]] road-switcher locomotives in 1949, which displaced all other locomotives in the freight market including their own F series locomotives.  GE subsequently dissolved its partnership with ALCO and would emerge as EMD's main competitor in the early 1960s, eventually taking the top position in the locomotive market from EMD.\n\nEarly diesel\u2013electric locomotives in the United States used direct current (DC) traction motors, but alternating current (AC) motors came into widespread use in the 1990s, starting with the [[EMD SD70 series|Electro-Motive SD70MAC]] in 1993 and followed by the [[GE AC4400CW|General Electric's AC4400CW]] in 1994 and [[GE AC6000CW|AC6000CW]] in 1995.<ref>Solomon, Brian, ''Locomotive'', 2001, pp 120, 130</ref>\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Europe===\n====First functional diesel vehicles====\n[[File:Limousin2010RVT01.jpg|thumb|[[Switzerland|Swiss]] & [[Germany|German]] co-production: world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcar 1914]]\nIn 1914, world's first functional diesel\u2013electric railcars were produced for the ''K\u00f6niglich-S\u00e4chsische Staatseisenbahnen'' ([[Royal Saxon State Railways]]) by [[Waggonfabrik Rastatt]] with electric equipment from [[Brown, Boveri & Cie]] and diesel engines from [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Sulzer (manufacturer)|Sulzer AG]].

After several test rides, it hauled trains for almost three decades from 1925 to 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://izmerov.narod.ru/first/thefirst3.html|title=The first russian diesel locos|website=izmerov.narod.ru}}</ref> Though proved to be world's first functional diesel locomotive, it did not become a series,  but it became a model for several classes of Soviet diesel locomotives.\n* The engine \u0429\u044d\u043b1 ([[Russian locomotive class shch-el-1|Shch-el 1]], original number ''\u042e\u044d2/Yu-e 2)'', started on November 9.

It had ten driving axles in three [[bogie]]s (1' Co' Do' Co' 1'). From 1925 to 1927, it hauled trains between [[Moscow]] and [[Kursk]] and in [[Caucasus]] region. Due to technical problems, afterwards, it was out of service. Since 1934, it was used as a stationary electric generator.\n\nIn 1935, [[Krauss-Maffei]], [[MAN AG|MAN]] and [[Voith]] built the first diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotive, called [[DRG Class V 140|V 140]], in Germany. The German railways (DRG) being very pleased with the performance of that engine, diesel\u2013hydraulics became the mainstream in diesel locomotives in Germany.  Serial production of diesel locomotives in Germany began after World War II.\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Switchers====\n[[File:Rangeerlocomotor NS 228.jpg|thumb|Shunter of [[Nederlandse Spoorwegen]] from 1934, in modern livery]]\nIn many railway stations and industrial compounds, steam shunters had to be kept hot during lots of breaks between scattered short tasks. Therefore, diesel traction became economical for [[Shunting (rail)|shunting]] before it became economical for hauling trains. The construction of diesel shunters began in 1920 in France, in 1925 in Denmark, in 1926 in the Netherlands, and in 1927 in Germany. After a few years of testing, hundreds of units were produced within a decade.\n\n====Diesel railcars for regional traffic====\n[[File:Autorail Renault VH2211 Mulhouse FRA 001.jpg|thumb|Renault VH, [[History of rail transport in France|France]], 1933/34]]\nDiesel-powered or \"oil-engined\" railcars, generally diesel\u2013mechanical, were developed by various European manufacturers in the 1930s, e.g. by [[William Beardmore and Company]] for the [[Canadian National Railways]] (the [[Beardmore Tornado]] engine was subsequently used in the [[R101]] airship). Some of those series for regional traffic were begun with gasoline motors and then continued with diesel motors, such as Hungarian BC<sup>mot</sup> (The class code doesn't tell anything but \"railmotor with 2nd and 3rd class seats\".), 128 cars built 1926 \u2013 1937, or German [[Wismar railbus]]es (57 cars 1932 \u2013 1941). In France, the first diesel railcar was [[Renault VH]], 115 units produced 1933/34.\nIn Italy, after 6 Gasoline cars since 1931, Fiat and [[Societ\u00e0 Italiana Ernesto Breda|Breda]] built a lot of diesel railmotors, more than 110 from 1933 to 1938 and 390 from 1940 to 1953, [[FS Class ALn 772|Class 772]] known as ''Littorina'', and Class ALn 900.\n\n====High-speed railcars====\nIn the 1930s, streamlined highspeed diesel railcars were developed in several countries:\n* In Germany, the [[Flying Hamburger]] was built in 1932. After a test ride in December 1932, this two coach diesel railcar (in English terminology a DMU2) started service at [[Deutsche Reichsbahn]] (DRG) in February 1933. It became the prototype of [[DRG Class SVT 137]] with 33 more highspeed DMUs, built for DRG till 1938, 13 DMU 2 (\"Hamburg\" series), 18 DMU 3 (\"Leipzig\" and \"K\u00f6ln\" series), and 2 DMU 4 (\"Berlin\" series).\n* French [[SNCF]] classes XF 1000 and XF 1100 comprised 11 high-speed DMUs, also called TAR, built 1934\u20131939.\n* In Hungary, [[Ganz Works]] built the {{Interlanguage link|Arp\u00e1d railmotor|hu|Aamot|de|M\u00c1V-Baureihe \u00c1rp\u00e1d}}, a kind of a luxurious railbus in a series of 7 items since 1934, and started to build the {{Interlanguage link|Hargita (DMU){{!}}Hargita|hu|Hargita motorvonat}} in 1944.\n\n====Further developments====\n[[File:LMS 10000 at Derby.jpg|thumb|[[British Rail Class D16/1]], since 1948]]In 1945, a batch of 30 Baldwin diesel\u2013electric locomotives, [[Baldwin 0-6-6-0 1000]], was delivered from the United States to the railways of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1947, the London Midland & Scottish Railway introduced the first of a pair of {{convert|1600|hp|kW|abbr=on}} Co-Co diesel\u2013electric locomotives (later [[British Rail Class D16/1]]) for regular use in the United Kingdom, although British manufacturers such as Armstrong Whitworth had been exporting diesel locomotives since 1930.  Fleet deliveries to British Railways, of other designs such as Class 20 and Class 31, began in 1957.\n\nSeries production of diesel locomotives in Italy began in the mid-1950s. Generally, diesel traction in Italy was of less importance than in other countries, as it was amongst the most advanced countries in the electrification of the main lines and, as a result of Italian geography, even on many domestic connections freight transport over sea is cheaper than rail transport.\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Asia===\n\n====Japan====\nIn Japan, starting in the 1920s, some petrol-electric railcars were produced. The first diesel\u2013electric traction and the first air-streamed vehicles on Japanese rails were the two DMU3s of class Kiha 43000 (\u30ad\u30cf43000\u7cfb).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rail.hobidas.com/photo/archives/2005/07/50.html|title=DD50 5\u3000DD50 2\uff5c\u968f\u6642\u30a2\u30c3\u30d7\uff1a\u6d88\u3048\u305f\u8eca\u8f0c\u5199\u771f\u9928\uff5c\u9244\u9053\u30db\u30d3\u30c0\u30b9|website=rail.hobidas.com}}</ref> Japan's first series of diesel locomotives was class DD50 (\u56fd\u9244DD50\u5f62), twin locomotives, developed since 1950 and in service since 1953.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.yahoo.co.jp/h53001126/4568133.html|title=\u30ad\u30cf\uff14\uff13\uff10\uff10\uff10\u306e\u8cc7\u6599 - \u3057\u308b\u306d\u3053\u306e\u5fae\u5999\u306a\u751f\u6d3b\uff0f\u6d6e\u6c17\u5fc3\u3042\u308c\u3070\u6c34\u5fc3!?|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== China ====\nOne of the first domestically-developed Diesel vehicles of China was the DMU [[Dong Feng DMU|Dongfeng]] (\u4e1c\u98ce), produced in 1958 by [[CSR Sifang Co Ltd.|CSR Sifang]]. Series production of China's first Diesel locomotive class, the DFH 1, began in 1964 following the construction of a prototype in 1959.\n\n===Early diesel locomotives and railcars in Australia===\n[[File:McKeen railmotor at Wodonga.jpg|thumb|A Mckeen railcar in Wodonga, Australia, 1911]]\n\nThe [[Trans-Australian Railway]] built 1912 to 1917 by Commonwealth Railways (CR) passes through 2000&nbsp;km of waterless (or salt watered) desert terrain unsuitable for steam locomotives.  The original engineer [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]] envisaged [[Diesel engine|diesel operation]] to overcome such problems.<ref name=burk>Burke, A 1991., ''Rails through the Wilderness''; New South Wales University Press</ref> Some have suggested that the CR worked with the South Australian Railways to trial diesel traction.<ref>Holden, R 2006 No. 259 : the curious story of a forgotten locomotive, Railmac Publications</ref> However, the technology was not developed enough to be reliable.\n\nAs in Europe, the usage of internal combustion engines advanced more readily in self-propelled railcars than in locomotives.\n* Some Australian railway companies bought [[McKeen railcars]].\n* In the 1920s and 1930s, more reliable Gasoline railmotors were built by Australian industries.\n* Australia's first diesel railcars were the NSWGR 100 Class (PH later DP) Silver City Comet cars in 1937.<ref>Rail Motors and XPTs, David Cooke, ARHS, NSW Division, 1984 pp40-59</ref>\n* High-speed vehicles for those days' possibilities on {{Track gauge|3ft6in|lk=on}} were the 10 [[NZR RM class (Vulcan)|Vulcan railcars]] of 1940 for New Zealand.\n\n==Transmission types==\nUnlike steam engines, internal combustion engines require a transmission to power the wheels. The engine must be allowed to continue to run when the locomotive is stopped.\n\n===Diesel\u2013mechanical===\n[[File:DieselMechanicalLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|Schematic illustration of a diesel mechanical locomotive]]\n\nA diesel\u2013mechanical locomotive uses a [[Transmission (mechanics)|mechanical transmission]] in a fashion similar to that employed in most road vehicles. This type of transmission is generally limited to low-powered, low speed [[shunting (rail)|shunting]] (switching) locomotives, lightweight [[multiple unit]]s and self-propelled [[railcar]]s.\n\n[[File:D2069 at Doncaster Works.JPG|thumb|left|A [[British Rail Class 03]] diesel\u2013mechanical [[shunter]] with a [[Jackshaft (locomotive)|jackshaft]] under the cab.]]\nThe mechanical transmissions used for railroad propulsion are generally more complex and much more robust than standard-road versions.  There is usually a [[fluid coupling]] interposed between the engine and gearbox, and the gearbox is often of the [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic (planetary)]] type to permit shifting while under load.  Various systems have been devised to minimise the break in transmission during gear changing; e.g., the S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) gearbox used by [[Hudswell Clarke]].\n\nDiesel\u2013mechanical propulsion is limited by the difficulty of building a reasonably sized transmission capable of coping with the power and [[torque]] required to move a heavy train.  A number of attempts to use diesel\u2013mechanical propulsion in high power applications have been made (e.g., the {{convert|1500|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[British Rail 10100]] locomotive), although none have proved successful in the end.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Diesel\u2013electric{{Anchor|Diesel-electric}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{see also|Diesel\u2013electric transmission}}\n{{For|locomotives powered by both external electricity and diesel fuel|#Electro-diesel}}\n{{for|locomotives powered by a combination of diesel or fuel cells and batteries or ultracapacitors|hybrid train}}\n[[File:DieselElectricLocomotiveSchematic.svg|thumb|right|Schematic diagram of diesel\u2013electric locomotive]]\nIn a '''diesel\u2013electric''' locomotive, the diesel engine drives either an electrical [[Electric generator|DC generator]] (generally, less than {{convert|3000|hp}} net for traction), or an electrical [[alternator|AC alternator-rectifier]] (generally {{convert|3000|hp}} net or more for traction), the output of which provides power to the [[traction motor]]s that drive the locomotive. There is no mechanical connection between the diesel engine and the wheels.\n\nThe important components of diesel\u2013electric propulsion are the diesel engine (also known as the [[Prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]), the main generator/alternator-rectifier, traction motors (usually with four or six axles), and a control system consisting of the engine [[governor (device)|governor]] and electrical or electronic components, including [[switchgear]], [[rectifiers]] and other components, which control or modify the electrical supply to the traction motors. In the most elementary case, the generator may be directly connected to the motors with only very simple switchgear.\n\n[[File:Metra Locomotives F40PH-2 & MP36PH-3S.jpg|thumb|left|The [[EMD F40PH]] (left) and [[MPI MPXpress]]-series MP36PH-3S (right) [[locomotive]]s [[Railway coupling|coupled]] together by [[Metra]] use [[diesel\u2013electric transmission]].]]\n[[File:2\u0422\u042d10\u041c-0870,_\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f,_\u0410\u0440\u0445\u0430\u043d\u0433\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c,_\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f_\u041e\u0431\u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f_(Trainpix_184374).jpg|thumb|Soviet [[TE10|2TE10M]] locomotive]]\nOriginally, the traction motors and generator were [[direct current|DC]] machines. Following the development of high-capacity [[silicon rectifiers]] in the 1960s, the DC generator was replaced by an [[alternator]] using a [[diode bridge]] to convert its output to DC. This advance greatly improved locomotive reliability and decreased generator maintenance costs by elimination of the [[commutator (electric)|commutator]] and [[brush (electric)|brushes]] in the generator.  Elimination of the brushes and commutator, in turn, disposed of the possibility of a particularly destructive type of event referred to as a [[flashover (electrical)|flashover]], which could result in immediate generator failure and, in some cases, start an engine room fire.\n\nCurrent North American practice is for four axles for high-speed passenger or \"time\" freight, or for six axles for lower-speed or \"manifest\" freight. The most modern units on \"time\" freight service tend to have six axles underneath the frame. Unlike those in \"manifest\" service, \"time\" freight units will have only four of the axles connected to traction motors, with the other two as idler axles for weight distribution.\n\nIn the late 1980s, the development of high-power [[Variable-frequency drive|variable-voltage/variable-frequency]] (VVVF) drives, or \"traction inverters,\" allowed the use of polyphase AC traction motors, thus also eliminating the motor commutator and brushes.  The result is a more efficient and reliable drive that requires relatively little maintenance and is better able to cope with overload conditions that often destroyed the older types of motors.\n\n[[File:CSX locomotive cab.jpg|thumb|right|Engineer's controls in a diesel\u2013electric locomotive cab. The lever near bottom-centre is the throttle and the lever visible at bottom left is the automatic brake valve control.]]\n\n====Diesel\u2013electric control====\n[[File:S3DieselElectricLocomotiveSRM.jpg|thumb|left|[[Montreal Locomotive Works|MLW]] model S-3 produced in 1957 for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] adhering to designs by [[American Locomotive Company|ALCO]].]]\nA diesel\u2013electric locomotive's power output is independent of road speed, as long as the unit's generator current and voltage limits are not exceeded. Therefore, the unit's ability to develop [[tractive effort]] (also referred to as drawbar pull or [[tractive force]], which is what actually propels the train) will tend to inversely vary with speed within these limits. (See power curve below). Maintaining acceptable operating parameters was one of the principal design considerations that had to be solved in early diesel\u2013electric locomotive development and, ultimately, led to the complex control systems in place on modern units.\n\n====Throttle operation====\n[[File:116U-rabmash.jpg|thumb|Cab of the Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 11 \u2014 throttle]]\nThe prime mover's [[Power (physics)|power]] output is primarily determined by its rotational speed ([[revolutions per minute|RPM]]) and fuel rate, which are regulated by a [[governor (device)|governor]] or similar mechanism. The governor is designed to react to both the throttle setting, as determined by the engine driver and the speed at which the prime mover is running (see [[Control theory]]). \n\nLocomotive power output, and thus speed, is typically controlled by the engine driver using a stepped or \"notched\" [[throttle]] that produces [[binary data|binary]]-like electrical signals corresponding to throttle position. This basic design lends itself well to [[multiple unit]] (MU) operation by producing discrete conditions that assure that all units in a [[consist]] respond in the same way to throttle position. Binary encoding also helps to minimize the number of [[Multiple-unit train control#Locomotive applications|trainlines]] (electrical connections) that are required to pass signals from unit to unit.  For example, only four trainlines are required to encode all possible throttle positions if there are up to 14 stages of throttling.\n\nNorth American locomotives, such as those built by [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] or [[General Electric]], have nine throttle positions, one idle and eight power (as well as an emergency stop position that shuts down the prime mover). Many [[UK]]-built locomotives have a ten-position throttle. The power positions are often referred to by locomotive crews depending upon the throttle setting, such as \"run 3\" or \"notch 3\".\n\nIn older locomotives, the throttle mechanism was [[ratchet (device)|ratcheted]] so that it was not possible to advance more than one power position at a time. The engine driver could not, for example, pull the throttle from notch 2 to notch 4 without stopping at notch 3. This feature was intended to prevent rough train handling due to abrupt power increases caused by rapid throttle motion (\"throttle stripping\", an operating rules violation on many railroads). Modern locomotives no longer have this restriction, as their control systems are able to smoothly modulate power and avoid sudden changes in [[train]] loading regardless of how the engine driver operates the controls.\n\nWhen the throttle is in the idle position, the prime mover will be receiving minimal fuel, causing it to idle at low RPM. In addition, the traction motors will not be connected to the main generator and the generator's field windings will not be excited (energized) \u2014 the generator will not produce electricity with no excitation. Therefore, the locomotive will be in \"neutral\". Conceptually, this is the same as placing an automobile's transmission into neutral while the engine is running.\n\nTo set the locomotive in motion, the [[reverser handle|reverser control handle]] is placed into the correct position (forward or reverse), the [[air brake (rail)|brake]] is released and the throttle is moved to the run 1 position (the first power notch). An experienced engine driver can accomplish these steps in a coordinated fashion that will result in a nearly imperceptible start. The positioning of the reverser and movement of the throttle together is conceptually like shifting an automobile's automatic transmission into gear while the engine is idling\n\nPlacing the throttle into the first power position will cause the traction motors to be connected to the main generator and the latter's field coils to be excited. With excitation applied, the main generator will deliver electricity to the traction motors, resulting in motion. If the locomotive is running \"light\" (that is, not coupled to the rest of a train) and is not on an ascending grade, it will easily accelerate. On the other hand, if a long train is being started, the locomotive may stall as soon as some of the slack has been taken up, as the drag imposed by the train will exceed the tractive force being developed. An experienced engine driver will be able to recognize an incipient stall and will gradually advance the throttle as required to maintain the pace of acceleration.\n\nAs the throttle is moved to higher power notches, the fuel rate to the prime mover will increase, resulting in a corresponding increase in RPM and horsepower output. At the same time, main generator field excitation will be proportionally increased to absorb the higher power. This will translate into increased electrical output to the traction motors, with a corresponding increase in tractive force. Eventually, depending on the requirements of the train's schedule, the engine driver will have moved the throttle to the position of maximum power and will maintain it there until the train has accelerated to the desired speed.\n\nThe propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. \nCurrent technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30% of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to {{convert|120000|lbf|kN}} of [[tractive force]] for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. \nIn fact, a [[consist]] of such units can produce more than enough [[drawbar pull]] at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad [[slang]] as \"jerking a lung\"). Therefore, it is incumbent upon the engine driver to carefully monitor the amount of power being applied at start-up to avoid damage. In particular, \"jerking a lung\" could be a calamitous matter if it were to occur on an ascending grade, except that the safety inherent in the correct operation of [[fail-safe]] [[air brake (rail)|automatic train brakes]] installed in wagons today, prevents runaway trains by automatically applying the wagon brakes when train line air pressure drops.\n\n====Propulsion system operation====\n[[File:3000hp curve ver2.jpg|thumb|350px|Typical main generator constant power curve at \"notch 8\"]]\n[[File:116U-left-corridore-diesel.jpg|thumb|Left corridor of power compartment of Russian locomotive [[2TE116]]U, 3 \u2014 alternator, 4 \u2014 rectifier, 6 \u2014 diesel]]\nA locomotive's control system is designed so that the main generator [[electrical power]] output is matched to any given engine speed. Given the innate characteristics of traction motors, as well as the way in which the motors are connected to the main generator, the generator will produce high current and low voltage at low locomotive speeds, gradually changing to low current and high voltage as the locomotive accelerates. Therefore, the net power produced by the locomotive will remain constant for any given throttle setting (''see power curve graph for notch 8'').\n\nIn older designs, the prime mover's governor and a companion device, the load regulator, play a central role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual engine speed ([[feedback]]). The governor has two external control outputs: [[fuel injector]] setting, which determines the engine fuel rate, and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation.  The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the [[Cab (locomotive)|cab]] in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM.  Not all of these inputs and outputs are necessarily electrical.\n\nThe load regulator is essentially a large [[potentiometer]] that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.  The load regulator's job is relatively complex, because although the prime mover's power output is proportional to RPM and fuel rate, the main generator's output is not (which characteristic was not correctly handled by the [[Ward Leonard control|Ward Leonard]] elevator- and hoist-type drive system that was initially tried in early locomotives). Instead, a quite complex electro-hydraulic [[Woodward, Inc.|Woodward]] governor was employed. Today, this important function would be performed by the Engine control unit, itself being a part of the Locomotive control unit.\n[[File:Russian Diesel Locomotive TEP80.JPG|right|thumb|Russian diesel locomotive [[TEP80]]]]\n[[File:EMD 567.jpg|thumb|An [[EMD 567|EMD 12-567B]] supercharged 12-cylinder diesel engine (square \"hand holes\"), stored pending rebuild, and missing some components, most notably the two [[Roots-type supercharger]]s, with a 16-567C or D 16-cylinder engine (round \"hand holes\").]]\nAs the load on the engine changes, its rotational speed will also change. This is detected by the governor through a change in the engine speed feedback signal.  The net effect is to adjust both the fuel rate and the load regulator position so that engine RPM and [[torque]] (and thus power output) will remain constant for any given throttle setting, regardless of actual road speed.\n\nIn newer designs controlled by a \u201ctraction computer,\u201d each engine speed step is allotted an appropriate power output, or \u201ckW reference\u201d, in software. The computer compares this value with actual main generator power output, or \u201ckW feedback\u201d, calculated from traction motor current and main generator voltage feedback values. The computer adjusts the feedback value to match the reference value by controlling the excitation of the main generator, as described above. The governor still has control of engine speed, but the load regulator no longer plays a central role in this type of control system. However, the load regulator is retained as a \u201cback-up\u201d in case of engine overload.  Modern locomotives fitted with [[electronic fuel injection]] (EFI) may have no mechanical governor; however, a \u201cvirtual\u201d load regulator and governor are retained with computer modules.\n\nTraction motor performance is controlled either by varying the DC voltage output of the main generator, for DC motors, or by varying the frequency and voltage output of the [[Variable-frequency drive|VVVF]] for AC motors.  With DC motors, various connection combinations are utilized to adapt the drive to varying operating conditions.\n\nAt standstill, main generator output is initially low voltage/high current, often in excess of 1000 [[ampere]]s per motor at full power.  When the locomotive is at or near standstill, current flow will be limited only by the DC resistance of the motor windings and interconnecting circuitry, as well as the capacity of the main generator itself.  Torque in a [[Traction motor|series-wound motor]] is approximately proportional to the square of the current. Hence, the traction motors will produce their highest torque, causing the locomotive to develop maximum [[tractive effort]], enabling it to overcome the inertia of the train. This effect is analogous to what happens in an automobile [[automatic transmission]] at start-up, where it is in first gear and thus producing maximum torque multiplication.\n\nAs the locomotive accelerates, the now-rotating motor armatures will start to generate a [[counter-electromotive force]] (back EMF, meaning the motors are also trying to act as generators), which will oppose the output of the main generator and cause traction motor current to decrease. Main generator voltage will correspondingly increase in an attempt to maintain motor power, but will eventually reach a plateau. At this point, the locomotive will essentially cease to accelerate, unless on a downgrade. Since this plateau will usually be reached at a speed substantially less than the maximum that may be desired, something must be done to change the drive characteristics to allow continued acceleration. This change is referred to as \"transition,\" a process that is analogous to shifting gears in an automobile.\n\nTransition methods include:\n* Series / Parallel or \"motor transition\".\n** Initially, pairs of motors are connected in series across the main generator. At higher speed, motors are reconnected in parallel across the main generator.\n* \"Field shunting\", \"field diverting\", or \"weak fielding\".\n** Resistance is connected in parallel with the motor field. This has the effect of increasing the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] current, producing a corresponding increase in motor torque and speed.\n\nBoth methods may also be combined, to increase the operating speed range.\n* Generator / rectifier transition\n** Reconnecting the two separate internal main generator [[alternator|stator windings]] of two rectifiers from parallel to series to increase the output voltage.\n\nIn older locomotives, it was necessary for the engine driver to manually execute transition by use of a separate control. As an aid to performing transition at the right time, the [[ammeter|load meter]] (an indicator that shows the engine driver how much current is being drawn by the traction motors) was calibrated to indicate at which points forward or backward transition should take place. Automatic transition was subsequently developed to produce better-operating efficiency and to protect the main generator and traction motors from overloading from improper transition.\n\nModern locomotives incorporate traction ''inverters'', AC to DC, capable of delivering 1,200 volts (earlier traction ''generators'', DC to DC, were capable of delivering only 600 volts). This improvement was accomplished largely through improvements in silicon diode technology. With the capability of delivering 1,200 volts to the traction motors, the need for \"transition\" was eliminated.\n\n====Dynamic braking====\n{{Main|Dynamic brake}}\nA common option on diesel\u2013electric locomotives is [[Dynamic braking|dynamic (rheostatic) braking]].\n\nDynamic braking takes advantage of the fact that the [[traction motor]] armatures are always rotating when the locomotive is in motion and that a motor can be made to act as a [[electrical generator|generator]] by separately exciting the field winding.  When dynamic braking is utilized, the traction control circuits are configured as follows:\n* The field winding of each traction motor is connected across the main generator.\n* The armature of each traction motor is connected across a forced-air-cooled [[resistor|resistance grid]] (the dynamic braking grid) in the roof of the locomotive's hood.\n* The prime mover RPM is increased and the main generator field is excited, causing a corresponding excitation of the traction motor fields.\n\nThe aggregate effect of the above is to cause each traction motor to generate electric power and dissipate it as heat in the dynamic braking grid.  A fan connected across the grid provides forced-air cooling.  Consequently, the fan is powered by the output of the traction motors and will tend to run faster and produce more airflow as more energy is applied to the grid.\n\nUltimately, the source of the energy dissipated in the dynamic braking grid is the motion of the locomotive as imparted to the traction motor armatures.  Therefore, the traction motors impose drag and the locomotive acts as a brake.  As speed decreases, the braking effect decays and usually becomes ineffective below approximately 16&nbsp;km/h (10&nbsp;mph), depending on the gear ratio between the traction motors and [[axle]]s.\n\nDynamic braking is particularly beneficial when operating in mountainous regions; where there is always the danger of a runaway due to overheated friction brakes during descent.  In such cases, dynamic brakes are usually applied in conjunction with the [[air brake (rail)|air brakes]], the combined effect being referred to as [[blended brake|blended braking]].  The use of blended braking can also assist in keeping the slack in a long train stretched as it crests a grade, helping to prevent a \"run-in\", an abrupt bunching of train slack that can cause a derailment.  Blended braking is also commonly used with [[commuter train]]s to reduce wear and tear on the mechanical brakes that is a natural result of the numerous stops such trains typically make during a run.\n\n====Electro-diesel====\n[[File:GE Genesis P32AC-DM 202 MNCRR Ossining.jpg|thumb|[[Metro-North]]'s [[GE Genesis#P32AC-DM|GE Genesis P32AC-DM]] electro-diesel locomotive can also operate off of [[third-rail]] electrification.]]\n{{Main|Electro-diesel locomotive}}\nThese special locomotives can operate as an [[electric locomotive]] or as a diesel locomotive.  The [[Long Island Rail Road]], [[Metro-North Railroad]] and [[New Jersey Transit Rail Operations]] operate dual-mode diesel\u2013electric/third-rail ([[Overhead line|catenary]] on NJTransit) locomotives between non-electrified territory and [[New York City]] because of a local law banning diesel-powered locomotives in [[Manhattan]] tunnels.  For the same reason, [[Amtrak]] operates a fleet of dual-mode locomotives in the New York area.  [[British Rail]] operated dual diesel\u2013electric/electric locomotives designed to run primarily as electric locomotives with reduced power available when running on diesel power.  This allowed railway yards to remain un-electrified, as the third rail power system is extremely hazardous in a yard area.\n\n===Diesel\u2013hydraulic===\n<!-- The material on torque converters is confusing and somewhat inaccurate.

A torque converter consists of three main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the [[stator]]) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission in an automobile. Another method is to provide several torque converters each with a range of variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.\n\n=====Locomotives=====\n[[File:Western Warship and Hymek.jpg|thumb|right|British Rail diesel\u2013hydraulic locomotives: [[British Rail Class 52|Class 52 \"Western\"]], [[British Rail Class 42|Class 42 \"Warship\"]] and [[British Rail Class 35|Class 35 \"Hymek\"]]]]\nDiesel-hydraulic locomotives are less efficient than diesel\u2013electrics.

The ''Cristiani Compressed Steam System'' used a diesel engine to power a compressor to drive and recirculate steam produced by a boiler; effectively using steam as the power transmission medium, with the diesel engine being the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]]<ref>[http://www.aqpl43.dsl.pipex.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/compsteam/compsteam.htm The Paragon-Cristiani Compressed Steam System] ''dslef.dsl.pipex.com''</ref>\n\n===Diesel\u2013pneumatic===\nThe diesel-pneumatic locomotive was of interest in the 1930s because it offered the possibility of converting existing steam locomotives to diesel operation.  The frame and cylinders of the steam locomotive would be retained and the boiler would be replaced by a diesel engine driving an [[air compressor]].  The problem was low [[thermal efficiency]] because of the large amount of energy wasted as heat in the air compressor.  Attempts were made to compensate for this by using the diesel exhaust to re-heat the compressed air but these had limited success.  A German proposal of 1929 did result in a prototype<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/LOCOLOCO/diesair/diesair.htm |title=A German Diesel-Pneumatic Locomotive |publisher=Douglas-self.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}</ref> but a similar British proposal of 1932, to use an [[LNER Class R1]] locomotive, never got beyond the design stage.\n\n==Multiple-unit operation==\n[[File:GM-EMD 2000.jpg|thumb|Diesel\u2013electric locomotive built by EMD for service in the UK and continental Europe.]]\nMost diesel locomotives are capable of [[multiple-unit train control]] (MU) as a means of increasing [[horsepower]] and [[tractive effort]] when hauling heavy trains. All [[North America]]n locomotives, including export models, use a standardized [[Association of American Railroads|AAR]] electrical control system interconnected by a 27-pin [[jumper cable]] between the units. For UK-built locomotives, a number of incompatible control systems are used, but the most common is the Blue Star system, which is electro-pneumatic and fitted to most early diesel classes. A small number of types, typically higher-powered locomotives intended for passenger only work, do not have multiple control systems. In all cases, the electrical control connections made common to all units in a [[consist]] are referred to as [[trainline (railroad)|trainlines]]. \nThe result is that all locomotives in a [[consist]] behave as one in response to the engine driver's control movements.\n\nThe ability to couple diesel\u2013electric locomotives in an MU fashion was first introduced in the [[EMD FT]] four-unit demonstrator that toured the United States in 1939. At the time, American railroad work rules required that each operating locomotive in a train had to have on board a full crew. [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] circumvented that requirement by coupling the individual units of the demonstrator with [[Drawbar (haulage)|drawbars]] instead of conventional [[Railway coupling|knuckle couplers]] and declaring the combination to be a single locomotive.  Electrical interconnections were made so one engine driver could operate the entire consist from the head-end unit.  Later on, work rules were amended and the semi-permanent coupling of units with drawbars was eliminated in favour of couplers, as servicing had proved to be somewhat cumbersome owing to the total length of the consist (about 200 feet or nearly 61 meters).\n\nIn mountainous regions, it is common to interpose [[helper locomotive]]s in the middle of the train, both to provide the extra power needed to ascend a grade and to limit the amount of [[tensile stress|stress]] applied to the [[Railway coupling#Drawgear|draft gear]] of the car coupled to the head-end power.  The helper units in such [[distributed power]] configurations are controlled from the lead unit's cab through coded radio signals.  Although this is technically not an MU configuration, the behaviour is the same as with physically interconnected units.\n\n===Cab arrangements===\nCab arrangements vary by builder and operator. Practice in the U.S. has traditionally been for a cab at one end of the locomotive with limited visibility if the locomotive is not operated cab forward. This is not usually a problem as U.S. locomotives are usually operated in pairs, or threes, and arranged so that a cab is at each end of each set. European practice is usually for a cab at each end of the locomotive as trains are usually light enough to operate with one locomotive. Early U.S. practice was to add power units without cabs (booster or [[B unit]]s) and the arrangement was often A-B, A-A, A-B-A, A-B-B, or A-B-B-A where A was a unit with a cab. Center cabs were sometimes used for switch locomotives.\n\n===Cow-calf===\n{{Main|Cow-calf}}\nIn North American railroading, a [[cow-calf]] set is a pair of switcher-type locomotives: one (the cow) equipped with a driving cab, the other (the calf) without a cab, and controlled from the cow through cables.  Cow-calf sets are used in heavy switching and [[hump yard]] service. Some are radio controlled without an operating engineer present in the cab. This arrangement is also known as [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave]]. Where two connected units were present, [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] called these TR-2s (approximately {{convert|2,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}); where three units, TR-3s (approximately {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on|disp=or}}).\n\nCow-calves have largely disappeared as these engine combinations exceeded their economic lifetimes many years ago.\n\nPresent North American practice is to pair two {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} [[EMD GP40-2|GP40-2]] or [[EMD SD40-2|SD40-2]] road switchers, often nearly worn-out and very soon ready for rebuilding or scrapping, and to utilize these for so-called \"transfer\" uses, for which the TR-2, TR-3 and TR-4 engines were originally intended, hence the designation TR, for \"transfer\".\n\nOccasionally, the second unit may have its prime-mover and traction alternator removed and replaced by concrete or steel ballast and the power for traction obtained from the master unit. As a 16-cylinder prime-mover generally weighs in the {{convert|36,000|lb|adj=on}} range, and a {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} traction alternator generally weighs in the {{convert|18,000|lb|adj=on}} range, this would mean that {{convert|54,000|lb|abbr=on}} would be needed for ballast.\n\nA pair of fully capable \"Dash 2\" units would be rated {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}}. A \"Dash 2\" pair where only one had a prime-mover/alternator would be rated {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}}, with all power provided by master, but the combination benefits from the tractive effort provided by the slave as engines in transfer service are seldom called upon to provide {{convert|3,000|HP|abbr=on}} much less {{convert|6,000|HP|abbr=on}} on a continuous basis.\n\n==Fittings and appliances==\n\n===Flameproofing===\nA standard diesel locomotive presents a very low fire risk but \u201cflame proofing\u201d can reduce the risk even further.  This involves fitting a water-filled box to the exhaust pipe to quench any red-hot carbon particles that may be emitted.  Other precautions may include a fully insulated electrical system (neither side earthed to the frame) and all electric wiring enclosed in conduit.\n\nThe flameproof diesel locomotive has replaced the [[fireless steam locomotive]] in areas of high fire risk such as [[oil refineries]] and [[ammunition dump]]s.

North American locomotives are fitted with two headlights (for safety in case one malfunctions) and a pair of ditch lights. The latter are fitted low down at the front and are designed to make the locomotive easily visible as it approaches a [[grade crossing]]. Older locomotives may be fitted with a Gyralite or [[Mars Light]] instead of the ditch lights.\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{See also|Diesel exhaust}}\nAlthough diesel locomotives generally emit less sulphur dioxide, a major [[Pollution|pollutant]] to the environment, and greenhouse gases than steam locomotives, they are not completely clean in that respect.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |title=Engineering gets $1 million grant to make locomotives leaner, greener |publisher=Northern Illinois University |last=King |first=Joe |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120910064330/http://www.niu.edu/northerntoday/2008/sept22/locomotive.shtml |archivedate=2012-09-10 }}</ref> Furthermore, like other diesel powered vehicles, they emit [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]] and [[fine particles]], which are a risk to public health.

In North America, [[steam locomotive]]s were custom-made for specific railway routes, so economies of scale were difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=10}} Though more complex to produce with exacting manufacturing tolerances ({{convert|1/10000|in|adj=on|disp=or}} for diesel, compared with {{convert|1/100|in|adj=on}} for steam), diesel locomotive parts were easier to mass-produce. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] offered almost five hundred steam models in its heyday, while [[Electro-Motive Diesel|EMD]] offered fewer than ten diesel varieties.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=19}} In the United Kingdom, [[British Railways]] built steam locomotives to standard designs from 1951 onwards. These included standard, interchangeable parts, making them cheaper to produce than the diesel locomotives then available. The capital cost per [[Tractive force|drawbar horse power]] was \u00a313 6s (steam), \u00a365 (diesel), \u00a369 7s (turbine) and \u00a317 13s (electric).<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Railway Magazine |date=January 1951 |pages=60\u201361 |title=Standardisation and Comparative Costs of Motive Power on B.R.}}</ref>\n\nDiesel locomotives offer significant operating advantages over steam locomotives.<ref>[http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html http://www.sdrm.org/faqs/hostling.html], Phil Jern \"How to Boot a Steam Locomotive\" (1990) San Diego Railroad Museum.</ref> They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives continue to have two-person crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked [[multiple working|in multiple]] with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives in a single train \u2014 something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered for use as a single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train. With steam traction, a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to [[double heading]] with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.\n\nDiesel engines can be started and stopped almost instantly, meaning that a diesel locomotive has the potential to incur no fuel costs when not being used. However, it is still the practice of large North American railroads to use straight water as a coolant in diesel engines instead of coolants that incorporate anti-freezing properties; this results in diesel locomotives being left idling when parked in cold climates instead of being completely shut down. A diesel engine can be left idling unattended for hours or even days, especially since practically every diesel engine used in locomotives has systems that automatically shut the engine down if problems such as a loss of oil pressure or coolant loss occur. Automatic start/stop systems are available which monitor coolant and engine temperatures. When the unit is close to having its coolant freeze, the system restarts the diesel engine to warm the coolant and other systems.<ref>[http://www.ztr.com/smartstart.php SmartStart\u00ae IIe - Automatic Engine Start/Stop System].

Preparing and firing a steam locomotive for use from cold can take many hours. They can be kept in readiness between uses with a low fire, but this requires regular stoking and frequent attention to maintain the level of water in the boiler. This may be necessary to prevent the water in the boiler freezing in cold climates, so long as the water supply is not frozen.\n\nThe maintenance and operational costs of steam locomotives were much higher than diesels. Annual maintenance costs for steam locomotives accounted for 25% of the initial purchase price. Spare parts were cast from wooden masters for specific locomotives. The sheer number of unique steam locomotives meant that there was no feasible way for spare-part inventories to be maintained.{{sfn|Churella|1998|pp=12-17}} With diesel locomotives spare parts could be mass-produced and held in stock ready for use and many parts and sub-assemblies could be standardized across an operator's fleet using different models of locomotive from the same builder. Modern diesel locomotive engines are designed to allow the power assemblies (systems of working parts and their block interfaces) to be replaced while keeping the main block in the locomotive, which greatly reduces the time that a locomotive is out of revenue-generating service when it requires maintenance.<ref name=\"Kettering\" />\n\nSteam engines required large quantities of coal and water, which were expensive variable operating costs.<ref name=\"Stover 213\">Stover, 213</ref> Further, the [[thermal efficiency]] of steam was considerably less than that of diesel engines. Diesel's theoretical studies demonstrated potential thermal efficiencies for a compression ignition engine of 36% (compared with 6\u201310% for steam), and an 1897 one-cylinder prototype operated at a remarkable 26% efficiency.{{sfn|Churella|1998|p=14}}\n\nHowever, one study published in 1959 suggested that many of the comparisons between diesel and steam locomotives were made unfairly. mostly because diesels were newer. After painstaking analysis of financial records and technological progress, the author found that if research had continued on steam technology instead of diesel, there would be negligible financial benefit in converting to diesel locomotion.<ref>Brown, H.
