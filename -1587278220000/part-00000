The first interchange is with [[Tennessee State Route|SR 48]]. I-24 then has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US 79]], [[Tennessee State Route 237|SR 237]], and [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], and crosses the [[Red River (Tennessee-Kentucky)|Red River]]. It then enters a long straight section with several steep grades, crossing into [[Robertson County, Tennessee|Robertson County]], and has interchanges with [[Tennessee State Route 256|SR 256]], and [[Tennessee State Route 49|SR 49]] near [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], respectively. The route then enters the rolling hilly terrain of the [[Nashville Basin]], and crosses briefly into [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], where it has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 249|SR 249]]. I-24 then crosses into [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]]. The interstate continues for several miles through rural woodlands and multiple steep grades before coming to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]). Three miles later, I-24 crosses the Nashville Urban Boundary, widens to six lanes, and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Parkway), the northern beltway around Nashville. Less than a mile later, I-24 joins a concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|Interstate 65]], where the combined routes carry ten through lanes, and travel due south. About a mile later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|US 41A]]/431 (Trinity Lane), and about a mile beyond this point, I-65 splits off, and I-24 enters downtown Nashville, where it has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], US 431, and [[U.S. Route 31E in Tennessee|US 31E]], as well as several city streets. I-24 then crosses the [[Cumberland River]], and joins in a concurrency with Interstate 40, travelling southeast with eight through lanes, and two miles later, I-40 splits off eastwardly, heading toward Knoxville. Located at this interchange is also an interchange with US 41/[[U.S. Route 70S in Tennessee|70S]], and less than a mile later is an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|Interstate 440]], which is also accessible from I-40 nearby. About a mile later is once again an interchange with SR 155/Briley Parkway near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and I-24 continues southeast, bisecting a major residential area. Here I-24 carries eight through lanes, and beginning at the next exit, [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]], the left lanes operate as [[HOV lane]]s during rush hour. Over the next few miles, I-24 has interchanges with Haywood Lane, [[Tennessee State Route 254|SR 254]] (Bell Road), Hickory Hollow Parkway, and [[Tennessee State Route 253|SR 253]] (Old Hickory Boulevard).\n\n====Middle Tennessee====\nI-24 continues southeast through the rapidly growing suburbs of Nashville, and crosses into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]] near the city of [[LaVergne, Tennessee|LaVergne]], where it has an interchange with a connector road to that respective city. Beginning at this point, I-24 is relatively straight and flat for most of its distance through Middle Tennessee. The straightest stretch of highway in Tennessee is located on I-24 between Lavergne and eastern [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], where the route is perfectly straight for about fifteen miles, although the median widens and narrows. Two miles later, I-24 reaches [[Smyrna, Tennessee|Smyrna]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 266|SR 266]] (Sam Ridley Pkwy.). Four miles later is an interchange with [[SR 102 (TN)|SR 102]] (Almaville Road), which also serves Smyrna, as well as the [[Nissan Smyrna assembly plant]]. Another four miles later is an interchange with [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville, and beyond this point I-24 enters Murfreesboro, the largest suburb of Nashville. In Murfreesboro, I-24 has interchanges with [[SR 96 (TN)|SR 96]] (which connects to [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]), [[SR 99 (TN)|SR 99]] (New Salem Highway), and [[US 231 (TN)|US 231]] (which connects to [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]] and [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]]), respectively, and at the final Murfreesboro exit (US 231), the HOV lane designation ends, and I-24 narrows to six lanes and then four lanes a short distance later. Three miles later is an interchange with the [[Joe B. Jackson Parkway]], which serves as an outer beltway around southeast Murfreesboro. I-24 then enters a more rural area, and remains relatively straight for many miles. Around milepost 96, I-24 briefly enters [[Bedford County, Tennessee|Bedford County]], and then [[Coffee County, Tennessee|Coffee County]], and at exit 97 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 64|SR 64]], which connects to Shelbyville. I-24 then curves to the south, then the east, and several miles later at exit 105 is an interchange with US 41, and five miles later I-24 enters [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]], where it has interchanges with [[SR 53 (TN)|SR 53]], [[SR 55 (TN)|SR 55]], and US 41, respectively. I-24 continues through a rural, largely agricultural area where it crosses into [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]] and has an interchange with [[US 64 (TN)|US 64]] and [[SR 50 (TN)|SR 50]].\n\n====Monteagle Mountain====\n{{main|Monteagle Mountain}}\nOne of the most hazardous stretches of interstate highway in the United States{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Chattanooga on I-24 in [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]], where the highway crosses the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The eastbound grade is particularly known to be hazardous, with a 4\u20136% grade protracted over a distance of several miles. Compared to grades elsewhere in the state, this downgrade does not come close to the steepest (I-40 between Nashville and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on I-24, near [[Joelton, Tennessee|Joelton]]). On this stretch, I-24 is three lanes in each direction, and contains two [[runaway truck ramp]]s. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. The westbound downgrade of the plateau is also extremely hazardous, and contains several sharp curves. Portions of this downgrade also feature off-ramp approach style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. Throughout the entire stretch across the Cumberland Plateau, the speed limit reduces to a maximum of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h}}; the westbound downgrade contains a {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit for trucks, and the eastbound downgrade contains a maximum {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit and {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|round=5}} limit for trucks.\n\nThe eastern Monteagle grade also has one of the three widest medians of any Interstate highway, with the others being [[Interstate 8|I-8]] through the In-Ko-Pah grade in [[California]] and [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] through the Cabbage Hill grade east of [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], [[Oregon]]. There is more than a mile between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other, and are part of the original interstate path in this area.\n\n====Georgia and Chattanooga==== \nAfter crossing Monteagle Mountain, I-24 travels for several miles through a relatively flat and straight segment before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 72|US&nbsp;72]] near [[Kimball, Tennessee|Kimball]] and [[South Pittsburg, Tennessee|South Pittsburg]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-24 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 28|SR&nbsp;28]] in [[Jasper, Tennessee|Jasper]]. Beyond this point, in a rare engineering feat, the east and westbound lanes split more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} apart, encompassing farms, homes, and a few businesses in between. This was reportedly a result of extensively fought disputes over [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] acquisitions, and is also one of the widest medians of any highway. The route then crosses a mountain, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 27|SR&nbsp;27]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, crosses the [[Nickajack Lake]] impoundment of the [[Tennessee River]]. Beyond this point, traveling through a gorge, I-24 can experience potentially strong [[crosswind]]s for several miles. I-24 enters [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and then into Georgia less than {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later.\n\nIn the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], I-24 travels for {{convert|4|mi}}, traveling along the southern flank of [[Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant|Raccoon Mountain]] and having an interchange with [[Interstate 59|I-59]] before turning back north to the Tennessee River and around the northern flank of [[Lookout Mountain]]. The exits remain numbered according to Tennessee's mileposts; however, the roadway mileposts are numbered according to Georgia's mileposts.<ref name=\"Athens\">{{cite news |url= http://onlineathens.com/stories/011600/new_0116000005.shtml |title= DOT to Change Interstate Exit Numbers |first=Ben |last= Deck |work= [[Athens Banner-Herald]] |date= January 16, 2000 |access-date= April 6, 2017 }}</ref> This segment also carries the [[Unsigned highway|unsigned]] '''State Route&nbsp;409''' (SR&nbsp;409) designation.<ref name=\"GDOT 2002\">{{cite GDOT map |year= 2002 |access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon re-entering Tennessee and Hamilton County, I-24 travels through [[Lookout Valley, Tennessee|Lookout Valley]] for several miles, and has interchanges with several key roads, including [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]]/US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;72. Several miles later, I-24 curves sharply to the east, traveling on a causeway between the Tennessee River and the northern tip of [[Lookout Mountain]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, curves sharply to the north. Entering [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is a three-way interchange with [[U.S. Route 27|US&nbsp;27]] northbound, which is a freeway beyond this point. Forming a concurrency with US&nbsp;27, the highways then curve sharply to the east, then to the west about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, where US&nbsp;27 splits off to the south as Rossville Boulevard. With interchanges with several city streets, I-24 travels through the inner city of Chattanooga. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-24 reaches the \"Ridge Cut\", a {{convert|1/4|mi|m|spell=in|adj=on}} section of [[Missionary Ridge]], between the 4th Avenue exit and the Germantown/Belvoir exit, where the interstate curves sharply to the north, then to the east again, crossing the ridge with an extremely steep grade. Accidents and severe congestion are common here. About {{convert|2|mi|km}} later, I-24 reaches its eastern terminus with [[Interstate 75|I-75]] in [[East Ridge, Tennessee|East Ridge]].\n\nThe entire length of I-24 is part of the [[National Highway System (United States)|National Highway System]], a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense.<ref name=\"NHS Illinois\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/illinois/il_illinois.pdf |title=National Highway System: Illinois |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 8, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Kentucky\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/kentuckty/ky_kentucky.pdf |title=National Highway System: Kentucky |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Tennessee\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/tn_tennessee.pdf |title=National Highway System: Tennessee |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Clarksville\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/clarksville_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Clarksville, TN--KY |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Nashville\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/nashville-davidson_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Nashville-Davidson, TN |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Murfreesboro\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/murfreesboro_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Murfreesboro, TN |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 9, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><ref name=\"NHS Chattanooga\">{{cite map |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/national_highway_system/nhs_maps/tennessee/chattanooga_tn.pdf |title=National Highway System: Chattanooga, TN--GA |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |date=May 10, 2019 |access-date=August 15, 2019 }}</ref><!-- Georgia map is not included because I-24 is not shown on it.

The first interchange is with [[Tennessee State Route|SR 48]]. I-24 then has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 79 in Tennessee|US 79]], [[Tennessee State Route 237|SR 237]], and [[Tennessee State Route 76|SR 76]], and crosses the [[Red River (Tennessee-Kentucky)|Red River]]. It then enters a long straight section with several steep grades, crossing into [[Robertson County, Tennessee|Robertson County]], and has interchanges with [[Tennessee State Route 256|SR 256]], and [[Tennessee State Route 49|SR 49]] near [[Springfield, Tennessee|Springfield]], respectively. The route then enters the rolling hilly terrain of the [[Nashville Basin]], and crosses briefly into [[Cheatham County, Tennessee|Cheatham County]], where it has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 249|SR 249]]. I-24 then crosses into [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]], and has an interchange with [[U.S. Route 431 in Tennessee|US 431]]. The interstate continues for several miles through rural woodlands and multiple steep grades before coming to an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 45|SR 45]] ([[Old Hickory Boulevard]]). Three miles later, I-24 crosses the Nashville Urban Boundary, widens to six lanes, and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 155|SR 155]] (Briley Parkway), the northern beltway around Nashville. Less than a mile later, I-24 joins a concurrency with [[Interstate 65 in Tennessee|Interstate 65]], where the combined routes carry ten through lanes, and travel due south. About a mile later is an interchange with [[U.S. Route 41 Alternate (Monteagle, Tennessee\u2013Hopkinsville, Kentucky)|US 41A]]/431 (Trinity Lane), and about a mile beyond this point, I-65 splits off, and I-24 enters downtown Nashville, where it has interchanges with [[U.S. Route 41 in Tennessee|US 41]], US 431, and [[U.S. Route 31E in Tennessee|US 31E]], as well as several city streets. I-24 then crosses the [[Cumberland River]], and joins in a concurrency with Interstate 40, travelling southeast with eight through lanes, and two miles later, I-40 splits off eastwardly, heading toward Knoxville. Located at this interchange is also an interchange with US 41/[[U.S. Route 70S in Tennessee|70S]], and less than a mile later is an interchange with the eastern terminus of [[Interstate 440 (Tennessee)|Interstate 440]], which is also accessible from I-40 nearby. About a mile later is once again an interchange with SR 155/Briley Parkway near the [[Nashville International Airport]], and I-24 continues southeast, bisecting a major residential area. Here I-24 carries eight through lanes, and beginning at the next exit, [[Tennessee State Route 255|SR 255]], the left lanes operate as [[HOV lane]]s during rush hour. Over the next few miles, I-24 has interchanges with Haywood Lane, [[Tennessee State Route 254|SR 254]] (Bell Road), Hickory Hollow Parkway, and [[Tennessee State Route 253|SR 253]] (Old Hickory Boulevard).\n\n====Middle Tennessee====\nI-24 continues southeast through the rapidly growing suburbs of Nashville, and crosses into [[Rutherford County, Tennessee|Rutherford County]] near the city of [[LaVergne, Tennessee|LaVergne]], where it has an interchange with a connector road to that respective city. Beginning at this point, I-24 is relatively straight and flat for most of its distance through Middle Tennessee. The straightest stretch of highway in Tennessee is located on I-24 between Lavergne and eastern [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], where the route is perfectly straight for about fifteen miles, although the median widens and narrows. Two miles later, I-24 reaches [[Smyrna, Tennessee|Smyrna]] and has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 266|SR 266]] (Sam Ridley Pkwy.). Four miles later is an interchange with [[SR 102 (TN)|SR 102]] (Almaville Road), which also serves Smyrna, as well as the [[Nissan Smyrna assembly plant]]. Another four miles later is an interchange with [[Interstate 840 (Tennessee)|Interstate 840]], the outer southern beltway around Nashville, and beyond this point I-24 enters Murfreesboro, the largest suburb of Nashville. In Murfreesboro, I-24 has interchanges with [[SR 96 (TN)|SR 96]] (which connects to [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]]), [[SR 99 (TN)|SR 99]] (New Salem Highway), and [[US 231 (TN)|US 231]] (which connects to [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]] and [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]]), respectively, and at the final Murfreesboro exit (US 231), the HOV lane designation ends, and I-24 narrows to six lanes and then four lanes a short distance later. Three miles later is an interchange with the [[Joe B. Jackson Parkway]], which serves as an outer beltway around southeast Murfreesboro. I-24 then enters a more rural area, and remains relatively straight for many miles. Around milepost 96, I-24 briefly enters [[Bedford County, Tennessee|Bedford County]], and then [[Coffee County, Tennessee|Coffee County]], and at exit 97 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 64|SR 64]], which connects to Shelbyville. I-24 then curves to the south, then the east, and several miles later at exit 105 is an interchange with US 41, and five miles later I-24 enters [[Manchester, Tennessee|Manchester]], where it has interchanges with [[SR 53 (TN)|SR 53]], [[SR 55 (TN)|SR 55]], and US 41, respectively. I-24 continues through a rural, largely agricultural area where it crosses into [[Grundy County, Tennessee|Grundy County]] and has an interchange with [[US 64 (TN)|US 64]] and [[SR 50 (TN)|SR 50]].\n\n====Monteagle Mountain====\n{{main|Monteagle Mountain}}\nOne of the most hazardous stretches of interstate highway in the United States{{citation needed|date=March 2010}} is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km}} west of Chattanooga on I-24 in [[Monteagle, Tennessee|Monteagle]], where the highway crosses the [[Cumberland Plateau]]. While all motorists need to exercise caution, truckers are particularly vexed by Monteagle, and many have died going through this area.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The eastbound grade is particularly known to be hazardous, with a 4\u20136% grade protracted over a distance of several miles. Compared to grades elsewhere in the state, this downgrade does not come close to the steepest (I-40 between Nashville and [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] features 5% grades in each direction as well as a 5% grade north of Nashville on I-24, near [[Joelton, Tennessee|Joelton]]). On this stretch, I-24 is three lanes in each direction, and contains two [[runaway truck ramp]]s. Owing to geography, these two ramps are on the left side of the grade. The westbound downgrade of the plateau is also extremely hazardous, and contains several sharp curves. Portions of this downgrade also feature off-ramp approach style lane dividers, in order to slow both motorists and truckers. Throughout the entire stretch across the Cumberland Plateau, the speed limit reduces to a maximum of {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h}}; the westbound downgrade contains a {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit for trucks, and the eastbound downgrade contains a maximum {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h}} speed limit and {{convert|35|mi/h|km/h|round=5}} limit for trucks.\n\nThe eastern Monteagle grade also has one of the three widest medians of any Interstate highway, with the others being [[Interstate 8|I-8]] through the In-Ko-Pah grade in [[California]] and [[Interstate 84 in Oregon|I-84]] through the Cabbage Hill grade east of [[Pendleton, Oregon|Pendleton]], [[Oregon]]. There is more than a mile between the eastbound and westbound lanes at one point. The eastbound lanes descend the mountain on one side of a ridge, while the westbound lanes ascend the other, and are part of the original interstate path in this area.\n\n====Georgia and Chattanooga==== \nAfter crossing Monteagle Mountain, I-24 travels for several miles through a relatively flat and straight segment before reaching an interchange with [[U.S. Route 72|US&nbsp;72]] near [[Kimball, Tennessee|Kimball]] and [[South Pittsburg, Tennessee|South Pittsburg]]. About {{convert|3|mi|km}} later, I-24 has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 28|SR&nbsp;28]] in [[Jasper, Tennessee|Jasper]]. Beyond this point, in a rare engineering feat, the east and westbound lanes split more than {{convert|1/2|mi|km}} apart, encompassing farms, homes, and a few businesses in between. This was reportedly a result of extensively fought disputes over [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] acquisitions, and is also one of the widest medians of any highway. The route then crosses a mountain, has an interchange with [[Tennessee State Route 27|SR&nbsp;27]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, crosses the [[Nickajack Lake]] impoundment of the [[Tennessee River]]. Beyond this point, traveling through a gorge, I-24 can experience potentially strong [[crosswind]]s for several miles. I-24 enters [[Hamilton County, Tennessee|Hamilton County]] entering the [[Eastern Time Zone]], and then into Georgia less than {{convert|1/4|mi|km}} later.\n\nIn the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], I-24 travels for {{convert|4|mi}}, traveling along the southern flank of [[Raccoon Mountain Pumped-Storage Plant|Raccoon Mountain]] and having an interchange with [[Interstate 59|I-59]] before turning back north to the Tennessee River and around the northern flank of [[Lookout Mountain]]. The exits remain numbered according to Tennessee's mileposts; however, the roadway mileposts are numbered according to Georgia's mileposts.<ref name=\"Athens\">{{cite news |url= http://onlineathens.com/stories/011600/new_0116000005.shtml |title= DOT to Change Interstate Exit Numbers |first=Ben |last= Deck |work= [[Athens Banner-Herald]] |date= January 16, 2000 |access-date= April 6, 2017 }}</ref> This segment also carries the [[Unsigned highway|unsigned]] '''State Route&nbsp;409''' (SR&nbsp;409) designation.<ref name=\"GDOT 2002\">{{cite GDOT map |year= 2002 |access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon re-entering Tennessee and Hamilton County, I-24 travels through [[Lookout Valley, Tennessee|Lookout Valley]] for several miles, and has interchanges with several key roads, including [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]]/US&nbsp;41/US&nbsp;72. Several miles later, I-24 curves sharply to the east, traveling on a causeway between the Tennessee River and the northern tip of [[Lookout Mountain]], and about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, curves sharply to the north. Entering [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} later is a three-way interchange with [[U.S. Route 27|US&nbsp;27]] northbound, which is a freeway beyond this point. Forming a concurrency with US&nbsp;27, the highways then curve sharply to the east, then to the west about {{convert|1|mi|km}} later, where US&nbsp;27 splits off to the south as Rossville Boulevard. With interchanges with several city streets, I-24 travels through the inner city of Chattanooga. About {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} later, I-24 reaches the \"Ridge Cut\", a {{convert|1/4|mi|m|spell=in|adj=on}} section of [[Missionary Ridge]], between the 4th Avenue exit and the Germantown/Belvoir exit, where the interstate curves sharply to the north, then to the east again, crossing the ridge with an extremely steep grade. Accidents and severe congestion are common here.

The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] and Rikiya \u014ctaka, and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed videotape that kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\nProduction took approximately nine months.<ref name=\"nakatainterview\" /> ''Ring'' and its sequel ''[[Spiral (1998 film)|Rasen]]'' were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, ''Ring'' was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups within the [[The_Ring_(franchise)|''Ring'' franchise]] and triggered a trend of Western [[remake]]s, starting with the 2002 American film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo high schoolers, Masami and Tomoko, talk about a videotape that was allegedly recorded in [[Izu Province|Izu]] and bears a curse that kills the viewer in one week. Tomoko reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a strange tape and received a call after watching. As soon as Masami returns upstairs, Tomoko witnesses her TV turn on by itself, and soon thereafter is killed by an unseen force.\n\nMeanwhile, the cursed video story is being investigated by Tomoko's maternal aunt; newspaper reporter [[List of Ring characters#Reiko Asakawa|Reiko Asakawa]]. When Reiko and her young son Yoichi are at Tomoko's funeral, she discovers that three of Tomoko's friends also died that same night, with their faces twisted in fear. In Tomoko's room the next day, Reiko looks through photos, finding that the four friends stayed in a rental cabin in Izu. One of the photos shows their faces blurred.\n\nReiko arrives at the cabin in Izu, and notices an unlabeled tape on the rental shelf. She watches it for herself: the tape shows a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images, accompanied by a metallic screeching. At the end, she sees a mysterious reflection in the TV and receives a phone call but there are only screeching sounds. Taking the threat of death seriously, she leaves with the tape and enlists her ex-husband, [[List of Ring characters#Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]] to investigate its origin. Ryuji discovers that Reiko's face is blurred in a photo, like those of Tomoko and her friends. Ry\u016bji watches the tape and tells her to make him a copy. While studying the tape the next day, the two find a hidden message within the tape saying \"frolic in brine, goblins be thine\". Ryuji eventually finds that the message is in a dialect from [[Izu \u014cshima]] Island. Reiko later catches Yoichi watching the tape, claiming the ghost of Tomoko told him to.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji sail for \u014cshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura. They stay at an inn run by Takashi, Shizuko's brother. Ry\u016bji reveals to Takashi that he knows the old man exposed Shizuko to the media, hoping to make money from it. The media attention attracted Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, who, besides researching [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], had an affair with Shizuko. Dr. Ikuma held a demonstration, where Shizuko displayed her psychic abilities. However, one journalist spitefully denounced her as a fraud, inciting his other colleagues to do the same. In retaliation, Shizuko's daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]], psychokinetically kills the journalist, with his face twisted like Tomoko's. Shortly after, a series of slanderous reports drive Shizuko to commit suicide. Dr. Ikuma was fired and took Sadako away.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji deduce that Sadako [[Psionics|psionically]] created the cursed tape to express her fury against the world. The two go back to Izu and uncover a well underneath the cabin. Through a vision, they discover that Dr. Ikuma murdered Sadako and threw her body into the well. They try to find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit. Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finds Sadako's corpse, and they return home, relieved that the curse is seemingly broken.\n\nThe next day, however, Ry\u016bji's TV switches on by itself and shows the image of a well. The [[Onry\u014d|vengeful ghost]] of Sadako crawls out of the well, out of Ry\u016bji's TV set, and frightens him into shock, killing him. Reiko had tried to call Ryuji so she hears his last minutes over the phone and finds out only she is free from the curse. Desperate to save Yoichi, she realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else was what saved her. She drives to her father's house, where she plans to let her son copy the tape and show it to her father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nanako Matsushima]] as [[Reiko Asakawa]], a journalist who investigates her niece's death and finds the cursed videotape.\n*[[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]], Reiko's ex-husband, a former medical student turned university professor.

Colette Balmain identifies, \u201cIn the figure of Sadako, ''Ring'' [utilises the] vengeful [[y\u016brei]] archetype of conventional Japanese horror\u201d. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which \u201cembodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\u201d.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\nRuth Goldberg argues that ''Ring'' expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\u201d. She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her 'natural' role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a [[Uncanny|doubling effect]] whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.<ref>Goldberg, Ruth (2004), 'Demons in the Family', in ''Planks of Reason'', ed. [[Barry Keith Grant]] and Christopher Sharrett, (Scarecrow Press), pp. 370-385.</ref>\n\nJay McRoy reads the ending hopefully: if the characters therapeutically understand their conflicts, they can live on.<ref name=autogenerated5 /> Balmain, however, is not optimistic; she reads the replication of the video as technology spreading, virus-like, throughout Japan.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\n==Production==\n{{expand section|date=November 2016}}\nAfter the moderate success of the [[Ring (Suzuki novel)|''Ring'' novel]], written by [[Koji Suzuki (writer)|K\u014dji Suzuki]] and published in 1991, publisher [[Kadokawa Shoten]] decided to make a motion picture adaptation of ''Ring''.\n\nScreenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi and director [[Hideo Nakata]] collaborated to work on the script after reading Suzuki's novel and watching ''[[Ring: Kanzenban]]'', [[Fuji Television]] Network's 1995 made-for-TV film, directed by Chisui Takigawa.<ref name=autogenerated2>Meikle, Dennis (2005), ''The Ring Companion'' (London: Titan Books).</ref> However, the TV version was re-edited and released on VHS under a new title, ''[[Ring: Kanzenban]]'' (''Ring: The Complete Edition'').<ref name=autogenerated2 /> Nakata did not state which TV version he and Takahashi watched.\n\nIn their film script, Takashi and Nakata changed the protagonist's gender (from male to female), name (from Kazuyuki Asakawa to Reiko Asakawa), marital status (from married to divorced) and child's gender and name (from daughter Yoko to son Yoichi).<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nWith the budget of US$1.2 million, the entire production took nine months and one week.

The film stars [[Nanako Matsushima]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]] and Rikiya \u014ctaka, and follows a reporter who is racing to investigate the mystery behind a cursed videotape that kills the viewer seven days after watching it.\n\nProduction took approximately nine months.<ref name=\"nakatainterview\" /> ''Ring'' and its sequel ''[[Spiral (1998 film)|Rasen]]'' were released in Japan at the same time. After its release, ''Ring'' was a huge box office success in Japan and was acclaimed by critics. It inspired numerous follow-ups within the [[The_Ring_(franchise)|''Ring'' franchise]] and triggered a trend of Western [[remake]]s, starting with the 2002 American film ''[[The Ring (2002 film)|The Ring]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nTwo high schoolers, Masami and Tomoko, talk about a videotape that was allegedly recorded in [[Izu Province|Izu]] and bears a curse that kills the viewer in one week. Tomoko reveals that a week ago, she and three of her friends watched a strange tape and received a call after watching. As soon as Masami returns upstairs, Tomoko witnesses her TV turn on by itself, and soon thereafter is killed by an unseen force.\n\nMeanwhile, the cursed video story is being investigated by Tomoko's maternal aunt; newspaper reporter [[List of Ring characters#Reiko Asakawa|Reiko Asakawa]]. When Reiko and her young son Yoichi are at Tomoko's funeral, she discovers that three of Tomoko's friends also died that same night, with their faces twisted in fear. In Tomoko's room the next day, Reiko looks through photos, finding that the four friends stayed in a rental cabin in Izu. One of the photos shows their faces blurred.\n\nReiko arrives at the cabin in Izu, and notices an unlabeled tape on the rental shelf. She watches it for herself: the tape shows a series of seemingly unrelated disturbing images, accompanied by a metallic screeching. At the end, she sees a mysterious reflection in the TV and receives a phone call but there are only screeching sounds. Taking the threat of death seriously, she leaves with the tape and enlists her ex-husband, [[List of Ring characters#Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]] to investigate its origin. Ryuji discovers that Reiko's face is blurred in a photo, like those of Tomoko and her friends. Ry\u016bji watches the tape and tells her to make him a copy. While studying the tape the next day, the two find a hidden message within the tape saying \"frolic in brine, goblins be thine\". Ryuji eventually finds that the message is in a dialect from [[Izu \u014cshima]] Island. Reiko later catches Yoichi watching the tape, claiming the ghost of Tomoko told him to.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji sail for \u014cshima and discover the history of the great psychic Shizuko Yamamura. They stay at an inn run by Takashi, Shizuko's brother. Ry\u016bji reveals to Takashi that he knows the old man exposed Shizuko to the media, hoping to make money from it. The media attention attracted Dr. Heihachiro Ikuma, who, besides researching [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]], had an affair with Shizuko. Dr. Ikuma held a demonstration, where Shizuko displayed her psychic abilities. However, one journalist spitefully denounced her as a fraud, inciting his other colleagues to do the same. In retaliation, Shizuko's daughter, [[Sadako Yamamura|Sadako]], psychokinetically kills the journalist, with his face twisted like Tomoko's. Shortly after, a series of slanderous reports drive Shizuko to commit suicide. Dr. Ikuma was fired and took Sadako away.\n\nReiko and Ry\u016bji deduce that Sadako [[Psionics|psionically]] created the cursed tape to express her fury against the world. The two go back to Izu and uncover a well underneath the cabin. Through a vision, they discover that Dr. Ikuma murdered Sadako and threw her body into the well. They try to find Sadako's body in an attempt to appease her spirit. Minutes before her seven days are up, Reiko finds Sadako's corpse, and they return home, relieved that the curse is seemingly broken.\n\nThe next day, however, Ry\u016bji's TV switches on by itself and shows the image of a well. The [[Onry\u014d|vengeful ghost]] of Sadako crawls out of the well, out of Ry\u016bji's TV set, and frightens him into shock, killing him. Reiko had tried to call Ryuji so she hears his last minutes over the phone and finds out only she is free from the curse. Desperate to save Yoichi, she realizes that copying the tape and showing it to someone else was what saved her. She drives to her father's house, where she plans to let her son copy the tape and show it to her father.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nanako Matsushima]] as [[Reiko Asakawa]], a journalist who investigates her niece's death and finds the cursed videotape.\n*[[Hiroyuki Sanada]] as [[Ryuji Takayama|Ry\u016bji Takayama]], Reiko's ex-husband, a former medical student turned university professor.

Colette Balmain identifies, \u201cIn the figure of Sadako, ''Ring'' [utilises the] vengeful [[y\u016brei]] archetype of conventional Japanese horror\u201d. She argues how this traditional Japanese figure is expressed via a videotape which \u201cembodies contemporary anxieties, in that it is technology through which the repressed past reasserts itself\u201d.<ref name=autogenerated6 />\n\nRuth Goldberg argues that ''Ring'' expresses \"ambivalence about motherhood\u201d. She reads Reiko as a mother who \u2013 due to the new potential for women's independence \u2013 neglects her 'natural' role as martyred homemaker in pursuit of an independent identity, subsequently neglecting her child. Goldberg identifies a [[Uncanny|doubling effect]] whereby the unconscious conflicts of Reiko's family are expressed via the supernatural in the other family under Reiko's investigation.<ref>Goldberg, Ruth (2004), 'Demons in the Family', in ''Planks of Reason'', ed.

They are also known as the [[Heheya Kingdom|Haihayas]] or as the \"early Kalachuris\" to distinguish them from their later namesakes.\n\nThe Kalachuri territory included parts of present-day [[Gujarat]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], and [[Maharashtra]]. Their capital was probably located at [[Mahishmati]]. Epigraphic and numismatic evidence suggests that the earliest of the [[Ellora Caves|Ellora]] and [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]] cave monuments were built during the Kalachuri rule.\n\nThe origin of the dynasty is uncertain. In the 6th century, the Kalachuris gained control of the territories formerly ruled by the [[Gupta Empire|Guptas]], the [[Vakataka]]s and the [[Vishnukundina]]s. Only three Kalachuri kings are known from inscriptional evidence: Shankaragana, Krishnaraja, and Buddharaja. The Kalachuris lost their power to the [[Chalukyas of Vatapi]] in the 7th century. One theory connects the later Kalachuri dynasties of [[Kalachuris of Tripuri|Tripuri]] and [[Kalachuris of Kalyani|Kalyani]] to the Kalachuris of Mahishmati.\n\n== Territory ==\n\nAccording to the Kalachuri inscriptions, the dynasty controlled [[Ujjayini]], [[Vidisha]] and [[Vadnagar|Anandapura]]. Literary references suggest that their capital was located at [[Mahishmati]] in the [[Malwa]] region.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}}\n\nThe dynasty also controlled [[Vidarbha]], where they succeeded the [[Vakataka]] and the [[Vishnukundina]] dynasties.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}}\n\nIn addition, the Kalachuris conquered northern [[Konkan]] (around [[Elephanta Caves|Elephanta]]) by the mid-6th century.

He issued coins featuring [[Brahmi script]] legends, imitating the design of earlier coins issued by the Traikutaka and the Gupta kings. His coins featuring a bull are based on the coins issued by [[Skandagupta]]. His silver coins were circulated widely for around 150 years after his reign.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}}\n\nKrishnaraja's coins describe him as ''Parama-Maheshvara'' (devotee of Shiva). An inscription of his son Shankaragana states that he was devoted to Pashupati (Shiva) since his birth.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}} Historical evidence suggests that he may have commissioned the Shaivite monuments at the [[Elephanta Caves]] and the earliest of the [[Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] caves at [[Ellora]], where his coins have been discovered.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|pp=9-10}}{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}}{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}}\n\n=== Shankaragana ===\n\nShankaragana (r. c. 575-600) is the earliest ruler of the dynasty to be attested by his own inscriptions, which were issued from Ujjain and Nirgundipadraka. His Ujjain grant is the earliest epigraphic record of the dynasty.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nShakaragana's adopted the titles of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] emperor [[Skandagupta]]. This suggests that he conquered western Malwa, which was formerly under the Gupta authority. His kingdom probably also included parts of the present-day Gujarat.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nLike his father, Shankaragana described himself as a ''Parama-Maheshvara'' (devotee of Shiva).{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\n=== Buddharaja ===\n\nBuddharaja is the last known ruler of the early Kalachuri dyansty. He was a son of Shankaragana.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nBuddharaja conquered eastern Malwa, but he probably lost western Malwa to the [[Maitraka|ruler of Vallabhi]]. During his reign, the [[Chalukyas of Vatapi|Chalukya]] king [[Mangalesha]] attacked the Kalachuri kingdom from the south, sometime after 600 CE. The invasion did not result in a complete conquest, as evident by Buddharaja's 609-610 CE (360 [[Kalachuri Era|KE]]) Vidisha and 610-611 CE (361 KE) Anandapura grants.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}} Buddharaja probably lost his sovereignty during a second Chalukya invasion, by Mangalesha,{{sfn|Durga Prasad Dikshit|1980|p=57}} or by his nephew [[Pulakeshin II]].{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}} The Chalukya inscriptions mention that Mangalesha defeated the Kalachuris, but do not credit Pulakeshin with this achievement; therefore, it is likely that Mangalesha was the Chalukya ruler responsible for ending the Kalachuri power.{{sfn|Durga Prasad Dikshit|1980|p=57}}\n\nLike his father and grandfather, Buddharaja described himself as a ''Parama-Maheshvara'' (devotee of Shiva). His queen Ananta-Mahayi belonged to the [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pashupata sect]].{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\n=== Descendants ===\n\nNo concrete information is available about the successors of Buddharaja, but it is known that by 687 CE, the Kalachuris had become feudatories of the [[Chalukya]]s.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nAn inscription issued by a prince named Taralasvamin was found at Sankheda (where one of Shankaragana's grants was also found). This inscription describes Taralasvamin as a devotee of Shiva, and his father [[Maharaja]] Nanna as a member of the \"Katachchuri\" family. The inscription is dated to the year 346 of an unspecified era. Assuming the era as Kalachuri era, Taralasvamin would have been a contemporary of Shankaragana. However, Taralasvamin and Nanna are not mentioned in other Kalachuri records. Also, unlike other Kalachuri inscriptions, the date in this inscription is mentioned in decimal numbers. Moreover, some expressions in the inscription appear to have been borrowed from the 7th century Sendraka inscriptions. Because of these evidences, [[V. V. Mirashi]] considered Taralasvamin's inscription as a spurious one.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|pp=10-11}}\n\nV. V. Mirashi connected the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]] to the early Kalachuri dynasty. He theorizes that the early Kalachuris moved their capital from Mahishmati to [[Kalanjara]], and from there to Tripuri.{{sfn|V. V.

Historical evidence suggests that these monuments are associated with Krishnaraja, who was also a Shavite.{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}}\n\nThe Kalachuris appear to have been the rulers of the Konkan coast, when some of the Elephanta monuments were built.{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}}  Silver coins of Krishnaraja have been found along the Konkan coast, on the [[Salsette Island]] (now part of Mumbai) and in the [[Nashik district]].{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}} Around 31 of his copper coins have been found on the Elephanta Island, which suggests that he was the patron of the main [[Elephanta Caves|cave temple]] on the island.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|pp=9-10}} According to numismatist Shobhana Gokhale, these low-value coins may have been used to pay the wages of the workers involved in the cave excavation.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\n=== Ellora ===\n\n[[File:Ellora, cave 29, Ravana shaking Mount Kailasa (9841650413).jpg|thumb|[[Ellora]] Cave No. 29]]\nThe earliest of the Hindu caves at [[Ellora]] appear to have been built during the Kalachuri reign, and possibly under Kalachuri patronage.

An inscription of his son Shankaragana states that he was devoted to Pashupati (Shiva) since his birth.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}} Historical evidence suggests that he may have commissioned the Shaivite monuments at the [[Elephanta Caves]] and the earliest of the [[Brahmanism|Brahmanical]] caves at [[Ellora]], where his coins have been discovered.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|pp=9-10}}{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}}{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}}\n\n=== Shankaragana ===\n\nShankaragana (r. c. 575-600) is the earliest ruler of the dynasty to be attested by his own inscriptions, which were issued from Ujjain and Nirgundipadraka. His Ujjain grant is the earliest epigraphic record of the dynasty.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nShakaragana's adopted the titles of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] emperor [[Skandagupta]]. This suggests that he conquered western Malwa, which was formerly under the Gupta authority. His kingdom probably also included parts of the present-day Gujarat.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nLike his father, Shankaragana described himself as a ''Parama-Maheshvara'' (devotee of Shiva).{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\n=== Buddharaja ===\n\nBuddharaja is the last known ruler of the early Kalachuri dyansty. He was a son of Shankaragana.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nBuddharaja conquered eastern Malwa, but he probably lost western Malwa to the [[Maitraka|ruler of Vallabhi]]. During his reign, the [[Chalukyas of Vatapi|Chalukya]] king [[Mangalesha]] attacked the Kalachuri kingdom from the south, sometime after 600 CE. The invasion did not result in a complete conquest, as evident by Buddharaja's 609-610 CE (360 [[Kalachuri Era|KE]]) Vidisha and 610-611 CE (361 KE) Anandapura grants.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}} Buddharaja probably lost his sovereignty during a second Chalukya invasion, by Mangalesha,{{sfn|Durga Prasad Dikshit|1980|p=57}} or by his nephew [[Pulakeshin II]].{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}} The Chalukya inscriptions mention that Mangalesha defeated the Kalachuris, but do not credit Pulakeshin with this achievement; therefore, it is likely that Mangalesha was the Chalukya ruler responsible for ending the Kalachuri power.{{sfn|Durga Prasad Dikshit|1980|p=57}}\n\nLike his father and grandfather, Buddharaja described himself as a ''Parama-Maheshvara'' (devotee of Shiva). His queen Ananta-Mahayi belonged to the [[Pashupata Shaivism|Pashupata sect]].{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\n=== Descendants ===\n\nNo concrete information is available about the successors of Buddharaja, but it is known that by 687 CE, the Kalachuris had become feudatories of the [[Chalukya]]s.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\nAn inscription issued by a prince named Taralasvamin was found at Sankheda (where one of Shankaragana's grants was also found). This inscription describes Taralasvamin as a devotee of Shiva, and his father [[Maharaja]] Nanna as a member of the \"Katachchuri\" family. The inscription is dated to the year 346 of an unspecified era. Assuming the era as Kalachuri era, Taralasvamin would have been a contemporary of Shankaragana. However, Taralasvamin and Nanna are not mentioned in other Kalachuri records. Also, unlike other Kalachuri inscriptions, the date in this inscription is mentioned in decimal numbers. Moreover, some expressions in the inscription appear to have been borrowed from the 7th century Sendraka inscriptions. Because of these evidences, [[V. V. Mirashi]] considered Taralasvamin's inscription as a spurious one.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|pp=10-11}}\n\nV. V. Mirashi connected the [[Kalachuris of Tripuri]] to the early Kalachuri dynasty. He theorizes that the early Kalachuris moved their capital from Mahishmati to [[Kalanjara]], and from there to Tripuri.{{sfn|V. V. Mirashi|1974|p=376}}\n\n== Cultural contributions ==\n\n=== Elephanta ===\n[[File:Elephanta Caves (27737333312).jpg|thumb|[[Elephanta Caves]]]]\nThe [[Elephanta Caves]] which contain [[Shaivite]] monuments are located along the [[Konkan]] coast, on the [[Elephanta Island]] near [[Mumbai]]. Historical evidence suggests that these monuments are associated with Krishnaraja, who was also a Shavite.{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}}\n\nThe Kalachuris appear to have been the rulers of the Konkan coast, when some of the Elephanta monuments were built.{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}}  Silver coins of Krishnaraja have been found along the Konkan coast, on the [[Salsette Island]] (now part of Mumbai) and in the [[Nashik district]].{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}} Around 31 of his copper coins have been found on the Elephanta Island, which suggests that he was the patron of the main [[Elephanta Caves|cave temple]] on the island.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|pp=9-10}} According to numismatist Shobhana Gokhale, these low-value coins may have been used to pay the wages of the workers involved in the cave excavation.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=10}}\n\n=== Ellora ===\n\n[[File:Ellora, cave 29, Ravana shaking Mount Kailasa (9841650413).jpg|thumb|[[Ellora]] Cave No. 29]]\nThe earliest of the Hindu caves at [[Ellora]] appear to have been built during the Kalachuri reign, and possibly under Kalachuri patronage. For example, the Ellora Cave No. 29 shows architectural and iconographic similarities with the Elephanta Caves.{{sfn|Geri Hockfield Malandra|1993|p=6}} The earliest coin found at [[Ellora]], in front of Cave No. 21 (Rameshvara), was issued by Krishnaraja.{{sfn|Charles Dillard Collins|1988|p=9}}\n\n== Rulers ==\n\nThe following are the known rulers of the Kalachuri dynasty of Malwa with their estimated reigns ([[IAST]] names in brackets):{{sfn|Ronald M.
