Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 54 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born mothers or fathers. There were violent confrontations between the Catholic and the Protestant (\"Orange\") Irish especially in the 1840s.<ref>Scott W.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sjport.com|title= Port of Saint John}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up.

The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union strike===\nThe 1949 Canadian Seamen's Union (CSU) strike for many shows a striking bit of history in Canadian labour and is a story about anti-union shipping companies who had a clear disregard for the law. The companies demanded the removal from the contract of the hiring hall. This concession was totally unacceptable to the union as it would mean the end of the CSU. When the union discovered the shipping companies were signing back-door agreements with the Seafarer's International Union (SIU) they had implemented strike action. With SIU crews operating the ships and the longshoremen handling the cargo, the CSU strike in Saint John was, for all intents and purposes, over. The union had been destroyed by a corrupt American union, led by gangster Hal Banks, who was supported by the American labour movement, the Canadian government and the Shipping Federation of Canada. The strike was now ineffective in Saint John, but the vibrations from the strike would be felt in the city for many years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union Strike The Saint John Story|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/the-1949-canadian-seamen-s-union-strike/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

Route 1 extends west to [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], and northeast towards [[Moncton, New Brunswick|Moncton]]. A second major highway, [[New Brunswick Route 7|Route 7]], connects Saint John with [[Fredericton]]. There are two main road crossings over the Saint John River: the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Reversing Falls Bridge]], approximately {{convert|1|nmi|km|lk=in}} upstream.\n\nThe [[Reversing Falls Railway Bridge]] carries rail traffic for the [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]] on the route from Saint John to [[Maine]]. Saint John was serviced by the [[Atlantic (train)|\"Atlantic\" Line]] of [[Via Rail]] passenger service. Passenger rail service in Saint John was discontinued in December 1994, although the [[Canadian National Railway]] and New Brunswick Southern Railway continue to provide freight service.\n\n[[Bay Ferries]] operates a ferry service, {{MV|Fundy Rose}}, across the Bay of Fundy to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]].

In November 2012, Acadian Lines ceased operations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe presence of Irish, British and French heritage is very apparent along with maritime traditions. Saint John's economy has long ties to the fisheries and shipbuilding, and is known for the ''Marco Polo'' as its flagship vessel. However, the city's economy has begun a transition from resource-based sectors and manufacturing to include growing IT and research sectors. The city has always been a traditional hub for the arts on the east coast, boasting many notable artists, actors and musicians, including [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and [[Miller Brittain]].\n\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet [[Clara Kathleen Smith| Kay Smith]], painters [[Jack Humphrey]], Miller Brittain, [[Bruno Bobak]], Fred Ross, and sculptor [[John Hooper (sculptor)|John Hooper]] and folk-singer Tom Connors.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]].

Prior to 1950 it was known as Moosepath Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|The Commons at the University of New Brunswick]]\nIn 1964, the [[University of New Brunswick]] created UNB Saint John in buildings throughout the uptown CBD. In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

Saint John Harbour, where the two rivers meet the Bay of Fundy, is a deep water port and ice-free all year long. Partridge Island is in the harbour.\n\nStonehammer [[UNESCO]] Geopark, the first Geopark in North America, is centred around Saint John. The Geopark has been recognized by UNESCO as having exceptional geological significance. The park contains rock formations throughout the Saint John region ranging billions of years.\n\n[[File:St Martins NB covered bridge.jpg|thumb|Covered bridges dot the Greater Saint John region.]]\n\nThe Saint John River itself flows into the [[Bay of Fundy]] through a narrow gorge several hundred feet wide at the centre of the city. It contains a unique phenomenon called the [[Reversing Falls]] where the diurnal tides of the bay reverse the water flow of the river for several kilometres. A series of underwater ledges at the narrowest point of this gorge also create a series of rapids.\n\nThe topography surrounding Saint John is hilly; a result of the influence of two coastal mountain ranges which run along the Bay of Fundy&nbsp;\u2013 the ''St. Croix Highlands'' and the ''Caledonia Highlands''. The soil throughout the region is extremely rocky with frequent granite outcrops. The coastal plain hosts numerous freshwater lakes in the eastern, western and northern parts of the city.\n\nIn Saint John the height difference from low to high [[tide]] is approximately 8 metres (28&nbsp;ft) due to the funnelling effect of the Bay of Fundy as it narrows. The Reversing Falls in Saint John, actually an area of strong rapids, provides one example of the power of these tides; at every high tide, ocean water is pushed through a narrow gorge in the middle of the city and forces the Saint John River to reverse its flow for several hours.\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n[[File:SaintJohn1894.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Saint John from 1894, including the lower west (then Carleton), and uptown]]\nSaint John is a city of neighbourhoods, with residents closely identifying with their particular area.\n\n[[File:King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand.JPG|thumb|left|King Edward VII Memorial Bandstand]]\n\n====South (End) Central Peninsula\u2014Uptown====\nThe central peninsula on the east side of [[Saint John Harbour]] and the area immediately opposite on the west side are the sites of the original city, which resulted from the merger of Parrtown and Carleton. The western side of the central peninsula subsequently saw increased development and includes the central business district (CBD) and the [[Trinity Royal Heritage Conservation Area]], which together are referred to as \"Uptown\" by residents throughout the city. The term \"Uptown\" came about as people at the slips would go up the hill to the city. In addition, most of the central peninsula is situated on a hill. This central area of Saint John is only rarely called \"Downtown.\" The south end of the central peninsula, south of Duke Street, is appropriately called the South End.\n\n====North End (Portland/Millidgeville)====\nMuch of the North End is made up of the former city of Portland, a predominantly working class area north of the harbour along the Saint John River. Vessels navigating the Saint John River can only transit the Reversing Falls gorge at [[slack tide]], thus Portland became a location during the 19th and 20th centuries where tugboats and paddle wheelers could dock to wait. Being at the beginning of the navigable part of the Saint John River, Portland also became a major terminal for vessels departing to ply their trade upriver.\n\nFurther north of the central part of the city, and northeast of Portland, along the southern bank of the Kennebecasis River is the area of Millidgeville which is generally considered a neighbourhood separate from Portland. The boundary of Millidgeville is typically thought to begin at the \"Y\" intersection of Somerset Street and Millidge Ave or right after Tartan St. It is a middle to upper-class neighbourhood.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Located here is [[University of New Brunswick]], as well as New Brunswick's largest health care centre, the [[Saint John Regional Hospital]], and Saint John's only completely French school and community centre, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre Scolaire Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]].\n\nThe eastern area of the North End plays host to the city's largest park, and one of Canada's largest urban parks. [[Rockwood Park, Saint John|Rockwood Park]] encompasses {{convert|890|ha|abbr=on}} of upland Acadian mixed forest, many hills and several caves, as well as several freshwater lakes, with an extensive trail network, a golf course, and the [[Cherry Brook Zoo]]. The park was designed by [[Calvert Vaux]] in the mid-to-late 19th century. Mount Pleasant borders the park, and is generally seen as distinct from the traditionally poorer North End.\n\n===={{anchor|East Side}} East Side (Simonds/Loch Lomond)====\n\n[[File:Church, St. Johns.jpg|thumb|Our Lady of the Assumption Catholic Church in Saint John]]\n\nTo the east of the [[Courtney Bay]] / Forebay and south of [[New Brunswick Route 1]] is the East Side, where the city has experienced its greatest suburban sprawl in recent decades with commercial retail centres and residential subdivisions. There has been significant and consistent commercial and retail development in the Westmorland Road-McAllister Drive-Consumer's Drive-Major's Brook Drive-Retail Drive corridor since the 1970s, including McAllister Place, the city's largest shopping mall, which opened in 1978, and with active year-to-year development since 1994. The city's airport is further east on the coastal plain among several lakes at the far eastern edge of the municipality. Far east side is Loch Lomond, including several urban neighbourhoods found here, including Forest Hills, Champlain Heights, and Lakewood Heights. The malls were built by filling in Major's Brook (a tributary to Marsh Creek), making the area prone to flooding.\n\n====West Side (Carleton/Lancaster/Fairville)====\nThe portion of the city west of the Saint John River is collectively referred to as West Side, although West Saint Johners divide this area into several neighbourhoods. As mentioned previously, the Lower West Side is the former working-class neighbourhood known as Carleton at the time of the city's formation in 1785. West and north of the Lower West Side is the former city of Lancaster (commonly referred to as Saint John West), which was amalgamated into Saint John in 1967. The boundary was City Line Street, with the streets east considered to be the \"West Side\", and the streets west of City Kine Street having been renamed from Lancaster, NB to Saint John West, NB.\n\nThe southern part of Lancaster abutting [[Saint John Harbour]] and the Bay of Fundy is Bayshore and the location of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]'s Bayshore Yard. The north end of Lancaster, known as Fairville, is home to [[Moosehead Brewery]] and older neighbourhoods clustered along Manawagonish Road. North of Fairville are the communities of [[Milford, New Brunswick|Milford]] and [[Randolph, New Brunswick|Randolph]]. Randolph, which is home to Dominion Park Beach, includes land on the city's largest island, and is joined by the Canal Bridge over Mosquito Cove on Greenhead Road. The area also contains the Irving Pulp and Paper mill, a highly visible manufacturing plant that sits next to the [[Reversing Falls]] and is owned and operated by [[J. D. Irving|J. D. Irving, Ltd.]]\n\nWest of Lancaster, the city hosts its second largest park, and one of the largest coastal urban parks in the country. The [[Irving Nature Park]], along Saints' Rest Beach, sits on an extensive peninsula called [[Taylor's Island, New Brunswick|Taylor's Island]] extending into the western part of the harbour into the Bay of Fundy. The park is partially open to vehicles in summer and features ocean views and walking trails through mixed forests.\n\n====Suburbs====\n\nSaint John's suburbs, just on the edge of the city limit, are [[Rothesay, New Brunswick|Rothesay]], [[Quispamsis]], and [[Grand Bay\u2013Westfield]]. Mainly residential, the suburbs have attracted many of Saint John's residents, leading the city's population to shrink.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Saint John\n| \u221213.6 | \u22122.7 | 139\n| \u221212.7 | \u22121.9 |  94\n|  \u22127.3 |  2.3 | 118\n|  \u22121.2 |  8.3 | 104\n|   4.0 | 14.8 | 118\n|   8.4 | 19.5 | 101\n|  11.7 | 22.4 | 102\n|  11.6 | 22.2 |  90\n|   7.7 | 17.7 | 117\n|   2.7 | 11.9 | 125\n|  \u22122.1 |  6.0 | 134\n|  \u22129.7 |  0.3 | 149\n| float  = right\n| clear  = none\n| source = Environment Canada<ref>{{cite web\n| publisher = [[Environment Canada]]\n| url = http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=6250&prov=&lang=e&dCode=1&dispBack=1&StationName=saint_john&SearchType=Contains&province=ALL&provBut=&month1=0&month2=12\n| title = Saint John A\n| work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000\n| accessdate = September 30, 2013}}</ref>}}\nThe climate of Saint John is [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''). The Bay of Fundy never fully freezes, thus moderating the winter temperatures compared with inland locations. Even so, with the prevailing wind blowing from the west (from land to sea), the average January temperature is about {{convert|-8.2|C}}. Summers are usually warm to hot, and daytime temperatures often exceed {{convert|25|C}}. The highest temperature recorded in a given year is usually {{convert|30|or|31|C|0}}. The confluence of cold Bay of Fundy air and inland warmer temperatures often creates onshore winds that bring periods of fog and cooler temperatures during the summer months.\n\nPrecipitation in Saint John totals about {{convert|1295|mm|abbr=on}} annually and is well distributed throughout the year, although the late autumn and early winter are typically the wettest time of year. Snowfalls can often be heavy, but rain is as common as snow in winter, and it is not unusual for the ground to be snow-free even in mid-winter.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Saint John

The city was incorporated in the late 1700s after more than 3,300 Black Loyalist refugees came to Saint John along with more than 10,000 white refugees after the American Revolution. <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-black-history-1.5048864 |title=Before Willie O'Ree: New Brunswick's surprising black history contributions|publisher=CBC |accessdate=10 November 2019}}</ref> In the years between 1815 and 1867, when immigration of that era passed its peak, more than 150,000 immigrants from Ireland came to Saint John dramatically changing the city. \n\nThose who came in the earlier period were largely tradesmen, and many stayed in Saint John, becoming the backbone of its builders. But when the Great Irish Potato Famine raged between 1845 and 1852, huge waves of famine refugees flooded the city's shores. It is estimated that between 1845 and 1847, some 30,000 arrived, more people than were living in the city at the time. In 1847, dubbed \"[[Great Famine (Ireland)|Black 47]]\", one of the worst years of the famine, some 16,000 immigrants, most of them from Ireland, arrived at Partridge Island, the immigration and quarantine station at the mouth of Saint John Harbour.<ref>Thomas P.

In the census of 1851, over half the heads of households in the city registered themselves as natives of Ireland. By 1871, 54 per cent of Saint John's residents were Irish natives or children of Irish-born mothers or fathers. There were violent confrontations between the Catholic and the Protestant (\"Orange\") Irish especially in the 1840s.<ref>Scott W.

The largest visible minority groups were [[Black people|Black]] (2.1%), [[Chinese people|Chinese]] (1.4%), [[Arabs|Arab]] (0.9%), and [[South Asian People|South Asian]] (0.7%). 5% of Saint Johners are francophone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=POPC&Code1=0734&Geo2=PR&Code2=13&SearchText=Saint+John&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=Language&TABID=1&type=0 |publisher=Statistics Canada |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nWith regard to religion, 89.2% identify as Christian (47.6% Protestant, 40.3% Roman Catholic, and 1.3% other Christian, mostly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and independent churches). 10.1% state no religious affiliation, and other religions including [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Hinduism]] together comprise less than 1%.\n\n==Municipal government (Common Council)==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\nSaint John is one of five chartered cities in Canada, giving it unique legislative powers.<ref name=\"policyschool\">{{cite web |title=Is \u2018Charter-City Status\u2019 a Solution for Financing City Services in Canada \u2014 Or is that a Myth? |url=https://www.policyschool.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/charter-city-status-kitchen_0.pdf |publisher=University of Calgary |accessdate=21 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Responsibility===\nSaint John is governed by a body of elected officials, referred to as \"Common Council\", whose responsibilities include:\n* Setting the city operational budget\n* Setting the City Water utility budget/ rates\n* Enacting and amending by-laws\n* Rezoning and land-use permissions of properties in Saint John.\n* Setting the capital budget for the city\n* Acting as the Board of Directors for the corporation \"City of Saint John\"\n* Appointing persons to city staff and commissions\n* Overseeing the operation of city commissions and departments\n\n===Composition===\n{{Main|Saint John City Council}}\nThe Common Council consists of:\n* The Mayor, who runs at-large, acts as Chairman of the Board.\n* Two at-large Common Councillors.\n* Two Common Councillors, from each of the city's four wards.\nOne is elected by the council to serve as Deputy Mayor.\n\nAs of 2017, the Council's members are:\n* Mayor: Don Darling\n* Deputy Mayor: [[Shirley McAlary]]\n* Councillor at Large: Gary Sullivan\n* Ward 1: Blake Armstrong, Greg Norton\n* Ward 2: John MacKenzie, Sean Casey\n* Ward 3: Donna Reardon, David Hickey\n* Ward 4: Ray Strowbridge, David Meritthew\n\nIn the [[2007 Saint John, New Brunswick Ward Plebiscite|October 9, 2007 Plebiscite]], it was decided that as of the May 2008 quadrennial municipal elections, the city will be divided into four wards of approximately equal population, with two councillors to be elected by the voters in that ward, and two councillors to be elected at large.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Colsen cove park 009.jpg|thumb|Colsen Cove generating station]]\n[[File:Old Post Office Saint John.JPG|thumb|The Old Post Office]]\nSaint John derived its economy from maritime industries such as shipping, fishing and shipbuilding. Saint John has a long history of shipbuilding at the city's dry dock, which is one of the largest in the world. Since 2003 shipbuilding has ended on the scale it once was, forcing the city to adopt a new economic strategy. The University of New Brunswick, the New Brunswick Museum and the New Brunswick Community College are important institutions, and along with Radian6, Horizon Health Network and many others, they are a part of Saint John's fast-growing research and information-technology sectors. As the city moves away from its industrial past it now begins to capitalize on the growing sector of tourism, hosting over 1.5 million visitors a year and 200,000 cruise ship visitors a year, creating a renaissance in the city's historic downtown (locally known as uptown). Many small businesses have moved into Uptown and large scale waterfront developments are underway, such as the Fundy Quay (condo, hotel and office space), Saint John Law Courts, and the Three Sisters Harbourfront condos.\n\nThe arts and culture sector plays a large role in Saint John's economy. The Imperial Theatre is home to the highly acclaimed Saint John Theatre Company, and the Symphony New Brunswick and hosts a large collection of plays, concerts and other stage productions year-round. Harbour Station entertainment complex is home to the Saint John Sea Dogs of the QMJHL and the Saint John Riptide of the NBL.\n\nArt galleries in Saint John cover the uptown, more than any other Atlantic Canadian city. Artists like [[Miller Brittain]] and [[Fred Ross (artist)|Fred Ross]] have made Uptown Saint John their home, and now the torch has been passed to artists like Gerard Collins, Cliff Turner and Peter Salmon and their respective galleries. Uptown art galleries also include the Trinity Galleries, Citadel Gallery, Handworks Gallery and the Saint John Arts Centre (SJAC). The SJAC in the Carnegie Building hosts art exhibits, workshops, local songwriters' circles and other shows too small to be featured at the grand Imperial Theatre.\n\nSaint John maintains industrial infrastructure in the city's East side such as Canada's largest [[Irving Oil Refinery|oil refinery]]. Capitalist [[Kenneth Colin Irving|K.C. Irving]] and his family built his unfettered industrial conglomerate in the city by buying up mills, shipyards, media outlets, and other industrial infrastructure during the 20th century, and still continue to this day. Today Irving dominates the city and province with stakes in oil, forestry, shipbuilding, media and transportation. Irving companies remain dominant employers in the region with North America's first deepwater oil terminal,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/CAN_Saint_John_Port_130.php |title=Saint John Port |website=World Port Source |accessdate=January 10, 2019}}</ref> a pulp mill, a paper mill and a tissue paper plant.\n\nOther important economic activity in the city is generated by the [[Port of Saint John]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sjport.com|title= Port of Saint John}}</ref>\n\nSaint John has a long history of brewers, such as Simeon Jones, The Olands, and James Ready. The city is now home to Moosehead Breweries, James Ready Brewing Co., Big Tide Brewing Co., Picaroon's and other craft brewers. The [[Moosehead Brewery]] (established in 1867, is Canada's only nationally distributed independent brewery [M. Nicholson]), James Ready Brewing Co., the [[New Brunswick Power Corporation]] which operates three electrical generating stations in the region including the [[Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station]], [[Bell Aliant]] which operates out of the former [[New Brunswick Telephone]] headquarters, the Horizon Health Network, which operates 5 hospitals in the Saint John area,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.horizonnb.ca/home/facilities-and-services/facilities.aspx?cat=1&type=hospital |title=Facilities: Hospitals |publisher=Horizon Health Services |accessdate=August 26, 2019}} Hospitals in the Saint John Region: Charlotte County Hospital, Grand Manan Hospital, Saint John Regional Hospital, St. Joseph's Hospital and Sussex Health Centre.</ref> and numerous [[information technology]] companies. There are also a number of [[call centres]] which were established in the 1990s under provincial government incentives.\n\n{{wide image|Stjohnpanoramo.jpg|1800px|View from Fort Howe of the Saint John skyline prior to Peel Plaza}}\n\n===Maritime activities===\n{{main|Port of Saint John}}\nUntil the first decade of the 21st century, Canada's largest shipyard (Irving Shipbuilding) had been an important employer in the city. During the 1980s-early 1990s the shipyard was responsible for building 9 of the 12 {{sclass-|Halifax|frigate|0}} multi-purpose patrol [[frigate]]s for the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Canadian Navy]]. However, the Irvings closed the shipyard in 2003 and centralized in Halifax.\n\nPrior to the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] in 1959, the Port of Saint John functioned as the winter port for [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] when shipping was unable to traverse the [[sea ice]] in the [[Gulf of St. Lawrence]] and [[St. Lawrence River]]. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] opened a line to Saint John from Montreal in 1889 across the state of [[Maine]] and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. The port fell into decline following the seaway opening and the start of year-round [[icebreaker]] services in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to [[Short-line railroad|shortline]] operator [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]]. The [[Canadian National Railway]] still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from [[Moncton]]. Despite these setbacks, Port Saint John is the largest port by volume in Eastern Canada, at about 28 million metric tonnes of cargo per year, including [[Shipping container|containers]] and [[bulk cargo]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Port Saint John |url=https://www.sjport.com/ |accessdate=5 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Military===\nBesides being the location of several historical forts, such as Fort Howe, Fort Dufferin, Fort Latour, and the [[Carleton Martello Tower]], Saint John is the location of a number of reserve units of the [[Canadian Forces]].\n\n*[[Canadian Forces Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]]\n** [[HMCS Brunswicker]]\n*[[37 Canadian Brigade Group]]\n** [[3rd Field Artillery Regiment, RCA]]: Regimental headquarters and 115th Field Battery (The Loyal Company)\n** [[Royal New Brunswick Regiment]] (Carleton & York): B Company\n** 37 Service Battalion: Battalion headquarters and a composite logistics company\n** 37 Signal Regiment: 2 Squadron\n\n==Labour==\n\n===Canada's first trade union===\nSaint John is often described as the birthplace of unionism in Canada and is one of the few pre-capitalist colonial settlements in North America. The city has a history of labour achievements and sparked the Canadian labour movement with Canada's first trade union, the Labourers' Benevolent Association (now International Longshoremen's Association Local 273). In 1849 the union was formed when Saint John's longshoremen banded together to lobby for regular pay and a shorter workday. One of their first resolutions was to apply to the city council for permission to erect the bell, which would announce the beginning and end of the labourers' 10-hour workday. As the bell shears were hardly finished when capitalists and merchants in the city objected to the bell and successfully lobbied city hall to keep the bell from being put up. But then, citizens and longshoremen defied the order and erected a larger bell and merchants withdrew their opposition to the \"Labourers' Bell\". ILA Local 273 remain one of the city's strongest trade unions to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=For Whom The Bells Toll|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/for-whom-the-bells-toll/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Saint John Street Railwaymen\u2019s strike and riot of 1914===\nThe [[1914 Saint John street railway strike]] (sometimes called the ''Saint John street railwaymen's strike'')<ref name=Babcock>{{cite journal |last=Babcock |first=Robert H. |date=January 1982 |title=The Saint John Street Railwaymen's Strike and Riot, 1914 |url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/Acadiensis/article/view/11570/0 |journal=[[Acadiensis]] |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages= |issn=0044-5851 |access-date=May 13, 2016}}</ref> was a [[strike action|strike]] by workers on the street railway system in the city which lasted from July 22\u201324, 1914, with rioting by Saint John inhabitants occurring on July 23 and 24. The strike was important for shattering the image of Saint John as a conservative town dominated primarily by ethnic and religious (rather than class) divisions, and highlighting tensions between railway industrialists and the local working population.\n\n[[File:1914 Saint John riot aftermath.jpg|thumb|1914 Saint John Railwaymen's Strike riot]]\n\n===The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union strike===\nThe 1949 Canadian Seamen's Union (CSU) strike for many shows a striking bit of history in Canadian labour and is a story about anti-union shipping companies who had a clear disregard for the law. The companies demanded the removal from the contract of the hiring hall. This concession was totally unacceptable to the union as it would mean the end of the CSU. When the union discovered the shipping companies were signing back-door agreements with the Seafarer's International Union (SIU) they had implemented strike action. With SIU crews operating the ships and the longshoremen handling the cargo, the CSU strike in Saint John was, for all intents and purposes, over. The union had been destroyed by a corrupt American union, led by gangster Hal Banks, who was supported by the American labour movement, the Canadian government and the Shipping Federation of Canada. The strike was now ineffective in Saint John, but the vibrations from the strike would be felt in the city for many years.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 1949 Canadian Seamen\u2019s Union Strike The Saint John Story|url=http://www.wfhathewaylabourexhibitcentre.ca/labour-history/the-1949-canadian-seamen-s-union-strike/|publisher=Hatheway Labour Exhibit Center|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===October 14, 1976 - the Saint John General Strike===\nThe Saint John General Strike of 1976 was a result of the Bill C-73 passed by Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and the House of Commons in Ottawa on October 14, 1975. This bill limited wage increases to 8% the first year, 6% the second year, and 4% the third year after its enactment. Most provinces of Canada accepted the bill by spring of 1976, but within eighteen months they began to withdraw from the program. After its introduction in 1975, it was not until 1976 that the Anti-Inflation Board (AIB) began to roll back workers' wages. The employees of Irving Pulp and Paper, members of the Canadian Paper Workers Union, were among the first to experience the roll backs implemented by the AIB. The paper workers were required to give back to the employer 9.8% of their previous wage increase the first year, and 11% the second year. The Atlantic Sugar Refinery workers of the Bakery and Confectionary Workers International Union of America soon felt the burden as well. The majority of workers within Saint John were influenced by the AIB by January 1976. On February 5, 1976, the Saint John District and the Labour Council held a conference to plan an organized opposition to the AIB. Fifty-two people came to the meeting as representatives of twenty-six unions in Saint John. The council was led by the Labour Council president, George Vair. They began by educating those present on wage control legislation, but swiftly transitioned into rallying and demonstrating in opposition throughout the city. Five thousand marched from numerous ends of the town to King Square. All major industries in Saint John were shut down.<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian workers strike against wage controls, 1976|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/canadian-workers-strike-against-wage-controls-1976|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===The Irving Oil Refinery strike, 1994-96===\nOn May 12, 1994, at 4:30 pm, members of Local 691 of the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers (CEP) union at the Irving Oil Ltd. Refinery went on strike. At this time the refinery's management took over its operations. Irving had argued the refinery might have to shut down and had to bring in a bevy of rollbacks to the workers\u2019 pay and benefits and other changes to the collective agreement. Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irving\u2019s demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights that have been in decline across North America.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Steuter|first1=Erin|last2=Martin|first2=Geoff|title=The Myth of the Competitive Challenge: The Irving Oil Refinery Strike, 1994\u201396 and the Canadian Petroleum Industry|url=http://spe.library.utoronto.ca/index.php/spe/article/view/6728|accessdate=May 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Uptown Saint John, from Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Looking east on the Saint John Throughway, right before the Harbour Bridge and the now closed (since 2011) toll plaza]]\n[[File:June 2009 Saint John Transit Bus.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Saint John Transit]] bus in uptown]]\n\nAir service into Saint John is provided by the [[Saint John Airport|Saint John Airport/A\u00e9roport de Saint-Jean]], near Loch Lomond {{convert|8|NM|lk=in}} east northeast of the central business district<ref name=\"CFS\">{{CFS}}</ref> or approximately {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} by road northeast of the city centre.

Route 1 extends west to [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], and northeast towards [[Moncton, New Brunswick|Moncton]]. A second major highway, [[New Brunswick Route 7|Route 7]], connects Saint John with [[Fredericton]]. There are two main road crossings over the Saint John River: the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] and the [[Reversing Falls Bridge]], approximately {{convert|1|nmi|km|lk=in}} upstream.\n\nThe [[Reversing Falls Railway Bridge]] carries rail traffic for the [[New Brunswick Southern Railway]] on the route from Saint John to [[Maine]]. Saint John was serviced by the [[Atlantic (train)|\"Atlantic\" Line]] of [[Via Rail]] passenger service. Passenger rail service in Saint John was discontinued in December 1994, although the [[Canadian National Railway]] and New Brunswick Southern Railway continue to provide freight service.\n\n[[Bay Ferries]] operates a ferry service, {{MV|Fundy Rose}}, across the Bay of Fundy to [[Digby, Nova Scotia]].

In November 2012, Acadian Lines ceased operations.\n\n==Culture==\nThe presence of Irish, British and French heritage is very apparent along with maritime traditions. Saint John's economy has long ties to the fisheries and shipbuilding, and is known for the ''Marco Polo'' as its flagship vessel. However, the city's economy has begun a transition from resource-based sectors and manufacturing to include growing IT and research sectors. The city has always been a traditional hub for the arts on the east coast, boasting many notable artists, actors and musicians, including [[Walter Pidgeon]], [[Donald Sutherland]], [[Louis B. Mayer]], and [[Miller Brittain]].\n\nWhat is considered the golden age of the Saint John arts community was during the post-war era from 1940 to 1970 when the city produced renowned artists and writers such as poet [[Clara Kathleen Smith| Kay Smith]], painters [[Jack Humphrey]], Miller Brittain, [[Bruno Bobak]], Fred Ross, and sculptor [[John Hooper (sculptor)|John Hooper]] and folk-singer Tom Connors. Poet Bliss Carman once wrote about Saint John, \"All the beauty and mystery Of life were there, adventure bold, Youth, and the glamour of the sea, And all its sorrows old.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Saint John: City of Firsts |url=https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1950/6/15/saint-john-city-of-firsts |publisher=Maclean's}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Saint John, NB, historical Church (Brennans) St..jpg|thumb|Saint John is known for its pub and restaurant scene throughout uptown.

Working class fishers, labourers and shipbuilders carried Maritime traditions and folk songs with kitchen parties and outdoor gatherings. But musical high-culture was captured by the wealthy. New Brunswick's solicitor-general 1784\u20131808, Ward Chipman Sr was known to have fancy soir\u00e9es at his home with all the latest songs from London. A notable Loyalist musician, Stephen Humbert, moved in 1783 from New Jersey to Saint John and opened a Sacred Vocal Music School. In 1801 Humbert published Union Harmony, the first Canadian music book in English. The Mechanics' Institute, built in 1840, was the first large-scale platform for comic opera and concerts. In 1950 The Saint John Symphony was founded by Kelsey Jones; by 1983 the organization became [[Symphony New Brunswick]].

Prior to 1950 it was known as Moosepath Park.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Commons unbsj 003.JPG|thumb|The Commons at the University of New Brunswick]]\nIn 1964, the [[University of New Brunswick]] created UNB Saint John in buildings throughout the uptown CBD. In 1968 UNBSJ opened a new campus in the city's Tucker Park neighbourhood. This campus has undergone expansion over the years and is the fastest growing component of the UNB system with many new buildings constructed from the 1970s to the first decade of the 21st century. A trend in recent years has been a growth in the number of international students. The city also hosts a [[New Brunswick Community College]] campus in the East End of the city. There has also been a satellite campus of [[Dalhousie Medical School]] added within the UNBSJ campus in 2010, instructing 30 medical students each year.\n\nIn the fall of 2007, a report commissioned by the provincial government recommended UNBSJ and the NBCC be reformed and consolidated into a new polytechnic post-secondary institute. The proposal immediately came under heavy criticism and led to the organizing of several protests in the uptown area, citing the diminishment of UNB as a nationally accredited university, the reduction in accessibility to receive degrees \u2013 and these are only a couple of the reasons why the community was enraged by the recommendation. Support for keeping UNBSJ as it was, and expanding the university under its current structure, fell slightly below 90%. Seeing too much political capital would be lost, and several Saint John MPs were likely not to support the initiative if the policies recommended by the report were legislated, the government abandoned the commission's report and created an intra-provincial post-secondary commission.\n\nSaint John is served by two school boards: [[Anglophone South School District]] schools and [[Francophone Sud School District]] (based out of [[Dieppe, New Brunswick|Dieppe]], [[New Brunswick]]) for the city's only Francophone school, [[\u00c9cole Samuel-de-Champlain|Centre-Scolaire-Communautaire Samuel-de-Champlain]]. Saint John is also home to Canada's oldest publicly funded school, [[Saint John High School]]. The other high schools in the city are [[Harbour View High School]], [[St. Malachy's High School]], and [[Simonds High School]].\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Saint John, New Brunswick}}\n\n==Twin/sister cities==\n\n* {{flagicon|SLO}} [[Koper]], Slovenia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/iiapublications/SmartBook/Documents/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31/abbd6fd3-4149-4206-8731-eb53a3ffdc31.pdf |title=Report:  Visit of the Honourable No\u00ebl A.

Some were songs that she wrote herself, while others were new arrangements of other standards, and others had been written especially for the singer. Her first hit song in America was her rendition of [[George Gershwin]]'s \"[[I Loves You, Porgy]]\" (1958). It peaked at number 18 on the ''Billboard'' magazine Hot 100 chart.<ref name=\"loves100\">{{cite web |title=Nina Simone I Loves You, Porgy Chart History |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/nina-simonbrownhart-history/hot-100/song/572536 |website=Billboard |accessdate=7 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring that same period Simone recorded \"[[My Baby Just Cares for Me]]\", which would become her biggest success years later, in 1987, after it was featured in a 1986 [[Chanel No. 5]] perfume commercial.<ref>[http://inside.chanel.com/en/#!/no5/advertising advertising].

He is considered \"one of the most important personalities of the Macedonian jazz scene\", known for his solo and group work as the Simon Kiselicki group, as well as his work in Macedonian bands Klerzo and La Colonie Volvox, and his contributions across Europe and the Balkans. Kiselicki is also one of the first musicians who brought jazz music to Macedonian stages and clubs, at the start of the 90s.\n\nSimon has composed seven albums, one of which was released by the [[Skopje Jazz Festival]], as well as having arranged for other artists' projects including [[Bodan Arsovski]]'s 'Broken Beats' album. Kiselicki has performed at European festivals including [[Exit Festival]], [[Skopje Jazz Festival]], Petrovac Jazz Festival, Glazba i Rec Festival Cavtat, Kumanovo Jazz Festival, SOSFest, Peace Unlimited Festival, and more. He is also known for his ten-year contribution to the Dubrovnik jazz scene at the Hard Jazz Cafe Troubadour, considered as one of Dubrovnik's most influential jazz musicians.\n\nSimon plays thirteen instruments in total: piano, keyboards, vibraphone, xylophone, timpani, drums, congas, bongos, guitar, [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], bass guitar, [[duduk]] and the recorder. Piano being his primary instrument, Simon has also recorded material performing the duduk on several albums.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nSimon Kiselicki was born on 25 October 1974 in [[Skopje, Macedonia]] (then [[Yugoslavia]]). At a young age his parents bought him a melodica which he constantly played, but was fed up of having to blow through the mouthpiece to receive a note. His solution was to sellotape a hairdryer to the mouthpiece so that the sound could be achieved without pauses, and ended up burning the melodica. His parents realised that Simon was better off learning the piano. Simon's initial introduction to music was through the drums, but later showed greater interest in the piano. He studied piano, percussion and theory at Ilija Nikolovski - Luj high school. In 1994, Simon would study classical composition under the guide of Goce Kolarovski, and studied jazz piano and jazz harmony in Ilija Peovski's class at Goce Delvec University.\n\nAt the start of the 90s, Kiselicki was one of the first musicians to bring jazz to Macedonian clubs, alongside musicians Djole Grujovski (guitarist), Goce Stevkovski (drummer), Darko Muchev (bassist), Marija Dimitrijevic (vocalist) and Dzemal Cakic (trumpeter). Jazz had been played before in Macedonia, but these musicians were the first to make jazz performances official in clubs and on stages.\n\nSimon's first composition 'Suite for Piano'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MdELutiMyQ|title=Simon Kiselicki - SUITE for piano|first=|last=Socom Sokom|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> was presented in 1995 (performed by Marjana Nikolovska) on Macedonian Radio Television (MRTV) for the Days of Macedonian Music Festival (Denovi Na Makedonska Muzika).\n\n===Klerzo===\nIn 1995, at 21 years of age, Simon initiated the second formation of Macedonian prog-rock group [[Klerzo]] with colleagues Sasho Gigov - Gis (vocalist), Goce Stevkovski (drummer), Darko Muchev (bassist), Goran Bugarinovski (flautist) and Sasho Spasovski (guitarist). The group, highly celebrated, performed across Macedonia, performing hits such as 'Pirunika' and 'Sonce', functioning for about two years.\n\n===Night and Day, Ezgija Orchestra===\nIn 1997 Simon began collaborating with [[Bodan Arsovski]] (former Leb i Sol bassist) and the Ezgija Orchestra for his album 'Broken Beats',<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dr6ihpjXHI Broken Beats, ''Devilish Game'' example]</ref> performing at EthnoFest Neum (1998) and Kursumli An. In the meantime, he would become the music manager for Lady Blue Jazz Club, and performed with his jazz quintet 'Night and Day' with Goce Stevkovski, Darko Muchev, Goce Micanov on the saxophone and Goce Dimitrovski on the trumpet.

La Colonie Volvox was commissioned to perform at the [[European Parliament]] in Brussels. The band toured Europe during this time, their travels concluding a 5500&nbsp;km journey, and as a result the ''East West and Rest'' album was inspired and composed. In the same year, Simon composed, conducted and arranged for the orchestra of the Macedonian theatrical performance of ''Troilus and Cressida'', which was the biggest theatrical performance recorded in Macedonia, with 120 performers and 4,000 guests. Furthermore, Simon recorded his composition 'Jamajla' from his unreleased album ''Jamajla'' for the ''Jazz from Macedonia 2009''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.simonkiselicki.com/jazz-from-macedonia|title=Simon Kiselicki - Jazz From Macedonia|website=Home - Simon Kiselicki}}</ref> album by Skopje Jazz Festival Records.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Meanwhile, Simon recorded his sixth album ''Same No More'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.simonkiselicki.com/discography|title=Discography - Simon Kiselicki|website=Home - Simon Kiselicki}}</ref>.

Later Simon would collaborate with DMA Music to re-release his albums ''Levitation'' and ''Beneventana''.

He is considered \"one of the most important personalities of the Macedonian jazz scene\", known for his solo and group work as the Simon Kiselicki group, as well as his work in Macedonian bands Klerzo and La Colonie Volvox, and his contributions across Europe and the Balkans. Kiselicki is also one of the first musicians who brought jazz music to Macedonian stages and clubs, at the start of the 90s.\n\nSimon has composed seven albums, one of which was released by the [[Skopje Jazz Festival]], as well as having arranged for other artists' projects including [[Bodan Arsovski]]'s 'Broken Beats' album. Kiselicki has performed at European festivals including [[Exit Festival]], [[Skopje Jazz Festival]], Petrovac Jazz Festival, Glazba i Rec Festival Cavtat, Kumanovo Jazz Festival, SOSFest, Peace Unlimited Festival, and more. He is also known for his ten-year contribution to the Dubrovnik jazz scene at the Hard Jazz Cafe Troubadour, considered as one of Dubrovnik's most influential jazz musicians.\n\nSimon plays thirteen instruments in total: piano, keyboards, vibraphone, xylophone, timpani, drums, congas, bongos, guitar, [[Tambura (instrument)|tambura]], bass guitar, [[duduk]] and the recorder. Piano being his primary instrument, Simon has also recorded material performing the duduk on several albums.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nSimon Kiselicki was born on 25 October 1974 in [[Skopje, Macedonia]] (then [[Yugoslavia]]). At a young age his parents bought him a melodica which he constantly played, but was fed up of having to blow through the mouthpiece to receive a note. His solution was to sellotape a hairdryer to the mouthpiece so that the sound could be achieved without pauses, and ended up burning the melodica. His parents realised that Simon was better off learning the piano. Simon's initial introduction to music was through the drums, but later showed greater interest in the piano. He studied piano, percussion and theory at Ilija Nikolovski - Luj high school. In 1994, Simon would study classical composition under the guide of Goce Kolarovski, and studied jazz piano and jazz harmony in Ilija Peovski's class at Goce Delvec University.\n\nAt the start of the 90s, Kiselicki was one of the first musicians to bring jazz to Macedonian clubs, alongside musicians Djole Grujovski (guitarist), Goce Stevkovski (drummer), Darko Muchev (bassist), Marija Dimitrijevic (vocalist) and Dzemal Cakic (trumpeter). Jazz had been played before in Macedonia, but these musicians were the first to make jazz performances official in clubs and on stages.\n\nSimon's first composition 'Suite for Piano'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MdELutiMyQ|title=Simon Kiselicki - SUITE for piano|first=|last=Socom Sokom|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> was presented in 1995 (performed by Marjana Nikolovska) on Macedonian Radio Television (MRTV) for the Days of Macedonian Music Festival (Denovi Na Makedonska Muzika).\n\n===Klerzo===\nIn 1995, at 21 years of age, Simon initiated the second formation of Macedonian prog-rock group [[Klerzo]] with colleagues Sasho Gigov - Gis (vocalist), Goce Stevkovski (drummer), Darko Muchev (bassist), Goran Bugarinovski (flautist) and Sasho Spasovski (guitarist). The group, highly celebrated, performed across Macedonia, performing hits such as 'Pirunika' and 'Sonce', functioning for about two years.\n\n===Night and Day, Ezgija Orchestra===\nIn 1997 Simon began collaborating with [[Bodan Arsovski]] (former Leb i Sol bassist) and the Ezgija Orchestra for his album 'Broken Beats',<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Dr6ihpjXHI Broken Beats, ''Devilish Game'' example]</ref> performing at EthnoFest Neum (1998) and Kursumli An. In the meantime, he would become the music manager for Lady Blue Jazz Club, and performed with his jazz quintet 'Night and Day' with Goce Stevkovski, Darko Muchev, Goce Micanov on the saxophone and Goce Dimitrovski on the trumpet. Simon's first jazz compositions were recorded for MRTV (produced by [[Ilija Peovski]]), and later Simon applied to study at Peovski's class, learning jazz piano and harmony.\n\n===Beneventan Trio, Hard Jazz Cafe Troubadour===\nIn 1999 Simon travelled to Croatia and found the Hard Jazz Cafe Troubadour in Dubrovnik, under the management of late Marko Breskovic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/croatia/bars/best-bars-in-croatia|title=The 50 best bars in Croatia|website=Time Out Croatia}}</ref> where he would perform every summer for ten years, recognised as one of the jazz musicians responsible for the popularisation and growth of one of the world's most important jazz scene.

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]] ruled by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]]. From the [[constitutional reforms of Augustus| accession of Caesar Augustus]] to the [[military Anarchy| military anarchy of the third century]], it was a [[roman principate| principate]] with [[Roman Italy| Italy]] as [[metropole]] of the [[Roman province| provinces]] and its city of [[Rome]] as sole capital (27 BC \u2013 286 AD). Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis, the empire was forcibly reassembled, then ruled by [[dominate| multiple emperors]] who shared rule over the [[Western Roman Empire]] (based in [[Milan]] and later in [[Ravenna]]) and over the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (based in [[Nicomedia]] and later in [[Constantinople]]). Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD, when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ([[Byzantium]] - [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Byz\u00e1ntion'')  following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of [[Odoacer]] and the subsequent deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]]. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to [[barbarian kingdoms| Germanic kings]], along with the [[hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire]] into the [[Byzantine Empire]], conventionally marks the end of [[Ancient Rome]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe predecessor state of the Roman Empire, the [[Roman Republic]] (which had replaced [[Roman Kingdom |Rome's monarchy]] in the 6th century BC) became severely destabilized in a series of [[Roman civil wars| civil wars]] and political conflicts. In the mid-1st century BC [[Julius Caesar]] was appointed as perpetual [[Roman dictator| dictator]] and then [[Assassination of Julius Caesar| assassinated]] in 44 BC. Civil wars and [[proscriptions]] continued, culminating in [[Final War of the Roman Republic |the victory]] of [[Octavian]], Caesar's adopted son, over [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. The following year Octavian [[Roman Egypt| conquered]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], ending the [[Hellenistic period]] that had begun with the [[Wars of Alexander the Great| conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]] in the 4th century BC. Octavian's power then became unassailable, and in 27 BC the [[Roman Senate]] formally granted him [[imperium| overarching power]] and the new title [[Augustus (honorific)| ''Augustus'']], effectively making him [[List of Roman emperors |the first Roman emperor]].\n\nThe [[History of the Roman Empire |first two centuries of the Empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] (\"Roman Peace\"). Rome reached its greatest [[Borders of the Roman Empire| territorial expanse]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117 AD). A period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of [[Commodus]] (177-192). In the 3rd century the Empire [[Crisis of the Third Century|underwent a crisis]] that threatened its existence, as the [[Gallic Empire]] and [[Palmyrene Empire]] broke away from the Roman state, and a series of [[Barracks emperor| short-lived emperors]], often from the legions, led the empire. The empire was reunified under [[Aurelian]] ({{reign | 270 | 275}}). In an effort to stabilize the Empire, [[Diocletian]] set up two different imperial courts in the [[Greek East and Latin West]] in 286. [[State church of the Roman Empire| Christians rose to positions of power]] in the 4th century following the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313. Shortly after, the [[Migration Period]], involving large invasions by [[Germanic-Roman contacts| Germanic peoples]] and by the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]], led to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire| decline of the Western Roman Empire]]. With the [[fall of Ravenna]] to the [[Heruli| Germanic Herulians]] and the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus |deposition]] of [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476 AD by [[Odoacer]], the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed \u2013 the (Eastern Roman) Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] formally abolished it in [[480 AD]]. Nonetheless, some states in the territories of the former Western Roman Empire would later claim to have inherited the supreme power of the emperors of Rome, most notably the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Roman Empire, identified by modern historians under the name of the [[History of the Byzantine Empire| Byzantine Empire]], survived for another millennium until the Empire's last remains collapsed when [[Fall of Constantinople| Constantinople fell]] to the [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman Turks]] of Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1453.<ref group=\"n\">The Ottomans sometimes called their state the \"Empire of [[R\u00fbm]]\" ({{lang-ota|\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0646\u0625\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0645|lit= Exalted State of Rome}}). In this sense, it could be argued that a \"Roman\" Empire survived until the early-20th century.

This was the period of the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic]]. Towards the end of this era, in 44 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] was briefly perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] before being [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]]. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC by an army led by [[Mark Antony]] and Caesar's adopted son [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, ending the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]]. In 27 BC the [[Senate and People of Rome]] made Octavian ''[[princeps]]'' (\"first citizen\") with [[proconsul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'', thus beginning the [[Principate]] (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the name \"[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]\" (\"the venerated\"). Though the old [[constitutional]] machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it. Although the republic stood in name, contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome.<ref>Syme, Ronald (1939) ''The Roman Revolution''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Since his rule ended a century of civil wars and began an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity, he was so loved that he came to hold the power of a monarch ''[[de facto]]'' if not ''[[de jure]]''. During the years of his rule, a new constitutional order emerged (in part organically and in part by design), so that, upon his death, this new constitutional order operated as before when [[Tiberius]] was accepted as the new emperor.\n\n===The Pax Romana===\n{{main|Pax Romana}}\n{{multiple image|total_width=600\n|image1=Nerva Tivoli Massimo.jpg\n|image2=Traianus Glyptothek Munich 72.jpg\n|image3=Bust Hadrian Musei Capitolini MC817.jpg\n|image4=Antoninus Pius (Museo del Prado) 01.jpg\n|image5=Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png\n|footer=The so-called [[Five Good Emperors]] (from left to right): [[Nerva]], [[Trajan]], [[Hadrian]], [[Antoninus Pius]] and [[Marcus Aurelius]]\n}}\nThe 200 years that began with Augustus's rule is traditionally regarded as the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' (\"Roman Peace\"). During this period, the cohesion of the empire was furthered by a degree of social stability and economic prosperity that Rome had never before experienced.

Female roles were played by men in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] (''[[travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'').

The circumstances under which Seneca's tragedies were performed are however unclear; scholarly conjectures range from minimally staged readings to full production pageants.

Vergil wrote the ''[[Aeneid]]'', creating a national epic for Rome in the manner of the [[Homeric epics]] of Greece. Horace perfected the use of [[Greek lyric]] [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day [[Constan\u021ba]], Romania), where he remained to the end of his life. Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' was a continuous poem of fifteen books weaving together [[Greco-Roman mythology]] from the [[Greek mythology#Cosmogony and cosmology|creation of the universe]] to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification of Julius Caesar]]. Ovid's versions of [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] became one of the primary sources of later [[classical mythology]], and his work was so influential in the [[medieval literature|Middle Ages]] that the 12th and 13th centuries have been called the \"Age of Ovid.\"<ref>''Aetas Ovidiana''; Charles McNelis, \"Ovidian Strategies in Early Imperial Literature,\" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 397.</ref>\n\nThe principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], whose account of [[founding of Rome|Rome's founding]] and early history became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. [[Vitruvius]]'s book ''[[De Architectura]]'', the only complete work on architecture to survive from antiquity, also belongs to this period.\n\nLatin writers were immersed in the [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literary tradition]], and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists [[Persius]] and [[Juvenal]]. The [[satires of Juvenal|poetry of Juvenal]] offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.\n\nThe period from the mid-1st century through the mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the \"Silver Age\" of Latin literature. Under Nero, disillusioned writers reacted to Augustanism.<ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 8.</ref> The three leading writers\u2014[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] the philosopher, dramatist, and tutor of Nero; [[Lucan]], his nephew, who turned [[Caesar's civil war]] into [[Pharsalia|an epic poem]]; and the novelist [[Petronius]] ''([[Satyricon]])''\u2014all committed suicide after incurring the emperor's displeasure.

The ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' of the elder Pliny, who died during disaster relief efforts in the wake of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]], is a vast collection on flora and fauna, gems and minerals, climate, medicine, freaks of nature, works of art, and [[antiquarian]] lore.

Other major Greek authors of the Empire include the biographer and antiquarian [[Plutarch]], the geographer [[Strabo]], and the rhetorician and satirist [[Lucian]]. Popular [[Ancient Greek novel|Greek romance novels]] were part of the development of long-form fiction works, represented in Latin by the ''Satyricon'' of Petronius and ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' of [[Apuleius]].\n\nFrom the 2nd to the 4th centuries, the Christian authors who would become the Latin [[Church Fathers]] were in active dialogue with the [[Classical tradition]], within which they had been educated. [[Tertullian]], a convert to Christianity from [[Africa province|Roman Africa]], was the contemporary of Apuleius and one of the earliest prose authors to establish a distinctly Christian voice.

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining good relations with the gods ''([[pax deorum]])''. The archaic religion believed to have been handed down from the earliest [[kings of Rome]] was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', \"the way of the ancestors\" or \"tradition\", viewed as central to Roman identity. There was no principle analogous to \"[[separation of church and state]]\". The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same social pool of men who held public office, and in the Imperial era, the [[Pontifex Maximus]] was the emperor.\n\nRoman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', \"I give that you might give.\" Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.<ref name=r4>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. [[Apuleius]] (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while.<ref>[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1</ref><ref>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 279.</ref> The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. As the first Roman emperor, Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. [[Vota pro salute rei publicae|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (''[[divus]]'') by vote of the Senate. [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], influenced by [[Hellenistic ruler cult]], became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as the Augustan military settlement at [[Najran]], in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran was possibly known later as the \"Kaaba of Najran\": \u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-'Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; \"Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam\"), Baghdad, 1955\u20131983; P.

The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity. In Gaul, the power of the [[druid]]s was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. At the same time, however, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted (''[[interpretatio romana]]'') within the context of Imperial theology, and a new [[Gallo-Roman religion]] coalesced, with its capital at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] in [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon, France).

As a polity it included large territorial holdings around the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in [[Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]] ruled by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]]. From the [[constitutional reforms of Augustus| accession of Caesar Augustus]] to the [[military Anarchy| military anarchy of the third century]], it was a [[roman principate| principate]] with [[Roman Italy| Italy]] as [[metropole]] of the [[Roman province| provinces]] and its city of [[Rome]] as sole capital (27 BC \u2013 286 AD). Although fragmented briefly during the military crisis, the empire was forcibly reassembled, then ruled by [[dominate| multiple emperors]] who shared rule over the [[Western Roman Empire]] (based in [[Milan]] and later in [[Ravenna]]) and over the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (based in [[Nicomedia]] and later in [[Constantinople]]). Rome remained the nominal capital of both parts until 476 AD, when it sent the imperial insignia to Constantinople ([[Byzantium]] - [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: \u0392\u03c5\u03b6\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Byz\u00e1ntion'')  following the capture of Ravenna by the barbarians of [[Odoacer]] and the subsequent deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]]. The [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] to [[barbarian kingdoms| Germanic kings]], along with the [[hellenization of the Eastern Roman Empire]] into the [[Byzantine Empire]], conventionally marks the end of [[Ancient Rome]] and the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThe predecessor state of the Roman Empire, the [[Roman Republic]] (which had replaced [[Roman Kingdom |Rome's monarchy]] in the 6th century BC) became severely destabilized in a series of [[Roman civil wars| civil wars]] and political conflicts. In the mid-1st century BC [[Julius Caesar]] was appointed as perpetual [[Roman dictator| dictator]] and then [[Assassination of Julius Caesar| assassinated]] in 44 BC. Civil wars and [[proscriptions]] continued, culminating in [[Final War of the Roman Republic |the victory]] of [[Octavian]], Caesar's adopted son, over [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC. The following year Octavian [[Roman Egypt| conquered]] [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], ending the [[Hellenistic period]] that had begun with the [[Wars of Alexander the Great| conquests]] of [[Alexander the Great]] of [[Macedon]] in the 4th century BC. Octavian's power then became unassailable, and in 27 BC the [[Roman Senate]] formally granted him [[imperium| overarching power]] and the new title [[Augustus (honorific)| ''Augustus'']], effectively making him [[List of Roman emperors |the first Roman emperor]].\n\nThe [[History of the Roman Empire |first two centuries of the Empire]] saw a period of unprecedented stability and prosperity known as the [[Pax Romana]] (\"Roman Peace\"). Rome reached its greatest [[Borders of the Roman Empire| territorial expanse]] during the reign of [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117 AD). A period of increasing trouble and decline began with the reign of [[Commodus]] (177-192). In the 3rd century the Empire [[Crisis of the Third Century|underwent a crisis]] that threatened its existence, as the [[Gallic Empire]] and [[Palmyrene Empire]] broke away from the Roman state, and a series of [[Barracks emperor| short-lived emperors]], often from the legions, led the empire. The empire was reunified under [[Aurelian]] ({{reign | 270 | 275}}). In an effort to stabilize the Empire, [[Diocletian]] set up two different imperial courts in the [[Greek East and Latin West]] in 286. [[State church of the Roman Empire| Christians rose to positions of power]] in the 4th century following the [[Edict of Milan]] of 313. Shortly after, the [[Migration Period]], involving large invasions by [[Germanic-Roman contacts| Germanic peoples]] and by the [[Huns]] of [[Attila]], led to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire| decline of the Western Roman Empire]]. With the [[fall of Ravenna]] to the [[Heruli| Germanic Herulians]] and the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus |deposition]] of [[Romulus Augustulus]] in 476 AD by [[Odoacer]], the Western Roman Empire finally collapsed \u2013 the (Eastern Roman) Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] formally abolished it in [[480 AD]]. Nonetheless, some states in the territories of the former Western Roman Empire would later claim to have inherited the supreme power of the emperors of Rome, most notably the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Eastern Roman Empire, identified by modern historians under the name of the [[History of the Byzantine Empire| Byzantine Empire]], survived for another millennium until the Empire's last remains collapsed when [[Fall of Constantinople| Constantinople fell]] to the [[Ottoman Empire| Ottoman Turks]] of Sultan [[Mehmed II]] in 1453.<ref group=\"n\">The Ottomans sometimes called their state the \"Empire of [[R\u00fbm]]\" ({{lang-ota|\u062f\u0648\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0644\u0646\u0625\u0647 \u0631\u0648\u0645|lit= Exalted State of Rome}}). In this sense, it could be argued that a \"Roman\" Empire survived until the early-20th century.

This was the period of the [[Crisis of the Roman Republic]]. Towards the end of this era, in 44 BC, [[Julius Caesar]] was briefly perpetual [[Roman dictator|dictator]] before being [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]]. The faction of his assassins was driven from Rome and defeated at the [[Battle of Philippi]] in 42 BC by an army led by [[Mark Antony]] and Caesar's adopted son [[Augustus|Octavian]]. Antony and Octavian's division of the Roman world between themselves did not last and Octavian's forces defeated those of [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]] at the [[Battle of Actium]] in 31 BC, ending the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]]. In 27 BC the [[Senate and People of Rome]] made Octavian ''[[princeps]]'' (\"first citizen\") with [[proconsul]]ar ''[[imperium]]'', thus beginning the [[Principate]] (the first epoch of Roman imperial history, usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD), and gave him the name \"[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]\" (\"the venerated\"). Though the old [[constitutional]] machinery remained in place, Augustus came to predominate it. Although the republic stood in name, contemporaries of Augustus knew it was just a veil and that Augustus had all meaningful authority in Rome.<ref>Syme, Ronald (1939) ''The Roman Revolution''.

Such masks were occasionally also specific to a particular role, and an actor could then play multiple roles merely by switching masks. Female roles were played by men in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] (''[[travesti (theatre)|travesti]]'').

The circumstances under which Seneca's tragedies were performed are however unclear; scholarly conjectures range from minimally staged readings to full production pageants. More popular than literary theatre was the genre-defying ''mimus'' theatre, which featured scripted scenarios with free improvisation, risqu\u00e9 language and jokes, sex scenes, action sequences, and political satire, along with dance numbers, juggling, acrobatics, tightrope walking, striptease, and [[dancing bear]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/4350348  |jstor=4350348  |title=Mime: The Missing Link in Roman Literary History  |journal=The Classical World  |volume=82  |issue=3  |pages=153\u2013163  |year=1989  |last1=Fantham  |first1=R.

They might have launched a major effort to suppress pagan learning as a danger to the Church and its doctrines.\nBut they did not. Why not? \nPerhaps it was in the slow dissemination of Christianity. After four centuries as members of a distinct religion, Christians had learned to live with Greek secular learning and to utilize it for their own benefit. Their education was heavily infiltrated by Latin and Greek pagan literature and philosophy\u2026 Although Christians found certain aspects of pagan culture and learning unacceptable, they did not view them as a cancer to be cut out of the Christian body.<ref>Grant, Edvard.

Vergil wrote the ''[[Aeneid]]'', creating a national epic for Rome in the manner of the [[Homeric epics]] of Greece. Horace perfected the use of [[Greek lyric]] [[Metre (poetry)|metres]] in Latin verse. Ovid's erotic poetry was enormously popular, but ran afoul of the Augustan moral programme; it was one of the ostensible causes for which the emperor exiled him to Tomis (present-day [[Constan\u021ba]], Romania), where he remained to the end of his life. Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' was a continuous poem of fifteen books weaving together [[Greco-Roman mythology]] from the [[Greek mythology#Cosmogony and cosmology|creation of the universe]] to the [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|deification of Julius Caesar]]. Ovid's versions of [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] became one of the primary sources of later [[classical mythology]], and his work was so influential in the [[medieval literature|Middle Ages]] that the 12th and 13th centuries have been called the \"Age of Ovid.\"<ref>''Aetas Ovidiana''; Charles McNelis, \"Ovidian Strategies in Early Imperial Literature,\" in ''A Companion to Ovid'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 397.</ref>\n\nThe principal Latin prose author of the Augustan age is the [[Roman historiography|historian]] [[Livy]], whose account of [[founding of Rome|Rome's founding]] and early history became the most familiar version in modern-era literature. [[Vitruvius]]'s book ''[[De Architectura]]'', the only complete work on architecture to survive from antiquity, also belongs to this period.\n\nLatin writers were immersed in the [[ancient Greek literature|Greek literary tradition]], and adapted its forms and much of its content, but Romans regarded satire as a genre in which they surpassed the Greeks. Horace wrote verse satires before fashioning himself as an Augustan court poet, and the early Principate also produced the satirists [[Persius]] and [[Juvenal]]. The [[satires of Juvenal|poetry of Juvenal]] offers a lively curmudgeon's perspective on urban society.\n\nThe period from the mid-1st century through the mid-2nd century has conventionally been called the \"Silver Age\" of Latin literature. Under Nero, disillusioned writers reacted to Augustanism.<ref>[[#Roberts|Roberts]], p. 8.</ref> The three leading writers\u2014[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] the philosopher, dramatist, and tutor of Nero; [[Lucan]], his nephew, who turned [[Caesar's civil war]] into [[Pharsalia|an epic poem]]; and the novelist [[Petronius]] ''([[Satyricon]])''\u2014all committed suicide after incurring the emperor's displeasure.

The Romans thought of themselves as highly religious, and attributed their success as a world power to their collective piety ''([[pietas]])'' in maintaining good relations with the gods ''([[pax deorum]])''. The archaic religion believed to have been handed down from the earliest [[kings of Rome]] was the foundation of the ''[[mos maiorum]]'', \"the way of the ancestors\" or \"tradition\", viewed as central to Roman identity. There was no principle analogous to \"[[separation of church and state]]\". The priesthoods of the state religion were filled from the same social pool of men who held public office, and in the Imperial era, the [[Pontifex Maximus]] was the emperor.\n\nRoman religion was practical and contractual, based on the principle of ''[[do ut des]]'', \"I give that you might give.\" Religion depended on knowledge and the [[orthopraxy|correct practice]] of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life.<ref name=r4>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighbourhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. [[Apuleius]] (2nd century) described the everyday quality of religion in observing how people who passed a cult place might make a vow or a fruit offering, or merely sit for a while.<ref>[[Apuleius]], ''Florides'' 1.1</ref><ref>[[#Rupke|R\u00fcpke]], p. 279.</ref> The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances. In the Imperial era, as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities.\n\nIn the wake of the [[Collapse of the Roman Republic|Republic's collapse]], state religion had adapted to support the new regime of the emperors. As the first Roman emperor, Augustus justified the novelty of one-man rule with a vast programme of religious revivalism and reform. [[Vota pro salute rei publicae|Public vows]] formerly made for the security of the republic now were directed at the wellbeing of the emperor. So-called \"emperor worship\" expanded on a grand scale the traditional Roman [[Roman funerals and burial|veneration of the ancestral dead]] and of the ''[[Genius (mythology)|Genius]]'', the divine [[tutelary deity|tutelary]] of every individual. Upon death, an emperor could be made a state divinity (''[[divus]]'') by vote of the Senate. [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|Imperial cult]], influenced by [[Hellenistic ruler cult]], became one of the major ways Rome advertised its presence in the provinces and cultivated shared cultural identity and loyalty throughout the Empire. Cultural precedent in the Eastern provinces facilitated a rapid dissemination of Imperial cult, extending as far as the Augustan military settlement at [[Najran]], in present-day [[Saudi Arabia]].<ref>The ''[[caesareum]]'' at Najaran was possibly known later as the \"Kaaba of Najran\": \u062c\u0648\u0627\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a, \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0627\u0631\u064a\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 (Jawad Ali, ''Al-Mufassal fi Tarikh Al-'Arab Qabl Al-Islam''; \"Commentary on the History of the Arabs Before Islam\"), Baghdad, 1955\u20131983; P.

The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional morality and unity. In Gaul, the power of the [[druid]]s was checked, first by forbidding Roman citizens to belong to the order, and then by banning druidism altogether. At the same time, however, Celtic traditions were reinterpreted (''[[interpretatio romana]]'') within the context of Imperial theology, and a new [[Gallo-Roman religion]] coalesced, with its capital at the [[Sanctuary of the Three Gauls]] in [[Lugdunum]] (present-day Lyon, France). The sanctuary established precedent for Western cult as a form of Roman-provincial identity.<ref>Fishwick, Duncan (1991).

A.|last=Wage}}</ref>), and read voraciously; the [[Tachtigers]] influenced him greatly, and he became a neo-Romantic of sorts. In addition, he got more critical of his family's Protestantism, but while he would become anti-church, he never became irreligious. In this time period he became friends with [[Carel Adama van Scheltema]] and with painter [[Jan Vogelaar]], who soon became a mentor to Van der Leeuw.<ref name=schipper/>\n\nHe studied law at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]] for practical purposes; his parents' financial situation was a concern to him, and law offered good social prospects. This proved motivation enough, and he graduated on time, in 1902, and then worked briefly at the city archives of Delft.<ref name=schipper/> In 1903 he started as ''chef de bureau''<ref name=wage/> at a life insurance company in [[Dordrecht]]. That same year he married his school friend Antonia Johanna Kipp; they had become engaged in 1899. Their marriage remained childless. She is present in many of his early poems and was much interested in mysticism and spirituality; she is credited with shifting Van der Leeuw from skepticism to religiosity,<ref name=schipper/> because of her non-dogmatic though Christian-inflected beliefs.<ref name=wage/>\n\nVan der Leeuw hated his job. He had agreed to take the accountancy exam and had to take classes for that; combined with the full work day he had little time left for creative work. In March 1907 he resigned his position, on his doctor's advice, for health reasons, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise: now he was free to pursue his calling. On top of that, his wife's father died, shortly followed by her mother, and he and his wife moved to [[Voorburg]], where he could devote himself to playing the violin, reading, and writing. They lived there until his death at age 54.<ref name=schipper>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]]|accessdate=2 January 2019|url=https://www.digibron.nl/search/detail/012e9d1b05d4aa4e283fc4b2/aart-van-der-leeuw-bescheiden-speelman|language=nl|date=16 April 1981|title= Aart van der Leeuw, bescheiden speelman: Neo-romanticus was lichamelijk zwak, maar geestelijk sterk|first=J.|last=Schipper}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1931 he fell ill with [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]], and never recovered. He died on 17 April, and was buried in Voorburg, with a modest ceremony. A family member read his poem \"Mijn vaders tuinen\" at the gravesite.<ref name=schipper/>\n\n== Work==\nThe novella ''Sint-Veit'' was his literary debut; published in 1908 in [[Albert Verwey]]'s magazine ''De Beweging'', it had been written years before, in Dordrecht. He published also in ''[[De Gids]]'' and ''[[De Nieuwe Gids]]'', but was less interested in the naturalist writers than he was in those of a more symbolist quality. Van der Leeuw began publishing poetry in 1909 and until 1926 published four collections. He also published three collections of short stories, four prose fiction books, critical prose, and some translations. Very much isolated in Voorburg and loath to mingle in the literary world, his friend Van Schendel helped him prepare a number of his books for publication, including ''Liederen en Balladen'' (1910), ''Kinderland'' (1913), and ''Herscheppingen'' (1916). He traveled abroad only when his friends gifted him a trip to Italy for his 50th birthday, a trip he credited with prompting him to write ''Ik en mijn speelman'', a typically neo-Romanticist book that thematizes the relationship between beauty and reality (influenced, Van der Leeuw said, by 17th-c spiritual writer and mystic [[Thomas Traherne]]) and chooses beauty over reality. In his next book, ''De kleine Rudolf'' (1930), there is an attempt to reconcile dream and reality, and now reality is accepted, with romanticism being sought in life, not outside of it. In 1928 he was awarded the [[Lucy B. en C.W. van der Hoogtprijs|C.W. van der Hoogtprijs]] by the [[Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde]] for ''Het aardsche paradijs'' (1927).<ref name=schipper/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''Sint Veit'' (1908)\n* ''Liederen en balladen'' (1911)\n* ''Kinderland'' (1914)\n* ''Herscheppingen'' (1916)\n* ''Sint-Veit en andere vertellingen'' (1919)\n* ''De mythe van een jeugd'' (1921)\n* ''Opvluchten'' (1922)\n* ''De gezegenden'' (1923)\n* ''Vluchtige begroetingen'' (1925)\n* ''De zwerftochten van Odysseus'' (1926)\n* ''Het aardsche paradijs'' (1927)\n* ''Ik en mijn speelman'' (1927)\n* ''De kleine Rudolf'' (1930)\n* ''De opdracht'' (1930)\n* ''Verspreid proza'', nagelaten (1932)\n* ''Die van hun leven vertelden'' (1934)\n* ''Vertellingen'' (1935)\n* ''Momenten van schoonheid en bezinning'' (1947)\n* ''Verzamelde gedichten'' (1950)\n* ''De briefwisseling tussen P.N. van Eyck en Aart van der Leeuw'', bezorgd door Piet Delen (1973)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Dutch writers]]\n[[Category:1876 births]]\n[[Category:1931 deaths]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Aart van der Leeuw.jpg|thumb|right|Aart van der Leeuw, 1899; photo by Carel Adama van Scheltema.]]\n'''Aart van der Leeuw''' (23 June 1876 \u2013 17 April 1931) was a Dutch writer of prose fiction and poetry.

In this time period he became friends with [[Carel Adama van Scheltema]] and with painter [[Jan Vogelaar]], who soon became a mentor to Van der Leeuw.<ref name=schipper/>\n\nHe studied law at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]] for practical purposes; his parents' financial situation was a concern to him, and law offered good social prospects. This proved motivation enough, and he graduated on time, in 1902, and then worked briefly at the city archives of Delft.<ref name=schipper/> In 1903 he started as ''chef de bureau''<ref name=wage/> at a life insurance company in [[Dordrecht]]. That same year he married his school friend Antonia Johanna Kipp; they had become engaged in 1899. Their marriage remained childless. She is present in many of his early poems and was much interested in mysticism and spirituality; she is credited with shifting Van der Leeuw from skepticism to religiosity,<ref name=schipper/> because of her non-dogmatic though Christian-inflected beliefs.<ref name=wage/>\n\nVan der Leeuw hated his job. He had agreed to take the accountancy exam and had to take classes for that; combined with the full work day he had little time left for creative work. In March of 1907 he resigned his position, on his doctor's advice, for health reasons, but this turned out to be a blessing in disguise: now he was free to pursue his calling. On top of that, his wife's father died, shortly followed by her mother, and he and his wife moved to [[Voorburg]], where he could devote himself to playing the violin, reading, and writing. They lived there until his death at age 54.<ref name=schipper>{{cite news|newspaper=[[Reformatorisch Dagblad]]|accessdate=2 January 2019|url=https://www.digibron.nl/search/detail/012e9d1b05d4aa4e283fc4b2/aart-van-der-leeuw-bescheiden-speelman|language=nl|date=16 April 1981|title= Aart van der Leeuw, bescheiden speelman: Neo-romanticus was lichamelijk zwak, maar geestelijk sterk|first=J.|last=Schipper}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1931 he fell ill with [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]], and never recovered. He died on 17 April, and was buried in Voorburg, with a modest ceremony. A family member read his poem \"Mijn vaders tuinen\" at the gravesite.<ref name=schipper/>\n\n== Work==\nThe novella ''Sint-Veit'' was his literary debut; published in 1908 in [[Albert Verwey]]'s magazine ''De Beweging'', it had been written years before, in Dordrecht. He published also in ''[[De Gids]]'' and ''[[De Nieuwe Gids]]'', but was less interested in the naturalist writers than he was in those of a more symbolist quality. Van der Leeuw began publishing poetry in 1909 and until 1926 published four collections. He also published three collections of short stories, four prose fiction books, critical prose, and some translations. Very much isolated in Voorburg and loath to mingle in the literary world, his friend Van Schendel helped him prepare a number of his books for publication, including ''Liederen en Balladen'' (1910), ''Kinderland'' (1913), and ''Herscheppingen'' (1916). He traveled abroad only when his friends gifted him a trip to Italy for his 50th birthday, a trip he credited with prompting him to write ''Ik en mijn speelman'', a typically neo-Romanticist book that thematizes the relationship between beauty and reality (influenced, Van der Leeuw said, by 17th-c spiritual writer and mystic [[Thomas Traherne]]) and chooses beauty over reality. In his next book, ''De kleine Rudolf'' (1930), there is an attempt to reconcile dream and reality, and now reality is accepted, with romanticism being sought in life, not outside of it. In 1928 he was awarded the [[Lucy B. en C.W. van der Hoogtprijs|C.W. van der Hoogtprijs]] by the [[Maatschappij der Nederlandse Letterkunde]] for ''Het aardsche paradijs'' (1927).<ref name=schipper/>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* ''Sint Veit'' (1908)\n* ''Liederen en balladen'' (1911)\n* ''Kinderland'' (1914)\n* ''Herscheppingen'' (1916)\n* ''Sint-Veit en andere vertellingen'' (1919)\n* ''De mythe van een jeugd'' (1921)\n* ''Opvluchten'' (1922)\n* ''De gezegenden'' (1923)\n* ''Vluchtige begroetingen'' (1925)\n* ''De zwerftochten van Odysseus'' (1926)\n* ''Het aardsche paradijs'' (1927)\n* ''Ik en mijn speelman'' (1927)\n* ''De kleine Rudolf'' (1930)\n* ''De opdracht'' (1930)\n* ''Verspreid proza'', nagelaten (1932)\n* ''Die van hun leven vertelden'' (1934)\n* ''Vertellingen'' (1935)\n* ''Momenten van schoonheid en bezinning'' (1947)\n* ''Verzamelde gedichten'' (1950)\n* ''De briefwisseling tussen P.N. van Eyck en Aart van der Leeuw'', bezorgd door Piet Delen (1973)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Dutch writers]]\n[[Category:1876 births]]\n[[Category:1931 deaths]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aart_van_der_Leeuw"}
