With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a [[Web server|server]] asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.<ref name=\"wrox\">{{cite book | url=http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-303217.html | title=Beginning Ajax | accessdate=24 June 2008 | publisher=wrox | date=March 2007 | first=Chris | last=Ullman | isbn=978-0-470-10675-4 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705101852/http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-303217.html | archivedate=5 July 2008  | url-status= live}}</ref> In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [[JSON]] instead of XML.\n\nAjax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage can then be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display\u2014and allow the user to interact with\u2014the new information. The built-in [[XMLHttpRequest]] object, or since 2017 the new \"fetch()\" function within JavaScript, is commonly used to execute Ajax on webpages allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways.\n\n== History ==\nIn the early-to-mid 1990s, most [[World Wide Web|Web]] sites were based on complete HTML pages. Each user action required that a complete new page be loaded from the server. This process was inefficient, as reflected by the user experience: all page content disappeared, then the new page appeared. Each time the browser reloaded a page because of a partial change, all of the content had to be re-sent, even though only some of the information had changed. This placed additional load on the server and made [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] a limiting factor on performance.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Iframe#Frames|iframe]] tag was introduced by [[Internet Explorer]]; like the [[HTML element#Images and objects|object]] element, it can load or fetch content asynchronously. In 1998, the Microsoft [[Outlook Web Access]] team developed the concept behind the [[XMLHttpRequest]] scripting object.<ref name=\"ALEXHOPMANN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm |title=Article on the history of XMLHTTP by an original developer |publisher=Alexhopmann.com |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623125327/http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It appeared as XMLHTTP in the second version of the [[MSXML]] library,<ref name=\"ALEXHOPMANN\" /><ref name=\"MSDN1\">{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms759148(VS.85).aspx |title=Specification of the IXMLHTTPRequest interface from the Microsoft Developer Network |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |accessdate=2009-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526164820/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms759148(VS.85).aspx |archive-date=26 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> which shipped with [[Internet Explorer 5.0]] in March 1999.<ref name=\"Dutta\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/23/516393.aspx |title=Native XMLHTTPRequest object |accessdate=2006-11-30 |last=Dutta |first=Sunava |date=2006-01-23 |work=IEBlog |publisher=Microsoft |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306164701/http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/23/516393.aspx |archive-date=6 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe functionality of the Windows XMLHTTP [[ActiveX]] control in IE 5 was later implemented by [[Mozilla]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and other browsers as the XMLHttpRequest [[JavaScript]] object.<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web | url=https://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | title=Dynamic HTML and XML: The XMLHttpRequest Object | publisher=Apple Inc. | accessdate=25 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103519/http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | archive-date=9 May 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref> Microsoft adopted the native XMLHttpRequest model as of [[Internet Explorer 7]].

In the article that coined the term Ajax,<ref name=\"garrett\" /><ref name=\"wrox\" /> Jesse James Garrett explained that the following technologies are incorporated:\n* [[HTML]] (or [[XHTML]]) and [[CSS]] for presentation\n* The [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) for dynamic display of and interaction with data\n* [[JSON]] or [[XML]] for the interchange of data, and [[XSLT]] for its manipulation\n* The [[XMLHttpRequest]] object for asynchronous communication\n* [[JavaScript]] to bring these technologies together\n\nSince then, however, there have been a number of developments in the technologies used in an Ajax application, and in the definition of the term Ajax itself. XML is no longer required for data interchange and, therefore, XSLT is no longer required for the manipulation of data. [[JSON|JavaScript Object Notation]] (JSON) is often used as an alternative format for data interchange,<ref name=\"tapestry\">{{cite web | url=http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4.1/ajax/json.html | title=JavaScript Object Notation | publisher=Apache.org | accessdate=4 July 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616113121/http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4.1/ajax/json.html | archivedate=16 June 2008 | url-status=live | df=dmy\n}}</ref> although other formats such as preformatted HTML or plain text can also be used.<ref name=\"devx-json\">{{cite web | url=http://www.devx.com/Webdev/Article/32651 | title=Speed Up Your Ajax-based Apps with JSON | publisher=DevX.com | accessdate=4 July 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704134131/http://www.devx.com/Webdev/Article/32651 | archivedate=4 July 2008 | url-status=dead | df=dmy }}</ref> A variety of popular JavaScript libraries, including JQuery, include abstractions to assist in executing Ajax requests.\n\n== Drawbacks ==\n* Any user whose browser does not support JavaScript or XMLHttpRequest, or has this functionality disabled, will not be able to properly use pages that depend on Ajax. Simple devices (such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]) may not support the required technologies. The only way to let the user carry out functionality is to fall back to non-JavaScript methods. This can be achieved by making sure links and forms can be resolved properly and not relying solely on Ajax.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/userproofingajax | title=User-proofing Ajax | first=Peter | last=Quinsey | access-date=8 January 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219120421/http://www.alistapart.com/articles/userproofingajax | archive-date=19 February 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n* Similarly, some Web applications that use Ajax are built in a way that cannot be read by screen-reading technologies, such as [[JAWS (screen reader)|JAWS]].

For example, editing a search field may trigger a query to the server for search completions, but the user may not know that a search completion popup is forthcoming, and if the Internet connection is slow, the popup list may show up at an inconvenient time, when the user has already proceeded to do something else.\n* Excluding [[Google]],<ref name=\"Google\">{{cite web | url=http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ca/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html?m=1 | title=Official news on crawling and indexing sites for the Google index | publisher=[[Google]] | first=Erik | last=Hendriks | date=23 May 2014 | accessdate=24 May 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525034039/http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.ca/2014/05/understanding-web-pages-better.html?m=1 | archive-date=25 May 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> most major [[Web crawler]]s do not execute JavaScript code,<ref name=\"IBM\">{{cite web | url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-sitemaps/index.html | title=Help Web crawlers efficiently crawl your portal sites and Web sites | publisher=[[IBM]] | first=Andreas | last=Prokoph | date=8 May 2007 | accessdate=22 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100219074644/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/x-sitemaps/index.html | archive-date=19 February 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> so in order to be indexed by [[Web search engine]]s, a Web application must provide an alternative means of accessing the content that would normally be retrieved with Ajax.

With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a [[Web server|server]] asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.<ref name=\"wrox\">{{cite book | url=http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-303217.html | title=Beginning Ajax | accessdate=24 June 2008 | publisher=wrox | date=March 2007 | first=Chris | last=Ullman | isbn=978-0-470-10675-4 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705101852/http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-303217.html | archivedate=5 July 2008  | url-status= live}}</ref> In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [[JSON]] instead of XML.\n\nAjax is not a single technology, but rather a group of technologies. [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] and [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] can be used in combination to mark up and style information. The webpage can then be modified by JavaScript to dynamically display\u2014and allow the user to interact with\u2014the new information. The built-in [[XMLHttpRequest]] object, or since 2017 the new \"fetch()\" function within JavaScript, is commonly used to execute Ajax on webpages allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page. Ajax is not a new technology, or different language, just existing technologies used in new ways.\n\n== History ==\nIn the early-to-mid 1990s, most [[World Wide Web|Web]] sites were based on complete HTML pages. Each user action required that a complete new page be loaded from the server. This process was inefficient, as reflected by the user experience: all page content disappeared, then the new page appeared. Each time the browser reloaded a page because of a partial change, all of the content had to be re-sent, even though only some of the information had changed. This placed additional load on the server and made [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] a limiting factor on performance.\n\nIn 1996, the [[Iframe#Frames|iframe]] tag was introduced by [[Internet Explorer]]; like the [[HTML element#Images and objects|object]] element, it can load or fetch content asynchronously. In 1998, the Microsoft [[Outlook Web Access]] team developed the concept behind the [[XMLHttpRequest]] scripting object.<ref name=\"ALEXHOPMANN\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm |title=Article on the history of XMLHTTP by an original developer |publisher=Alexhopmann.com |date=2007-01-31 |accessdate=2009-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623125327/http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It appeared as XMLHTTP in the second version of the [[MSXML]] library,<ref name=\"ALEXHOPMANN\" /><ref name=\"MSDN1\">{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms759148(VS.85).aspx |title=Specification of the IXMLHTTPRequest interface from the Microsoft Developer Network |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |accessdate=2009-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526164820/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms759148(VS.85).aspx |archive-date=26 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> which shipped with [[Internet Explorer 5.0]] in March 1999.<ref name=\"Dutta\">{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/23/516393.aspx |title=Native XMLHTTPRequest object |accessdate=2006-11-30 |last=Dutta |first=Sunava |date=2006-01-23 |work=IEBlog |publisher=Microsoft |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306164701/http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/01/23/516393.aspx |archive-date=6 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe functionality of the XMLHTTP [[ActiveX]] control in IE 5 was later implemented by [[Mozilla]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] and other browsers as the XMLHttpRequest [[JavaScript]] object.<ref name=\"apple\">{{cite web | url=https://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | title=Dynamic HTML and XML: The XMLHttpRequest Object | publisher=Apple Inc. | accessdate=25 June 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103519/http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html | archive-date=9 May 2008 | url-status=live }}</ref> Microsoft adopted the native XMLHttpRequest model as of [[Internet Explorer 7]].

In the article that coined the term Ajax,<ref name=\"garrett\" /><ref name=\"wrox\" /> Jesse James Garrett explained that the following technologies are incorporated:\n* [[HTML]] (or [[XHTML]]) and [[CSS]] for presentation\n* The [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) for dynamic display of and interaction with data\n* [[JSON]] or [[XML]] for the interchange of data, and [[XSLT]] for its manipulation\n* The [[XMLHttpRequest]] object for asynchronous communication\n* [[JavaScript]] to bring these technologies together\n\nSince then, however, there have been a number of developments in the technologies used in an Ajax application, and in the definition of the term Ajax itself. XML is no longer required for data interchange and, therefore, XSLT is no longer required for the manipulation of data. [[JSON|JavaScript Object Notation]] (JSON) is often used as an alternative format for data interchange,<ref name=\"tapestry\">{{cite web | url=http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4.1/ajax/json.html | title=JavaScript Object Notation | publisher=Apache.org | accessdate=4 July 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616113121/http://tapestry.apache.org/tapestry4.1/ajax/json.html | archivedate=16 June 2008 | url-status=live | df=dmy\n}}</ref> although other formats such as preformatted HTML or plain text can also be used.<ref name=\"devx-json\">{{cite web | url=http://www.devx.com/Webdev/Article/32651 | title=Speed Up Your Ajax-based Apps with JSON | publisher=DevX.com | accessdate=4 July 2008 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704134131/http://www.devx.com/Webdev/Article/32651 | archivedate=4 July 2008 | url-status=dead | df=dmy }}</ref> A variety of popular JavaScript libraries, including JQuery, include abstractions to assist in executing Ajax requests.\n\n== Drawbacks ==\n* Any user whose browser does not support JavaScript or XMLHttpRequest, or has this functionality disabled, will not be able to properly use pages that depend on Ajax. Simple devices (such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]) may not support the required technologies. The only way to let the user carry out functionality is to fall back to non-JavaScript methods.

Although it still uses XMLHttpRequest behind the scenes, the following is a client-side implementation of the same example as above using the 'ajax' method.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\">\n$.ajax({\n\ttype: 'GET',\n\turl: 'send-ajax-data.php',\n\tdataType: \"JSON\", // data type expected from server\n\tsuccess: function (data) {\n\t\tconsole.log(data);\n\t},\n\terror: function(error) {\n\t\tconsole.log('Error: ' + error);\n\t}\n});\n</syntaxhighlight>jQuery also implements a 'get' method which allows the same code to be written more concisely.<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\">\n$.get('send-ajax-data.php').done(function(data) {\n\tconsole.log(data);\n}).fail(function(data) {\n\tconsole.log('Error: ' + data);\n});\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Fetch example ===\nFetch is a new native JavaScript API.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fetch API - Web APIs |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#Browser_compatibility |website=MDN |accessdate=30 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529085752/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API#Browser_compatibility |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to [https://developers.google.com/web/ilt/pwa/working-with-the-fetch-api Google Developers Documentation], \"Fetch makes it easier to make web requests and handle responses than with the older XMLHttpRequest.\"\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\">\nfetch('send-ajax-data.php')\n    .then(data => console.log(data))\n    .catch (error => console.log('Error:' + error));\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nES7 async/await example:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"javascript\">\n\nasync function doAjax() {\n    try {\n        const res = await fetch('send-ajax-data.php');\n        const data = await res.text();\n        console.log(data);\n    } catch (error) {\n        console.log('Error:' + error);\n    }\n}\n\ndoAjax();\n\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAs seen above, fetch relies on JavaScript [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise promises].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[ActionScript]]\n* [[Comet (programming)]] (also known as Reverse Ajax)\n* [[Google Instant]]\n* [[HTTP/2]]\n* [[List of Ajax frameworks]]\n* [[Node.js]]\n* [[Remote scripting]]\n* [[Rich Internet application]]\n* [[WebSocket]]\n* [[HTML5]]\n* [[JavaScript|Javascript]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- =================== {{No more links}} ============================\n|  PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

It borders [[Canada]] and lies at the center of the [[North American continent]]. The geographic center of North America is near the town of [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]]. [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] is the capital of North Dakota, and [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] is the largest city.\n\nSoil is North Dakota's most precious resource. It is the base of the state's great agricultural wealth. North Dakota also has enormous mineral resources. These mineral resources include billions of tons of lignite coal. In addition, North Dakota has large oil reserves. Petroleum was discovered in the state in 1951 and quickly became one of North Dakota's most valuable mineral resources. In the early 2000s, the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technologies enabled mining companies to extract huge amounts of oil from the Bakken shale rock formation in the western part of the stat.\n\nNorth Dakota's economy is based more heavily on farming than the economies of most other stats. Many North Dakota factories process farm products or manufacture farm equipment. Many of the stat's merchants also rely on agriculture.\n\nFarms and ranches cover nearly all of North Dakota. They stretch from the flat Red River Valley in the east, across rolling plains, to the rugged Badlands in the west. The chief crop, wheat, is grown in nearly every county. North Dakota harvests more than 90 percent of the nation's canola and flaxseed. It is also the country's top producer of barley and sunflower seeds and a leader in the production of beans, honey, lentils, oats, peas, and sugar beets.\n\nFew white settlers came to the North Dakota region before the 1870s because railroads had not yet entered the area. During the early 1870s, the Northern Pacific Railroad began to push across the Dakota Territory. Large-scale farming also began during the 1870s. Eastern corporations and some families established huge wheat farms covering large areas of land in the Red River Valley. The farms made such enormous profits they were called bonanza farms. White settlers, attracted by the success of the bonanza farms, flocked to North Dakota, rapidly increasing the territory's population. In 1870, North Dakota had 2,405 people. By 1890, the population had grown to 190,983.\n\nNorth Dakota was named for the Sioux people who once lived in the territory. The Sioux called themselves Dakota or Lakota, meaning allies or friends. One of North Dakota's nicknames is the Peace Garden State. This nickname honors the [[International Peace Garden]], which lies on the state's border with Manitoba, Canada. North Dakota is also called the Flickertail State because of the many flickertail ground squirrels that live in the central part of the state.\n\nNorth Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the [[Great Plains]]. The state shares the [[Red River of the North]] with [[Minnesota]] to the east. [[South Dakota]] is to the south, [[Montana]] is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] are to the north. North Dakota is near the middle of [[North America]] with a stone marker in [[Rugby, North Dakota]] marking the \"Geographic Center of the North American Continent\".

North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the [[Red River Valley]], as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands. By the outbreak of the First World War, this was among North America's richest farming regions. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.\n\nFrom the 1930s until the end of the 20th century, North Dakota's population gradually declined, interrupted by a couple of brief increases. Young adults with university degrees were particularly likely to leave the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} With the advancing process of mechanization of agricultural practices, and environmental conditions requiring larger landholdings for successful agriculture, subsistence farming proved to be too risky for families. Many people moved to urban areas for jobs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leading Population Trends in North Dakota |publisher=North Dakota State University |year=2007 |url=http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm |accessdate=August 19, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818144416/http://www.ndsu.edu/sdc/data/populationtrends.htm |archivedate=August 18, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nSince the late 20th century, one of the major causes of migration from North Dakota is the lack of skilled jobs for college graduates.

By the early 19th century the territory was dominated by Siouan-speaking peoples, whose territory stretched west from the Great Lakes area. The word \"Dakota\" is a Sioux (Lakota/Dakota) word meaning \"allies\" or \"friends\".\n\nThe primary historic tribal nations in or around North Dakota, are the Lakota and the Dakota (\"[[The Great Sioux Nation]]\" or \"Oceti Sakowin\", meaning the seven council fires), the [[Blackfoot]], the [[Cheyenne]], the [[Chippewa]] (known as [[Ojibwe]] in Canada), and the [[Mandan]]. The federally recognized tribes have [[Indian reservations]] in the state.\n\n===Pow wows===\n\nSocial gatherings known as \"[[powwows]]\" (or wacipis in Lakota/Dakota) continue to be an important part of Native American culture and are held regularly throughout the state. Throughout Native American history, powwows were held, usually in the spring, to rejoice at the beginning of new life and the end of the winter cold. These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet with old friends and acquaintances, as well as to make new ones. Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes. Today, powwows are still a part of the Native American culture and are attended by Natives and non-Natives alike. In North Dakota, the United Tribes International Powwow held each September in the capital of [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], is one of the largest powwows in the United States.\n\nA [[pow wow]] is an occasion for parades and Native American dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills, and eagle feathers; male [[grass dance]]rs wear colorful fringe regalia, and male [[fancy dance]]rs wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than the male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, beaded moccasins, and jewelry, while the [[jingle dress]] dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. Inter-tribal dances during the powwow, allow everyone (even spectators) can take part in the dancing.\n\n===Norwegian and Icelandic influences===\n\n[[File:Hultstrand61.jpg|thumb|Norwegian settlers in front of their sod house in North Dakota in 1898]]\n\nAround 1870 many European immigrants from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. [[Icelandic American|Icelanders]] also arrived from Canada.<ref>William Charles Sherman, Playford V. Thorson, Warren A. Henke, ''Plains Folk: North Dakota's Ethnic History'' (North Dakota Institute for Regional Studies, 1986) pp 189, 242, 256</ref> [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] was a town of many [[Norwegian American|Norwegians]] when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools, greatly outnumbering other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as ''[[lefse]]'' and ''[[lutefisk]]''. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, ''[[Norsk H\u00f8stfest]]'', is celebrated each September in [[Minot, North Dakota|Minot's]] [[North Dakota State Fair Center]], a local attraction featuring art, architecture, and cultural artifacts from all five Nordic countries. The Icelandic State Park in [[Pembina County, North Dakota|Pembina County]] and an annual Icelandic festival reflect immigrants from that country, who are also descended from Scandinavians.\n\nOld World folk customs have persisted for decades in North Dakota, with the revival of techniques in weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving. Traditional turf-roof houses are displayed in parks; this style originated in Iceland. A [[stave church]] is a landmark in Minot. Ethnic Norwegians constitute nearly one-third or 32.3% of Minot's total population and 30.8% of North Dakota's total population.\n\n===Germans from Russia===\n\n{{See also|Germans from Russia}}\n\nEthnic Germans who had settled in Russia for several generations since the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] grew dissatisfied in the nineteenth century because of economic problems and because of the revocation of religious freedoms for [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] and [[Hutterite]]s, in particular the revocation of exemption from military service in 1871. Most Mennonites and Hutterites migrated to America in the late 1870s. By 1900, about 100,000 had immigrated to the U.S., settling primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota became known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". By 1910, about 60,000 ethnic Germans from Russia lived in Central North Dakota. They were Lutherans, Mennonites, Hutterites and Roman Catholics who had kept most of their German customs of the time when their ancestors immigrated to Russia. They were committed to agriculture. Traditional iron cemetery grave markers are a famous art form practiced by ethnic Germans.<ref>Elwyn B.

Its capital is [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], and its largest city is [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]].\n\nIn the 21st century, North Dakota's [[natural resource]]s have played a [[North Dakota oil boom|major role]] in its economic performance, particularly with the [[Extraction of petroleum|oil extraction]] from the [[Bakken formation]], which lies beneath the northwestern part of the state.

It borders [[Canada]] and lies at the center of the [[North American continent]]. The geographic center of North America is near the town of [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]]. [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] is the capital of North Dakota, and [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]] is the largest city.\n\nSoil is North Dakota's most precious resource. It is the base of the state's great agricultural wealth. North Dakota also has enormous mineral resources. These mineral resources include billions of tons of lignite coal. In addition, North Dakota has large oil reserves. Petroleum was discovered in the state in 1951 and quickly became one of North Dakota's most valuable mineral resources. In the early 2000s, the emergence of hydraulic fracturing technologies enabled mining companies to extract huge amounts of oil from the Bakken shale rock formation in the western part of the state.\n\nNorth Dakota's economy is based more heavily on farming than the economies of most other states. Many North Dakota factories process farm products or manufacture farm equipment. Many of the state's merchants also rely on agriculture.\n\nFarms and ranches cover nearly all of North Dakota. They stretch from the flat Red River Valley in the east, across rolling plains, to the rugged Badlands in the west. The chief crop, wheat, is grown in nearly every county. North Dakota harvests more than 90 percent of the nation's canola and flaxseed. It is also the country's top producer of barley and sunflower seeds and a leader in the production of beans, honey, lentils, oats, peas, and sugar beets.\n\nFew white settlers came to the North Dakota region before the 1870s because railroads had not yet entered the area. During the early 1870s, the Northern Pacific Railroad began to push across the Dakota Territory. Large-scale farming also began during the 1870s. Eastern corporations and some families established huge wheat farms covering large areas of land in the Red River Valley. The farms made such enormous profits they were called bonanza farms. White settlers, attracted by the success of the bonanza farms, flocked to North Dakota, rapidly increasing the territory's population. In 1870, North Dakota had 2,405 people. By 1890, the population had grown to 190,983.\n\nNorth Dakota was named for the Sioux people who once lived in the territory. The Sioux called themselves Dakota or Lakota, meaning allies or friends. One of North Dakota's nicknames is the Peace Garden State. This nickname honors the [[International Peace Garden]], which lies on the state's border with Manitoba, Canada. North Dakota is also called the Flickertail State because of the many flickertail ground squirrels that live in the central part of the state.\n\nNorth Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the [[Great Plains]]. The state shares the [[Red River of the North]] with [[Minnesota]] to the east. [[South Dakota]] is to the south, [[Montana]] is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Manitoba]] are to the north. North Dakota is near the middle of [[North America]] with a stone marker in [[Rugby, North Dakota]] marking the \"Geographic Center of the North American Continent\".

Most of the state is covered in [[grassland]]; crops cover most of eastern North Dakota but become increasingly sparse in the center and farther west. Natural trees in North Dakota are found usually where there is good drainage, such as the ravines and valley near the Pembina Gorge and Killdeer Mountains, the Turtle Mountains, the hills around Devil's Lake, in the dunes area of McHenry County in central North Dakota, and along the Sheyenne Valley slopes and the Sheyenne delta.

North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and general laborers and their families, mostly from [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], [[Sweden]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the [[Red River Valley]], as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands. By the outbreak of the First World War, this was among North America's richest farming regions. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.\n\nFrom the 1930s until the end of the 20th century, North Dakota's population gradually declined, interrupted by a couple of brief increases.

By the early 19th century the territory was dominated by Siouan-speaking peoples, whose territory stretched west from the Great Lakes area. The word \"Dakota\" is a Sioux (Lakota/Dakota) word meaning \"allies\" or \"friends\".\n\nThe primary historic tribal nations in or around North Dakota, are the Lakota and the Dakota (\"[[The Great Sioux Nation]]\" or \"Oceti Sakowin\", meaning the seven council fires), the [[Blackfoot]], the [[Cheyenne]], the [[Chippewa]] (known as [[Ojibwe]] in Canada), and the [[Mandan]]. The federally recognized tribes have [[Indian reservations]] in the state.\n\n===Pow wows===\n\nSocial gatherings known as \"[[powwows]]\" (or wacipis in Lakota/Dakota) continue to be an important part of Native American culture and are held regularly throughout the state. Throughout Native American history, powwows were held, usually in the spring, to rejoice at the beginning of new life and the end of the winter cold. These events brought Native American tribes together for singing and dancing and allowed them to meet with old friends and acquaintances, as well as to make new ones. Many powwows also held religious significance for some tribes. Today, powwows are still a part of the Native American culture and are attended by Natives and non-Natives alike. In North Dakota, the United Tribes International Powwow held each September in the capital of [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]], is one of the largest powwows in the United States.\n\nA [[pow wow]] is an occasion for parades and Native American dancers in regalia, with many dancing styles presented. It is traditional for male dancers to wear regalia decorated with beads, quills, and eagle feathers; male [[grass dance]]rs wear colorful fringe regalia, and male [[fancy dance]]rs wear brightly colored feathers. Female dancers dance much more subtly than the male dancers. Fancy female dancers wear cloth, beaded moccasins, and jewelry, while the [[jingle dress]] dancer wears a dress made of metal cones. Inter-tribal dances during the powwow, allow everyone (even spectators) can take part in the dancing.\n\n===Norwegian and Icelandic influences===\n\n[[File:Hultstrand61.jpg|thumb|Norwegian settlers in front of their sod house in North Dakota in 1898]]\n\nAround 1870 many European immigrants from Norway settled in North Dakota's northeastern corner, especially near the Red River. [[Icelandic American|Icelanders]] also arrived from Canada.<ref>William Charles Sherman, Playford V. Thorson, Warren A. Henke, ''Plains Folk: North Dakota's Ethnic History'' (North Dakota Institute for Regional Studies, 1986) pp 189, 242, 256</ref> [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] was a town of many [[Norwegian American|Norwegians]] when it was founded; they worked on family farms. They started Lutheran churches and schools, greatly outnumbering other denominations in the area. This group has unique foods such as ''[[lefse]]'' and ''[[lutefisk]]''. The continent's largest Scandinavian event, ''[[Norsk H\u00f8stfest]]'', is celebrated each September in [[Minot, North Dakota|Minot's]] [[North Dakota State Fair Center]], a local attraction featuring art, architecture, and cultural artifacts from all five Nordic countries. The Icelandic State Park in [[Pembina County, North Dakota|Pembina County]] and an annual Icelandic festival reflect immigrants from that country, who are also descended from Scandinavians.\n\nOld World folk customs have persisted for decades in North Dakota, with the revival of techniques in weaving, silver crafting, and wood carving. Traditional turf-roof houses are displayed in parks; this style originated in Iceland. A [[stave church]] is a landmark in Minot. Ethnic Norwegians constitute nearly one-third or 32.3% of Minot's total population and 30.8% of North Dakota's total population.\n\n===Germans from Russia===\n\n{{See also|Germans from Russia}}\n\nEthnic Germans who had settled in Russia for several generations since the reign of [[Catherine the Great]] grew dissatisfied in the nineteenth century because of economic problems and because of the revocation of religious freedoms for [[Russian Mennonite|Mennonites]] and [[Hutterite]]s, in particular the revocation of exemption from military service in 1871. Most Mennonites and Hutterites migrated to America in the late 1870s. By 1900, about 100,000 had immigrated to the U.S., settling primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska. The south-central part of North Dakota became known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". By 1910, about 60,000 ethnic Germans from Russia lived in Central North Dakota. They were Lutherans, Mennonites, Hutterites and Roman Catholics who had kept most of their German customs of the time when their ancestors immigrated to Russia. They were committed to agriculture. Traditional iron cemetery grave markers are a famous art form practiced by ethnic Germans.<ref>Elwyn B.

G. Jung]] believed sublimation to be mystical in nature, thus differing fundamentally from Freud's view of the concept. For Freud, sublimation helped explain the plasticity of the sexual instincts (and their convertibility to non-sexual ends). The concept also underpinned his psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the [[super-ego]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]). Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:\n\n<blockquote> Sublimation is part of the royal art where the true gold is made. Of this Freud knows nothing; worse still, he barricades all the paths that could lead to true sublimation. This is just about the opposite of what Freud understands by sublimation. It is not a voluntary and forcible channeling of instinct into a spurious field of application, but an alchymical transformation for which fire and prima materia are needed. Sublimation is a great mystery. Freud has appropriated this concept and usurped it for the sphere of the will and the bourgeois, rationalistic ethos.<ref>Carl Jung, Letters, ed. By G. Adler and A. Jaff\u00e9 (Princeton University Press; Princeton, 1974), vol. 1, 171,</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis criticism extends from the private sphere of his correspondence (as above) to specific papers he published on psychoanalysis:\n\n<blockquote> Freud invented the idea of sublimation to save us from the imaginary claws of the unconscious. But what is real, what actually exists, cannot be alchemically sublimated, and if anything is apparently sublimated it never was what a false interpretation took it to be.<ref>C. G. Jung, Dreams: (From Volumes 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung), Princeton University Press (2012), p. 100.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== According to Lacan ==\n\n=== ''Das Ding'' ===\n\nThe French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]'s exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars.<ref>The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII.</ref> Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept ''Das Ding'' (later in his career Lacan termed this ''[[objet petit a]]''); ''Das Ding'' is German for 'the thing' though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences, all of which are used to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. Unfortunately, all attempts to overcome the vacuity of ''Das Ding'' are insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual. For this reason Lacan also considers ''Das Ding'' to be a non-Thing or vacuole.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 134, p. 150.</ref>\n\nLacan considers ''Das Ding'' a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact it is in its nature that the object as such is lost. It will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 52\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 52.</ref> and again '[Das Ding] is to be found at most as something missed. One doesn't find it, but only its pleasurable associations.'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 52\"/> Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: 'The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to ''Das Ding'' in relation to its end.'{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 58.</ref>\n\n=== Lacanian sublimation ===\n\nLacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of ''Das Ding''. His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 112.</ref> Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of ''Das Ding'' and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 119\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 119.</ref> Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system',<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 119\"/> in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of ''Das Ding''.\n\nLacan also considers sublimation to be a process of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''{{Hairspace}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, pp. 115-127.</ref> (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of ''Das Ding''. Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnes\u00e4nger''{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\"/> who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centered around a hole (the vagina<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.</ref>). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation.'<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.</ref> He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Proven\u00e7al verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.</ref> If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).\n\nLacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.</ref> They are primitive and even primordial artifacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.</ref> In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.</ref> and often depict empty spaces through perspective.\n\nIn myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\"/> (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).\n\nLacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behavior can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\"/> As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.</ref> (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.\n\n==Empirical research==\nA study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.<ref name=\"kim13\">{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639\u2013666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}</ref>\nThese investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing \"possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms.\"<ref name=\"kim13\"/>{{rp|639}}\n\n== In fiction ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].\n*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].\n*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F.

Son, be a dentist/People will pay you to be inhumane.\"\n*[[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' features a villain whose line of work as a judge, dealing out harsh sentences to guilty criminals, had previously permitted him to sublimate his homicidal urges.\n* Sexual transmutation was quoted in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), and was illustrated as a principle of success.\n* In the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode \"[[Criminal Minds (season 7)|The Bittersweet Science]]\", it's mentioned that children with a violent past grow up to be police officers or soldiers, not necessarily boxers.\n* In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neil Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]], sublimation is presented as the source of the [[Neo-Victorian|Neo-Victorians']] dominance: \"...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes.

The concept also underpinned his psychoanalytical theories, which showed the human psyche at the mercy of conflicting impulses (such as the [[super-ego]] and the [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]). Jung criticized Freud for obscuring the alchemical origins of sublimation and for attempting instead to make the concept appear scientifically credible:\n\n<blockquote> Sublimation is part of the royal art where the true gold is made. Of this Freud knows nothing; worse still, he barricades all the paths that could lead to true sublimation. This is just about the opposite of what Freud understands by sublimation. It is not a voluntary and forcible channeling of instinct into a spurious field of application, but an alchymical transformation for which fire and prima materia are needed. Sublimation is a great mystery. Freud has appropriated this concept and usurped it for the sphere of the will and the bourgeois, rationalistic ethos.<ref>Carl Jung, Letters, ed. By G. Adler and A. Jaff\u00e9 (Princeton University Press; Princeton, 1974), vol. 1, 171,</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis criticism extends from the private sphere of his correspondence (as above) to specific papers he published on psychoanalysis:\n\n<blockquote> Freud invented the idea of sublimation to save us from the imaginary claws of the unconscious. But what is real, what actually exists, cannot be alchemically sublimated, and if anything is apparently sublimated it never was what a false interpretation took it to be.<ref>C. G. Jung, Dreams: (From Volumes 4, 8, 12, and 16 of the Collected Works of C. G. Jung), Princeton University Press (2012), p. 100.</ref></blockquote>\n\n== According to Lacan ==\n\n=== ''Das Ding'' ===\n\nThe French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]'s exposition of sublimation is framed within a discussion about the relationship of psychoanalysis and ethics within the seventh book of his seminars.<ref>The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII.</ref> Lacanian sublimation is defined with reference to the concept ''Das Ding'' (later in his career Lacan termed this ''[[objet petit a]]''); ''Das Ding'' is German for 'the thing' though Lacan conceives it as an abstract notion and one of the defining characteristics of the human condition. Broadly speaking it is the vacuum one experiences as a human being and which one endeavours to fill with differing human relationships, objects and experiences, all of which are used to plug a gap in one's psychical needs. Unfortunately, all attempts to overcome the vacuity of ''Das Ding'' are insufficient in wholly satisfying the individual. For this reason Lacan also considers ''Das Ding'' to be a non-Thing or vacuole.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 134, p. 150.</ref>\n\nLacan considers ''Das Ding'' a lost object ever in the process of being recuperated by Man. Temporarily the individual will be duped by his or her own psyche into believing that this object, this person or this circumstance can be relied upon to satisfy his needs in a stable and enduring manner when in fact it is in its nature that the object as such is lost. It will never be found again. Something is there while one waits for something better, or worse, but which one wants'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 52\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 52.</ref> and again '[Das Ding] is to be found at most as something missed. One doesn't find it, but only its pleasurable associations.'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 52\"/> Human life unravels as a series of detours in the quest for the lost object or the absolute Other of the individual: 'The pleasure principle governs the search for the object and imposes detours which maintain the distance to ''Das Ding'' in relation to its end.'{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 58.</ref>\n\n=== Lacanian sublimation ===\n\nLacanian sublimation centres to a large part on the notion of ''Das Ding''. His general formula for sublimation is that 'it raises an object ... to the dignity of The Thing.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 112.</ref> Lacan considers these objects (whether human, aesthetic, credal or philosophical) to be signifiers which are representative of ''Das Ding'' and that 'the function of the pleasure principle is, in effect, to lead the subject from signifier to signifier, by generating as many signifiers as are required to maintain at as low a level as possible the tension that regulates the whole functioning of the psychic apparatus.'{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 119\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 119.</ref> Furthermore, man is the 'artisan of his support system',<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 119\"/> in other words, he creates or finds the signifiers which delude him into believing he has overcome the emptiness of ''Das Ding''.\n\nLacan also considers sublimation to be a process of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''{{Hairspace}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, pp. 115-127.</ref> (creating out of nothing), whereby an object, human or manufactured, comes to be defined in relation to the emptiness of ''Das Ding''. Lacan's prime example of this is the courtly love of the troubadours and ''Minnes\u00e4nger''{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 112\"/> who dedicated their poetic verse to a love-object which was not only unreachable (and therefore experienced as something missing) but whose existence and desirability also centered around a hole (the vagina<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 163.</ref>). For Lacan such courtly love was 'a paradigm of sublimation.'<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 128.</ref> He affirms that the word 'troubadour' is etymologically linked to the Proven\u00e7al verb ''trobar'' (like the French ''trouver'') 'to find.'{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 118.</ref> If we consider again the definition of ''Das Ding'', it is dependent precisely on the expectation of the subject to re-find the lost object in the mistaken belief that it will continue to satisfy him (or her).\n\nLacan maintains that creation ''ex nihilo'' operates in other noteworthy fields as well. In pottery for example vases are created around an empty space.<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 121.</ref> They are primitive and even primordial artifacts which have benefited mankind not only in the capacity of utensils but also as metaphors of (cosmic) creation ''ex nihilo''. Lacan cites Heidegger who situates the vase between the earthly (raising clay from the ground) and the ethereal (pointing upwards to receive).<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 120.</ref> In architecture, Lacan asserts, buildings are designed around an empty space and in art paintings proceed from an empty canvas,<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\">Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 130.</ref> and often depict empty spaces through perspective.\n\nIn myth, Pan pursues the nymph Syrinx who is transformed into hollow reeds in order to avoid the clutches of the God, who subsequently cuts the reeds down in anger and transforms them into what we today call panpipes{{Hair space}}<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 163\"/> (both reeds and panpipes rely on their hollowness for the production of sound).\n\nLacan briefly remarks that religion and science are also based around emptiness. In regard to religion, Lacan refers the reader to Freud, stating that much obsessional religious behavior can be attributed to the avoidance of the primordial emptiness of ''Das Ding'' or in the respecting of it.<ref name=\"Jacques Lacan p. 130\"/> As for the discourse of science this is based on the notion of ''Verwerfung''{{Hair space}}<ref>Jacques Lacan, The Ethics of Psychoanalysis 1959-1960 - The Seminar of Jacques Lacan - Book VII, p. 131.</ref> (the German word for 'dismissal') which results in the dismissing, foreclosing or exclusion of the notion of ''Das Ding'' presumably because it defies empirical categorisation.\n\n==Empirical research==\nA study by Kim, Zeppenfeld, and Cohen studied sublimation by empirical methods.<ref name=\"kim13\">{{cite journal|last1=Kim |first1=Emily |last2=Zeppenfeld |first2=Veronika |last3=Cohen |first3=Dov|title=Sublimation, culture, and creativity.|journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|date=2013 |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=639\u2013666 |doi=10.1037/a0033487}}</ref>\nThese investigators view their research, published in the ''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'', as providing \"possibly the first experimental evidence for sublimation and [suggesting] a cultural psychological approach to defense mechanisms.\"<ref name=\"kim13\"/>{{rp|639}}\n\n== In fiction ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}\n*One of the best known examples in Western literature is in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'', where the protagonist Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous writer, sublimates his desire for an adolescent boy into writing [[poetry]].\n*In [[Alberto Moravia]]'s novel, [[Io e lui (novel)|''Io e lui'' (''Him and Me'', 1971)]], the protagonist is in a constant unsuccessful quest to overcome the power of his large [[penis]], so he sublimates into a serious [[film director]].\n*In ''Psychological Science: Mind, Brain and Behavior,'' by [[Michael Gazzaniga]] and [[Todd Heatherton|Todd F.

A direct example of this is in the musical and movie ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (musical)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' characterized in the descriptively sadistic character of Orin Scrivello who follows his mother's advice to become a dentist, quoting her \"You'll find a way/to make your natural tendencies pay ... Son, be a dentist/People will pay you to be inhumane.\"\n*[[Agatha Christie]]'s novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]'' features a villain whose line of work as a judge, dealing out harsh sentences to guilty criminals, had previously permitted him to sublimate his homicidal urges.\n* Sexual transmutation was quoted in [[Napoleon Hill]]'s book ''[[Think and Grow Rich]]'' (1937), and was illustrated as a principle of success.\n* In the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' episode \"[[Criminal Minds (season 7)|The Bittersweet Science]]\", it's mentioned that children with a violent past grow up to be police officers or soldiers, not necessarily boxers.\n* In ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' by [[Neil Stephenson|Neal Stephenson]], sublimation is presented as the source of the [[Neo-Victorian|Neo-Victorians']] dominance: \"...it was precisely their emotional repression that made the Victorians the richest and most powerful people in the world. Their ability to submerge their feelings, far from pathological, was rather a kind of mystical art that gave them nearly magical power over Nature and over the more intuitive tribes.

[[James Dean]] remains the only actor to have been posthumously nominated in this category on more than one occasion. At age 29, [[Adrien Brody]] became the youngest actor to win this award for ''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]'' (2002), while [[Henry Fonda]], at age 76, became the oldest winner for ''[[On Golden Pond (1981 film)|On Golden Pond]]''.

[[James Dean]] remains the only actor to have been posthumously nominated in this category on more than one occasion.
