One day, the Maulvi Sahib was repeatedly telling AlaHazrat  to say a word, but AlaHazrat  could not pronounce it. The Maulvi Sahib was pronouncing the word with a zabr but AlaHazrat  was pronouncing the same word with a zer instead. It happened time and time again. The grandfather of AlaHazrat , Moulana Raza Ali Khan  also witnessed this situation and called AlaHazrat  to himself and asked for the Holy Qur'an. Moulana Raza Ali Khan  noticed that the copyist had accidentally placed a zabr instead of a zer and was astonished to see that the pronunciation of Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan  was actually accurate and perfect. His respected grandfather  asked, 'Ahmad Raza Khan ! Why are you not following your teacher?' AlaHazrat  politely replied, 'I tried my best to follow the pronunciation of my teacher but I lost control over my tongue.' The Maulvi Sahib witnessed many other peculiar incidences similar to this one and once privately asked AlaHazrat , 'Oh son, be honest with me, I promise I will not tell anybody, are you a human or a Jinn?' AlaHazrat  replied, 'All praise be to Allah , I'm human, however, the grace and generosity of Allah  accompanies me all the time    (Hayat-e-AlaHazrat, V1, P68, Maktaba-tul-Madina Karachi)\n\n==='''First Fatwa'''===\n\nAt the age of 13 years, 10 months and 4 days, after studying the prevalent sciences under the guidance of his respected father Moulana Naqi Ali Khan , a Dast\u00e0ar (accomplishment of Islamic studies) was awarded to AlaHazrat . On this very day, he  wrote a Fatwa and presented it to his respected father Moulana Naqi Ali Khan  who found it absolutely correct. Looking to the talent of his son, Moulana Naqi Ali Khan  authorised AlaHazrat  to work as a Mufti and AlaHazrat  continued this until the end.  (Hayat-e-AlaHazrat, V1, P279, Maktaba-tul-Madina, Baab-ul-Madina Karachi)\n\n==='''AlaHazrat as a Mathematician'''===\n\nAllah  had blessed AlaHazrat  with knowledge of great sciences. AlaHazrat  wrote about fifty different types of knowledge and was an expert in every single science. AlaHazrat  was such a professional astronomer and astrologer that he  would set his clock just by observing the sun in the day and the stars at night. The time that he would set would always be precise and accurate with not even a minute difference. AlaHazrat  was also a unique and remarkable mathematician. Once, Sir Zia-ud-Deen, vice chancellor of Ali Gar university, a prominent Mathematician of Indo-Pak Subcontinent, and holder of many international degrees, came to Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan . After greeting Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan , he  asked the mathematician the purpose of coming. He answered, 'I have come to seek help in solving a mathematical problem.' Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan  asked, 'What is the problem?' The vice-Chancellor explained, 'It is not such an ordinary and easy problem that I can state it in such a way.' However, Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan  again asked, 'What is the problem?' The vice chancellor hesitantly presented the full complexity of the problem but to his astonishment, Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan  solved the problem immediately! In a state of awe and shock at the speed of the solution that Imaam Ahmad Raza Khan  had provided, he exclaimed, 'My intention had been to travel to Germany for the solution but Professor Moulana Sayyid Suleiman Ashraf (Professor of Islamic studies) guided me here. It seemed as if you were observing the solution of this problem in a book.' When the vice-chancellor returned home, due to the impact of this experience, he grew a beard and became punctual in performing salaah and fasting.  (Hayat-e-AlaHazrat, V1, P223-228, Maktaba-tul-Madina, Baab-ul-Madina Karachi)\n\nImaam Ahmad Raza Khan was also proficient in arithmetic, astrology, astronomy, Ilm-e-Ja'far etc.\n\n==='''Extraordinary Memory'''=== \n\nAbu Haamid Sayyid Muhammad Khachauchi  says that when people gave up finding the references for Fiqh in order to reply to questions, they would go to AlaHazrat  who would provide the precise book references straight away. AlaHazrat   would say, 'look in rad-dul-muhtaar, so and so volume and so and so page, you will see the passage written down. It is written down in the book of Alamgiri, so and so volume, so and so page, so and so line etc.' When the people obtained the books, they would find the passage or sentence written down exactly as AlaHazrat  had said. We can only say that this is surely God-given unique memory, that he knew even the '1400 year old books', off by heart.   (Hayat-e-AlaHazrat, V1, P210, Maktaba-tul-Madina, Baab-ul-Madina Karachi)\n\n==='''Memorising the Qur'an in just One Month'''=== \n\nSayyid Ayub Ali  states that one day AlaHazrat  said, 'Some people, out of unawareness, write 'Hafiz' before my name even though I am not worthy of this title.' Sayyid Ayub  says that on that very same day, AlaHazrat  started memorising the Qur'an. The daily routine was most probably from after he made his wudu for Isha up until the time of Isha Jama'at. AlaHazrat  memorised one Para (Chapter) every day and so finished the 30th Para on the 30th day. On one occasion, AlaHazrat  said, 'I have managed to memorise the entire Qur'an in the correct order just so that the people of Allah  who assume that I am a Hafiz now are not proven wrong.   (Hayat-e-AlaHazrat, V1, P208, Maktaba-tul-Madina, Baab-ul-Madina Karachi)..\n\n==='''Love for the Prophet (Sallallahu Alaihi Wassallam)'''===\n\nFrom head to toe, AlaHazrat  was an example of love for the Prophet . The love that AlaHazrat  had for the Prophet  can be acknowledged by reading 'Hadaiq-e-Bakhshish', in which every line of every page is proof of the fact that the most sacred thing in the world to AlaHazrat  was the love of the Prophet . Every single verse which he  has written praising the Prophet  from the depths of his heart, testifies his immense love & admiration for the Prophet . AlaHazrat  never ever wrote flattering poems in praise of a chief or a governor to persuade or convince them of  something, because AlaHazrat  had whole-heartedly accepted the slavery, servitude and obedience of the Holy Prophet .\n\nOnce, the poets composed poems in praise & compliment of the governor of Nan-Para (district Behraich-UP). Some people requested AlaHazrat  to also compose a poem in praise of the Governor. In reply to this, AlaHazrat  wrote a Naat Shareef in the last verse of his poem, AlaHazrat very elegantly writes,\n\nAlaHazrat says why should I compliment the rich? I am a beggar of the gate of my merciful Prophet . My religion is not 'Para-e-Naan'. 'Para' means a piece and 'Naan' means 'Roti', which metaphorically implies that I will not sell myself to the worldly kings.\n\n===Translation of the Holy Qur'an===\nThe Urdu translation of the Holy Qur'an written by AlaHazrat is dominant over all present Qur'an Translations.  (Sawanih Imaam Ahmad Raza, P373, Maktaba Nooria Razaviya Sakhar) The translation written by AlaHazrat is called 'Kanzul-Imaan'. The spiritual successor of AlaHazrat , Moulana Sayyid Naeem-ud-Deen Muraadabaadi has written the commentary inside Kanzul-Imaan.''(Biography of Ala Hazrat, P7, Maktaba-tul-Madina, Baab-ul-Madina Karachi)'' \n\n===Books & Compilations===\nAlaHazrat has written approximately 1000 books. Other than this, AlaHazrat has written thousands of 'Fatawa' (rulings) from the period 1286H-1340H, but sadly, not all of them have been recovered. Those that have been, are collectively entitled as 'Al'ata yanabavia fil Fatawa-e-Razaviya'. The New Edition of 'Fatawa-e-Razaviya' consists of 30 volumes, 21656 pages, 6847 questions and answers and up to 206 booklets.   (Fatawa-e-Razaviya (New Edition) V30, P10, Raza Foundation, Markaz-ul-Auliya Lahore)  Every Fatwa contains an ocean of knowledge. You can appreciate and acknowledge the knowledge and far-sightedness of AlaHazrat      with regards to Qur'an, Hadith, Fiqh, Mantiq (logic) by studying his Fatawa.

He possessed all the conditions of a Mujaddid and his entire life was spent trying to revive the Deen of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).\nA cloud of darkness had covered most of the world and the false concepts of Polytheism (Shirk) and Innovations (Bid'at) were coming into existence. The Muslims were in a state of confusion. They were surrounded by the cloud of Kufr (Disbelief), Shirk and Bid'at. It is through the Divine Grace of Almighty Allah and the Sadaqah of the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) that the Reviver of the 14th Century, Imam-e-Ahle Sunnat, Imam Ahmed Raza Khan (radi Allahu anhu) shone like the sun. With his bright proofs, he destroyed the darkness of Kufr and revived Islam.\nProfessor Manzoorud'deen Ahmad, Vice Chancellor, University of Karachi said: \"The reality is that on reading several books of Imam Ahmed Raza, I have come to the conclusion that through his writings and speeches, the Fatawa (Inquisitions) and hundreds of small and bulky treatises, he had struggled for the revival of Islam, and as a reward he was declared as a Mujaddid of his Century by the Ulema (Scholars of Islam), in particular, the scholars of Makkah and Madina (Haramain Sharifain). . .\"\nA Hadith recorded in Mishkaat Shareef and quoted by Sayyiduna Abu Hurairah (radi Allahu anhu) who says that the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said: \"VERILY, AT THE END OF EVERY CENTURY, ALMIGHTY ALLAH WILL SEND SUCH A PERSON TO THE UMMAH, WHO WILL REVIVE THE DEEN FOR THE THEM (THE UMMAH).\"\nIn other the words, when there comes a period in which there is a shortage of knowledge and a deterioration in following of the Sunnah; when there is an increase in false innovations and ignorance; then Almighty Allah will send a person at the beginning or end of every century who will show the difference between Sunnah and Bid'at. He will refute and destroy false innovations and will fear none but Almighty Allah. He will very bravely and sincerely hoist the flag of Deen-e-Muhammadi (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). Such a person is known as a \"Mujaddid\" (Reviver) of Deen.\nThe author of the book, \"Siraajum Muneer\", has explained who a Mujaddid is in the following words: \"In other words, to revive the Deen is to revive those teachings of the Quran and Sunnah that are being destroyed and to give command according to the Quran and Sunnah.\"\nAllamah Munaadi (radi Allahu anhu) states:\"A Mujaddid is one who separates Sunnah from Bid'ah and one who degrades the status of the Ahle Bid'ah.\"\n \nWhy does a Mujaddid come after 100 years? A Mujaddid is sent after every 100 years because after every century the surroundings, the environment, the manner of thinking and ways of the people tend to pass through a massive transformation. It has been stated in the Hadith of Bukhari Shareef that during the latter stages of the Prophet's (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) physical life, one night, after performing Esha Salaah, he stood up and said, \"Should I inform you of the importance of this night? From this night onwards, right up to the end of a 100 years, that person who is alive on the earth (presently) will not be alive.\"\nCan their be more than one Mujaddid to a century? Yes. There can be more, and there has already been more than one Mujaddid to a Century. In the Hadith, the Arabic word that is used to explain the coming of the Mujaddid is in the singular tense, but according to the meaning, it is a plural as it has been explained in the Kitaabs of Usool-e-Fiqh. Allamah Mulla Ali bin Sultan Qaari (radi Allahu anhu) who is the Mujaddid of the 11th Century says, \"From the words, not only one single person is implied, but the implication is towards a group of people, from amongst whom each one is reforming a single type of knowledge or all types of knowledge in his city.\"\nA LIST OF KNOWN MUJADDIDS FROM THE FIRST CENTURY:\n\n1st CENTURY :\n\na.

He left no stone unturned in safe-guarding the dignity and integrity of Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam), in spite of being personally attacked by the misguided. These personal attacks did not bother him in the least bit!\nAllamah Abdul Hamid, Vice Chancellor of Al Jamia Al-Nizamiyya (Hyderbad, India), said: \"Mawlana Ahmed Raza Khan was a Sword of Islam and a great commander for the cause of Islam. He may justifiably be called AN INVINCIBLE FORT THAT HELPED TO DEFEND THE BASIC TENETS AND IDEAS OF THE AHLE SUNNAH WAL JAMA'AT. It is on accord of his untiring efforts that due respect and regard for the Messenger of Allah, Holy Prophet Muhammad (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) and other Sufis and Saints of Islam is still alive in the Muslim Society. His opponents had to mend their ways. No doubt he is the Imaam (Leader) of the Ahle Sunnah. His written and compiled works reflect immense depth and vision.\"\nJustice Allamah Mufti Sayyid Shuja'at Ali Qadri (radi Allahu anhu), Shariah Court, Government of Pakistan (Islamabad), said: \"He was pious like Ahmad bin Hambal and Sheikh Abdul Qaadir Jilani. He had true acumen and insight of Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Abu Yusuf. He commanded the force of logic like Imam Razi and Imam Ghazzali, bold enough like Mujaddid Alf Thaani and Mansoor Hallaj to proclaim the truth. Indeed, he was intolerant to non-believers, kind and sympathetic to devotees, and the affectionates of the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).\"\nThe adversaries of A'la Hadrat (radi Allahu anhu) levelled many accusations and tried desperately in defending their Kufr statements. After much proofs, when it became absolutely clear to A'la Hadrat (radi Allahu anhu) that certain misguided individuals were not prepared in withdrawing their Kufr statements and making Tauba, and in order to protect Islam, he passed Kufr Fatawas against those persons. We should remember that he passed the \"Fatawa-e-Takfeer\" (Kufr Fatawa) against those persons who insulted the status and dignity of Almighty Allah and His Rasool (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam). He passed the Fatawa-e-Takfeer on persons such as Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Rasheed Ahmed Gangohi and Khalil Ahmad Ambetwi and others because, through their writings, it was evident that they had insulted the Holy Prophet (sallal laahu alaihi wasallam).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Imran |first1=Mohammed |title=Mr |url=http://www.ala-hazrat.com/mujaddid.html |website=Official Website of Dargah-e-Aala Hazrat, Bareilly Shareef (India) |publisher=fficial Website of Dargah-e-Aala Hazrat, Bareilly Shareef (India) |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nKhan wrote books in Arabic, Persian and Urdu, including the thirty-volume [[fatwa]] compilation ''Fatawa Razaviyya'', and ''[[Kanzul Iman]]'' (Translation & Explanation of the [[Qur'an]]).

The solids, known as [[curd]], form a gelatinous skin over the liquid (known as [[whey]]) in the vat, which is cut into cubes with wires, allowing more whey to drain from the curds. The curds are then reheated to {{convert|120|F}} for one or two hours. In [[Iowa]] in the early 1930s, hot water was poured into the vat, which further firms the curds. Once the curds have been drained and are mostly dry the mass is pressed to further dry the curds.

Producers must be careful that the final product contains approximately 2&nbsp;ppm diacetyl, and that the ratio of diacetyl to [[acetaldehyde]] is 3&ndash;5 to 1, to achieve the typical cottage cheese flavor.

''lactis'' or ''L. lactis'' ssp.

The solids, known as [[curd]], form a gelatinous skin over the liquid (known as [[whey]]) in the vat, which is cut into cubes with wires, allowing more whey to drain from the curds. The curds are then reheated to {{convert|120|F}} for one or two hours. In [[Iowa]] in the early 1930s, hot water was poured into the vat, which further firms the curds. Once the curds have been drained and are mostly dry the mass is pressed to further dry the curds. The curds are then rinsed in water.<ref name=Flavour/><ref name=CaliDairy/><ref name=EncycloFood/><ref name=Iowa/> Finally, salt and a \"dressing\" of [[cream]] is added, and the final product is packaged and shipped for consumption.<ref name=Flavour/><ref name=AmericaLove/><ref name=Iowa/> Some modern manufactures add starches and gums to stabilize the product.

Producers must be careful that the final product contains approximately 2&nbsp;ppm diacetyl, and that the ratio of diacetyl to [[acetaldehyde]] is 3&ndash;5 to 1, to achieve the typical cottage cheese flavor. Too small a ratio and the product tastes grassy, too much and the taste becomes harsh.<ref name=Flavour/>\n\nCottage cheese is naturally a yellow colour due to the cream dressing, but to increase consumer acceptance and appeal of the final product [[titanium dioxide]] is usually added to the dressing to make it a brilliant white colour and enhance marketability of the finished product. In the United States the FDA allows the additive in many dairy products (not whole milk) up to 1% of total volume by weight, but it must be labelled in the ingredient list. It may also be used in Canada and the European Union. Relatively recently producers have added this ingredient in [[nanoparticle]] form.

They learn that the businessman, Suzuki Kazuo, is actually Sheung-hung\u2019s long lost twin brother, who ended up in Japan and was raised by an abusive Japanese father. The repeated abuse turns Kazuo into a strange and psychotic man.\nIn another mission, Kei-sang reunites with Sai-kai, but his ties with the Kuomintang puts their relationship at an impasse.
