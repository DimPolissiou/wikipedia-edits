The border to [[Switzerland]] is located 23&nbsp;km away towards the south-west.\n\n==History==\nPrutz, situated on the former [[Via Claudia Augusta]], was a resting place and later post station from [[Carolingian]] times, with favourable opportunities for the development of a settlement. The place is first recorded in 1027\u20131034 as ''locus qui dicitur Bruttes'' (\"the place called Bruttes\") in relation to a dispute over [[tithe]]s between the bishops' churches of [[Brixen]] and [[Regensburg]].<ref>{{citation|surname1=Martin Bitschnau|surname2=Hannes Obermair|title=Tiroler Urkundenbuch, II.
