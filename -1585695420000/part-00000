Shaktimaan was depicted as a human who has attained superhuman powers through [[meditation]] and five elements of nature: Space, Earth, Air, Fire, Water. [[Kitu Gidwani]] (later replaced by [[Vaishnavi Mahant]]) played the role of [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]], a [[Journalist|reporter]] who loves Shaktimaan. [[Surendra Pal]] played the role of Tamraj Kilvish. \nThe show was followed by ''[[Shaktimaan: The Animated Series]]'' in 2011, and a television film titled ''Hamara Hero Shaktimaan'' in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\nSince the dawn of mankind, humanity was at peace until the arrival of [[Kali Yuga]]. Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear.

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1. Muladhar Chakra *\n\nThis gives control over the Earth element.\n\nPhysical force like gravitation, gravitational force etc.\n\n*2. Swadhishthan *\n\nWater element control\n\nJalajgraman, living in water, fearlessness etc.\n\n* 3 Manipura Chakra *\n\nFire control\n\nComplete knowledge of yoga, without living water, food or living of air, travel by sky, journey of invisibility, velocity equal to light, knowledge of all languages, knowledge of languages of birds and tree plants\n\nNature control such as climate climatic earthquake, leadership capacity, hypnotism, meditation, removal of all types of rays such as xray vision, medicine as well as knowledge of Ayurveda\n\n* 4. [[Anahata (Heart Chakra)|Anahata Chakra]] *\n\nAir control\n\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, Proximity to Brahma, Trikalagalyta, Doordarshan, Kalnagna, Time Control, such as Time Travel\n\nTelepathy, foreign entry (entering the living or dead body of another)\n\nKnowledge of the action of cosmic intersection, going into different planets, stars, realms, and multiverse, entering 26 dimensions, watching the above-mentioned places from a distance\n\nTo see the invisible, the philosophy of Goddesses, rejuvenation, attracting all, the pace of mind, the meditation and manifestation,\n\nHypnotism\n\n* 5 vishuddh chakra *\n\nSky control\n\nThe establishment of Saraswati, which has knowledge of ancient and modern science\n\nThe ability to betray, curse and boast\nKnowledge of entire texts\nLiterature composition, stream flow discourse,\nSong music and dance art\nTo hold many bodies like yours or different\n\nOn the other hand, Hanuman ji swallowed the sun upon the desire to make the body bigger by the desire.\n\nKnowing the subtle mysteries of the universe,\n\nRevealing any substance from zero, turning one thing into another,\n\nChange of form, philosophy of brahman\n\nEuthanasia (immortality), hypnosis and hipnotism\n\n* 6. Agya chakra *\n\nControl over the whole universe\n\nDevour someone\n\nAwakening of ternate\n\nTo give someone infinite powers, to make their own, to make the unsuccessful success, to remove all types of rays, such as power rays, xray vision, becoming like God, attaining Brahmana\n\n* 7. Sahasrara Chakra *\n\nControl over entire universes (multiverses)\n\nAbility to compose, follow, and destroy the universe\n\nTo be equal to Parabrahma, infinite power, nature is adorned for obedience\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted a different identity as\nPandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics. Later she teamed up with Gangadhar again and joined ''KR TV''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtPBVkdn6Yc&list|title=shaktimaan 22 12 2010 0002|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> as a television reporter while working for the comics simultaneously.\n\n<sup>\u2021</sup>&nbsp;\u2013 ''When the journalist character Geeta Vishwas was written out of the series, fan protests prompted the producers to bring her back.''<ref name=interview>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiantelevision.com/interviews/actor/vaishnavi.htm |title=An Interview with vaishnavi Mahant |publisher=Indiantelevision.com |date=12 October 2001 |accessdate=7 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Enemies ===\n\n==== Main enemies ====\n; Jackal and Kilvish\nTamraj Kilvish is Shaktimaan's archenemy. Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others. He also invented a height control solution and fictional EC- rays.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l14zW_E1VzI|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 120|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83uDEE69YlY|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 28|publisher=YouTube.com 3 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buecO_bwsls|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 301|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-lG6uoeh7E|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 162|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVVTrBXe18s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 38|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJf6yZZdkes|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 41 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDNhyZ5abCE|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 42 |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Sahab\nSahab is an organised criminal and drug lord. Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him.

Shaktimaan was depicted as a human who has attained superhuman powers through [[meditation]] and five elements of nature: Space, Earth, Air, Fire, Water. [[Kitu Gidwani]] (later replaced by [[Vaishnavi Mahant]]) played the role of [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]], a [[Journalist|reporter]] who loves Shaktimaan. [[Surendra Pal]] played the role of Tamraj Kilvish. \nThe show was followed by ''[[Shaktimaan: The Animated Series]]'' in 2011, and a television film titled ''Hamara Hero Shaktimaan'' in 2013.\n\n== Plot ==\nSince the dawn of mankind, humanity was at peace until the arrival of [[Kali Yuga]]. Since then, greed and hatred has taken over humanity and has been deteriorating it for past 6000 years. To end this, a mystical sect of saints known as \"Suryanshis\" chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society. He was taught the way to energise the 7 chakras of body through Kundalini Yoga that helped him get mystical and supernatural powers. During his training, he also conducted the ritual of death in order to get total control over his powers by entering the holy fire and immersing his physical body in it. When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a [[Superhuman]]. At last, he takes a pledge to finish corruption and injustice in society and fight the evil prevailing in the world. Due to his heroic initial works, he is named Shaktimaan by a reporter, [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. Later, it is revealed that\nShaktimaan was the rebirth of Shri Satya who was part of the Suryanshi Sect during the Mahabharata era 5,000 years ago.\n\nHis alter-ego is a funny geek named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri, who works as a photographer in a daily newspaper office to maintain his secret identity as Shaktimaan and speaks pure [[Hindi]].\n\nShaktimaan's nemesis is Tamraj Kilvish, who is the living embodiment of the evil and dark forces of the world.\n\nShaktimaan is another common human being, but reincarnation of Shri Satya, but has got his internal spiritual powers ignited with the continuous and typical practice of [[Hindu Philosophy|Hindu philosophical]] and cultural values system and activities like [[Yoga|Yog Sadhna]] and [[Meditation]]. Also, he follows the morals and ethical values of truth, non-violence, and values stated in books like the [[Bhagavad Gita]].\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Mukesh Khanna]] as Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri / Shaktimaan, Major Ranjeet Singh (Shaktimaan's Father), Shree Satya (Previous Incarnation of Shaktimaan), Evil Clone Shaktimaan\n* [[Kitu Gidwani]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 1-16)\n* [[Vaishnavi Mahant]] as Geeta Vishwas (Episode 16-520)\n* [[Surendra Pal]] as Tamraj Kilvish / Guru Sarvagya\n* [[Tom Alter]] as Mahaguru\n* [[Lalit Parimoo]] as Dr. Jaikaal\n* [[Arun Bakshi]] as Dr. Jaikaal (in last few episodes)\n* Raman Khatri as Sahab / Kumar Ranjan\n* Sharad Smart as Satyaprakash Nirala, the 1st editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Raju Shrivastav]] as Durandhar Singh, the 2nd editor of ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Manjeet Kullar]] as Kaushalya / Maharani Shavalika, Shaktimaan's biological mother\n* [[Ashwini Kalsekar]] as Shalaaka / Kaali Billi\n* [[Dolly Minhas]] as Shaliyaa / Safed Billi, elder sister and guardian of Shalaaka\n* [[Kishore Bhanushali]] as Naurangee the thief\n* [[Rajendra Gupta]] as Prof. Vishwas, paranormal scientist, Geeta Vishwas's father.\n* Jay Mishra as Ghosh Babu\n* [[Nawab Shah (actor)|Nawab Shah]] as Mayor JJ \"Jai Kumar Janardhan\" / Kakodar\n* [[Deepshikha Nagpal]] as Paroma and Sheraali (dual roles)\n* Sunila Karambelkar as Queen Mayaadri and Natasha in starting episodes\n* Brij Mohan Pandey as Bankelal / Toyman\n* Sanjeev Chaddha as Shudhanshu ji\n* Ajit Mehra as Shwami Ji\n* [[Arun Bali]] as Dayal Chopra, Businessman and owner of Aaj Ki Awaz\n* [[Zahida Parveen]] as Nisha Saluja, reporter who replaced Geeta at Aaj Ki Awaz\n* Hemal Dharia as Hemal\n* Sharad Smart as Satya Prakash Nirala\n* Urmila Amar as Leela Lautekar\n*[[Nupur Alankar]] as Kaamini, Film gossip writer at ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''\n* [[Shikha Swaroop]] as Alien (special appearance)\n* [[Goga Kapoor]] as Bilas Rao\n* Zeena Bhatia as Matandeeka Witch\n* [[Deepraj Rana]] as Inspector Jai Singh, a Corrupt Police officer.\n* [[Urvashi Dholakia]] as Maansi Sharma\n* Annu Kashyap as Teemira / Behroopia\n* [[Neelam Mehra]] as Maansi\n* Shravani Goswami as Shalini (Bengali Bahu)\n* Durgesh Nandini as Rachna (Punjabi Bahu)\n* Manav Sohal as Shalini's husband\n\n== Production ==\n''Shaktimaan'' was conceptualised by Khanna in 1981, when he was working on a film with [[Rajshri Productions]]. He narrated the idea to producer Rajkumar Barjatya, who liked it, and the two adapted it into a film titled ''Akash''. In November 1997, ''[[Screen (magazine)|Screen]]'' reported quoted him: \"I would watch my nephew sitting glued to the TV whenever ''Power Zone'' came on, shooting with imaginary [[laser guns]], or operating some imaginary hi-fi gadget in his own little world. That's when it struck me that if I made ''Shaktimaan'' I would have a readymade audience of kids who are always most impressed with [[Special effects|SFX]] tricks.\" Over the development of the titular character, Khanna said, \"In Indian mythology there are a lot of strong characters but no super-heroes. All we get to see are [[Superman]] or [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]], who are alien concepts. That's why I decided to create an Indian super-hero, Shaktimaan, who is born out of a [[yagna]], and a result of all the creative energies of the universe. A superhero who can fly...disappear. And when he is not in his super-hero [[Dual role|avataar]] he's a bumbling photographer who always misses scoop much to the chagrin of his boss Kitu Gidwani.\" He added that the attire of Shaktimaan's alter ego, \"complete with buck teeth and floppy hair\" was inspired by American comedian [[Jerry Lewis]].<ref name=\"screen\">{{cite web |title=Mukesh Khanna: No More Mthologicals |url=http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |website=Screen |accessdate=14 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031031211440/http://www.screenindia.com/nov14/tele1.htm |archivedate=31 October 2003 |date=November 1997}}</ref>\n\nHaving wanted the \"best ever\" special effects seen on Indian television, following the series' airing, Khanna felt that it \"[fell] short of [his] expectations\". He added, \"When I had planned the serial I wanted the kind of special effects seen in ''Superman'', ''Spiderman'' and ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]''. Maybe I was too ambitious. [[Computer graphics]] has just arrived in India and there is lack of trained professionals here.\" He further said, the special effects for each episode costed him {{INR}}2 [[lakh]], and {{INR}}10 lakh overall.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\nIn 2004 Sign language interpretation was launched for the social message given in the end of the episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040201/spectrum/tv.htm|title=The Sunday Tribune - Spectrum - Television|website=www.tribuneindia.com}}</ref>\n\nThe series was sponsored by [[Parle-G]] from its first episode.<ref name=\"screen\"/>\n\nIn 2019, Mukesh Khanna revealed through his YouTube channel that the show had to be cancelled because the high broadcasting charges were bringing him losses, and not due to complaints of children imitating stunts from the show as popularly believed.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/bollywood/mukesh-khanna-on-shaktimaan-why-this-show-off-air|title=14 \u0938\u093e\u0932 \u092c\u093e\u0926 \u092e\u0941\u0915\u0947\u0936 \u0916\u0928\u094d\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0947 \u092c\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926, \u0907\u0938 \u0935\u091c\u0939 \u0938\u0947 \u092c\u0902\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u093e \u092a\u0921\u093c\u093e \u0925\u093e '\u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u092e\u093e\u0928'|newspaper=[[Amar Ujala]]}}</ref>\n\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe series ran for 450 episodes from 13 September 1997 to 27 March 2005 on [[DD National]].<ref name=\"date\"/> Reruns of the series also aired on   [[STAR Utsav]] and [[Dangal TV]].<ref name=\"archive.org12\">{{cite web|url=http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516180410/http://app.indya.com:80/epg/asp/displaySchedules.asp?ddChannelName=starutsav|archivedate=2009-05-16|title=STAR - Programme Guide|date=16 May 2009|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> \n\nRe-edited version of the series premiered on [[Pogo TV]] in 2006, The series was also dubbed in English language for the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/west-bengal/screen-on-off/cid/1275205|title=Screen On & Off|website=www.telegraphindia.com}}</ref><ref name=\"archive.org18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218185837/http://www.pogo.tv/tvschedule|archivedate=2015-02-18|title=TV Schedule - POGO!

They are followers of the star ''Sun''. As part of training, he trained with [[Kundalini Yoga]] to awake the 7 chakras of body and gain 'supernatural' powers from them. To gain complete control over his powers he performed the ritual of death. However, this did not cause death but made him more alive than when he was a normal man. He also performed [[Yajna]] in which he entered the fire himself and dissolved his body in fire. Then, the five elements of life, i.e. fire, wind, water, earth, sky revived his body giving him special powers from them. Thus after leaving his mortal body he was given a superhuman form to fight against the evil in the world as Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgrZ2ofIcT8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 1|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Shaktimaan was created he set out to destroy his archenemy Kilvish. But, as the Mahaguru ([[Tom Alter]]) explained, Kilvish can only be defeated after evil is destroyed. Shaktimaan's mission is to destroy the sin within people, not the sinned people. Shaktimaan's adventures show him pursuing justice and saving his friends while Kilvish and his minions plot to defeat him.\n\n=== Powers ===\nShaktimaan has superhuman powers which lie inside his body in his seven chakras of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] attained through meditation. Shaktimaan worships God through the symbol [[Om]]. Truthfulness is his motto. He can even separate his body into five different bodies of fire, wind, water, earth and sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuTDNEmCzB8|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 43|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> He is an expert, skilled and intelligent fighter and has fought with super-skilled enemies. He possesses physical powers like unlimited speed (up to the speed of light), strength, durability as well as psychic powers like telepathy, teleportation, telekinesis etc.\nAlthough he possesses godlike powers, his only weakness is a crystal (Papmani) possessed by Tamraj Kilvish which can be used to defeat and even kill him. This makes him powerless because it is filled with the evil of the world and is the source of the black powers. But he regains his strength after the crystal is taken away from him. He can be killed if the crystal is placed in front of him and he is treated violently to the verge of death. Shaktimaan also gets brief premonitions about the incidents that are going to happen to him in future. This can be observed in kashtak's episode, Geeta going to jail and in kapala's reappearance episodes.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cuwX6vm8dqw | title = Shaktimaan episode 172}}</ref>\n\nShaktimaan's powers are virtually limitless. He can do practically anything he imagines. The only limit to his powers is his own belief in himself and his knowledge of how to manifest his powers. His powers come from his chakras. (Note: Although we'll call them chakras in the vedas, in the series dialogue they will also be called energy centers.)\n\nThe seven chakras in his body which give him powers are:\n* Energy Chakra (1): This chakra gives Shaktimaan super strength enabling him to fly, shoot fire from his hands, emit rays from his fingertips, blow a stream of freezing air, or send out protective force fields which nothing can penetrate (provided he can maintain his willpower and not give in). Shaktimaan's strength allows him to physically penetrate anything and lift any object.\n* Creative Chakra (2): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to manifest things out of thin air.\n* Astral Chakra (3): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control his astral body (a semi-transparent, ethereal duplicate of himself) which can fly, walk through walls, see inside objects, etc.\n* Heart Chakra (4): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control the will of others, but only for good. He can will people to do the right thing, see the error in their ways. This power is most useful when Shaktimaan needs to stop someone who is under the control of Kilvish from doing evil.\n* Vibration Chakra (5): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power to control all types of vibrations, including sound waves, light waves, healing warmth, etc. He can also use it to hear ultrasonic sounds, and can speed up the vibrations of his own atoms allowing him to transport himself in space or time. This can be very useful for getting out of dangerous situations.\n* Psychic Chakra (6): This chakra gives Shaktimaan the power of the \"third eye\" which enables him to read minds and see anywhere in the world at any distance. He can sense impending danger and see things at any corner of the world.\n\nThe source of power of Shaktimaan is Kundalini,\n\nThere are seven chakras in the Kundalini\n\n* 1. Muladhar Chakra *\n\nThis gives control over the Earth element.\n\nPhysical force like gravitation, gravitational force etc.\n\n*2. Swadhishthan *\n\nWater element control\n\nJalajgraman, living in water, fearlessness etc.\n\n* 3 Manipura Chakra *\n\nFire control\n\nComplete knowledge of yoga, without living water, food or living of air, travel by sky, journey of invisibility, velocity equal to light, knowledge of all languages, knowledge of languages of birds and tree plants\n\nNature control such as climate climatic earthquake, leadership capacity, hypnotism, meditation, removal of all types of rays such as xray vision, medicine as well as knowledge of Ayurveda\n\n* 4. [[Anahata (Heart Chakra)|Anahata Chakra]] *\n\nAir control\n\nNirvikalpa Samadhi, Proximity to Brahma, Trikalagalyta, Doordarshan, Kalnagna, Time Control, such as Time Travel\n\nTelepathy, foreign entry (entering the living or dead body of another)\n\nKnowledge of the action of cosmic intersection, going into different planets, stars, realms, and multiverse, entering 26 dimensions, watching the above-mentioned places from a distance\n\nTo see the invisible, the philosophy of Goddesses, rejuvenation, attracting all, the pace of mind, the meditation and manifestation,\n\nHypnotism\n\n* 5 vishuddh chakra *\n\nSky control\n\nThe establishment of Saraswati, which has knowledge of ancient and modern science\n\nThe ability to betray, curse and boast\nKnowledge of entire texts\nLiterature composition, stream flow discourse,\nSong music and dance art\nTo hold many bodies like yours or different\n\nOn the other hand, Hanuman ji swallowed the sun upon the desire to make the body bigger by the desire.\n\nKnowing the subtle mysteries of the universe,\n\nRevealing any substance from zero, turning one thing into another,\n\nChange of form, philosophy of brahman\n\nEuthanasia (immortality), hypnosis and hipnotism\n\n* 6. Agya chakra *\n\nControl over the whole universe\n\nDevour someone\n\nAwakening of ternate\n\nTo give someone infinite powers, to make their own, to make the unsuccessful success, to remove all types of rays, such as power rays, xray vision, becoming like God, attaining Brahmana\n\n* 7. Sahasrara Chakra *\n\nControl over entire universes (multiverses)\n\nAbility to compose, follow, and destroy the universe\n\nTo be equal to Parabrahma, infinite power, nature is adorned for obedience\n\n=== Personal life ===\nTo avoid being an easy prey of Tamraj Kilvish, Shaktimaan adopted a different identity as\nPandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri in the society. The character Gangadhar is completely opposite to that of Shaktimaan in all aspects e.g. appearance, intelligence while he speaks pure [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. Whenever he gets any important job to do, he says that he has written a book on it which had never been published. Staying in the society as a common person helped him to get knowledge about crime. He got a job of a photographer for the newspaper ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' after being interviewed by [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]]. After a few weeks, he became a co-reporter working with Geeta. Through a series of incidents and the fact that he could never capture a photo of Shaktimaan, Geeta came to know about the dual identity of Shaktimaan, which was previously known only to Suryanshis. After ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, Gangadhar became a Hindi professor at a junior college. Later, he left the college to work for a news channel ''KR TV'' with Geeta.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Main characters ===\n\n==== Geeta Vishwas ====\nGeeta Vishwas ([[Vaishnavi Mahant]], previously [[Kitu Gidwani]]), the female lead in the serial, used to work as a brave news reporter in ''Aaj Ki Awaaz''. She was the first to report about Shaktimaan in newspaper and named the superhero as ''Shaktimaan''. Incidentally, she was the only reporter to get interviews of Shaktimaan as Gangadhar used to accompany her as photographer in missions. She died in a crash planned by Dr. Jackal.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0r8M4plt9c|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 101|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref> As Shaktimaan loved her, he brought her back to life again using his power which resulted in losing his powers temporarily due to his ''against the nature actions''. Geeta came to know about this after Shaktimaan regained power with the vow that he will never repeat the same mistake again. To ensure this, she planned to leave the country. In the lead up to that situation, she got to know about Shaktimaan's dual character for the third time. But unlike first two occasions, Shaktimaan didn't erase it from Geeta's memory this time as she promised to keep it secret forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9y8GUm3-UbA|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 109|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nOne year later<sup>\u2021</sup>, after ''Aaj Ki Awaaz'' was shut down, its staff members persuaded Geeta in returning to India to join them to release Shaktimaan comics.

Tamraj means King of Darkness (''tama'' = darkness, ''raj'' = king). He has lived 6000 years and is the source of evil in the world. He intends to rule the world by spreading darkness, hatred, sin and evil. It is said that the source of his strength is one-half of the \"Shakti Punj\" (the half which is referred to as \"shaktiman\") which he managed to retain after he originally obtained the entire Shakti Punj by deceit from Shri Satya (Satya means truth), the founder of the Suryavanshi. However, it is also mentioned that the source of his strength is the evil that is committed by people in this world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB9JLeGRUIk|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 70|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nIt was later revealed that only Shri Satya can kill Tamraj Kilvish. After a death-defying adventure, Shaktimaan was told that he is the rebirth of Shri Satya. Shri Satya had given the exact time of the child's birth and the place before he died about 6000 years ago. Tamraj also knows this and this is the main reason he is frightened by the appearance of Shaktimaan as he knows that only Shaktimaan can kill Tamraj. He murdered Shaktimaan's parents and his adoptive father, Pandit Vidyadhar Shastri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/s/shakti.htm |title=International Hero&nbsp;\u2013 Shaktimaan |accessdate=25 November 2011}}</ref> He and his minions plot to kill him but always fail. His minions include Electric-man (who can shoot lightning bolts from his body), Stone-man (who can shoot stones from his body), Plastica (who can stretch any part of her body), Dr. Jackal (an evil scientist) and others. Dr. Jackal has helped Kilvish in his various schemes by cloning Shaktimaan and also by turning aliens against him.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |newspaper=Indian Express |title=Bad Boys |date=21 June 2006 |author=Tushar Abhichandani |accessdate=23 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060919194526/http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=189133 |archivedate=19 September 2006  }}</ref>\n\nIn the television series, Kilvish is often treated as the personification of darkness itself even though he was once a human being who later becomes very powerful and commits many evil deeds. In an attempt to become immortal, he left his mortal body and took an ethereal body which can't be killed but Shaktimaan is told that he has to kill all the evil in the world to destroy Tamraj's ethereal body. Kilvish's trademark quote is \"Andhera Kaayam Rahe\" (May Darkness Prevail), which is also used by his followers.\n\nKilvish's character evolves as the series progresses. In the beginning episodes of Shaktimaan, his face is never shown and his voice is different from the voice that he uses in the later episodes of Shaktimaan, in which his role is played by [[Surendra Pal]]. Later his face deforms to become a distorted wolf-like face.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bakwaasbybiswas.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/kilwis.jpg|title=Bakwaas by Biswas (WordPress blog)|accessdate= 13 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Dr. Jackal\nDr. Jackal is an evil scientist who works for Kilvish. His earlier intention was not that of becoming evil, but when he was denied scholarship for research, Kilvish provided him with funds and labs, thus making him a supporter of Kilvish & an evil scientist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iof2Ce4egp8|title=Shaktimaan Episode&nbsp;\u2013 224|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\nThough he is overall a brilliant scientist, his specialisation is cloning and various energy rays.\nHis creations against Shaktimaan include Kekda Man (a clone formed by fusing cells of Crab & human), followed by Jonk Jonkaa (a clone using leech), an evil clone of Shaktimaan, Plastica,\nLightman, 3D image, Super-heroine Sunanda and others.

Like Shaktimaan he also possesses double identity, the other being that of a law-abiding industrialist and Mayor, known as Kumar Ranjan. Except for Tamraj Kilvish (and later Dr. Jackal), no one knows that Sahab and Kumar Ranjan are the same person, thus making this his biggest strength. Through his criminal mind, Sahab keeps plotting ways to create trouble for Shaktimaan or to defame him and to find out about the real identity of Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsseb6UtzyA&list|title=shaktimaan 10 1 2011 0002|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Other enemies ====\n; Kakodar\nKakodar is a sorcerer with the visage of a devil who was imprisoned in a statue nearly five hundred years ago. He could only be freed if a good person removes a thread from his neck. It is unclear whether he was cursed by an enemy or punished by Tamraj to end up imprisoned. In the present day, the mayor of Mumbai, Jai Kumar Janardhan a.k.a. JJ (Nawab Shah) was deceived by his personal assistant Mathur (Deepak Bhatia) to break the thread and free him. Mayor JJ died in shock at seeing Kakodar's true form. As instructed by Madhur, Kakodar possessed JJ's body and decided to spread ''Andhera'' (darkness).\n\nHe was the primary super villain in the first part of the series as he uses JJ's wealth and power to hatch plots to kill Shaktimaan but always failed. Unlike most of other assailants of Shaktimaan, he is very sharp and analytical. He even tries to approach Tarendra, an all knowing sentient being of light, to know the truth about Shaktimaan. He is cunning enough to be able to use mental manipulation to trick Shaktimaan on occasion. This put the hero into a dilemma, and self-doubt drained him of his powers temporarily.\n\nThe full extent of his powers is not revealed. On an occasion, JJ's girlfriend Zuby realises that JJ is possessed by a demon and tries to reveal him in public. He uses hypnosis to drive her mad so that the public will ignore her statements. He has a potent and fatal poison inside him that he can spit out of his mouth which affects everyone except Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan and Kakodar end things in a fight when Kakodar turns into his real form and Shaktimaan turns him back to a statue.\n\n; Natasha\nNatasha (Sunila) was also a demonic evil woman sent by Kilvish. Along with Mathur she serves JJ/Kakodar. She was JJ's secretary before he was possessed. She has the ability to change her appearance. She kills a C.B.I. officer and takes her appearance to interrogate Gangadhar and Geeta on one occasion. Her powers were greatly diminished due to Shaktimaan defeating Kakodar. To regain power she and Madhur decide to sacrifice Shaktimaan. For this they kidnap the son of a scientist to get the formula of ''invisible man'' which may help defeating Shaktimaan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dHANSmJg6A|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 24 |publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Madhur\nMadhur (Deepak Bhatia) is one of the two trusted demonic accomplices of JJ/Kakodar along with Natasha. He initially served JJ as his personal assistant (PA) before he was possessed, but was secretly preparing the stage for Kakodar's entry under Tamraj's directions. His true identity is revealed after Kakodar is released from his imprisonment. Not many of his powers are revealed in the series. He has the ability to change his appearance at will, but not shape shift to assume someone else's body. He also loses his powers when Kakodar was defeated by Shaktimaan.\n\n; Electric-man\nHe was the first synthetic villain faced by Shaktimaan. Dr. Chandola, an evil scientist, created him. Dr. Chandola claims that Electric man was his son, whom he killed so that he can resurrect the dead body with electricity. When he comes to life he kills Dr. Chandola. Without recognising friend from foe he kills everyone in his path and spreads destruction in the city. His powers include shooting electricity from eyes and electrocution on contact. Finding him difficult to restrain, Shaktimaan grabs him and tunnels deep into the earth, pushing him deep underground.\n\n; Kapala\nKapala is a corrupted tantrik who serves Tamraj Kilvish. His primary skill is his shape shifting to inanimate objects such as vehicles and weapons. He also has many other magical devices and servants under his control. One such device is metal plate he wears around his neck that has the power to steal his opponent's strength. The villain Stone man was created from his magic skull. Shaktimaan destroys both the metal plate and the magic skull. He has an odd sense of humor as he makes jokes while fighting Shaktimaan. There are occasions where he serves as a comic relief. This is in contrast to other villains who are stark and serious. He also has a very fragile ego and falls victim to taunts. His main accessory is a trident. Shaktimaan eventually turns him into stone and shatters him at one instance. However, in later episodes of Shaktimaan, he is shown resurrected back to life. He is played by Faqira.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41PAj7P6qKk&list|title=shaktimaan 28 12 2010 0003|publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUChETYxkQo|title=shaktimaan 8 12 2010 0001 |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Khali-Bali\nKhali and Bali are two dwarvish green and red imps. Their names originate from the Urdu word Khalbali which means commotion. Throughout their appearances they constantly argue and reconcile with each other over inane reasons. They claim to eat humans but there is no evidence regarding the same. They can combine to form a single full size demon. This demon wears a green and red garb. Their power is insignificant when they are separated but when they both combine they become as physically strong as a full-fledged demon. Not much is shown regarding any psychic powers they possess.\n\n; Kashtak\nDuring an archaeological dig in the ''qila''(fort) at Bhangdu Khati, the lead archaeologist Prof. Hussain and his assistant Hema discover a sarcophagus and a mysteriously untarnished sword made out of an unknown metal in the ruins. Hema accidentally opens the sarcophagus and unleashes Kashtak, a servant of Tamraj Kilvish. Kashtak used to terrorise the world and was imprisoned nearly 2500 years ago by the curse of Komalatha, a lady sage. [[Shaktimaan#Geeta Vishwas|Geeta Vishwas]] turns out to be the reincarnation of Komalatha. His sword ''Khadgi'' has many powers imbued in them such as telekinesis, petrification and resurrection and control of his army. In the series it is enhanced with the power of mind control by Tamraj. When he controls the mind of a scientist to create a weapon of mass destruction, Shaktimaan stops him .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVda1QKR54s|title=Shaktimaan : Episode 30|publisher=YouTube.com  |accessdate= 31 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n; Kekda Man\nKekda man (Crab man) is one of the two dangerous clones of Dr. Jackal (along with Jonk Jonkaa). He is a clone created by Dr. Jackal by fusing cells of crab and a kidnapped Suryanshi. Dr. Jackal managed to twist the mind of the pure Suryanshi to become the Kekda man. He can breathe fire which contains an extremely dangerous poison that even impeded Shaktimaan. Shaktimaan left an illusion of him behind and narrowly escaped.

Shaktimaan is however captured in a flying prison in the process.\n\n; Evil clone Shaktimaan\nAfter capturing Shaktimaan, Dr. Jackal makes a clone of him, but twists his mind to be a servant of darkness. The evil clone is created stronger than Shaktimaan, and is unleashed on the world. When the real Shaktimaan escapes his prison, he challenges the evil clone to a fight. He then captures the clone and sends him into deep space.\n\n; Shalaka\nShalaka is a cat girl who has pledged to eliminate Shaktimaan.

As a teenager, Stefano was so keen to become an actor that he dropped out of high school two weeks before graduation and traveled to [[New York City]]. In Manhattan he adopted the stage name Jerry Stevens.\n\nStefano's initial career was as a composer of [[pop music]] in the 1940s, writing songs for Las Vegas showman [[Donn Arden]]. In possession of a large collection of sheet music, he once spent five hours challenging pianist [[Michael Feinstein]] on names of obscure [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs.\n\n==Career as screenwriter, producer and director==\nStefano began writing movie scripts in the late 1950s, firstly for [[Martin Ritt]] with ''[[The Black Orchid (film)|The Black Orchid]]'' (1959); his father was a tailor, and his mother made silk flowers and this was an influence on the screenplay.\n\nStefano was commissioned by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] to adapt [[Robert Bloch]]'s novel ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' (1960) for the screen. His work was recognized by the [[Mystery Writers of America]] when he was given a 1961 [[Edgar Award]], for Best Motion Picture Screenplay. Stefano appears briefly onscreen, discussing Bloch's utilization of the basis of the character Norman Bates in the crimes of [[serial killer]] [[Ed Gein]], in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003 film)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'' (2003).\n\nStefano was also offered the job of scripting Hitchcock's ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) and ''[[Marnie (film)|Marnie]]'' (1964), but was already committed to produce and write for his friend [[Leslie Stevens]]' [[science fiction television]] anthology series ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''. Both Stefano and Stevens were involved only during the first season of the show. In the book ''[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0983205604 Writing with Hitchcock]'', Stefano said that Hitchcock held a grudge over his being unavailable to write the screenplay for ''Marnie''.\n\nAfter leaving the series due to network interference and exhaustion, Stefano wrote, produced and directed ''[[The Ghost of Sierra de Cobre]]'' (1964; aka ''The Haunted''), a film utilizing many of the crew responsible for ''The Outer Limits''. The [[thriller film|thriller]] ''[[Eye of the Cat]]'' (1969) and the [[comedy film|comedy]] ''Futz'' (1969) were Stefano's last big-screen jobs for many years. Throughout the 1970s, he wrote many [[television film]]s such as ''[[Revenge!]]'' (1971), ''[[A Death of Innocence]]'' (1971), ''[[Home for the Holidays (1972 film)|Home for the Holidays]]'' (1972), ''[[Live Again, Die Again]]'' (1974), ''Aloha Means Goodbye'' (1974) and ''[[Snowbeast]]'' (1977). Stefano also wrote one episode for the first season of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (1988) entitled \"[[Skin of Evil]]\". Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Stefano was one of the Guests of Honor at the 1974 NY Telefantasy Convention (along with [[Noel Neill]], Jim Danforth and William Tuttle), and spent hours signing autographs for hundreds of ''Outer Limits'' fans. At the show, he expressed his surprise that so many people still remembered the series almost a decade after its cancellation.\n\nIn 1990, he revisited the characters from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' with the TV movie script for the [[prequel]], in what he believed had become an increasingly disappointing series of films. ''[[Psycho IV: The Beginning]]'' (1990) posits the origins of [[Norman Bates]]' destructive mother-love, featuring [[Olivia Hussey]] as Mrs. Bates. Stefano wrote and executive produced the [[Al Pacino]] [[drama]] ''[[Two Bits]]'' (1995), a personal project that fared poorly at the box-office and with critics, leaving Stefano less than enthusiastic about continuing to write for modern Hollywood. [[Gus Van Sant]]'s remake of ''[[Psycho (1998 film)|Psycho]]'' (1998) followed Stefano's script punctiliously, and in the biopic ''[[Hitchcock (film)|Hitchcock]]'' (2012), about the making of ''Psycho,'' he is portrayed by [[Ralph Macchio]].\n\nStefano died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at [[Los Robles Hospital]] in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], in 2006.\n\n==''The Outer Limits''==\nStefano was a producer for the first season of ''The Outer Limits'' and wrote a total of 12 episodes. They are:\n*\"[[Nightmare (1963 The Outer Limits)|Nightmare]]\"\n*\"[[It Crawled Out of the Woodwork]]\"\n*\"[[The Zanti Misfits]]\"\n*\"[[The Mice (The Outer Limits)|The Mice]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[Don't Open Till Doomsday]]\"\n*\"[[The Invisibles (The Outer Limits)|The Invisibles]]\"\n*\"[[The Bellero Shield]]\" (story & teleplay)\n*\"[[Moonstone (The Outer Limits)|Moonstone]]\" (story)\n*\"[[Fun and Games (The Outer Limits)|Fun and Games]]\" (teleplay)\n*\"[[A Feasibility Study]]\"\n*\"[[The Chameleon (The Outer Limits)|The Chameleon]]\" (story)\n*\"[[The Forms of Things Unknown]]\"\nThe last episode was originally a pilot for a proposed TV series called ''The Unknown'', but after ABC rejected it, Stefano reworked it as the season one finale.\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Films===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
