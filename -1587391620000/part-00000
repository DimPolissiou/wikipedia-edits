The principal islands are [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]], [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and [[Bryher]]. The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} farther south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition.

Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018). ''The British Civil Wars at Sea, 1638-1653.''

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles. Winters are, by far, the warmest in the country due to the moderating effects of the ocean, and despite being on exactly the same latitude as [[Winnipeg]] in Canada, snow and frost are extremely rare. The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

The principal islands are [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]], [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] and [[Bryher]]. The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} farther south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

The men of this island even now preserve an old custom: they do not use coins. They give and accept, obtaining the necessities of life [[barter|by exchange]] rather than by money.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.)

In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles. Winters are, by far, the warmest in the country due to the moderating effects of the ocean, and despite being on exactly the same latitude as [[Winnipeg]] in Canada, snow and frost are extremely rare. The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].<ref name=iossb>{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>  There is currently no Sunday air transport.\n\nAt present all air and sea, passenger and freight transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland is owned by one company - The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company.  This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

(The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend.

After the death of Ashoka (232 BCE), as the Maurya Empire began to weaken and decline, the [[S\u0101tav\u0101hanas]] who started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, declared independence and established their empire in this region. The [[S\u0101tav\u0101hana Empire]] was a royal Indian dynasty based from [[Kotilingala]] in Telangana as well as Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra.

After the death of Ashoka (232 BCE), as the Maurya Empire began to weaken and decline, the [[S\u0101tav\u0101hanas]] who started out as feudatories to the Mauryan dynasty, declared independence and established their empire in this region. The [[S\u0101tav\u0101hana Empire]] was a royal Indian dynasty based from [[Kotilingala]] in Telangana as well as Junnar (Pune) and Prathisthan (Paithan) in Maharashtra. The territory of the empire covered much of the [[Deccan plateau]] & [[central India]] for 450 years,i.e., from 230 BCE onward until around 220 CE. After the decline of the Satavahana Empire in 210 AD, the region came under the rule of the [[Ikshvaku]] dynasty (225 AD \u2013 325 AD), the successors of the Satavahanas in eastern Deccan. The capital of [[Ikshvaku]] dynasty was the town of [[Nagarjunakonda]] in modern-day Guntur district and named after [[Nagarjuna]], a southern Indian master of [[Mahayana Buddhism]] who lived in the 2nd century AD, who is believed to have been responsible for the Buddhist activity in the area.\n\n==Medieval history==\n\n\nVarious Buddhist and Hindu kingdoms ruled the area during the subsequent centuries. The area was ruled by the [[Kalyani Chalukya|Kalyani]] branch of the [[Chalukya]] kings. When the [[Chalukya]] kingdom became weaker, [[Kakatiya]]s, who were feudal chieftains of Chalukya, declared independence and set up their kingdom around [[Warangal]].\n\nThe Kakatiyas built the [[Golkonda]] Fort in the vicinity of Hyderabad as part of their western defenses along the lines of the [[Kondapalli Fort]]. The city and the fortress were built on a [[granite]] hill that is {{convert|120|m|ft}} high, surrounded by massive [[battlement]]s.

Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].

In this location he resided long enough to train the painter [[Angelo Everardi]], who was likely of Flemish descent and was known as il Fiammenghino.  Although there is no documentary evidence for this, it is likely that he was also active in [[Mantua]] for a while.  In Mantua Flemish artists had been in charge of the artistic direction of the Ducal Court for decades, first with [[Daniel van den Dyck]] and later [[Frans Geffels]].  Geffels had become a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke a year earlier than de Herdt. He had then left to work in Italy while also working for periods in, and maintaining links, with Vienna, where both artists are believed to have arrived in the early 1660s.

The Southern Netherlands had developed a close bond with the Imperial court in Vienna as its Spanish rulers were connected with it through dynastic links.  The governor generals of the Southern Netherlands were often members of the Austrian Imperial family. They occasionally took artists from Flanders back with them when they returned to Vienna after being called back from their post.  This was the case with [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]], who brought artists such as [[Jan Anton van der Baren]], [[Franciscus van der Steen]] and [[Nikolaus van Hoy]] back with him to Vienna.<ref name=os>Barbara Dossi. \"Baren, Jan Anthonie van der.\" Grove Art Online.

While he is believed to have arrived in Vienna around 1660, Jan is first documented in Vienna on 8 January 1662. On that date he signed his name in the ecclesiastical registers as a witness together with the Flemish engraver [[Franciscus van der Steen]] at the wedding of Dutch artist [[Hans de Jode]] in Vienna on 8 January 1662.

He signed the vast majority of his works with the most widespread variant of his name J. D. Herdt.  The most apparent influences on his work are Antwerp's leading painters Anthony van Dyck, Rubens, Jordaens and [[Caspar de Crayer]].<ref name=thesis/>  The style of de Herdt's portraits showed the influence of the van Dyckian portrait model.  This influence is also recognisable in his series of paintings recounting stories from Torquato Tasso's 'Gerusalemme Liberata' such as the [[:File:Jan de Herdt - Erminia bij de landlieden - GG 2921 - Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpg|''Erminia and the shepherds'']].<ref name=jstor>Maria Adelaide Baroncelli, ''Jan de Herdt e le origini del Fiammenghino'', Saggi e Memorie di storia dell'arte Saggi e Memorie di storia dell'arte Vol. 4 (1965), pp. 7, 9-24, 133-141 (26 pages) {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n[[File:Jan de Herdt - Erminia bij de landlieden - GG 2921 - Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpg|thumb|270px|left|''Erminia and the shepherds'']]\n\nJan de Herdt also was aware of trends in Central European painting.  This is shown in his [[:File:Jan de Herdt - Portrait of the family of Imperial Goldsmith Franz Wilhelm de Harde von Antor\ufb00.jpg|''Portrait of the family of Imperial Goldsmith Franz Wilhelm de Harde von Antor\ufb00'']] ([[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]). De Herdt's family portrait likely includes a self-portrait in the young man on the left who holds a watch in his left hand and point with his right hand to the floor.  Alternatively, this may be a portrait of his nephew. Based on the similarities between the two works,de Herdt's may indicate that he had seen the [[:File:Karel \u0160kr\u00e9ta - The Family of Precious Stone Cutter Dionysius Miseroni - Google Art Project.jpg|''Family of precious stone cutter Dionysius Miseroni'']] ([[National Gallery Prague]]) painted by the Czech portrait painter [[Karel \u0160kr\u00e9ta]] in 1653.  This was one of the first group portraits of this kind in Central Europe.  In 1669 [[Tobias Pock]] painted a [[:File:Tobias Pock - Self portrait with his family.jpg|''Self-Portrait with the artist's family'']] in which he depicted himself in a manner that is almost identical to the one used by Jan de Herdt in his family portrait. Pock may have known de Herdt's family portrait.  Jan de Herdt along with the above-mentioned artists created an entirely new visual language in Central Europe in the form of the communicative group portrait.<ref name=family/>\n[[File:Jan de Herdt - Portrait of Franz Augustin of Waldstein.jpg|thumb|200px|''Portrait of Franz Augustin von Waldstein]]\n\nJan de Herdt collaborated on the publication ''Historia di Leopoldo Cesare'' written by [[Galeazzo Gualdo Priorato]] and published in Vienna by the Flemish publisher from Antwerp [[Johann Baptist Hacque]].  The first and second volumes of the book were published in 1670 and a third one in 1674. The first volume described the political and military successes of Emperor Leopold I between 1656 and 1670.  It was mainly illustrated with prints made by Flemish and Dutch printmakers after designs by other Netherlandish artists as well as artists from Germany and Italy. The illustrations mainly depict portraits of European monarchs and important aristocrats, castle scenes, battle scenes, maps and ceremonies. Apart from Jan de Herdt, the Dutch and Flemish artists who contributed to the work were [[Frans Geffels]], [[Cornelis Meyssens]], [[Franciscus van der Steen]], [[Gerard Bouttats]], [[Adriaen van Bloemen]], Sebastian van Dryweghen and [[Jacob Toorenvliet]].

In this location he resided long enough to train the painter [[Angelo Everardi]], who was likely of Flemish descent and was known as il Fiammenghino.  Although there is no documentary evidence for this, it is likely that he was also active in [[Mantua]] for a while.  In Mantua Flemish artists had been in charge of the artistic direction of the Ducal Court for decades, first with [[Daniel van den Dyck]] and later [[Frans Geffels]].  Geffels had become a member of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke a year earlier than de Herdt. He had then left to work in Italy while also working for periods in, and maintaining links, with Vienna, where both artists are believed to have arrived in the early 1660s. It is likely that the artists knew each other as they both contributed to a collaborative book published in Vienna, the ''Historia di Leopoldo Cesare''.<ref name=family>[https://www.academia.edu/39947127/The_De_Herdt_De_Harde_family_in_the_service_of_Emperor_Leopold_in_Vienna Miroslav Kindl, ''The De Herdt (De Harde) family in the service of Emperor Leopold in Vienna''] in: K.

The Southern Netherlands had developed a close bond with the Imperial court in Vienna as its Spanish rulers were connected with it through dynastic links.  The governor generals of the Southern Netherlands were often members of the Austrian Imperial family. They occasionally took artists from Flanders back with them when they returned to Vienna after been called back from their post.  This was the case with [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]], who brought artists such as [[Jan Anton van der Baren]], [[Franciscus van der Steen]] and [[Nikolaus van Hoy]] back with him to Vienna.<ref name=os>Barbara Dossi. \"Baren, Jan Anthonie van der.\" Grove Art Online.

While he is believed to have arrived in Vienna around 1660, Jan is first documented in Vienna on 8 January 1662. On that date he signed his name in the ecclesiastical registers as a witness together with the Flemish engraver [[Franciscus van der Steen]] at the wedding of Dutch artist [[Hans de Jode]] in Vienna on 8 January 1662.

The son of the founder of the family business trained as a goldsmith with Jan's brother in Vienna.  The records of the Forchondt firm show that in 1671 Prince Schwarzenberg bought a painting on the subject of ''Armida and Rinaldo'', which was likely the [[:File:Jan de Herdt - Rinaldo preventing Armida's suicide (detail).jpg|''Rinaldo preventing Armida's suicide'']] by de Herdt (now in the former Augustinian monastery (Brno)).<ref name=thesis/>\n[[File:Jan de Herdt - Portrait of unknown noblewoman.jpg|thumb|220px|''Portrait of unknown noblewoman'']]\n\nJan may have been active in [[Jarom\u011b\u0159ice nad Rokytnou]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]) from the beginning of 1666 to January 1667.

He signed the vast majority of his works with the most widespread variant of his name J. D. Herdt.  The most apparent influences on his work are Antwerp's leading painters Anthony van Dyck, Rubens, Jordaens and [[Caspar de Crayer]].<ref name=thesis/>  The style of de Herdt's portraits showed the influence of the van Dyckian portrait model.  This influence is also recognisable in his series of paintings recounting stories from Torquato Tasso's 'Gerusalemme Liberata' such as the [[:File:Jan de Herdt - Erminia bij de landlieden - GG 2921 - Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpg|''Erminia and the shepherds'']].<ref name=jstor>Maria Adelaide Baroncelli, ''Jan de Herdt e le origini del Fiammenghino'', Saggi e Memorie di storia dell'arte Saggi e Memorie di storia dell'arte Vol. 4 (1965), pp. 7, 9-24, 133-141 (26 pages) {{in lang|it}}</ref>\n[[File:Jan de Herdt - Erminia bij de landlieden - GG 2921 - Kunsthistorisches Museum.jpg|thumb|270px|left|''Erminia and the shepherds'']]\n\nJan de Herdt also was aware of trends in Central European painting.  This is shown in his [[:File:Jan de Herdt - Portrait of the family of Imperial Goldsmith Franz Wilhelm de Harde von Antor\ufb00.jpg|''Portrait of the family of Imperial Goldsmith Franz Wilhelm de Harde von Antor\ufb00'']] ([[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]). De Herdt's family portrait likely includes a self-portrait in the young man on the left who holds a watch in his left hand and point with his right hand to the floor.  Alternatively, this may be a portrait of his nephew. Based on the similarities between the two works,de Herdt's may indicate that he had seen the [[:File:Karel \u0160kr\u00e9ta - The Family of Precious Stone Cutter Dionysius Miseroni - Google Art Project.jpg|''Family of precious stone cutter Dionysius Miseroni'']] ([[National Gallery Prague]]) painted by the Czech portrait painter [[Karel \u0160kr\u00e9ta]] in 1653.  This was one of the first group portraits of this kind in Central Europe.  In 1669 [[Tobias Pock]] painted a [[:File:Tobias Pock - Self portrait with his family.jpg|''Self-Portrait with the artist's family'']] in which he depicted himself in a manner that is almost identical to the one used by Jan de Herdt in his family portrait. Pock may have known de Herdt's family portrait.  Jan de Herdt along with the above-mentioned artists created an entirely new visual language in Central Europe in the form of the communicative group portrait.<ref name=family/>\n[[File:Jan de Herdt - Portrait of Franz Augustin of Waldstein.jpg|thumb|200px|''Portrait of Franz Augustin von Waldstein]]\n\nJan de Herdt collaborated on the publication ''Historia di Leopoldo Cesare'' written by [[Galeazzo Gualdo Priorato]] and published in Vienna by the Flemish publisher from Antwerp [[Johann Baptist Hacque]].  The first and second volumes of the book were published in 1670 and a third one in 1674. The first volume described the political and military successes of Emperor Leopold I between 1656 and 1670.  It was mainly illustrated with prints made by Flemish and Dutch printmakers after designs by other Netherlandish artists as well as artists from Germany and Italy. The illustrations mainly depict portraits of European monarchs and important aristocrats, castle scenes, battle scenes, maps and ceremonies. Apart from Jan de Herdt, the Dutch and Flemish artists who contributed to the work were [[Frans Geffels]], [[Cornelis Meyssens]], [[Franciscus van der Steen]], [[Gerard Bouttats]], [[Adriaen van Bloemen]], Sebastian van Dryweghen and [[Jacob Toorenvliet]].  German artists Moritz Lang, Johann Martin Lerch and Johann Holst and Italians Il Bianchi, Marco Boschini and Leonardus Hen.t Venetiis also contributed.<ref name=Cesare>[http://www.muo.cz/en/collections/books--41/galeazzo-gualdo-priorato--284/ Miroslav Kindl, ''Galeazzo Gualdo Priorato (1606 Vicenza \u2013 1678 Vicenza), Historia di Leopoldo Cesare I\u2013III, 1670\u20131674''] at Muzeum Um\u011bn\u00ed Olomouc</ref>\n\nJan de Herdt contributed at least six designs for portraits: Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, Duke Ferdinand Dietrichstein, Count Jean-Louis Raduit de Souches, Count Raimund Montecuccoli, Count Jan Rottal and Count Nicholas Zrinsky.  The prints designed by de Herdt in this publication have been used as the basis to attribute paintings to de Herdt.<ref name=kindle1/>  For instance, the [[:File:Herdt Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski.jpg|''Portrait of the Polish nobleman and commander Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski'']] ([[Royal Castle, Warsaw]]) was attributed in this manner.

In 1920 the artist's signature was discovered on the altarpiece of the high altar of the Church of Saint Maurice in [[Breno, Lombardy|Breno]] in [[Lombardy]], northern [[Italy]].  The altarpiece depicts ''Saint Maurice kneeling before the Virgin and Child.'' There was a ''Portrait of St. Elizabeth'' (now lost) in the Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Brescia.

From 1941 to 1945, almost 20,000 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[prisoners of war]] and a further 50,000 inmates died there.<ref name=Oppenheimer>{{cite book|author=Oppenheimer, Paul |date=1996| title=From Belsen to Buckingham Palace|location= Nottingham|publisher= Quill Press|isbn= 978-0-9536280-3-2}}</ref> Overcrowding, lack of food and poor sanitary conditions caused outbreaks of [[typhus]], [[tuberculosis]], [[typhoid fever]] and [[dysentery]], leading to the deaths of more than 35,000 people in the first few months of 1945, shortly before and after the liberation.\n\nThe camp was liberated on April 15, 1945, by the [[11th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|British 11th Armoured Division]].<ref name=11th>[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10006188 \"The 11th Armoured Division (Great Britain)\"], United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.</ref> The soldiers discovered approximately 60,000 prisoners inside, most of them half-starved and seriously ill,<ref name=BB>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&ModuleId=10005224|title=Bergen-Belsen|website=www.ushmm.org}}</ref> and another 13,000 corpses lying around the camp unburied.<ref name=11th/> The horrors of the camp, documented on film and in pictures, made the name \"Belsen\" emblematic of [[Nazi]] crimes in general for public opinion in many countries in the immediate post-1945 period. Today, there is a memorial with an exhibition hall at the site.\n\n==Operation==\n\n===Prisoner of war camp===\nIn 1935 the [[Wehrmacht]] began to build a large military complex close to the village of [[Belsen (Bergen)|Belsen]], a part of the town of Bergen, in what was then the [[Province of Hanover]].<ref name=\"Memorial website\"/> This became the largest military training area in Germany of the time and was used for armoured vehicle training.<ref name=\"Memorial website\"/> The barracks were finished in 1937. The camp has been in continuous operation since then and is today known as [[Bergen-Hohne Training Area]]. It is used by the [[NATO]] armed forces.\n\nThe workers who constructed the original buildings were housed in camps near [[Fallingbostel]] and Bergen, the latter being the so-called Bergen-Belsen Army Construction Camp.<ref name=\"Memorial website\"/> Once the military complex was completed in 1938/39, the workers' camp fell into disuse. However, after the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, the ''Wehrmacht'' began using the huts as a [[prisoner of war]] (POW) camp.\n\nThe camp of huts near Fallingbostel became known as [[Stalag XI-B]] and was to become one of the ''Wehrmacht''{{'}}s largest POW camps, holding up to 95,000 prisoners from various countries.<ref name=\"Memorial website2\">{{cite web|url=http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/POW_Camps.html|title=POW Camps|accessdate=April 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016093251/http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/POW_Camps.html|archivedate=October 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In June 1940, Belgian and French POWs were housed in the former Bergen-Belsen construction workers' camp. This installation was significantly expanded from June 1941, once Germany prepared to invade the Soviet Union, becoming an independent camp known as [[Stalag XI-C]] (311). It was intended to hold up to 20,000 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] POWs and was one of three such camps in the area. The others were at [[Oerbke]] (Stalag XI-D (321)) and [[Wietzendorf]] (Stalag X-D (310)). By the end of March 1942, some 41,000 Soviet POWs had died in these three camps of starvation, exhaustion, and disease. By the end of the war, the total number of dead had increased to 50,000.<ref name=\"Memorial website2\"/> When the POW camp in Bergen ceased operation in early 1945, as the ''Wehrmacht'' handed it over to the [[SS]], the cemetery contained over 19,500 dead Soviet prisoners.\n\nIn the summer of 1943, Stalag XI-C (311) was dissolved and Bergen-Belsen became a branch camp of Stalag XI-B. It served as the hospital for all Soviet POWs in the region until January 1945. Other inmates/patients were Italian military internees from August 1944 and, following the suppression of the [[Warsaw Uprising]] in October 1944, around 1,000 members of the [[Polish Home Army]] were imprisoned in a separate section of the POW camp.<ref name=\"Memorial website2\"/>\n\n[[File:Bergen-belsen.jpg|thumb|left|Memorial stone at the entrance to the historical camp area]]\n\n===Concentration camp===\nIn April 1943, a part of the Bergen-Belsen camp was taken over by the SS Economic-Administration Main Office (''SS Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt; WVHA''). It thus became part of the [[concentration camp]] system, run by the ''SS [[Schutzstaffel]]'' but it was a special case.<ref name=\"USHMM website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005224|title=Bergen-Belsen|accessdate=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Having initially been designated a ''Zivilinterniertenlager'' (\"civilian internment camp\"), in June 1943 it was redesignated ''Aufenthaltslager'' (\"holding camp\"), since the [[Geneva Conventions]] stipulated that the former type of facility must be open to inspection by international committees.<ref name=\"Exhibition guide\">{{cite book|last=Godeke|first=Monika (ed)|title=Bergen-Belsen Memorial 2007: Guide to the Exhibition|publisher=Scherrer|year=2007|isbn=978-3-9811617-3-1}}</ref> This \"holding camp\" or \"exchange camp\" was for Jews who were intended to be exchanged for German civilians interned in other countries, or for hard currency.<ref name=\"Memorial website3\">{{cite web|url=http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/concentration-camp/exchange-camp.html|title=The Exchange Camp|accessdate=April 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421052736/http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/concentration-camp/exchange-camp.html|archivedate=April 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The SS divided this camp into subsections for individual groups (the \"Hungarian camp\", the \"special camp\" for Polish Jews, the \"neutrals camp\" for citizens of neutral countries and the \"Star camp\" for [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch]] Jews). Between the summer of 1943 and December 1944 at least 14,600 Jews, including 2,750 children and minors were transported to the Bergen-Belsen \"holding\" or exchange camp.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|160}} Inmates were made to work, many of them in the \"shoe commando\" which salvaged usable pieces of leather from shoes collected and brought to the camp from all over Germany and occupied Europe. In general the prisoners of this part of the camp were treated less harshly than some other classes of Bergen-Belsen prisoner until fairly late in the war, due to their perceived potential exchange value.<ref name=\"Memorial website3\" /> However, only around 2,560 Jewish prisoners were ever actually released from Bergen-Belsen and allowed to leave Germany.<ref name=\"Memorial website3\"/>\n\nIn March 1944, part of the camp was redesignated as an ''Erholungslager'' (\"recovery camp\"),<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/Belsen.html Bergen-Belsen], Jewish Virtual Library</ref> where prisoners too sick to work were brought from other concentration camps. They were in Belsen supposedly to recover and then return to their original camps and resume work, but many of them died in Belsen of disease, starvation, exhaustion and lack of medical attention.<ref name=\"Memorial website4\">{{cite web|url=http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/concentration-camp/mens-and-womens-camps.html|title=Men's and Women's Camps|accessdate=April 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421052948/http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/concentration-camp/mens-and-womens-camps.html|archivedate=April 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1944, a new section was created and this became the so-called \"women's camp\". By November 1944 this camp received around 9,000 women and young girls. Most of those who were able to work stayed only for a short while and were then sent on to other concentration camps or slave-labour camps. The first women interned there were Poles, arrested after the failed Warsaw Uprising. Others were Jewish women from Poland or Hungary, transferred from Auschwitz.<ref name=\"Memorial website4\" /> [[Margot Frank|Margot]] and [[Anne Frank]] died there in February or March 1945.<ref name=DeathResearch>[http://www.annefrank.org/en/News/News/2015/Maart/Anne-Franks-last-months/ \"New research sheds new light on Anne Frank's last months\"].

As eastern concentration camps were evacuated before the advance of the Red Army, at least 85,000 people were transported in cattle cars or marched to Bergen-Belsen.<ref name=\"Memorial website5a\">{{cite web|url=http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/concentration-camp/reception-and-dying-camp.html|title=\"Reception\" and dying camps|accessdate=April 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421052240/http://bergen-belsen.stiftung-ng.de/en/history/concentration-camp/reception-and-dying-camp.html|archivedate=April 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Before that the number of prisoners at Belsen had been much smaller. In July 1944 there were 7,300; by December 1944 the number had increased to 15,000; and by February 1945 it had risen to 22,000. Numbers then soared to around 60,000 by April 15, 1945.<ref name=\"USHMM website\"/> This overcrowding led to a vast increase in deaths from disease: particularly [[typhus]], as well as [[tuberculosis]], [[typhoid fever]], [[dysentery]] and [[malnutrition]] in a camp originally designed to hold about 10,000 inmates. At this point also, the special status of the exchange prisoners no longer applied. All inmates were subject to starvation and epidemics.<ref name=\"Memorial website5a\" />\n\n===''Au\u00dfenlager'' (satellite camps)===\nBergen-Belsen concentration camp had three satellite camps. These were at regional armament works. Around 2,000 female concentration camp prisoners were forced to work there. Those who were too weak or sick to continue with their work were brought to Bergen-Belsen.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204\u2013205}}\n\n''Au\u00dfenlager Bomlitz-Benefeld'' at [[Bomlitz]] near [[Fallingbostel]] was in use from September 3 to October 15, 1944. It was located at the facility of Eibia GmbH, a gunpowder works. Around 600 female Polish Jews were used for construction and production work.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204}}\n\n''Au\u00dfenlager Hamb\u00fchren-Ovelg\u00f6nne'' (Lager III, Waldeslust) at [[Hamb\u00fchren]] south of [[Winsen an der Aller|Winsen]] was in use from August 23, 1944 to February 4, 1945. It was an abandoned [[potash]] mine, now intended as an underground production site for Bremen plane manufacturer [[Focke-Wulf]]. Around 400 prisoners, mostly female Polish or Hungarian Jews, were forced to prepare the facility and to help lay train tracks to it. This was done for the company [[Hochtief]].<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204}}\n\n''Au\u00dfenlager Unterl\u00fc\u00df-Altensothrieth'' (Tannenberglager) east of Bergen was in use from late August 1944 to April 13, 1945. It was located at [[Unterl\u00fc\u00df]], where the [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig AG]] had a large test site. Up to 900 female Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Yugoslavian and Czech Jews had to clear forest, do construction work or work in munitions production.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204}}\n\nPrisoners were guarded by SS staff and received no wages for their work. The companies instead reimbursed the SS for the labour supplied. Wage taxes were also levied by local authorities.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204\u2013205}}\n\n===Treatment of prisoners and deaths in the camp===\n[[File:The Liberation of Bergen-belsen Concentration Camp, April 1945 BU4004.jpg|thumb|Bergen Belsen crematorium in April 1945]]\nCurrent estimates put the number of prisoners who passed through the concentration camp during its period of operation from 1943 to 1945 at around 120,000. Due to the destruction of the camp's files by the SS, not even half of them, around 55,000, are known by name.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|269}} As mentioned above, treatment of prisoners by the SS varied between individual sections of the camp, with the inmates of the exchange camp generally being better treated than other prisoners, at least initially. However, in October 1943 the SS selected 1,800 men and women from the ''Sonderlager'' (\"special camp\"), Jews from Poland who held passports from Latin American countries. Since the governments of these nations mostly refused to honour the passports, these people had lost their value to the regime. Under the pretext of sending them to a fictitious \"Lager Bergau\", the SS had them transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were sent directly to the gas chambers and killed. In February and May 1944 another 350 prisoners from the \"special camp\" were sent to Auschwitz. Thus, out of the total of 14,600 prisoners in the exchange camp, at least 3,550 died, more than 1,400 of them at Belsen, and around 2,150 at Auschwitz.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|187}}\n\nIn the ''M\u00e4nnerlager'' (the male section of the \"recovery camp\"), inmates suffered even more from lack of care, malnourishment, disease and mistreatment by the guards. Thousands of them died. In the summer of 1944, at least 200 men were killed by orders of the SS by being injected with [[phenol]].<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|196}}\n\nThere were no [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chamber]]s at Bergen-Belsen, since the mass killings took place in the camps further east. Nevertheless, current estimates put the number of deaths at Belsen at more than 50,000 [[Jew]]s, [[Czech people|Czechs]], [[Poles]], anti-Nazi [[Christians]], [[homosexual]]s, and [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]] (Gypsies).<ref name=\"USHMM website\" /> Among them was Czech painter and writer [[Josef \u010capek]] (estimated to be in April 1945).

In a speech at the Bergen-Belsen memorial, Adenauer assured the Jews still living in Germany that they would have the same respect and security as everyone else.<ref name=\"Memorial Guide\"/>{{rp|42}} Afterwards, the German public saw the Belsen memorial as primarily a Jewish place of remembrance. Nevertheless, the memorial was redesigned in 1960\u201361. In 1966, a document centre was opened which offered a permanent exhibition on the persecution of the Jews, with a focus on events in the nearby Netherlands \u2013 where Anne Frank and her family had been arrested in 1944. This was complemented by an overview of the history of the Bergen-Belsen camp. This was the first ever permanent exhibit anywhere in Germany on the topic of Nazi crimes.<ref name=\"Memorial Guide\"/>{{rp|42}} However, there was still no scientific personnel at the site, with only a caretaker as permanent staff. Memorial events were only organized by the survivors themselves.\n\nIn October 1979, the president of the [[European Parliament]] [[Simone Veil]], herself a survivor of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, came to the memorial for a speech which focused on the Nazi persecution of Roma and Sinti.

This concentration camp was hopelessly overcrowded and we were not accepted. The right hand no longer knew what the left hand was doing, so we were sent to an adjoining Wehrmacht compound. As the soldiers of the Wehrmacht marched out, we moved in. The confusion was unbelievable; this time it was disorder with German perfection. We were moved into clean barracks, equipped for human beings with excellent bathrooms and clean beds stacked three on top of each other.

Women lay in bed with no sheets and no nightie but with scarlet red lips, you saw them wandering about with nothing but a blanket over their shoulders, but with scarlet red lips. I saw a woman dead on the post mortem table and clutched in her hand was a piece of lipstick. At last someone had done something to make them individuals again, they were someone, no longer merely the number tattooed on the arm. At last they could take an interest in their appearance.

It was intended to hold up to 20,000 [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] POWs and was one of three such camps in the area. The others were at [[Oerbke]] (Stalag XI-D (321)) and [[Wietzendorf]] (Stalag X-D (310)).

This was done for the company [[Hochtief]].<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204}}\n\n''Au\u00dfenlager Unterl\u00fc\u00df-Altensothrieth'' (Tannenberglager) east of Bergen was in use from late August 1944 to April 13, 1945. It was located at [[Unterl\u00fc\u00df]], where the [[Rheinmetall|Rheinmetall-Borsig AG]] had a large test site. Up to 900 female Polish, Hungarian, Romanian, Yugoslavian and Czech Jews had to clear forest, do construction work or work in munitions production.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204}}\n\nPrisoners were guarded by SS staff and received no wages for their work. The companies instead reimbursed the SS for the labour supplied. Wage taxes were also levied by local authorities.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|204\u2013205}}\n\n===Treatment of prisoners and deaths in the camp===\n[[File:The Liberation of Bergen-belsen Concentration Camp, April 1945 BU4004.jpg|thumb|Bergen Belsen crematorium in April 1945]]\nCurrent estimates put the number of prisoners who passed through the concentration camp during its period of operation from 1943 to 1945 at around 120,000. Due to the destruction of the camp's files by the SS, not even half of them, around 55,000, are known by name.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|269}} As mentioned above, treatment of prisoners by the SS varied between individual sections of the camp, with the inmates of the exchange camp generally being better treated than other prisoners, at least initially. However, in October 1943 the SS selected 1,800 men and women from the ''Sonderlager'' (\"special camp\"), Jews from Poland who held passports from Latin American countries. Since the governments of these nations mostly refused to honour the passports, these people had lost their value to the regime. Under the pretext of sending them to a fictitious \"Lager Bergau\", the SS had them transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where they were sent directly to the gas chambers and killed. In February and May 1944 another 350 prisoners from the \"special camp\" were sent to Auschwitz. Thus, out of the total of 14,600 prisoners in the exchange camp, at least 3,550 died, more than 1,400 of them at Belsen, and around 2,150 at Auschwitz.<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|187}}\n\nIn the ''M\u00e4nnerlager'' (the male section of the \"recovery camp\"), inmates suffered even more from lack of care, malnourishment, disease and mistreatment by the guards. Thousands of them died. In the summer of 1944, at least 200 men were killed by orders of the SS by being injected with [[phenol]].<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|196}}\n\nThere were no [[Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|gas chamber]]s at Bergen-Belsen, since the mass killings took place in the camps further east. Nevertheless, current estimates put the number of deaths at Belsen at more than 50,000 [[Jew]]s, [[Czech people|Czechs]], [[Poles]], anti-Nazi [[Christians]], [[homosexual]]s, and [[Romani people|Roma]] and [[Sinti]] (Gypsies).<ref name=\"USHMM website\" /> Among them was Czech painter and writer [[Josef \u010capek]] (estimated to be in April 1945). He had coined the word ''[[robot]]'', popularised by his brother [[Karel \u010capek]].\n\nThe rate at which inmates died at Belsen accelerated notably after the mass transport of prisoners from other camps began in December 1944. From 1943 to the end of 1944 around 3,100 died. From January to mid-April 1945 this rose to around 35,000. Another 14,000 died after liberation between April 15 and the end of June 1945 (see below).<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|233}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"3\"| '''Deaths at Bergen-Belsen concentration camp'''<br /> December 1944 to April 15, 1945<ref name=\"New Exhibition Guide\"/>{{rp|232\u2013233}}\n|-----\n| December 1944\n| at least 360\n|----\n| January 1945\n| around 1,200\n|----\n| February 1945\n| around 6,400\n|----\n| March 1945\n| at least 18,168\n|----\n| April 1945\n| around 10,000\n|}\n\nAfter the war, there were allegations that the camp (or possibly a section of it), was \"of a privileged nature\", compared to others.

Immediately following the liberation, revenge killings took place in the satellite camp the SS had created in the area of the army barracks that later became Hohne-Camp. Around 15,000 prisoners from [[Mittelbau-Dora]] had been relocated there in early April. These prisoners were in much better physical condition than most of the others. Some of these men turned on those who had been their overseers at Mittelbau.

In a speech at the Bergen-Belsen memorial, Adenauer assured the Jews still living in Germany that they would have the same respect and security as everyone else.<ref name=\"Memorial Guide\"/>{{rp|42}} Afterwards, the German public saw the Belsen memorial as primarily a Jewish place of remembrance. Nevertheless, the memorial was redesigned in 1960\u201361. In 1966, a document centre was opened which offered a permanent exhibition on the persecution of the Jews, with a focus on events in the nearby Netherlands \u2013 where Anne Frank and her family had been arrested in 1944. This was complemented by an overview of the history of the Bergen-Belsen camp. This was the first ever permanent exhibit anywhere in Germany on the topic of Nazi crimes.<ref name=\"Memorial Guide\"/>{{rp|42}} However, there was still no scientific personnel at the site, with only a caretaker as permanent staff. Memorial events were only organized by the survivors themselves.\n\nIn October 1979, the president of the [[European Parliament]] [[Simone Veil]], herself a survivor of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen, came to the memorial for a speech which focused on the Nazi persecution of Roma and Sinti.

This concentration camp was hopelessly overcrowded and we were not accepted. The right hand no longer knew what the left hand was doing, so we were sent to an adjoining Wehrmacht compound. As the soldiers of the Wehrmacht marched out, we moved in. The confusion was unbelievable; this time it was disorder with German perfection. We were moved into clean barracks, equipped for human beings with excellent bathrooms and clean beds stacked three on top of each other. After all we had experienced in the preceding year, this was sheer luxury. There was no mention of the usual camp rituals, no roll calls and no work, but also no food.</blockquote>\n\n* Lieutenant Colonel Mervin Willett Gonin DSO<ref>http://www.bergenbelsen.co.uk/pages/Database/ReliefStaffAccount.asp?HeroesID=17&=17</ref>\n<blockquote> It was shortly after the British Red Cross arrived, though it may have no connection, that a very large quantity of lipstick arrived. This was not at all what we men wanted, we were screaming for hundreds and thousands of other things and I don't know who asked for lipstick. I wish so much that I could discover who did it, it was the action of genius, sheer unadulterated brilliance. I believe nothing did more for those internees than the lipstick. Women lay in bed with no sheets and no nightie but with scarlet red lips, you saw them wandering about with nothing but a blanket over their shoulders, but with scarlet red lips. I saw a woman dead on the post mortem table and clutched in her hand was a piece of lipstick. At last someone had done something to make them individuals again, they were someone, no longer merely the number tattooed on the arm. At last they could take an interest in their appearance. That lipstick started to give them back their humanity.</blockquote>\n\n==Media==\n{{listen|filename=BergenBelsenHatikva.ogg|title=Vocal|description=[[BBC]] recording from April 20, 1945 of Jewish survivors of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp singing ''[[Hatikvah]]'', today the [[national anthem]] of [[Israel]], only five days after their liberation by Allied forces.

Retrieved 22 May 2018 {{subscription}}</ref> He read English at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], where he was taught and heavily influenced by [[F. R. Leavis]].  At Cambridge he took over the editing of the magazine [[Delta (magazine)|''delta'']] from [[Peter Redgrove]]. After Cambridge, he worked as a school teacher in London from 1955 to 1959, when he moved to [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]] to study for a PhD under [[William Empson]].  In 1962 he took up an academic position at [[Queen's University of Belfast|Queen's University, Belfast]], and moved again in 1966,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article540710.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk}}</ref> to take up a post in the [[University of Glasgow]].  He was awarded a personal chair in 1985, and retired from the University in 1997; he remained in Glasgow until his death in 2005.\n\n===The Group(s)===\nHobsbaum's most direct impact on literature was as the animating force behind ''[[The Group (literature)|The Group]]'', a sequence of writing workshops in Cambridge, London, [[Belfast]] and [[Glasgow]], in turn.  Although there was some slight overlap in personnel with ''[[Movement (literature)|The Movement]]'', the various incarnations of the Group had a more concrete existence and a more practical focus.\n\nThe Cambridge Group was initially concerned with the oral performance of poetry, but soon turned into an exercise in [[practical criticism]] and mutual support for a network of poets.  This Group relocated to London when Hobsbaum moved there in 1955, becoming ''The Group'', and continuing until 1965, chaired by [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] after Hobsbaum's departure for Sheffield.\n\nOn arriving in Sheffield (c.1959-1962) he immediately organized the \"Writers' Group\"  for the university's undergraduates and started \"Poetry from Sheffield\", a magazine for their poetry but which also had poems by George McBeth, Peter Redgrove and Francis Berry. He wrote about the group in ''The Times Literary Supplement'', published on 14 April 1961. Barry Fox took over the chair when Hobsbaum left to concentrate on his thesis.\n\nIn Belfast (1962&ndash;1966), Hobsbaum organised a new weekly discussion group, which became known as [[The Belfast Group]] and included the emerging authors [[John Bond (writer)|John Bond]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Michael Longley]], [[Derek Mahon]], [[Stewart Parker]] and [[Bernard MacLaverty]].\n\nIn Glasgow, Hobsbaum became once again the nucleus of a group of new and distinctive authors, including [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Liz Lochhead]], [[James Kelman]], [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]], [[Aonghas MacNeacail]] and [[Jeff Torrington]].  This group continued to meet until 1975, and unlike the previous groups developed a more pronounced focus on prose than on poetry.  As an encore, Hobsbaum was instrumental in setting up, in 1995, the successful [[MLitt]] in [[Creative Writing]] at the University of Glasgow.\n\n===Work===\nThough he was a poet as well, it was as a critic that Hobsbaum was best known.

Retrieved 22 May 2018 {{subscription}}</ref> He read English at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], where he was taught and heavily influenced by [[F. R. Leavis]].  At Cambridge he took over the editing of the magazine [[Delta (magazine)|''delta'']] from [[Peter Redgrove]]. After Cambridge, he worked as a school teacher in London from 1955 to 1959, when he moved to [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]] to study for a PhD under [[William Empson]].  In 1962 he took up an academic position at [[Queen's University of Belfast|Queen's University, Belfast]], and moved again in 1966,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article540710.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk}}</ref> to take up a post in the [[University of Glasgow]].  He was awarded a personal chair in 1985, and retired from the University in 1997; he remained in Glasgow until his death in 2005.\n\n===The Group(s)===\nHobsbaum's most direct impact on literature was as the animating force behind ''[[The Group (literature)|The Group]]'', a sequence of writing workshops in Cambridge, London, [[Belfast]] and [[Glasgow]], in turn.  Although there was some slight overlap in personnel with ''[[Movement (literature)|The Movement]]'', the various incarnations of the Group had a more concrete existence and a more practical focus.\n\nThe Cambridge Group was initially concerned with the oral performance of poetry, but soon turned into an exercise in [[practical criticism]] and mutual support for a network of poets.  This Group relocated to London when Hobsbaum moved there in 1955, becoming ''The Group'', and continuing until 1965, chaired by [[Edward Lucie-Smith]] after Hobsbaum's departure for Sheffield.\n\nOn arriving in Sheffield (c.1959-1962) he immediately organized the \"Writers' Group\"  for the university's undergraduates and started \"Poetry from Sheffield\", a magazine for their poetry but which also had poems by George McBeth, Peter Redgrove and Francis Berry. He wrote about the group in ''The Times Literary Supplement'', published on 14 April 1961. Barry Fox took over the chair when Hobsbaum left to concentrate on his thesis.\n\nIn Belfast (1962&ndash;1966), Hobsbaum organised a new weekly discussion group, which became known as [[The Belfast Group]] and included the emerging authors [[John Bond (writer)|John Bond]], [[Seamus Heaney]], [[Michael Longley]], [[Derek Mahon]], [[Stewart Parker]] and [[Bernard MacLaverty]].\n\nIn Glasgow, Hobsbaum became once again the nucleus of a group of new and distinctive authors, including [[Alasdair Gray]], [[Liz Lochhead]], [[James Kelman]], [[Tom Leonard (poet)|Tom Leonard]], [[Aonghas MacNeacail]] and [[Jeff Torrington]].  This group continued to meet until 1975, and unlike the previous groups developed a more pronounced focus on prose than on poetry.  As an encore, Hobsbaum was instrumental in setting up, in 1995, the successful [[MLitt]] in [[Creative Writing]] at the University of Glasgow.\n\n===Work===\nThough he was a poet as well, it was as a critic that Hobsbaum was best known.  And though as one of his obituarists noted, \"[h]e was famously not a man who felt a pressing need to endear himself to students\", he was a charismatic teacher, and fiercely committed to those with a commitment to literature.  The dedication of Alasdair Gray's ''The Book of Prefaces'' is \"to Philip Hobsbaum poet, critic and servant of servants of art\".  Seamus Heaney also dedicated the poem \"Blackberry-Picking\" (from Death of a Naturalist, 1966) to Philip Hobsbaum.\n\n====Poetry====\n*''A Group Anthology'' (Oxford UP, 1963), edited with Edward Lucie-Smith\n*''The Place's Fault, and other poems'' (Macmillan, 1964)\n*''Snapshots'' (Belfast: Festival Publications, 1967)\n*''In Retreat and Other Poems'' (Macmillan, 1966)\n*''Coming Out Fighting'' (Macmillan, 1969)\n*''Women and Animals'' (Macmillan, 1972)\n*''The Pattern of Poetry'' (1962)\n\n====Criticism and other academic writing====\n*''Ten Elizabethan Poets'' (Longmans, 1969), editor\n*''A Theory of Communication'' (Macmillan, 1970), in US as ''Theory of Criticism'' (Indiana UP, 1970)\n*''A Reader's Guide To Charles Dickens'' (Thames and Hudson, 1972)\n*''Tradition and Experiment in English Poetry'' (Macmillan, 1979)\n*''A Reader's Guide to D H Lawrence'' (Thames and Hudson, 1981)\n*''Essentials Of Literary Criticism'' (Thames and Hudson, 1983)\n*''A Reader's Guide to Robert Lowell'' (Thames and Hudson, 1988)\n*''William Wordsworth: Selected Poetry and Prose'' (Routledge, 1989), editor\n*''Channels of Communication:  Papers from the Conference of Higher Education Teachers of English'' (Dept Eng Lit, University of Glasgow, 1992), edited by Hobsbaum, Paddy Lyons, and Jim McGhee\n*''Metre, Rhythm And Verse Form'' (Routledge, 1996)\n*Entries in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography for Peter Alexander, William Burnaby, Richard Thomas Church, Everard Guilpin, Alfred Noyes, (James) Stewart Parker, and William Stewart Rose (2004).\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*In 2002, the Scottish-American poetry magazine ''[[The Dark Horse (magazine)|The Dark Horse]]'' printed an [https://web.archive.org/web/20050522080555/http://www.star.ac.uk/darkhorse/archive/HobsbaumInterview.pdf interview] with him, in which he discussed his biography and work.\n*[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/research/fa/hobsbaum.html Hobsbaum/Group correspondence archive at University of Texas at Austin]\n*[http://www.qub.ac.uk/directorates/InformationServices/TheLibrary/FileStore/Filetoupload,195850,en.pdf Belfast Creative Writing Group files at Queen's University Belfast]\n\n;Obituaries\n*Obituaries appeared in a number of publications on both sides of the Atlantic: [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/02/books/02hobsbaum.html?ex=1127448000&en=be0169a65043860b&ei=5070 New York Times]\n*Other obituaries (not online) appeared in the [http://www.theherald.co.uk Herald], [http://scotsman.com Scotsman], [http://www.thejc.com/ Jewish Chronicle] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060917075627/http://news.independent.co.uk/ Independent].\n\n==External links==\n*[http://voyager.library.uvic.ca/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2017366 Philip Hobsbaum fonds] at University of Victoria, Special Collections\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hobsbaum, Philip}}\n[[Category:Academics of the University of Glasgow]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Sheffield]]\n[[Category:English literary critics]]\n[[Category:English people of Polish-Jewish descent]]\n[[Category:Jewish poets]]\n[[Category:1932 births]]\n[[Category:2005 deaths]]\n[[Category:Alumni of Downing College, Cambridge]]\n[[Category:English male poets]]\n[[Category:People educated at Belle Vue Boys' Grammar School, Bradford]]\n[[Category:20th-century English poets]]\n[[Category:20th-century British male writers]]\n[[Category:English male non-fiction writers]]\n", "name_user": "A.C.Butner", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hobsbaum"}
