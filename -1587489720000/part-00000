{"title_page": "Mundaka wave", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=May 2011}}\n[[Image:MundakaCoast.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Coast near Mundaka, Biscay]]\nThe '''Mundaka wave''', at [[Mundaka]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], northern [[Spain]], is a [[surfing]] location considered one of the best lefts of the world.\n\n== Surfing ==\n[[Image:Mundaka.JPG|thumb|right|Mundaka]]\n[[Image:PortMundaka.jpg|thumb|right|Mundaka's port]]\n[[Image:Mundaka surf txapelketa.jpg|thumb|right|Mundaka surf championship]]\nHuge swells roll in from the [[Bay of Biscay]] and slam into the rocky coastline of the Basque Country. The estuary at Mundaka has created a perfect sandbar which forms hollow waves that can be watched from the town's harbor wall. Mundaka was formerly one of the sites of the World Championship Tour of Surfing. Some great surfers have marked their legacy on Mundaka such as [[Andy Irons]], [[Taj Burrow]], [[Kelly Slater]], Mark Occilupo and [[Joel Parkinson]].\n\nThe wave of [[Mundaka]] is \u201cperfect\u201d for surfing one of every three days of the year. During the months of [[winter]], the possibility of surfing increases until surpassing 50%. And it is the month of January, with a 62% of surfable days, when the bar of Mundaka displays the best scene for the lovers of this sport.\n\n==History of Billabong Pro Mundaka==\nBillabong Pro Mundaka is one of the most important tests of the ASP World Tour. It is celebrated in Mundaka from the beginning of  October until mid October. In eight years the event has had to be suspended twice. First, in 2001, due to the 9/11 attacks in New York. Second, in 2005 by the hand of the man.\n\n==Disappearance of the wave==\nThe wave of Mundaka is seriously damaged. Its situation is critical although non irreversible. This is what the surfers want to think due to the fact that they have seen how their appraised jewel has not done act of appearance in the last months. Everything began when in 2003, the [[Murueta]] shipyard coat 57 tons of laughs of mundaca, with the aim of making it more passable for the different ships. Consequently, the sea of Mundaka has suffered the disappearance of one of its most wanted waves and in this way, the disappearance of Mundaka, from the professional circuit of surfing.\n\n==Cancellation of the test in 2005 ==\nThe extraction in 2003 of almost 300,000 cubic meters of sand laughs of Urdaibai, caused that the most famous left of Europe  would lose its position in match WCT of the ASP{{clarify|date=October 2015}}. The characteristics of the wave changed as if a disease had seized her. The tube of 400 meters that formed diminished until 40 meters long, starting to disappear. A diving lead the consequence that, lamentably, all saw come: that the ASP suspended the test of 2005. Mundaca, which had received an average of 10,000 visitors with the event, lost its main reclamation and sectors of the region as the guest houses entered into an enormous crisis. Studies of the department of Environment and the University of the Basque Country (UPV) agreed upon indicating that the wave was debilitated by the drainage realised by the [[shipyard]] of [[Murueta]]. The sand was deposited on the beach of Laida and finished changing to the structure of the marine bottom and the flow of the currents. The investigations also kept awake that the own Nature was in charge to forge a similar morphology to which existed before 2003. The force of the sea returned to give to hope to Mundaca and the Billabong Pro.

Stewart, on his [[Facebook]] profile, defended his decision to side with the bakers saying that while he was still opposed to organised religion, \"It was not because it was a gay couple that they objected, it was not because they were celebrating some sort of marriage or an agreement between them. It was the actual words on the cake they objected to. Because they found the words offensive. I would support their rights to say 'no, this is personally offensive to my beliefs, I will not do it.'\" The Christian Bakers would ultimately win in [[Lee v Ashers Baking Company Ltd and others|a narrow landmark Supreme Court decision]] for the United Kingdom, almost simultaneously as a [[Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission|similar case in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11653932/Patrick-Stewart-defends-Christian-bakers-in-gay-cake-controversy.html|title=Patrick Stewart defends Christian bakers in 'gay cake' controversy|first=Saffron|last=Alexander|date=5 June 2015|accessdate=17 September 2019|newspaper=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nStewart is also an avid car enthusiast; he is regularly seen at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]] during [[British Grand Prix]] weekends.

Northwest of Darbun, two frame homes were completely leveled, one of which was removed off its foundation. A large hardwood tree was uprooted and lofted several feet in this area. One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

The episode shows Lalo early on as a welcoming and charismatic person to his extended family and the cartel, but later having an evil and vengeful side when his family comes under attack.<ref name=\"variety dalton\"/>\n\nGilligan and Gould gave Dalton the freedom to take Lalo's personality as he saw fit, in the same manner they had allowed [[Jonathan Banks]] to develop [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] during ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-tony-dalton-lalo.html | title = Better Call Saul\u2019s Tony Dalton Hopes That Lalo Gets a \u2018Worthy Death\u2019 | first = Maria Elena | last = Fernandez | date = April 20, 2020 | accessdate = April 21, 2020 | work = [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] }}</ref> According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming: \"I saw ''Breaking Bad'' and I saw ''Better Call Saul'' before I got the job, and I thought there needs to be somebody besides [[Bob Odenkirk|Bob [Odenkirk]]], [...] who is also kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous in the bad guy's part\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> Dalton took inspiration from [[Samuel L.

If he was standing against a wall, you couldn\u2019t tell him apart from the wall.\" Dalton avoided giving him a thick Mexican accent because \"he\u2019s kind of a second generation narco.

Introduced in the [[Better Call Saul (season 4)|fourth season]], he is portrayed by [[Tony Dalton]], and was created by [[Vince Gilligan]], [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] and [[Gordon Smith (screenwriter)|Gordon Smith]].\n\nLalo, a member of the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]], is one of many nephews of drug kingpin [[Hector Salamanca]]. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did.\n\n== Conception and development ==\n[[File:Tony Dalton (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Tony Dalton]]\n[[Tony Dalton]] made his first on-screen appearance as Lalo Salamanca in the fourth season episode \"[[Coushatta (Better Call Saul)|Coushatta]]\". The character was first mentioned in the ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' episode \"[[Better Call Saul (Breaking Bad)|Better Call Saul]]\", which also referenced the character \"Ignacio\" ([[Nacho Varga]]) and introduced the character [[Saul Goodman]] (Jimmy McGill).<ref name=\"bustle\" /> Prior to the show's airing, [[Vince Gilligan]] mentioned in an interview that the writers had envisioned Lalo to become a major character, acknowledging that, like on ''Breaking Bad'', they must \"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |title=Vince Gilligan Gives Us a Glimpse of Where Better Call Saul Is Headed |last=Tannenbaum |first=Rob |date=February 5, 2015 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081417/https://www.wired.com/2015/02/vince-gilligan-better-call-saul/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref> However, Gilligan and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] had difficulties in figuring in how to introduce the character properly. They considered him as a [[bogeyman]] around the second season when they started writing narrative to support the need for Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or other motivations. Gilligan believes this was more his fault for delaying on developing Lalo, as it was Gould that pushed on the need to introduce Lalo sooner into the story. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a equal foil for [[Gus Fring]], which lead to the casting of Dalton for the role who had the charmisa, charm and athletism they felt they needed for Lalo.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |title=5 Burning Questions About the \u2018Better Call Saul\u2019 Season 5 Finale&nbsp;\u2014 Answered |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=April 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200421083848/https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-creators-interview-984340/ |archive-date=April 21, 2020 |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Den of Geek]]'', [[Michael Mando]] (who portrays Nacho) described the character of Lalo as \"a Salamanca in every way, just like [[Tuco Salamanca|Tuco]] and [[Hector Salamanca|Hector]] had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/better-call-saul/275809/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path |title=Better Call Saul Season 4: Nacho's Dark Path |last=Kurland |first=Daniel |date=August 21, 2018 |website=[[Den of Geek]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309081528/https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/better-call-saul-season-4-nachos-dark-path/ |archive-date=March 9, 2020 |access-date=March 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe episode \"[[Wiedersehen]]\", written by [[Gennifer Hutchison]], fleshes out Lalo further.

The episode shows Lalo early on as a welcoming and charismatic person to his extended family and the cartel, but later having an evil and vengeful side when his family comes under attack.<ref name=\"variety dalton\"/>\n\nGilligan and Gould gave Dalton the freedom to take Lalo's personality as he saw fit, in the same manner they had allowed [[Jonathan Banks]] to develop [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] during ''Breaking Bad''.<ref name=\"vulture dalton\">{{cite web | url = https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/better-call-saul-season-5-finale-tony-dalton-lalo.html | title = Better Call Saul\u2019s Tony Dalton Hopes That Lalo Gets a \u2018Worthy Death\u2019 | first = Maria Elena | last = Fernandez | date = April 20, 2020 | accessdate = April 21, 2020 | work = [[Vulture (magazine)|Vulture]] }}</ref> According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming: \"I saw ''Breaking Bad'' and I saw ''Better Call Saul'' before I got the job, and I thought there needs to be somebody besides [[Bob Odenkirk|Bob [Odenkirk]]], [...] who is also kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous in the bad guy's part\".<ref name=\"looper\" /> Dalton took inspiration from [[Samuel L.

He mentioned 13 languages under the heading ''North-Western High-Sudan Family, or Mand\u00e9ga Family of Languages''. In 1901, [[Maurice Delafosse]] made a distinction of two groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essai de manuel pratique de la langue mand\u00e9 ou mandingue ...|last=Delafosse|first=Maurice|publisher=Institut national de langues et civilisations orientales|year=1901|isbn=|location=|pages=|oclc=461494818}}</ref> He speaks of a northern group ''mand\u00e9-tan'' and a southern group ''mand\u00e9-fu''. The distinction was basically done only because the languages in the north use the expression ''tan'' for ten, and the southern languages use ''fu''. In 1924, Louis Tauxier noted that the distinction is not well founded and there is at least a third subgroup he called ''mand\u00e9-bu''. It was not until 1950 that Andr\u00e9 Prost supported that view and gave further details.\n\nIn 1958, Welmers published an article ''The Mande Languages'' where he divided the languages into three subgroups: North-West, South and East. His conclusion was based on [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] research. [[Joseph Greenberg]] followed that distinction in his ''The Languages of Africa'' (1963). Long (1971) and G\u00e9rard Galtier (1980) follow the distinction into three groups but with notable differences.\n\nVarious opinions exist as to the age of the Mande languages. Greenberg has suggested that the Niger-Congo group, which in his view includes the Mande languages, began to break up around [[5th millennium BC|7000 years]] [[Before Present|BP]]. Its speakers practised a [[Neolithic]] culture, as indicated by the Proto-Niger-Congo words for \"cow\", \"goat\" and \"cultivate\".<ref>\nD.F. McCall, \"The Cultural Map and Time Profile of the Mande Speaking Peoples,\" in C.T. Hodge (ed.). Papers on the Manding, Indiana University, Bloomington, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe Mande languages are considered to be an independent language family by Dimmendaal (2011).<ref>{{cite book|first=Gerrit J.|last=Dimmendaal|title=Historical Linguistics and the Comparative Study of African Languages|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=978-90-272-8722-9}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nMande does not share the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] characteristic of most of the Niger\u2013Congo family, such as the [[noun-class system]]. Blench regards it as an early branch that, like [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] and perhaps [[Dogon languages|Dogon]], diverged before it developed. Dwyer (1998) compared it with other branches of Niger\u2013Congo and finds that they form a coherent family, with Mande being the most divergent of the branches he considered. However, Dimmendaal (2008) argues that the evidence for inclusion is slim, with no new evidence for decades, and for now Mande is best considered an independent family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimmendaal|first=Gerrit J.|date=2008|title=Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=2|issue=5|pages=840\u2013858|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00085.x|issn=1749-818X}}</ref>\n\nMost internal Mande classifications are based on [[lexicostatistics]], and the results are unreliable (see, for example, Vydrin (2009),<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the problem of the Proto-Mande homeland.|last=Valentin|first=Vydrin|oclc=798912747}}</ref> based on the [[Swadesh list]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/index/mande_languages/mande_family/|title=Mande language family|website=mandelang.kunstkamera.ru|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> The following classification from Kastenholz (1996) is based on lexical innovations and comparative linguistics;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sprachgeschichte im West-Mande : Methoden und Rekonstruktionen|first=Raimund|last=Kastenholz|date=1996|publisher=K\u00f6ppe|isbn=3896450719|location=K\u00f6ln|pages=281|oclc=42295840}}</ref> details of East Mande are from Dwyer (1989, 1996), summarized in Williamson & Blench 2000.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=African languages : an introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Heine, Bernd |editor2=Nurse, Derek |isbn=0521661781|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=42810789}}</ref>\n\n{{clade\n| label1=Mande&nbsp;\n| 1={{clade\n  | label1={{nowrap|&nbsp;East Mande&nbsp;}}<br>&nbsp;(Dan\u2013Busa)&nbsp;\n  | 1={{clade\n    | label1=South(east)&nbsp;<br>Mande\n    | 1={{clade\n      | label1=&nbsp;Mano\u2013Dan&nbsp;\n      | 1={{clade\n          | 1=[[Mano language|Mano]]\n          | label2=&nbsp;Guro\u2013Dan&nbsp;\n          | 2={{clade\n            | 1=[[Dan language|Dan]]\u2013[[Goo language|Goo]]\u2013[[Tura language|Tura]]\n            | 2=[[Guro language|Guro]]\u2013[[Yaure language|Yaure]]\n              }}\n          }}<!--end MD-->\n      | label2=&nbsp;Nwa\u2013Beng&nbsp;\n      | 2={{clade\n        | 1=[[Mwan language|Mwa]]\u2013[[Wan language|Wan]]\n        | 2=[[Gagu language|Gban]]\u2013[[Beng language|Beng]]\n          }}\n        }}<!--end SEM-->\n    | label2=&nbsp;Bisa\u2013Busa&nbsp;\n    | 2={{clade\n      | 2=[[Bissa language|Bissa]]\n      | label1=&nbsp;Samo\u2013Busa&nbsp;\n      | 1={{clade\n        | 1=[[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]]\n        | label2=Busa &nbsp;languages&nbsp;\n        | 2={{clade\n          | 1=[[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]]\u2013[[Boko language|Boko]]\n          | 2=[[Shanga language|Shanga]]\u2013[[Kyenga language|Tyenga]]\n            }}\n          }}<!--end SB-->\n        }}<!--end BB-->\n      }}<!--end EM-->\n  | label2=West Mande&nbsp;\n  | 2={{clade\n    | label1={{nowrap|Central West&nbsp;}}<br>(Manding\u2013Kpelle)\n    | 1={{clade\n      | label1=Central Mande\n      | 1={{clade\n        | 2=[[Susu language|Susu]]\u2013[[Yalunka language|Yalunka]]\n        | label1=&nbsp;Manding\u2013J\u0254g\u0254&nbsp;\n        | 1={{clade\n            | label1=J\u0254g\u0254\u2013Jeri\n            | 1={{clade\n              | 1=[[Jeri language|Jeri]]\n              | 2=[[Jogo languages|J\u0254g\u0254 languages]] ([[Ligbi language|Ligbi]])\n                }}\n            | label2=&nbsp;Manding\u2013Vai&nbsp;\n            | 2={{clade\n              | 1=[[Vai language|Vai]]\u2013[[Kono language (Sierra Leone)|K\u0254n\u0254]] (and maybe [[Dama language (Sierra Leone)|Dama]])\n              | label2={{nowrap|&nbsp;Manding\u2013Mokole&nbsp;}}\n              | 2={{clade\n                | 1=[[Manding languages]]\n                | 2=[[Mokole languages]] \n                  }}\n                }}<!--end MV-->\n            }}<!--end Manding\u2013Jogo-->\n          }}<!--end CM-->\n      | label2=&nbsp;[[Southwestern Mande languages|Southwest&nbsp;

The Mande languages have traditionally been considered a divergent branch of the [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger\u2013Congo family]], however that categorisation has been controversial.\n\n==Homeland==\n[[Valentin Vydrin]] concluded: \"the Mande [[Urheimat|homeland]] at the second half of the 4th millennium BC was located in Southern [[Sahara]], somewhere to the North of 16\u00b0 or even 18\u00b0 of Northern latitude and between 3\u00b0 and 12\u00b0 of Western longitude.\"<ref name=\"Vydrin II\">{{cite web |last1=Vydrin |first1=Valentin |title=On the Problem of the Proto-Mande Homeland |url=http://www.jolr.ru/files/(10)jlr2009-1(107-142).pdf |website=Journal of Language Relationship |publisher=Journal of Language Relationship}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe group was first recognized in 1854 by [[Sigismund Wilhelm Koelle]], in his ''[[Polyglotta Africana]]''. He mentioned 13 languages under the heading ''North-Western High-Sudan Family, or Mand\u00e9ga Family of Languages''. In 1901, [[Maurice Delafosse]] made a distinction of two groups.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Essai de manuel pratique de la langue mand\u00e9 ou mandingue ...|last=Delafosse|first=Maurice|publisher=Institut national de langues et civilisations orientales|year=1901|isbn=|location=|pages=|oclc=461494818}}</ref> He speaks of a northern group ''mand\u00e9-tan'' and a southern group ''mand\u00e9-fu''. The distinction was basically done only because the languages in the north use the expression ''tan'' for ten, and the southern languages use ''fu''. In 1924, Louis Tauxier noted that the distinction is not well founded and there is at least a third subgroup he called ''mand\u00e9-bu''. It was not until 1950 that Andr\u00e9 Prost supported that view and gave further details.\n\nIn 1958, Welmers published an article ''The Mande Languages'' where he divided the languages into three subgroups: North-West, South and East. His conclusion was based on [[lexicostatistics|lexicostatistic]] research. [[Joseph Greenberg]] followed that distinction in his ''The Languages of Africa'' (1963). Long (1971) and G\u00e9rard Galtier (1980) follow the distinction into three groups but with notable differences.\n\nVarious opinions exist as to the age of the Mande languages. Greenberg has suggested that the Niger-Congo group, which in his view includes the Mande languages, began to break up around [[5th millennium BC|7000 years]] [[Before Present|BP]]. Its speakers practised a [[Neolithic]] culture, as indicated by the Proto-Niger-Congo words for \"cow\", \"goat\" and \"cultivate\".<ref>\nD.F. McCall, \"The Cultural Map and Time Profile of the Mande Speaking Peoples,\" in C.T. Hodge (ed.). Papers on the Manding, Indiana University, Bloomington, 1971.</ref>\n\nThe Mande languages are considered to be an independent language family by Dimmendaal (2011).<ref>{{cite book|first=Gerrit J.|last=Dimmendaal|title=Historical Linguistics and the Comparative Study of African Languages|year=2011|publisher=John Benjamins|isbn=978-90-272-8722-9}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\nMande does not share the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] characteristic of most of the Niger\u2013Congo family, such as the [[noun-class system]]. Blench regards it as an early branch that, like [[Ijoid languages|Ijoid]] and perhaps [[Dogon languages|Dogon]], diverged before it developed. Dwyer (1998) compared it with other branches of Niger\u2013Congo and finds that they form a coherent family, with Mande being the most divergent of the branches he considered. However, Dimmendaal (2008) argues that the evidence for inclusion is slim, with no new evidence for decades, and for now Mande is best considered an independent family.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimmendaal|first=Gerrit J.|date=2008|title=Language Ecology and Linguistic Diversity on the African Continent|journal=Language and Linguistics Compass|volume=2|issue=5|pages=840\u2013858|doi=10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00085.x|issn=1749-818X}}</ref>\n\nMost internal Mande classifications are based on [[lexicostatistics]], and the results are unreliable (see, for example, Vydrin (2009),<ref>{{Cite book|title=On the problem of the Proto-Mande homeland.|last=Valentin|first=Vydrin|oclc=798912747}}</ref> based on the [[Swadesh list]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mandelang.kunstkamera.ru/index/mande_languages/mande_family/|title=Mande language family|website=mandelang.kunstkamera.ru|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> The following classification from Kastenholz (1996) is based on lexical innovations and comparative linguistics;<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sprachgeschichte im West-Mande : Methoden und Rekonstruktionen|first=Raimund|last=Kastenholz|date=1996|publisher=K\u00f6ppe|isbn=3896450719|location=K\u00f6ln|pages=281|oclc=42295840}}</ref> details of East Mande are from Dwyer (1989, 1996), summarized in Williamson & Blench 2000.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=African languages : an introduction|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|editor=Heine, Bernd |editor2=Nurse, Derek |isbn=0521661781|location=Cambridge [England]|oclc=42810789}}</ref>\n\n{{clade\n| label1=Mande&nbsp;\n| 1={{clade\n  | label1={{nowrap|&nbsp;East Mande&nbsp;}}<br>&nbsp;(Dan\u2013Busa)&nbsp;\n  | 1={{clade\n    | label1=South(east)&nbsp;<br>Mande\n    | 1={{clade\n      | label1=&nbsp;Mano\u2013Dan&nbsp;\n      | 1={{clade\n          | 1=[[Mano language|Mano]]\n          | label2=&nbsp;Guro\u2013Dan&nbsp;\n          | 2={{clade\n            | 1=[[Dan language|Dan]]\u2013[[Goo language|Goo]]\u2013[[Tura language|Tura]]\n            | 2=[[Guro language|Guro]]\u2013[[Yaure language|Yaure]]\n              }}\n          }}<!--end MD-->\n      | label2=&nbsp;Nwa\u2013Beng&nbsp;\n      | 2={{clade\n        | 1=[[Mwan language|Mwa]]\u2013[[Wan language|Wan]]\n        | 2=[[Gagu language|Gban]]\u2013[[Beng language|Beng]]\n          }}\n        }}<!--end SEM-->\n    | label2=&nbsp;Bisa\u2013Busa&nbsp;\n    | 2={{clade\n      | 2=[[Bissa language|Bissa]]\n      | label1=&nbsp;Samo\u2013Busa&nbsp;\n      | 1={{clade\n        | 1=[[Samo language (Burkina)|Samo]]\n        | label2=Busa &nbsp;languages&nbsp;\n        | 2={{clade\n          | 1=[[Busa language (Mande)|Busa]]\u2013[[Boko language|Boko]]\n          | 2=[[Shanga language|Shanga]]\u2013[[Kyenga language|Tyenga]]\n            }}\n          }}<!--end SB-->\n        }}<!--end BB-->\n      }}<!--end EM-->\n  | label2=West Mande&nbsp;\n  | 2={{clade\n    | label1={{nowrap|Central West&nbsp;}}<br>(Manding\u2013Kpelle)\n    | 1={{clade\n      | label1=Central Mande\n      | 1={{clade\n        | 2=[[Susu language|Susu]]\u2013[[Yalunka language|Yalunka]]\n        | label1=&nbsp;Manding\u2013J\u0254g\u0254&nbsp;\n        | 1={{clade\n            | label1=J\u0254g\u0254\u2013Jeri\n            | 1={{clade\n              | 1=[[Jeri language|Jeri]]\n              | 2=[[Jogo languages|J\u0254g\u0254 languages]] ([[Ligbi language|Ligbi]])\n                }}\n            | label2=&nbsp;Manding\u2013Vai&nbsp;\n            | 2={{clade\n              | 1=[[Vai language|Vai]]\u2013[[Kono language (Sierra Leone)|K\u0254n\u0254]] (and maybe [[Dama language (Sierra Leone)|Dama]])\n              | label2={{nowrap|&nbsp;Manding\u2013Mokole&nbsp;}}\n              | 2={{clade\n                | 1=[[Manding languages]]\n                | 2=[[Mokole languages]] \n                  }}\n                }}<!--end MV-->\n            }}<!--end Manding\u2013Jogo-->\n          }}<!--end CM-->\n      | label2=&nbsp;[[Southwestern Mande languages|Southwest&nbsp;

Southwestern Mande languages and Soninke have initial [[consonant mutation]]. Plurality is most often marked with a clitic; in some languages, with [[tone (linguistics)|tone]], as for example in [[Sembla language|Sembla]]. Pronouns often have [[Inalienable possession|alienable\u2013inalienable]] and [[clusivity|inclusive\u2013exclusive]] distinctions. [[Word order]] in transitive clauses is [[subject (grammar)|subject]]\u2013[[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]]\u2013[[object (grammar)|object]]\u2013[[verb]]\u2013[[adverb]]. Mainly [[postposition]]s are used.
