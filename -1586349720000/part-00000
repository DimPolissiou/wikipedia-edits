The novel is centred upon twin brothers separated at birth, Hua Wuque and Xiaoyuer. They both grow up in different places. M\u00e1ster Yayoue raised Wuque to kill Xiaoyuer because of their father Jeng Feng who loved another woman then at the end Yayoue explains everything and then Wuque and Xiaouyer are happy because they find out they were brothers.\n\n==Plot==\nJiang Feng, a handsome young martial artist, is injured during a misadventure. He is saved by the sisters Yaoyue and Lianxing of Yihua Palace, who are considered the most powerful female martial artists in the ''[[jianghu]]'' (martial artists' community). The two sisters fall in love with Jiang Feng, but he spurns them because of their arrogance. He starts a romance with their servant girl, Hua Yuenu.\n\nJiang Feng and Hua Yuenu are forced to flee from Yihua Palace after Hua becomes pregnant with Jiang's child. However, they are betrayed by Jiang Feng's servant, Jiang Qin, and attacked by bandits. Hua Yuenu gives birth to a pair of twin boys and dies together with Jiang Feng during the attack. Yaoyue and Lianxing soon catch up and find the couple dead. Yaoyue refuses to forgive Jiang Feng for rejecting her love and vows to take her revenge by making his two sons destroy each other. They adopt one of the boys as their own child and abandon the other. The other boy is saved by Yan Nantian, Jiang Feng's sworn brother and one of the most powerful martial artists in the ''jianghu''. Unaware of the first boy's fate, Yan Nantian pursues Jiang Qin into the Villains' Valley, a place populated entirely by criminals. There, he encounters five of the notorious Ten Great Villains. He defeats them easily but falls into a trap and gets captured. The villains torture him until he loses consciousness, but refrain from harming the second boy and instead decide to raise him as their apprentice and groom him to become the greatest villain in history.\n\nMore than a decade later, the twins have grown up and become a pair of handsome youths. Yaoyue and Lianxing name the boy they raised \"Hua Wuque\", and teach him the martial arts of Yihua Palace. The other boy, Xiaoyu'er, is trained by the Ten Great Villains in different martial arts and a wide range of \"villainous\" skills such as theft, the use of poison, and the art of disguise. Xiaoyu'er ventures into the ''jianghu'' alone and encounters young maidens such as Tie Xinlan, Murong Jiu, Su Ying and Zhang Jing. He gets into complicated romantic relationships with most of them. At the same time, Yaoyue sends Hua Wuque to kill Xiaoyu'er by lying to him that Xiaoyu'er is a dangerous threat to him. In the various fights they have, even though Hua Wuque's fighting skills are far better than Xiaoyu'er's, the latter always manages to survive by using his wits to escape.\n\nThe twins are initially hostile towards one another and have wildly different personalities. Hua Wuque is righteous but naive, while Xiaoyu'er is expedient and cunning. However, the two of them develop an uncanny friendship and mutual respect after braving danger together. At the same time, they also get entangled in love triangles with tie xienlan the maiden they meet.\n\nYaoyue is determined to make the twins kill each other so she forces Hua Wuque to challenge Xiaoyu'er to a fight to the death. Xiaoyu'er is seemingly killed by Hua Wuque during the duel. After Xiaoyu'er's apparent death, Yaoyue exposes her true intentions to Hua Wuque and tells him about her plan to make their father pay the ultimate price for scorning her. Hua Wuque is shocked when he learns that Xiaoyu'er is actually his twin brother. However, Xiaoyu'er comes back to life later and reveals that he feigned death earlier by consuming a special drug. The twins finally recognise and acknowledge each other as brothers.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Protagonists===\n* '''Jiang Xiaoyu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6c5f\u5c0f\u9b5a|s=\u6c5f\u5c0f\u9c7c|p=Ji\u0101ng Xi\u01ceoy\u00fa|j=Gong1 Siu2-jyu4|labels=no}}), better known as '''Xiaoyu'er''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u5c0f\u9b5a\u5152|s=\u5c0f\u9c7c\u513f|p=Xi\u01ceoy\u00fa'\u00e9r|j=Siu2-jyu4-ji4|labels=no}}) aka Little Fish, is Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu's son. He was raised by the Five of the Ten Great Villains and trained to become a great villain. Although he is covered with scars and cuts due to his brutal upbringing, he possesses strong charms and rugged good looks which allow him to leave a lasting impression in every woman he meets. He is a formidable fighter, but prefers to rely on his intelligence, cunning, and a variety of \"villainous\" skills such as thieving and deception. When he first encounters Hua Wuque, he realises that his tricks are insufficient to save him from death, so he seeks to improve his fighting skills. He finds a martial arts manual by chance, learns the skills in it, and becomes a formidable martial artist in his own right. He behaves like a hooligan and comes across as callous and amoral, but is actually a softhearted and kind person.\n* '''Hua Wuque''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u82b1\u7121\u7f3a|s=\u82b1\u65e0\u7f3a|p=Hu\u0101 W\u00faqu\u0113|j=Faa1 Mou4-kyut3|labels=no}}) is Xiaoyu'er's twin brother. He is the heir to Yihua Palace and its only male resident. He bears a striking resemblance to his father, and looks more effeminately handsome than his brother. He is highly respected by in the ''jianghu'' for his formidable prowess in martial arts. He is gentlemanly, graceful and polite. However, he has a tendency to suppress his emotions and has a naive outlook towards life, but he changes after he meets Xiaoyu'er.\n* '''Tie Xinlan''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9435\u5fc3\u862d|s=\u94c1\u5fc3\u5170|p=Ti\u011b X\u012bnl\u00e1n|j=Tit3 Sam1-laan4|labels=no}}) is the daughter of Tie Zhan, one of the Ten Great Villains. She is beautiful in appearance and appears softhearted, but is actually strong-willed, brash and extremely stubborn. She is a decent fighter and was trained in the skill 'Berserk Hundred Hits' ({{lang|zh|\u760b\u72c2\u4e00\u767e\u96f6\u634c\u6253}}) by her father. She falls madly in love with Xiaoyu'er, even though he initially treats her badly. She later falls in love with Hua Wuque, who has strong feelings for her. She becomes entangled in a love triangle between the brothers and often has to intervene to prevent them from fighting.\n* '''Su Ying''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u8607\u6afb|s=\u82cf\u6a31|p=S\u016b Y\u012bng|j=Sou1 Jing1|labels=no}}) is Wei Wuya's foster daughter. She is spoiled, arrogant, scheming and anti-social. She is well-versed in medicine and extremely cunning but has no significant martial arts skills. Her intelligence enables her to manipulate many martial artists throughout the novel. Her beautiful appearance and indifferent personality are similar to those of Yaoyue and Lianxing \u2013 which was why Wei Wuya adopted her. When she meets Xiaoyu'er, she falls in love with him and decides to follow him until she wins his heart. She is more intelligent than him and knows how to adapt her behaviour according to his mood \u2013 thereby making her the only person who can effectively control him.\n* '''Yan Nantian''' ({{zh|c=\u71d5\u5357\u5929|p=Y\u00e0n N\u00e1nti\u0101n|j=Jin3 Naam4-tin1|labels=no}}), nicknamed \"Best Divine Swordsman Under Heaven\" (\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\u795e\u528d), is the most powerful martial artist in the novel. He is Jiang Feng's [[sworn brother]]. His prowess in swordplay is unmatched in the ''jianghu'' and his \"swordsman aura\" can be even felt from a distance. He is said to be so powerful that he can shave a man bald in a single move without the person noticing. He is massive in stature and dresses like a pauper. He is ambushed by the Ten Great Villains and enters a coma. He is revived by the physician Wan Chunliu, who kept him alive under the pretext of using his comatose body to test new drugs. He awakens only to find that he has lost most of his original abilities, and trains for long months to regain them, eventually even surpassing his previous level of power. He serves as Xiaoyu'er's role model and trains him in martial arts.\n\n===Xiaoyu'er's Love Interests===\n* '''Taohua''' ({{zh|c=\u6843\u82b1|p=T\u00e1ohu\u0101|j=Tou4-faa1|labels=no}}) is a nomadic girl living on the plains. She is the first maiden Xiaoyu'er meets on his adventures. She plays a hospitable host to him.\n* '''Zhang Jing''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u5f35\u83c1|s=\u5f20\u83c1|p=Zh\u0101ng J\u012bng|j=Zoeng1 Zing1|labels=no}}) is nicknamed \"Little Fairy\" (\u5c0f\u4ed9\u5b50). Although beautiful in appearance, she is extremely brutal. She has a fiery temper and hates evil to the core. She is not very powerful in martial arts, but her moves are very fast. Once, to comfort her mother, she decides to find the treasure left behind by her mother's ex-lover, Yan Nantian. She follows Tie Xinlan, who finds the treasure and meets Xiaoyu'er along the way, who gives her her first kiss. She marries Gu Renyu eventually.\n* '''Murong Jiu''' ({{zh|c=\u6155\u5bb9\u4e5d|p=M\u00f9r\u00f3ng J\u01d0u|j=Mou6-jung4 Gau2|labels=no}}) is a member of the Murong family. She seems very cold towards people because she practises the 'Rock Altering Divine Skill' ({{lang|zh|\u5316\u77f3\u795e\u529f}}). Once, Xiaoyu'er disguises himself as a [[vengeful ghost]] to scare her and captures her. She falls in love with him afterwards but marries Black Spider eventually.\n* '''Tie Pinggu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9435\u840d\u59d1|s=\u94c1\u840d\u59d1|p=Ti\u011b P\u00edngg\u016b|j=Tit3 Ping4-gu1|labels=no}}) is a servant in Yihua Palace. She helps Xiaoyu'er escape from Yaoyue. She is deceived by Jiang Yulang and loses her virginity to him, and is used as a bait to lure Xiaoyu'er into a trap. After she is abandoned by Jiang Yulang, she feels dejected and chooses to join Hu Yaoshi and the Twelve Zodiac. She is the daughter of the \"cannibalistic\" Great Villain Li Dazui.\n* '''Hai Hongzhu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6d77\u7d05\u73e0|s=\u6d77\u7ea2\u73e0|p=H\u01cei H\u00f3ngzh\u016b|j=Hoi2 Hung4-zyu1|labels=no}}) is the only child of Hai Laodie, the leader of a wandering performance troupe. Xiaoyu'er disguises himself as \"Hai Xiaodai\" and sneaks into the troupe. She meets him and falls in love with him. Xiaoyu'er refuses to admit that he is actually Hai Xiaodai after he saves her from danger in subsequent events.\n* '''Duan Sangu''' ({{zh|c=\u6bb5\u4e09\u59d1|p=Du\u00e0n S\u0101ng\u016b|j=Dyun6 Saam1-gu1|labels=no}}) is Duan Hefei's daughter. She dresses up as a man to help her father with his business. She appreciates Xiaoyu'er's talents and recruits him to be in charge of the medicine shop. She helps Xiaoyu'er once in solving a mystery case. Xiaoyu'er influences her to dress like a woman.\n\n===Yihua Palace===\n* '''Yaoyue''' ({{zh|c=\u9080\u6708|p=Y\u0101oyu\u00e8|j=Jiu1-jyut6|labels=no}}) is the first mistress of Yihua Palace. Although she possesses beauty, charisma and skill, she is described by Jiang Feng as \"not a living person or human being, but fire, a block, ice or a sword instead\". Jiang Feng rejects her and elopes with one of Yihua Palace's slave girls, Hua Yuenu. Yaoyue is angered and she pursues and hunts down the couple. After Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu die, Yaoyue intends to kill their twin boys but Lianxing stops her. The sisters choose one of the twins and raise him as their son and groom him to be the heir to Yihua Palace. According to Lianxing, before Yaoyue and Yan Nantian mastered all their respective skills, Yaoyue was slightly better than Yan, so she is actually the most powerful martial artist at the beginning of the novel.\n* '''Lianxing''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6190\u661f|s=\u601c\u661f|p=Li\u00e1nx\u012bng|j=Lin4-sing1|labels=no}}) is the second mistress of Yihua Palace and Yaoyue's younger sister. She is described to be a sweet and pretty woman whose beauty surpasses that of a flower blooming in spring. According to Xiaoyue'er, in comparison to Yaoyue, Lianxing is warmer in character than her sister. This is confirmed by Tie Pinggu, because Lianxing, like Yaoyue, had also fallen in love with Jiang Feng, but was afraid to express her feelings for fear of her sister. After Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu die, Lianxing saves the twins by suggesting to make them kill each other when they are grown up instead of killing them now. Throughout the novel, it is hinted that Lianxing, unlike Yaoyue, does not take the plot seriously. Lianxing is seen by Hua Wuque as a mother and he treats her with love and respect. As compared to Yaoyue and Yan Nantian, Lianxing is slightly weaker in martial arts than her sister but equal to Yan.\n\n===Good Characters===\n* '''Gu Renyu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9867\u4eba\u7389|s=\u987e\u4eba\u7389|p=G\u00f9 R\u00e9ny\u00f9|j=Gu3 Jan4-juk6|labels=no}}) is nicknamed \"Jade Faced Divine Fist\" (\u7389\u9762\u795e\u62f3). He is honest, simple and easily embarrassed. He practises his family's martial art 'Gu Family Divine Fist' ({{lang|zh|\u9867\u5bb6\u795e\u62f3}}), which blends in well when combined with Zhang Jing's palm skills. He is initially ordered by his mother to woo Murong Jiu, but falls in love with Zhang Jing instead and eventually marries her.\n* '''Black Spider''' ({{zh|c=\u9ed1\u8718\u86db|p=H\u0113izh\u012bzh\u016b|j=Hak1-zi1-zyu1|labels=no}}) is a martial artist who dresses in a tight black suit and has a mechanical device strapped to his wrist capable of shooting spider web fluid at enemies. He is an expert in ''[[qinggong]]'' and is capable of scaling walls with his 'Flying Silver Threads' ({{lang|zh|\u9280\u7d72\u98db\u6e21}}) skill.

The five who raised Xiaoyu'er are '''Du Sha''', '''Haha'er''', '''Tu Jiao Jiao''', '''Li Dazhui''' and '''Yin Jiuyou'''.

The novel is centred upon twin brothers separated at birth, Hua Wuque and Xiaoyuer. They both grow up in different places. M\u00e1ster Yayoue raised Wuque to kill Xiaoyuer because of their father Jeng Feng who loved another woman then at the end Yayoue explains everything and then Wuque and Xiaouyer are happy because they find out they were brothers.\n\n==Plot==\nJiang Feng, a handsome young martial artist, is injured during a misadventure. He is saved by the sisters Yaoyue and Lianxing of Yihua Palace, who are considered the most powerful female martial artists in the ''[[jianghu]]'' (martial artists' community). The two sisters fall in love with Jiang Feng, but he spurns them because of their arrogance. He starts a romance with their servant girl, Hua Yuenu.\n\nJiang Feng and Hua Yuenu are forced to flee from Yihua Palace after Hua becomes pregnant with Jiang's child. However, they are betrayed by Jiang Feng's servant, Jiang Qin, and attacked by bandits. Hua Yuenu gives birth to a pair of twin boys and dies together with Jiang Feng during the attack. Yaoyue and Lianxing soon catch up and find the couple dead. Yaoyue refuses to forgive Jiang Feng for rejecting her love and vows to take her revenge by making his two sons destroy each other. They adopt one of the boys as their own child and abandon the other. The other boy is saved by Yan Nantian, Jiang Feng's sworn brother and one of the most powerful martial artists in the ''jianghu''. Unaware of the first boy's fate, Yan Nantian pursues Jiang Qin into the Villains' Valley, a place populated entirely by criminals. There, he encounters five of the notorious Ten Great Villains. He defeats them easily but falls into a trap and gets captured. The villains torture him until he loses consciousness, but refrain from harming the second boy and instead decide to raise him as their apprentice and groom him to become the greatest villain in history.\n\nMore than a decade later, the twins have grown up and become a pair of handsome youths. Yaoyue and Lianxing name the boy they raised \"Hua Wuque\", and teach him the martial arts of Yihua Palace. The other boy, Xiaoyu'er, is trained by the Ten Great Villains in different martial arts and a wide range of \"villainous\" skills such as theft, the use of poison, and the art of disguise. Xiaoyu'er ventures into the ''jianghu'' alone and encounters young maidens such as Tie Xinlan, Murong Jiu, Su Ying and Zhang Jing. He gets into complicated romantic relationships with most of them. At the same time, Yaoyue sends Hua Wuque to kill Xiaoyu'er by lying to him that Xiaoyu'er is a dangerous threat to him. In the various fights they have, even though Hua Wuque's fighting skills are far better than Xiaoyu'er's, the latter always manages to survive by using his wits to escape.\n\nThe twins are initially hostile towards one another and have wildly different personalities. Hua Wuque is righteous but naive, while Xiaoyu'er is expedient and cunning. However, the two of them develop an uncanny friendship and mutual respect after braving danger together. At the same time, they also get entangled in love triangles with tie xienlan the maiden they meet.\n\nYaoyue is determined to make the twins kill each other so she forces Hua Wuque to challenge Xiaoyu'er to a fight to the death. Xiaoyu'er is seemingly killed by Hua Wuque during the duel. After Xiaoyu'er's apparent death, Yaoyue exposes her true intentions to Hua Wuque and tells him about her plan to make their father pay the ultimate price for scorning her. Hua Wuque is shocked when he learns that Xiaoyu'er is actually his twin brother. However, Xiaoyu'er comes back to life later and reveals that he feigned death earlier by consuming a special drug. The twins finally recognise and acknowledge each other as brothers.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Protagonists===\n* '''Jiang Xiaoyu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6c5f\u5c0f\u9b5a|s=\u6c5f\u5c0f\u9c7c|p=Ji\u0101ng Xi\u01ceoy\u00fa|j=Gong1 Siu2-jyu4|labels=no}}), better known as '''Xiaoyu'er''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u5c0f\u9b5a\u5152|s=\u5c0f\u9c7c\u513f|p=Xi\u01ceoy\u00fa'\u00e9r|j=Siu2-jyu4-ji4|labels=no}}) aka Little Fish, is Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu's son. He was raised by the Five of the Ten Great Villains and trained to become a great villain. Although he is covered with scars and cuts due to his brutal upbringing, he possesses strong charms and rugged good looks which allow him to leave a lasting impression in every woman he meets. He is a formidable fighter, but prefers to rely on his intelligence, cunning, and a variety of \"villainous\" skills such as thieving and deception. When he first encounters Hua Wuque, he realises that his tricks are insufficient to save him from death, so he seeks to improve his fighting skills. He finds a martial arts manual by chance, learns the skills in it, and becomes a formidable martial artist in his own right. He behaves like a hooligan and comes across as callous and amoral, but is actually a softhearted and kind person.\n* '''Hua Wuque''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u82b1\u7121\u7f3a|s=\u82b1\u65e0\u7f3a|p=Hu\u0101 W\u00faqu\u0113|j=Faa1 Mou4-kyut3|labels=no}}) is Xiaoyu'er's twin brother.

However, he has a tendency to suppress his emotions and has a naive outlook towards life, but he changes after he meets Xiaoyu'er.\n* '''Tie Xinlan''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9435\u5fc3\u862d|s=\u94c1\u5fc3\u5170|p=Ti\u011b X\u012bnl\u00e1n|j=Tit3 Sam1-laan4|labels=no}}) is the daughter of Tie Zhan, one of the Ten Great Villains.

She falls madly in love with Xiaoyu'er, even though he initially treats her badly. She later falls in love with Hua Wuque, who has strong feelings for her. She becomes entangled in a love triangle between the brothers and often has to intervene to prevent them from fighting.\n* '''Su Ying''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u8607\u6afb|s=\u82cf\u6a31|p=S\u016b Y\u012bng|j=Sou1 Jing1|labels=no}}) is Wei Wuya's foster daughter. She is spoiled, arrogant, scheming and anti-social. She is well-versed in medicine and extremely cunning but has no significant martial arts skills. Her intelligence enables her to manipulate many martial artists throughout the novel. Her beautiful appearance and indifferent personality are similar to those of Yaoyue and Lianxing \u2013 which was why Wei Wuya adopted her. When she meets Xiaoyu'er, she falls in love with him and decides to follow him until she wins his heart. She is more intelligent than him and knows how to adapt her behaviour according to his mood \u2013 thereby making her the only person who can effectively control him.\n* '''Yan Nantian''' ({{zh|c=\u71d5\u5357\u5929|p=Y\u00e0n N\u00e1nti\u0101n|j=Jin3 Naam4-tin1|labels=no}}), nicknamed \"Best Divine Swordsman Under Heaven\" (\u5929\u4e0b\u7b2c\u4e00\u795e\u528d), is the most powerful martial artist in the novel.

He is said to be so powerful that he can shave a man bald in a single move without the person noticing. He is massive in stature and dresses like a pauper. He is ambushed by the Ten Great Villains and enters a coma. He is revived by the physician Wan Chunliu, who kept him alive under the pretext of using his comatose body to test new drugs. He awakens only to find that he has lost most of his original abilities, and trains for long months to regain them, eventually even surpassing his previous level of power. He serves as Xiaoyu'er's role model and trains him in martial arts.\n\n===Xiaoyu'er's Love Interests===\n* '''Taohua''' ({{zh|c=\u6843\u82b1|p=T\u00e1ohu\u0101|j=Tou4-faa1|labels=no}}) is a nomadic girl living on the plains.

She marries Gu Renyu eventually.\n* '''Murong Jiu''' ({{zh|c=\u6155\u5bb9\u4e5d|p=M\u00f9r\u00f3ng J\u01d0u|j=Mou6-jung4 Gau2|labels=no}}) is a member of the Murong family. She seems very cold towards people because she practises the 'Rock Altering Divine Skill' ({{lang|zh|\u5316\u77f3\u795e\u529f}}). Once, Xiaoyu'er disguises himself as a [[vengeful ghost]] to scare her and captures her. She falls in love with him afterwards but marries Black Spider eventually.\n* '''Tie Pinggu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9435\u840d\u59d1|s=\u94c1\u840d\u59d1|p=Ti\u011b P\u00edngg\u016b|j=Tit3 Ping4-gu1|labels=no}}) is a servant in Yihua Palace. She helps Xiaoyu'er escape from Yaoyue. She is deceived by Jiang Yulang and loses her virginity to him, and is used as a bait to lure Xiaoyu'er into a trap.

She dresses up as a man to help her father with his business. She appreciates Xiaoyu'er's talents and recruits him to be in charge of the medicine shop. She helps Xiaoyu'er once in solving a mystery case. Xiaoyu'er influences her to dress like a woman.\n\n===Yihua Palace===\n* '''Yaoyue''' ({{zh|c=\u9080\u6708|p=Y\u0101oyu\u00e8|j=Jiu1-jyut6|labels=no}}) is the first mistress of Yihua Palace. Although she possesses beauty, charisma and skill, she is described by Jiang Feng as \"not a living person or human being, but fire, a block, ice or a sword instead\". Jiang Feng rejects her and elopes with one of Yihua Palace's slave girls, Hua Yuenu. Yaoyue is angered and she pursues and hunts down the couple. After Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu die, Yaoyue intends to kill their twin boys but Lianxing stops her. The sisters choose one of the twins and raise him as their son and groom him to be the heir to Yihua Palace. According to Lianxing, before Yaoyue and Yan Nantian mastered all their respective skills, Yaoyue was slightly better than Yan, so she is actually the most powerful martial artist at the begining of the novel.\n* '''Lianxing''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u6190\u661f|s=\u601c\u661f|p=Li\u00e1nx\u012bng|j=Lin4-sing1|labels=no}}) is the second mistress of Yihua Palace and Yaoyue's younger sister. She is described to be a sweet and pretty woman whose beauty surpasses that of a flower blooming in spring. According to Xiaoyue'er, in comparison to Yaoyue, Lianxing is warmer in character than her sister. This is confirmed by Tie Pinggu, because Lianxing, like Yaoyue, had also fallen in love with Jiang Feng, but was afraid to express her feelings for fear of her sister. After Jiang Feng and Hua Yuenu die, Lianxing saves the twins by suggesting to make them kill each other when they are grown up instead of killing them now. Throughout the novel, it is hinted that Lianxing, unlike Yaoyue, does not take the plot seriously. Lianxing is seen by Hua Wuque as a mother and he treats her with love and respect. As compared to Yaoyue and Yan Nantian, Lianxing is slightly weaker in martial arts than her sister but equal to Yan.\n\n===Good Characters===\n* '''Gu Renyu''' ({{zh|first=t|t=\u9867\u4eba\u7389|s=\u987e\u4eba\u7389|p=G\u00f9 R\u00e9ny\u00f9|j=Gu3 Jan4-juk6|labels=no}}) is nicknamed \"Jade Faced Divine Fist\" (\u7389\u9762\u795e\u62f3).

When Xiaoyu'er attempts to expose his hypocrisy in public, he attacks Xiaoyu'er verbally and accuses him of committing the very atrocities he is responsible for.

In spite of their collective nickname, they are not an official group ''per se'' because they often operate independently. Furthermore, their fame is due more to their various eccentricities and quirks rather than actual villainy. Most of the ten are not even evil at all. The five who raised Xiaoyu'er are '''Du Sha''', '''Haha'er''', '''Tu Jiao Jiao''', '''Li Dazhui''' and '''Yin Jiuyou'''. They develop an emotional attachment to the boy and treat him with a degree of affection. As such, Xiaoyu'er respects them as his surrogate parents and manages to convince Yan Nantian to spare them.

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels. These publications came on the heels of the success of the [[Murder on the Orient Express (1974 film)|film version]] of ''Murder on the Orient Express'' in 1974.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{Rp|497}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainecrimewriters.com/2018/01/25/dame-agatha-and-her-orient-express/|title=Dame Agatha and Her Orient Express|last=susanvaughan|date=25 January 2018|website=Maine Crime Writers|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nChristie became increasingly tired of Poirot, much as Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] had grown weary of his character [[Sherlock Holmes]]. By the end of the 1930s, Christie wrote in her diary that she was finding Poirot \"insufferable\", and by the 1960s she felt that he was \"an egocentric creep\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Gross |first= John |title= The New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes |publisher= Oxford University Press |page=267 |year= 2006 |isbn= 978-0199543410}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unlike Conan Doyle, Christie resisted the temptation to kill her detective off while he was still popular. She saw herself as an entertainer whose job was to produce what the public liked, and the public liked Poirot.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Christie Mystery|title=Agatha Christie&nbsp;\u2013 Her Detectives & Other Characters|date=22 February 2009|url=http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906011416/http://www.christiemystery.co.uk/detectives.html|archive-date=6 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> She did marry off Poirot's companion [[Arthur Hastings|Captain Hastings]] in an attempt to trim her cast commitments.<ref name=\"Auto1993\" />{{rp|268}}\n\nIn contrast, Christie was fond of Miss Marple. However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple. In a recording discovered and released in 2008, Christie revealed the reason for this: \"Hercule Poirot, a complete egoist, would not like being taught his business or having suggestions made to him by an elderly spinster lady. Hercule Poirot \u2013 a professional sleuth \u2013 would not be at home at all in Miss Marple's world.\".<ref name=BBCdustyClues/>  However, ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' does feature both Hercule Poirot and the elderly bachelor Mr. Satterthwaite (confederate of Harley Quin).<ref>{{Cite book|title=THREE ACT TRAGEDY.|last=CHRISTIE, AGATHA.|date=2018|publisher=HARPERCOLLINS PUBLISHERS|isbn=978-0008255787|oclc=1027804732}}</ref>\n\nPoirot is the only fictional character to date to be given an obituary in ''The New York Times'', following the publication of ''Curtain''. It appeared on the front page of the paper on 6 August 1975.<ref>{{cite web|first=JD|last=Hobbs|place=USA|url=http://www.poirot.us/obituary.php|title=Poirot's Obituary|publisher=Poirot|date=6 August 1975|accessdate=30 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the great success of ''Curtain'', Christie gave permission for the release of ''Sleeping Murder'' sometime in 1976 but died in January 1976 before the book could be published.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the U.S. sent an official letter of complaint to Christie\u2019s American publishers, ''Dodd, Mead and Company'', regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie\u2019s British literary agent later wrote to her U.S. representative, authorizing American publishers to \u201comit the word \u2018Jew\u2019 when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\u201d<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates.

The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\">{{cite book|last=Christie Mallowan|first=Agatha|title=Come, Tell Me How You Live|date=1990|publisher=Fontana Books|isbn=0-00-637594-4|location=London, UK|page=|pages=|orig-year=1946}}</ref> From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the numerous archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Similarly, throughout ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with strong archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

Both books were sealed in a [[bank vault]] for over thirty years and were released for publication by Christie only at the end of her life, when she realised that she could not write any more novels.

However, the Belgian detective's titles outnumber the Marple titles more than two to one. This is largely because Christie wrote numerous Poirot novels early in her career, while ''[[The Murder at the Vicarage]]'' remained the sole Marple novel until the 1940s. Christie never wrote a novel or short story featuring both Poirot and Miss Marple.

Similarly, the novel ''[[Mrs McGinty's Dead]]'' is named after a children's game that is explained in the course of the story.\n\n====Character stereotypes====\nChristie occasionally inserted stereotyped descriptions of characters into her work, particularly before the end of the Second World War (when such attitudes were more commonly expressed publicly), and particularly in regard to Italians, Jews, and non-Europeans.<ref name=\"Morgan1984\" />{{Rp|264\u2013266}} For example, she described \"men of Hebraic extraction, sallow men with hooked noses, wearing rather flamboyant jewellery\" in the short story \"The Soul of the Croupier\" from the collection ''[[The Mysterious Mr Quin]].'' In 1947, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] in the U.S. sent an official letter of complaint to Christie\u2019s American publishers, ''Dodd, Mead and Company'', regarding perceived [[antisemitism]] in her works. Christie\u2019s British literary agent later wrote to her U.S. representative, authorizing American publishers to \u201comit the word \u2018Jew\u2019 when it refers to an unpleasant character in future books.\u201d<ref name=\"thompson\" />{{Rp|386}}\n\nIn ''[[The Hollow]]'', published as late as 1946, one of the more unsympathetic characters is \"a Whitechapel Jewess with dyed hair and a voice like a [[corncrake]]&nbsp;... a small woman with a thick nose, henna red and a disagreeable voice\". To contrast with the more stereotyped descriptions, Christie sometimes showed \"foreigners\" as victims or potential victims at the hands of English malefactors, such as, respectively, Olga Seminoff (''[[Hallowe'en Party]]'') and Katrina Reiger (in the short story \"How Does Your Garden Grow?\"). Jewish characters are often seen as un-English (such as Oliver Manders in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]''), but they are rarely the culprits.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pendergast|first=Bruce|title=Everyman's Guide to the Mysteries of Agatha Christie|publisher=Trafford|year=2004|location=Victoria, BC, Canada|page=399|isbn=1-4120-2304-1}}</ref>\n\nHowever, many American characters are positive characters living in the UK, and are frequently misunderstood by their British associates.

She wrote novels and short stories, but also contributed work to the archaeological sites, more specifically to the archaeological restoration and labelling of ancient exhibits, including tasks such as cleaning and conserving delicate ivory pieces, reconstructing pottery, developing photos from early excavations which later led to taking photographs of the site and its findings, and taking field notes.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\">{{cite web|publisher=Trustees of the British Museum|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/online_tours/middle_east/agatha_christie__archaeology/agatha_christie__archaeology.aspx|title=Agatha Christie: Archaeology|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nChristie would always pay for her own board and lodging and her travel expenses so as to not influence the funding of the archaeological excavations, and she also supported excavations as an anonymous sponsor.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/> During their time in the Middle East, there was also a large amount of time spent travelling to and from Mallowan's sites. Their extensive travelling had a strong influence on her writing, as some type of transportation often plays a part in her murderer's schemes. The large amount of travel was reused in novels such as ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'', as well as suggesting the idea of archaeology as an adventure itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|title=Archaeology is a brand!|publisher=Comhem|accessdate=30 November 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505140439/http://web.comhem.se/cornelius/brand.html|archivedate=5 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Second World War, she chronicled her time in Syria with fondness in ''Come Tell Me How You Live''. Anecdotes, memories, funny episodes are strung in a rough timeline, with more emphasis on eccentric characters and lovely scenery than on factual accuracy.<ref name=\"mallowan\">{{cite book|last=Christie Mallowan|first=Agatha|title=Come, Tell Me How You Live|date=1990|publisher=Fontana Books|isbn=0-00-637594-4|location=London, UK|page=|pages=|orig-year=1946}}</ref> From 8 November 2001 to 24 March 2002, [[British Museum|The British Museum]] had an exhibit named ''Agatha Christie and Archaeology: Mystery in Mesopotamia'', which presented the life of Christie and the influences of archaeology in her life and works.<ref name=\"britishmuseum\"/>\n\nMany of the settings for Christie's books were directly inspired by the numerous archaeological field seasons spent in the Middle East on the sites managed by her husband Max. The extent of her time spent at the many locations featured in her books is apparent from the extreme detail in which she describes them, such as the temple of [[Abu Simbel temples|Abu Simbel]], depicted in ''[[Death on the Nile]]''. Similarly, throughout ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' she draws upon her knowledge of daily life on a dig.<ref name=\":8\" />{{Rp|269}} Among the characters in her books, Christie has often given prominence to the archaeologists and experts in Middle Eastern cultures and artefacts, most notably Dr. Eric Leidner in ''Murder in Mesopotamia'' and Signor Richetti in ''Death on the Nile''; several minor characters are archaeologists in ''They Came to Baghdad''.\n\nSome of Christie's best known novels with heavy archaeological influences are:\n* ''[[Murder in Mesopotamia]]'' (1936)&nbsp;\u2013 the most archaeologically influenced of all her novels, as it is set in the Middle East at an archaeological dig site and its associated expedition house. The main characters include archaeologist Dr. Eric Leidner, his wife, many specialists and assistants, and the men working on the site. The novel is noted most for its careful description of the dig site and house, which showed that the author had lived in very similar situations. The characters in this book are also based on archaeologists known to Christie through her experiences on excavation sites.\n* ''[[Death on the Nile]]'' (1937)&nbsp;\u2013 takes place on a tour boat on the Nile. Many archaeological sites are visited along the way and one of the main characters, Signor Richetti, is an archaeologist.\n* ''[[Appointment with Death]]'' (1938)&nbsp;\u2013 set in [[Jerusalem]] and the surrounding area. The eponymous death occurs at an old cave site in [[Petra]] and Christie provides some very descriptive details of sites which she may have visited.\n* ''[[They Came to Baghdad]]'' (1951)&nbsp;\u2013 inspired by Christie's own trips to [[Baghdad]] with Mallowan, and involves an archaeologist as the heroine's love interest.\n\n==Portrayals in fiction==\nChristie has been portrayed on a number of occasions in film and television. Several biographical programmes have been made, such as [[BBC television]]'s ''[[Agatha Christie: A Life in Pictures]]'' (2004; in which she was portrayed by [[Olivia Williams]], [[Anna Massey]], and [[Bonnie Wright]], at different stages in her life), and in Season 3, Episode 1 of ''[[ITV (TV channel)|ITV Perspectives]]'': \"The Mystery of Agatha Christie\" (2013), hosted by [[David Suchet]], who plays Hercule Poirot on television.<ref>{{cite news|work=Perspectives|publisher=ITV|title=The Mystery of Agatha Christie with David Suchet|year=2013|author=Suchet, David|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUmbf2fMF5M}}</ref>\n\nChristie has also been portrayed fictionally. Some of these portrayals have explored and offered accounts of Christie's disappearance in 1926, including:\n\n* the film ''[[Agatha (film)|Agatha]]'' (1979) with [[Vanessa Redgrave]], in which she sneaks away to plan revenge against her husband (Christie's heirs sued unsuccessfully to prevent the film's distribution<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/1083600%7C0/Agatha.html|title=Agatha|author=Axmaker, Sean|work=Turner Classic Movies|accessdate=17 June 2017}}</ref>);\n* the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode \"[[The Unicorn and the Wasp]]\" (17 May 2008), with [[Fenella Woolgar]], in which her disappearance is the result of her suffering a temporary breakdown owing to a brief psychic link being formed between her and an alien wasp called the [[Vespiform]]; and\n* ''[[Agatha and the Truth of Murder]]'', in which she goes under cover to solve the murder of [[Florence Nightingale]]'s [[goddaughter]], Florence Nightingale Shore.\n\nA fictionalised account of Christie's disappearance is also the central theme of a Korean musical, ''Agatha''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical Agatha|url=http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|website=VisitSeoul.com|publisher=Seoul Metropolitan Government|accessdate=10 April 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416100240/http://www.visitseoul.net/en/article/article.do?_method=view&m=0004009001001&p=06&art_id=78125&lang=en|archivedate=16 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther portrayals, such as Hungarian film, ''Kojak Budapesten'' (1980; not to be confused with the 1986 comedy of the same name) create their own scenarios involving Christie's criminal skill. In the TV play, ''Murder by the Book'' (1986), Christie herself (Dame [[Peggy Ashcroft]]) murdered one of her fictional-turned-real characters, Poirot. The heroine of Liar-Soft's [[visual novel]] ''[[Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow]]'' (2008), Mary Clarissa Christie, is based on the real-life Christie. Christie features as a character in Gaylord Larsen's ''Dorothy and Agatha'' and ''The London Blitz Murders'' by Max Allan Collins.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gaylord|last=Larsen|publisher=Amazon|url=https://archive.org/details/dorothyagatha00lars|title=Dorothy and Agatha: A Mystery Novel|isbn=978-0-525-24865-1|accessdate=30 November 2012|year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Max Allan|last=Collins|title=The London Blitz Murders|isbn=978-0-425-19805-6|year=2004}}</ref> A young Agatha is depicted in the Spanish historical television series ''[[Gran Hotel (TV series)|Gran Hotel]]'' (2011).

The series aired until July 13, 1973, and a weekly [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series began that fall and ran for one season. Actor [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] hosted the series from 1969 to 1971, then decided to return to acting full-time. He was replaced by [[Joe Garagiola Sr.|Joe Garagiola]], who hosted the remainder of the daytime series plus the one season in syndication.\n\nThe game consists of contestants answering general knowledge questions. At certain points during the game, the player currently in the lead is offered an \"Instant Bargain\", a prize to keep regardless of the game's outcome, in exchange for a certain amount deducted from that contestant's score.\n\nThe rights to ''Sale of the Century'' were purchased in 1980 by Australian TV mogul [[Reg Grundy]], who turned the show into a success in Australia (see [[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|''Sale of the Century'' (Australian game show)]]) and eventually sold his format of the series to NBC. With [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] as its host, the new American ''Sale of the Century'' launched on January 3, 1983, and aired until March 24, 1989. It was one of three NBC game shows premiering on the same date, along with ''[[Hit Man (game show)|Hit Man]]'' and ''[[Just Men!]]'' (both of which aired for only 13 weeks), and\u2014like its predecessor\u2014spawned a syndicated edition also hosted by Jim Perry. This syndicated series premiered on January 7, 1985, and ran daily until September 12, 1986.\n\nAl Howard was the executive producer of the initial 1969\u201373 version, and for a short time was co-executive producer of the 1980s version with Robert Noah.\n\nA short-lived revival of the series entitled ''[[Temptation (2007 U.S. game show)|Temptation]]'', like the recent Australian revival, debuted in syndication on September 10, 2007, following a September 7 preview on [[MyNetworkTV]]. This series ran for one year.\n\n==Game format==\nContestants answered general knowledge questions posed by the host at a value of $5 per correct answer. However, any contestant who answered incorrectly lost $5, and\u2014unlike most game shows\u2014only one contestant was permitted to answer for each question.\n\nAt certain points during the game, whatever contestant was in the lead participated in an \"Instant Bargain\" and were offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The selling price for the item, generally the value of one or more questions, was then deducted from the contestant's score, and the prize was theirs to keep regardless of the game's outcome.\n\nDepending upon the version, question values either remained at $5 or increased as the game progressed. Additional Instant Bargains were also offered. The contestant in the lead at the end of the game was declared the champion and used their final score to purchase a larger prize, or played a separate end game, which varied depending upon the version of the show.\n\n===1969\u201373===\nFrom 1969 to 1973, the game featured three contestants, who all began with $25. Midway through the game, the question values doubled to $10. At first, the final round consisted of 30 seconds of $15 questions. Later, this was replaced with five $20 questions (called \"The Century Round\", as the total value of the questions was $100). If a contestant's total was reduced to zero (or lower), that contestant was eliminated from the game.\n\nAt certain points during gameplay, all contestants were offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The first contestant to buzz in after the prize was revealed purchased that prize, and the price was deducted from his or her score. The prices of all prizes offered were expressed much as one would hear in a department store (ending with \"and 95 cents\"), and the prices increased as the episode progressed (e.g., $7.95, $11.95, $14.95, $21.95). All prize values were rounded up to the nearest dollar before being subtracted from the score of the contestant who purchased the prize. Each Instant Bargain was hidden behind a curtain, and contestants could not buzz in before the curtain opened. A contestant who did buzz in early was penalized by having the cost of the Instant Bargain deducted from their score and being locked out of purchasing the prize.\n\nThe \"Open House\" round was played in early episodes of the original version, usually about halfway through a particular episode. Five prizes were presented to the contestants and each could buy as many of them as he or she wanted. Unlike Instant Bargains, multiple contestants could buy the same item. This was later replaced with an \"Audience Sale\" round in which three members of the studio audience guessed the \"sale price\" of an item. The one that bid closest without going over won the item. The three contestants could increase their score by correctly guessing which audience member would win.\n\nDuring the last thirteen weeks of this series, and the aforementioned follow-up weekly syndicated series,<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=David|title=The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows|year=1999|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0816038473}}</ref> two married couples competed instead of three individual contestants. Each couple was given $20 at the start of the game. On the syndicated version, the first round consisted of questions worth $5, and in the second questions were valued at $10. A series of five questions worth $20 each were asked to conclude the game. If either couple's score reached $0, both couples were given an additional $20.\n\nThe winning contestant or couple was given the opportunity to spend their score on at least one of several grand prizes at the \"Sale of the Century\". Contestants either purchased a prize with their winnings and retired, or elected to return the next day and try to win enough to buy a more expensive prize. Champions could buy more than one prize. Also, when contestants chose to return the next day, they were asked which prizes they were considering buying. As long as the contestant kept winning, those prizes remained while others were replaced by more expensive ones.\n\nThe 1970s syndicated version featured two different formats. Both offered three possible prizes (almost always a trip, a fur coat, and a car), only one of which the couple could win. Originally, each prize had a sale price, and Garagiola asked questions worth $100 each, which was added to the couple's score from the game. When the amount reached the sale price of a prize, the couple could buy the prize or keep playing for a more expensive prize. Later, this was changed to \"The Game of Champions\". The three prizes had sale amounts ($150, $300, and $600). The winning couple chose a prize and had to answer three questions (worth $50, $100, or $200 each, depending on the prize) in order to win.\n\n===1983\u201389===\n\n====Original format====\nThree contestants competed each day, usually a returning champion and two challengers. Each contestant was given $20 at the start of the game. Except for Fame Game questions, contestants earned $5 for a correct answer and were penalized $5 for an incorrect answer. A contestant's score, however, could not be reduced below $0. Contestants could buzz-in before the question was finished, but had to answer based only on whatever information the host had read to that point.\n\nThree Instant Bargains were played per game, with prizes generally becoming more valuable and costing more as the game progressed. In some cases, the host could reduce the cost and/or offer extra cash to entice a contestant to make a purchase. During an Instant Bargain, only the player in the lead could purchase the prize available. In case of a tie for the lead, a [[Dutch auction]] was usually conducted for the prize, although sometimes the price remained the same. For a brief time in early 1984, any contestant who bought an Instant Bargain could win back the money they spent by correctly answering a \"Money Back Question\" immediately afterward.\n\nAdditional questions were asked after the first Instant Bargain, following which the first \"Fame Game\" was played. A \"who-am-I?\"-style question was posed to the contestants, with clues becoming easier as the question continued. A contestant who buzzed in with a correct answer played the second half of the round; giving an incorrect answer eliminated a player from the round, but with no penalty. Play ended when a contestant answered correctly or all three failed to answer.\n\nThe contestant who answered correctly was given a choice of nine spaces on the Fame Game board, each displaying the face of a celebrity. Eight of the spaces hid either small bonus prizes or various amounts of cash, some of which offered the contestant a choice between taking either the money or an extra turn. Hidden behind one space was a $25 Money Card, which added that amount to the contestant's score. The Fame Game was played three times per episode, and spaces were removed from play as they were revealed. After the third playing, the host asked three final questions to end the game.\n\nThe contestant with the highest final score became the champion. If the match ended in a tie, the tied players were asked one more question. Buzzing in and answering correctly won the game, while answering incorrectly resulted in a loss. In both cases, the losing contestants kept any and all cash and prizes won along the way, including their final scores in cash.\n\n====Bonus Round====\nThe champion then \"went shopping\" with the money he/she had earned. A total of six individual prizes were offered, which changed every five shows, and were arranged in ascending order of both retail value and sale price. A new champion was always allowed to buy the least expensive prize for either its sale price or his/her entire winning score, whichever was lower.\n\nAfter a win, the champion could either buy the most expensive prize he/she could afford and retire from the show, or return to play another match in the hopes of winning enough money to afford a higher-level prize. If the champion was defeated, though, he/she left with only the cash and prizes accumulated in the main game. Prizes on the uppermost levels included expensive jewelry, fur coats, and opulent trips with first-class accommodations, with a luxury automobile as the most common top prize.\n\nThe ultimate goal for any long-term champion was to earn enough money to purchase every single shopping prize on the stage. For the first five months of ''Sale's'' run on NBC, a champion had to accumulate $510 in total and the total of the prize values were augmented with enough cash to make the entire package worth $95,000. Later, an accumulating cash jackpot was added to the prize package. The jackpot started at $50,000 and increased in value by $1,000 each day until it was claimed. In order to buy the entire prize package, a champion would now need to accumulate $600.\n\nThe syndicated series featured a similar shopping round when it premiered in January 1985. Like its parent series, eight prize levels were available and a champion could elect to buy a prize at any time and retire. The final prize level, as before, was all of the shopping prizes and the cash jackpot. The difference was that the syndicated series did not offer the cash jackpot by itself as a prize. Instead, the car was the last individual prize offered and the penultimate prize level gave the champion an opportunity to purchase all of the shopping prizes without the jackpot. For the first three weeks of episodes it took $830 to win the entire lot, with $720 needed for just the shopping prizes. Beginning on January 28, 1985, and continuing until the shopping format was discontinued in November 1985, accumulating $640 won the prizes and $750 won them and the jackpot. During this period, the lot was won a total of four times, with the first win coming in February 1985 and the last in September 1985.\n\nOn rare occasions, a champion entered a match needing a certain amount for one prize and finish with a high enough score that, when added to his/her current bankroll, enabled him/her to buy the prize that was on the next level. For instance, the champion could have been aiming for a fur coat but ended up accumulating a high enough score during the game to give he/she an opportunity to buy the next prize in line (e.g., the car).<ref name=\"21-May\">{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=21 May 1985 |quote=Champion Jan Robes was faced with this specific situation. }}\n</ref> When such a situation arose, the champion was allowed to buy either of the two prizes if he/she wished, but not both.<ref name=\"21-May\"/> If the next level involved multiple prizes, like the lot on the NBC series or all the shopping prizes on the syndicated series, there was no choice given between prizes. In the former case, the champion simply retired as he/she was at the highest possible prize level<ref>Barbara Phillips' lot win from 1983. She had entered the match trying to win the jackpot but earned enough money to win all of the prizes. Aired August 9, 1983.</ref>{{Better source|reason=Reference text does not meet [[WP:V]]|date=August 2019}} In the latter case, the champion faced the same decision he/she continued to face after each victory: either to take all the shopping prizes and leave, or try to add the cash jackpot.<ref>Syndicated ''Sale'' episode airing September 20, 1985.

Jim Perry informs him that if he had won enough on that episode he would not have been able to choose between the car and the prizes.</ref>{{Better source|reason=Reference text does not meet [[WP:V]]|date=August 2019}}\n\nAll the shopping prizes were swapped out for different ones every five shows. If a contestant's reign was to continue past the Friday of a particular week, Jim Perry offered a reminder that a different set of prizes would be offered beginning on the next show, told the champion where he/she stood and what else would be available.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=4 February 1985}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=17 May 1985}}</ref>\n\n====Later changes====\n=====Main game=====\nBy July 1983, the Fame Game underwent two changes. The first involved adding two more Money Cards to the board, worth $10 and $15. These cards were added to the board one at a time, with the $10 card added on the first playing, the $15 on the second, and the $25 on the third. Occasionally, a fourth money card worth $5 was placed on the board with the $10 card. Later in March 1984, the famous faces on the Fame Game board were replaced by numbers, and for a brief time in late 1984, there was a \"$5+\" money card, entitling the contestant who found it to immediately pick another number and receive whatever was behind it in addition to the $5 score boost.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Even later, in October 1985, a randomizer was added to the Fame Game board and the player in control of the board selected a number by hitting their buzzer, which stopped the randomizer. When this change was made, the locations of the Money Cards were shown to the players and the $5 card was done away with.\n\nThe regular game format also underwent a significant change in March 1984 when the series followed the Australian ''Sale'''s lead by replacing the final three questions after the last Fame Game with a 60-second speed round. To coincide with this change, ''Sale'' also increased the value of the shopping prizes. The price of the cash jackpot increased from $510 to $650, while the total amount needed to purchase the entire lot of prizes went from $600 to $760.\n\nBeginning in May 1984, a \"Sale Surprise\" was occasionally and secretly added to certain Instant Bargains. It was only revealed after the contestant either purchased or passed on a prize, and consisted of a cash bonus in addition to any money the host might have already offered.\n\nIn March 1986, the third Instant Bargain was replaced by an \"Instant Cash\" game. The leading contestant (or, in case of a tie, the winner of an auction) was offered a chance at a cash jackpot for the cost of their entire lead over the second-place contestant. If the leader accepted the deal, he/she chose one of three boxes, two of which contained $100 each. The third box held the jackpot, which started at $1,000 and increased by that amount every day it went unclaimed.\n\nBeginning in late December 1987, a prize was awarded to the winner of the match. Originally, there were six prizes on offer each week, each hidden behind a number,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=15 January 1988}}</ref> and the winner of the match got to determine their prize by picking one of the numbers (early on, the number was chosen by the defending champion during the game and the prize went to the winner even if the champion was dethroned later in the show). Beginning in August 1988, the prize was predetermined before the show began and Jim Perry announced it before the match started.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=16 August 1988}}</ref>\n\n=====Bonus round #2: The Winner's Board=====\nThe shopping bonus round was later replaced with a game called the \"Winner's Board\", which was introduced in October 1984 on NBC and on November 18, 1985 in syndication. On the Friday before the switch was made on both series, the champion was awarded the shopping prize he/she was entitled to based on how much money had been accumulated to that point.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=15 November 1985}}</ref>\n\nUnlike before, where a contestant had to continue winning and build his/her bank to a certain amount to have a chance at one of the major prizes on the stage such as the car, the Winner's Board guaranteed that the contestant had a fair shot at any of 10 bonus prizes that were offered during that given week.\n\nEvery new champion's reign started with a full board of 20 squares. As before, prizes included such items as jewelry, fur coats, and vacations; however, one prize was always $3,000 in cash. The two highest-valued prizes, a car and $10,000 cash, were each hidden behind one square, while the other eight were behind two each. Two \"WIN\" cards were also hidden on the board. The champion selected one square at a time and won the first prize for which he/she found a matching pair. If a \"WIN\" card was found, the champion won the prize revealed on the next pick. This was the only way to win the car or the $10,000 as long as the champion had won eight games or fewer. When a prize was won, it was removed for all subsequent visits to the Winner's Board by that champion, but the two \"WIN\" cards were always in play for his/her first eight visits. After a ninth victory, these cards were removed and two numbers were displayed, each concealing one of the two remaining prizes. The champion picked one number and won its prize, then automatically received the other one for a tenth win.\n\nAny champion who had won 10 games and thus cleared the board was presented with a decision. He/she could retire undefeated and keep all the prizes, or return to play one more game against two new challengers. A win in this game awarded the champion a $50,000 bonus, but a loss forfeited the prizes. Regardless of the outcome, the champion left the show afterward.\n\n=====Bonus round #3: The Winner's Big Money Game=====\nIn December 1987, the show changed bonus rounds again and introduced a new round called the \"Winner's Big Money Game\". The champion was given a choice of three envelopes (red, yellow, blue) before the start of the round. Inside each of the envelopes was a series of six-word puzzles that served as clues to a famous person, place, or thing. To win, the champion had to solve a set amount of them within a time limit: originally five puzzles in 25 seconds, which was later reduced to four in 20 seconds. The clock began when the first word of a puzzle was revealed and stopped when the champion hit a plunger to stop the clock and give an answer. Passing was allowed, as was one incorrect guess. A second incorrect guess ended the round.\n\nThe Winner's Big Money Game had a series of eight prize levels. Each of the first six were cash prizes that increased in value each time regardless of whether the round was won the day before or not. A new champion played for $5,000 on his/her first trip to the bonus round, $6,000 on the second trip, and so on up to $10,000 on the sixth.\n\nIf the champion reached the Winner's Big Money Game a seventh time, he/she played for a car. A win also allowed the champion to return for an eighth match, with $50,000 at stake in the bonus round if he/she won. The champion retired from the show after either failing to win the car or playing for the $50,000, win or lose.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=22 March 1989 |quote=champion Darrell Garrison is retired after failing to win a Jeep in the Winner's Big Money Game.}}</ref>\n\nFrom the time the round was introduced until the series ended, the $50,000 Winner's Big Money Game was played twice. The first player to reach it was Rani White in May 1988, who won the $50,000 prize.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=May 1988 |quote=Champion Rani White wins the Winner's Big Money Game for $50,000.}}</ref> Five months later, in October 1988, the $50,000 level was reached by Phil Cambry.

[[Jay Stewart]] announced until his retirement in January 1988, when he was replaced by [[Don Morrow]].\n\n==Production information==\n===Broadcast history===\n''Sale of the Century'' premiered on September 29, 1969, on [[NBC]]'s daytime schedule at 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m. (10:00{{nbsp}}a.m. Central), replacing the three-year-old ''Personality'', which was hosted by [[Larry Blyden]]. It aired at that time slot for the whole of its initial three-and-a-half years on the network, ending its first run on July 13, 1973, after which ''[[The Wizard of Odds]]''\u2014the first American program hosted by [[Alex Trebek]]\u2014made its debut.\n\nThe 1983 revival debuted on NBC on January 3 of that year at 10:30{{nbsp}}a.m. (9:30{{nbsp}}a.m. Central) and remained there until January 2, 1987. Replacing ''Wheel of Fortune'', the show that belonged in the time slot from April 1982 to December 1982, the show faced competition against ''[[Child's Play (game show)|Child's Play]]'' at the same time slot on CBS (ABC did not begin programming until 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m.) from January to September 1983, then ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' from September 1983 to January 1986, then ''[[Card Sharks]]'' from January 1986 to 1987. On January 5, 1987, the network moved the show back thirty minutes to 10:00{{nbsp}}a.m. (9:00{{nbsp}}a.m. Central). ''Sale of the Century'' stayed in that timeslot for the remainder of its run, enjoying respectable ratings. It faced competition with three CBS game shows airing at that same timeslot: ''[[The $25,000 Pyramid]]'' (for the entirety of 1987 and the spring of 1988), ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' (which aired from January to April 1988), and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (which premiered in July 1988). The program's 1,578th and final episode aired on March 24, 1989.\n\nIts place on the schedule was taken by ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]'', which had been airing in the afternoons for several years, in a shuffle that also saw ''[[Super Password]]'' end after four-and-a-half seasons (its timeslot of 12:00 PM was given back to its affiliates) and the soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' inherit its place and ''Scrabble'''s old timeslot.\n\nThe revival series spawned an accompanying daily syndicated edition that premiered on January 7, 1985, and was distributed by [[New World Pictures|Genesis Entertainment]]. The syndicated ''Sale of the Century'' ran for one and a half seasons and came to an end in September 1986.\n\n===Episode status===\nMost episodes of the original 1969\u201373 series are believed to have been [[Wiping|destroyed]], but nine episodes of that run are held by the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/search?searchArg=Sale+of+the+Century&searchCode=FTIT*&setLimit=1&recCount=50&searchType=1&page.search.search.button=Search|title=UCLA Library Catalog|website=ucla.edu|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[USA Network|USA]] aired reruns of the entire 270\u2013episode 1985\u201386 syndicated series, and 120 episodes (August 1988 \u2013 March 1989) of the NBC daytime series from September 14, 1992, to July 29, 1994, for a total of 390 episodes.\n\n[[Game Show Network|GSN]] carried the series from April 1, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-acquires-new-series-sale-century-and-new-episodes-press-your-luck-launch-april-1|title=GSN acquires new series Sale of the Century and new episodes of Press Your Luck to launch April 1|website=Corp.gsn.com|accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref> until March 27, 2015. The network initially started out by airing the final sixty-five episodes of the NBC series. As part of the weekend beginning with that year's [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], the network aired a four-hour marathon of episodes from the first season of the syndicated series to pay tribute to many retailers offering sales. GSN added the syndicated episodes to its daytime lineup in place of the network episodes that Monday and aired most of the run before dropping ''Sale'' from their schedule.\n\nOn October 18, 2015, [[Buzzr]] added the syndicated episodes to their Sunday night lineup, which later moved to the weeknight lineup in the summer of 2017. In July 2018, the show moved to the weekday morning lineup, and in July 2019, the network added NBC episodes to its rotation, starting from episode 1410, in July 1988.\n\n===Theme music===\nThe original 1969\u201374 theme was composed by Al Howard and Irwin Bazelon.<ref name=\"EOTGS\">{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows|date=January 1999|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0816038473|page=192}}</ref>\n\nThe main theme on the 1980s version was composed in 1982 by Ray Ellis and his son, Marc, and was more or less a reworking of Jack Grimsley's original 1980 recording for the Australian version of the show.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The show introduced a synthesized version of the Ellis theme in 1987.\n\n==Licensed merchandise==\nMilton Bradley released two home editions based on the 1969\u201374 version.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sale of the Century Home Game Home Page|url=http://userdata.acd.net/ottinger/gshghp/Inside/Sale.html|website=Userdata.acd.net|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> A version based upon the 1983\u201389 version of the show \u2013 made by American Publishing Corp, and featuring the Quizzard game \u2013 was released in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sale of the Century Quizzard|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10188/sale-of-the-century-quizzard|publisher=Board Game Geek|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs part of their \"Game Show Greats\" lineup, IGT released a video slot machine in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGT \u2013 Games: Sale of the Century\u2122 Video Slots|url=http://www.igt.com/GamingGroup/Games/mjgames.asp?pid=5.206|access-date=November 30, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505105933/http://www.igt.com/GamingGroup/Games/mjgames.asp?pid=5.206|archive-date=May 5, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==International versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

September 29, 1969, on [[NBC]] daytime.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/370/mode/2up|accessdate=22 March 2020|page=371}}</ref> It was one of three NBC game shows to premiere on that date, the other three being the short-lived game shows ''[[Letters to Laugh-In]]'' and ''Name Droppers'' and soap opera ''Bright Promise''. The series aired until July 13, 1973, and a weekly [[television syndication|syndicated]] series began that fall and ran for one season. Actor [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]] hosted the series from 1969 to 1971, then decided to return to acting full-time. He was replaced by [[Joe Garagiola Sr.|Joe Garagiola]], who hosted the remainder of the daytime series plus the one season in syndication.\n\nThe game consists of contestants answering general knowledge questions. At certain points during the game, the player currently in the lead is offered an \"Instant Bargain\", a prize to keep regardless of the game's outcome, in exchange for a certain amount deducted from that contestant's score.\n\nThe rights to ''Sale of the Century'' were purchased in 1980 by Australian TV mogul [[Reg Grundy]], who turned the show into a success in Australia (see [[Sale of the Century (Australian game show)|''Sale of the Century'' (Australian game show)]]) and eventually sold his format of the series to NBC. With [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]] as its host, the new American ''Sale of the Century'' launched on January 3, 1983, and aired until March 24, 1989. It was one of three NBC game shows premiering on the same date, along with ''[[Hit Man (game show)|Hit Man]]'' and ''[[Just Men!]]'' (both of which aired for only 13 weeks), and\u2014like its predecessor\u2014spawned a syndicated edition also hosted by Jim Perry. This syndicated series premiered on January 7, 1985, and ran daily until September 12, 1986.\n\nAl Howard was the executive producer of the initial 1969\u201373 version, and for a short time was co-executive producer of the 1980s version with Robert Noah.\n\nA short-lived revival of the series entitled ''[[Temptation (2007 U.S. game show)|Temptation]]'', like the recent Australian revival, debuted in syndication on September 10, 2007, following a September 7 preview on [[MyNetworkTV]]. This series ran for one year.\n\n==Game format==\nContestants answered general knowledge questions posed by the host at a value of $5 per correct answer. However, any contestant who answered incorrectly lost $5, and\u2014unlike most game shows\u2014only one contestant was permitted to answer for each question.\n\nAt certain points during the game, whatever contestant was in the lead participated in an \"Instant Bargain\" and were offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The selling price for the item, generally the value of one or more questions, was then deducted from the contestant's score, and the prize was theirs to keep regardless of the game's outcome.\n\nDepending upon the version, question values either remained at $5 or increased as the game progressed. Additional Instant Bargains were also offered. The contestant in the lead at the end of the game was declared the champion and used their final score to purchase a larger prize, or played a separate end game, which varied depending upon the version of the show.\n\n===1969\u201373===\nFrom 1969 to 1973, the game featured three contestants, who all began with $25. Midway through the game, the question values doubled to $10. At first, the final round consisted of 30 seconds of $15 questions. Later, this was replaced with five $20 questions (called \"The Century Round\", as the total value of the questions was $100). If a contestant's total was reduced to zero (or lower), that contestant was eliminated from the game.\n\nAt certain points during gameplay, all contestants were offered the opportunity to purchase merchandise at a bargain price. The first contestant to buzz in after the prize was revealed purchased that prize, and the price was deducted from his or her score. The prices of all prizes offered were expressed much as one would hear in a department store (ending with \"and 95 cents\"), and the prices increased as the episode progressed (e.g., $7.95, $11.95, $14.95, $21.95). All prize values were rounded up to the nearest dollar before being subtracted from the score of the contestant who purchased the prize. Each Instant Bargain was hidden behind a curtain, and contestants could not buzz in before the curtain opened. A contestant who did buzz in early was penalized by having the cost of the Instant Bargain deducted from their score and being locked out of purchasing the prize.\n\nThe \"Open House\" round was played in early episodes of the original version, usually about halfway through a particular episode. Five prizes were presented to the contestants and each could buy as many of them as he or she wanted. Unlike Instant Bargains, multiple contestants could buy the same item. This was later replaced with an \"Audience Sale\" round in which three members of the studio audience guessed the \"sale price\" of an item. The one that bid closest without going over won the item. The three contestants could increase their score by correctly guessing which audience member would win.\n\nDuring the last thirteen weeks of this series, and the aforementioned follow-up weekly syndicated series,<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|last=Schwartz|first=David|title=The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows|year=1999|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0816038473}}</ref> two married couples competed instead of three individual contestants. Each couple was given $20 at the start of the game. On the syndicated version, the first round consisted of questions worth $5, and in the second questions were valued at $10. A series of five questions worth $20 each were asked to conclude the game. If either couple's score reached $0, both couples were given an additional $20.\n\nThe winning contestant or couple was given the opportunity to spend their score on at least one of several grand prizes at the \"Sale of the Century\". Contestants either purchased a prize with their winnings and retired, or elected to return the next day and try to win enough to buy a more expensive prize. Champions could buy more than one prize. Also, when contestants chose to return the next day, they were asked which prizes they were considering buying. As long as the contestant kept winning, those prizes remained while others were replaced by more expensive ones.\n\nThe 1970s syndicated version featured two different formats. Both offered three possible prizes (almost always a trip, a fur coat, and a car), only one of which the couple could win. Originally, each prize had a sale price, and Garagiola asked questions worth $100 each, which was added to the couple's score from the game. When the amount reached the sale price of a prize, the couple could buy the prize or keep playing for a more expensive prize. Later, this was changed to \"The Game of Champions\". The three prizes had sale amounts ($150, $300, and $600). The winning couple chose a prize and had to answer three questions (worth $50, $100, or $200 each, depending on the prize) in order to win.\n\n===1983\u201389===\n\n====Original format====\nThree contestants competed each day, usually a returning champion and two challengers. Each contestant was given $20 at the start of the game. Except for Fame Game questions, contestants earned $5 for a correct answer and were penalized $5 for an incorrect answer. A contestant's score, however, could not be reduced below $0. Contestants could buzz-in before the question was finished, but had to answer based only on whatever information the host had read to that point.\n\nThree Instant Bargains were played per game, with prizes generally becoming more valuable and costing more as the game progressed. In some cases, the host could reduce the cost and/or offer extra cash to entice a contestant to make a purchase. During an Instant Bargain, only the player in the lead could purchase the prize available. In case of a tie for the lead, a [[Dutch auction]] was usually conducted for the prize, although sometimes the price remained the same. For a brief time in early 1984, any contestant who bought an Instant Bargain could win back the money they spent by correctly answering a \"Money Back Question\" immediately afterward.\n\nAdditional questions were asked after the first Instant Bargain, following which the first \"Fame Game\" was played. A \"who-am-I?\"-style question was posed to the contestants, with clues becoming easier as the question continued. A contestant who buzzed in with a correct answer played the second half of the round; giving an incorrect answer eliminated a player from the round, but with no penalty. Play ended when a contestant answered correctly or all three failed to answer.\n\nThe contestant who answered correctly was given a choice of nine spaces on the Fame Game board, each displaying the face of a celebrity. Eight of the spaces hid either small bonus prizes or various amounts of cash, some of which offered the contestant a choice between taking either the money or an extra turn. Hidden behind one space was a $25 Money Card, which added that amount to the contestant's score. The Fame Game was played three times per episode, and spaces were removed from play as they were revealed. After the third playing, the host asked three final questions to end the game.\n\nThe contestant with the highest final score became the champion. If the match ended in a tie, the tied players were asked one more question. Buzzing in and answering correctly won the game, while answering incorrectly resulted in a loss. In both cases, the losing contestants kept any and all cash and prizes won along the way, including their final scores in cash.\n\n====Bonus Round====\nThe champion then \"went shopping\" with the money he/she had earned. A total of six individual prizes were offered, which changed every five shows, and were arranged in ascending order of both retail value and sale price. A new champion was always allowed to buy the least expensive prize for either its sale price or his/her entire winning score, whichever was lower.\n\nAfter a win, the champion could either buy the most expensive prize he/she could afford and retire from the show, or return to play another match in the hopes of winning enough money to afford a higher-level prize. If the champion was defeated, though, he/she left with only the cash and prizes accumulated in the main game. Prizes on the uppermost levels included expensive jewelry, fur coats, and opulent trips with first-class accommodations, with a luxury automobile as the most common top prize.\n\nThe ultimate goal for any long-term champion was to earn enough money to purchase every single shopping prize on the stage. For the first five months of ''Sale's'' run on NBC, a champion had to accumulate $510 in total and the total of the prize values were augmented with enough cash to make the entire package worth $95,000. Later, an accumulating cash jackpot was added to the prize package. The jackpot started at $50,000 and increased in value by $1,000 each day until it was claimed. In order to buy the entire prize package, a champion would now need to accumulate $600.\n\nThe syndicated series featured a similar shopping round when it premiered in January 1985. Like its parent series, eight prize levels were available and a champion could elect to buy a prize at any time and retire. The final prize level, as before, was all of the shopping prizes and the cash jackpot. The difference was that the syndicated series did not offer the cash jackpot by itself as a prize. Instead, the car was the last individual prize offered and the penultimate prize level gave the champion an opportunity to purchase all of the shopping prizes without the jackpot. For the first three weeks of episodes it took $830 to win the entire lot, with $720 needed for just the shopping prizes. Beginning on January 28, 1985, and continuing until the shopping format was discontinued in November 1985, accumulating $640 won the prizes and $750 won them and the jackpot. During this period, the lot was won a total of four times, with the first win coming in February 1985 and the last in September 1985.\n\nOn rare occasions, a champion entered a match needing a certain amount for one prize and finish with a high enough score that, when added to his/her current bankroll, enabled him/her to buy the prize that was on the next level. For instance, the champion could have been aiming for a fur coat but ended up accumulating a high enough score during the game to give he/she an opportunity to buy the next prize in line (e.g., the car).<ref name=\"21-May\">{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=21 May 1985 |quote=Champion Jan Robes was faced with this specific situation. }}\n</ref> When such a situation arose, the champion was allowed to buy either of the two prizes if he/she wished, but not both.<ref name=\"21-May\"/> If the next level involved multiple prizes, like the lot on the NBC series or all the shopping prizes on the syndicated series, there was no choice given between prizes. In the former case, the champion simply retired as he/she was at the highest possible prize level<ref>Barbara Phillips' lot win from 1983.

If a contestant's reign was to continue past the Friday of a particular week, Jim Perry offered a reminder that a different set of prizes would be offered beginning on the next show, told the champion where he/she stood and what else would be available.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=4 February 1985}}</ref><ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=17 May 1985}}</ref>\n\n====Later changes====\n=====Main game=====\nBy July 1983, the Fame Game underwent two changes. The first involved adding two more Money Cards to the board, worth $10 and $15. These cards were added to the board one at a time, with the $10 card added on the first playing, the $15 on the second, and the $25 on the third. Occasionally, a fourth money card worth $5 was placed on the board with the $10 card. Later in March 1984, the famous faces on the Fame Game board were replaced by numbers, and for a brief time in late 1984, there was a \"$5+\" money card, entitling the contestant who found it to immediately pick another number and receive whatever was behind it in addition to the $5 score boost.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Even later, in October 1985, a randomizer was added to the Fame Game board and the player in control of the board selected a number by hitting their buzzer, which stopped the randomizer. When this change was made, the locations of the Money Cards were shown to the players and the $5 card was done away with.\n\nThe regular game format also underwent a significant change in March 1984 when the series followed the Australian ''Sale'''s lead by replacing the final three questions after the last Fame Game with a 60-second speed round. To coincide with this change, ''Sale'' also increased the value of the shopping prizes. The price of the cash jackpot increased from $510 to $650, while the total amount needed to purchase the entire lot of prizes went from $600 to $760.\n\nBeginning in May 1984, a \"Sale Surprise\" was occasionally and secretly added to certain Instant Bargains. It was only revealed after the contestant either purchased or passed on a prize, and consisted of a cash bonus in addition to any money the host might have already offered.\n\nIn March 1986, the third Instant Bargain was replaced by an \"Instant Cash\" game. The leading contestant (or, in case of a tie, the winner of an auction) was offered a chance at a cash jackpot for the cost of their entire lead over the second-place contestant. If the leader accepted the deal, he/she chose one of three boxes, two of which contained $100 each. The third box held the jackpot, which started at $1,000 and increased by that amount every day it went unclaimed.\n\nBeginning in late December 1987, a prize was awarded to the winner of the match. Originally, there were six prizes on offer each week, each hidden behind a number,<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=15 January 1988}}</ref> and the winner of the match got to determine their prize by picking one of the numbers (early on, the number was chosen by the defending champion during the game and the prize went to the winner even if the champion was dethroned later in the show). Beginning in August 1988, the prize was predetermined before the show began and Jim Perry announced it before the match started.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=16 August 1988}}</ref>\n\n=====Bonus round #2: The Winner's Board=====\nThe shopping bonus round was later replaced with a game called the \"Winner's Board\", which was introduced in October 1984 on NBC and on November 18, 1985 in syndication. On the Friday before the switch was made on both series, the champion was awarded the shopping prize he/she was entitled to based on how much money had been accumulated to that point.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=15 November 1985}}</ref>\n\nUnlike before, where a contestant had to continue winning and build his/her bank to a certain amount to have a chance at one of the major prizes on the stage such as the car, the Winner's Board guaranteed that the contestant had a fair shot at any of 10 bonus prizes that were offered during that given week.\n\nEvery new champion's reign started with a full board of 20 squares. As before, prizes included such items as jewelry, fur coats, and vacations; however, one prize was always $3,000 in cash. The two highest-valued prizes, a car and $10,000 cash, were each hidden behind one square, while the other eight were behind two each. Two \"WIN\" cards were also hidden on the board. The champion selected one square at a time and won the first prize for which he/she found a matching pair. If a \"WIN\" card was found, the champion won the prize revealed on the next pick. This was the only way to win the car or the $10,000 as long as the champion had won eight games or fewer. When a prize was won, it was removed for all subsequent visits to the Winner's Board by that champion, but the two \"WIN\" cards were always in play for his/her first eight visits. After a ninth victory, these cards were removed and two numbers were displayed, each concealing one of the two remaining prizes. The champion picked one number and won its prize, then automatically received the other one for a tenth win.\n\nAny champion who had won 10 games and thus cleared the board was presented with a decision. He/she could retire undefeated and keep all the prizes, or return to play one more game against two new challengers. A win in this game awarded the champion a $50,000 bonus, but a loss forfeited the prizes. Regardless of the outcome, the champion left the show afterward.\n\n=====Bonus round #3: The Winner's Big Money Game=====\nIn December 1987, the show changed bonus rounds again and introduced a new round called the \"Winner's Big Money Game\". The champion was given a choice of three envelopes (red, yellow, blue) before the start of the round. Inside each of the envelopes was a series of six-word puzzles that served as clues to a famous person, place, or thing. To win, the champion had to solve a set amount of them within a time limit: originally five puzzles in 25 seconds, which was later reduced to four in 20 seconds. The clock began when the first word of a puzzle was revealed and stopped when the champion hit a plunger to stop the clock and give an answer. Passing was allowed, as was one incorrect guess. A second incorrect guess ended the round.\n\nThe Winner's Big Money Game had a series of eight prize levels. Each of the first six were cash prizes that increased in value each time regardless of whether the round was won the day before or not. A new champion played for $5,000 on his/her first trip to the bonus round, $6,000 on the second trip, and so on up to $10,000 on the sixth.\n\nIf the champion reached the Winner's Big Money Game a seventh time, he/she played for a car. A win also allowed the champion to return for an eighth match, with $50,000 at stake in the bonus round if he/she won. The champion retired from the show after either failing to win the car or playing for the $50,000, win or lose.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=22 March 1989 |quote=champion Darrell Garrison is retired after failing to win a Jeep in the Winner's Big Money Game.}}</ref>\n\nFrom the time the round was introduced until the series ended, the $50,000 Winner's Big Money Game was played twice. The first player to reach it was Rani White in May 1988, who won the $50,000 prize.<ref>{{Cite episode |series=Sale of the Century |date=May 1988 |quote=Champion Rani White wins the Winner's Big Money Game for $50,000.}}</ref> Five months later, in October 1988, the $50,000 level was reached by Phil Cambry.

[[Bill Wendell]], then on the staff of NBC, served as announcer for the entire 1969\u201373 version. Madelyn Sanders, an African-American model, served as hostess for most of the run.\n\nThe 1980s version was hosted by [[Jim Perry (television personality)|Jim Perry]], who was initially joined by Sally Julian as co-host. Two months later, [[Lee Menning]] replaced her until December 28, 1984,<ref>Weekly Variety Magazine; December 26, 1984 issue; Page 35</ref>{{Better source|reason=Citation is not in format of [[Template:Cite news]] and missing parameters.|date=August 2019}} when [[Summer Bartholomew]] joined the program and remained as co-host until the 1989 finale. [[Jay Stewart]] announced until his retirement in January 1988, when he was replaced by [[Don Morrow]].\n\n==Production information==\n===Broadcast history===\n''Sale of the Century'' premiered on September 29, 1969, on [[NBC]]'s daytime schedule at 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m. (10:00{{nbsp}}a.m. Central), replacing the three-year-old ''Personality'', which was hosted by [[Larry Blyden]]. It aired at that time slot for the whole of its initial three-and-a-half years on the network, ending its first run on July 13, 1973, after which ''[[The Wizard of Odds]]''\u2014the first American program hosted by [[Alex Trebek]]\u2014made its debut.\n\nThe 1983 revival debuted on NBC on January 3 of that year at 10:30{{nbsp}}a.m. (9:30{{nbsp}}a.m. Central) and remained there until January 2, 1987. Replacing ''Wheel of Fortune'', the show that belonged in the time slot from April 1982 to December 1982, the show faced competition against ''[[Child's Play (game show)|Child's Play]]'' at the same time slot on CBS (ABC did not begin programming until 11:00{{nbsp}}a.m.) from January to September 1983, then ''[[Press Your Luck]]'' from September 1983 to January 1986, then ''[[Card Sharks]]'' from January 1986 to 1987. On January 5, 1987, the network moved the show back thirty minutes to 10:00{{nbsp}}a.m. (9:00{{nbsp}}a.m. Central). ''Sale of the Century'' stayed in that timeslot for the remainder of its run, enjoying respectable ratings. It faced competition with three CBS game shows airing at that same timeslot: ''[[The $25,000 Pyramid]]'' (for the entirety of 1987 and the spring of 1988), ''[[Blackout (game show)|Blackout]]'' (which aired from January to April 1988), and ''[[Family Feud]]'' (which premiered in July 1988). The program's 1,578th and final episode aired on March 24, 1989.\n\nIts place on the schedule was taken by ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]'', which had been airing in the afternoons for several years, in a shuffle that also saw ''[[Super Password]]'' end after four-and-a-half seasons (its timeslot of 12:00 PM was given back to its affiliates) and the soap opera ''[[Generations (U.S. TV series)|Generations]]'' inherit its place and ''Scrabble'''s old timeslot.\n\nThe revival series spawned an accompanying daily syndicated edition that premiered on January 7, 1985, and was distributed by [[New World Pictures|Genesis Entertainment]]. The syndicated ''Sale of the Century'' ran for one and a half seasons and came to an end in September 1986.\n\n===Episode status===\nMost episodes of the original 1969\u201373 series are believed to have been [[Wiping|destroyed]], but nine episodes of that run are held by the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.library.ucla.edu/vwebv/search?searchArg=Sale+of+the+Century&searchCode=FTIT*&setLimit=1&recCount=50&searchType=1&page.search.search.button=Search|title=UCLA Library Catalog|website=ucla.edu|accessdate=November 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[USA Network|USA]] aired reruns of the entire 270\u2013episode 1985\u201386 syndicated series, and 120 episodes (August 1988 \u2013 March 1989) of the NBC daytime series from September 14, 1992, to July 29, 1994, for a total of 390 episodes.\n\n[[Game Show Network|GSN]] carried the series from April 1, 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corp.gsn.com/press/releases/gsn-acquires-new-series-sale-century-and-new-episodes-press-your-luck-launch-april-1|title=GSN acquires new series Sale of the Century and new episodes of Press Your Luck to launch April 1|website=Corp.gsn.com|accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref> until March 27, 2015. The network initially started out by airing the final sixty-five episodes of the NBC series. As part of the weekend beginning with that year's [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]], the network aired a four-hour marathon of episodes from the first season of the syndicated series to pay tribute to many retailers offering sales. GSN added the syndicated episodes to its daytime lineup in place of the network episodes that Monday and aired most of the run before dropping ''Sale'' from their schedule.\n\nOn October 18, 2015, [[Buzzr]] added the syndicated episodes to their Sunday night lineup, which later moved to the weeknight lineup in the summer of 2017. In July 2018, the show moved to the weekday morning lineup, and in July 2019, the network added NBC episodes to its rotation, starting from episode 1410, in July 1988.\n\n===Theme music===\nThe original 1969\u201374 theme was composed by Al Howard and Irwin Bazelon.<ref name=\"EOTGS\">{{cite book|last1=Schwartz|first1=David|title=The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows|date=January 1999|publisher=Checkmark Books|isbn=0816038473|page=192}}</ref>\n\nThe main theme on the 1980s version was composed in 1982 by Ray Ellis and his son, Marc, and was more or less a reworking of Jack Grimsley's original 1980 recording for the Australian version of the show.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The show introduced a synthesized version of the Ellis theme in 1987.\n\n==Licensed merchandise==\nMilton Bradley released two home editions based on the 1969\u201374 version.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sale of the Century Home Game Home Page|url=http://userdata.acd.net/ottinger/gshghp/Inside/Sale.html|website=Userdata.acd.net|accessdate=November 30, 2013}}</ref> A version based upon the 1983\u201389 version of the show \u2013 made by American Publishing Corp, and featuring the Quizzard game \u2013 was released in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sale of the Century Quizzard|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10188/sale-of-the-century-quizzard|publisher=Board Game Geek|accessdate=September 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAs part of their \"Game Show Greats\" lineup, IGT released a video slot machine in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=IGT \u2013 Games: Sale of the Century\u2122 Video Slots|url=http://www.igt.com/GamingGroup/Games/mjgames.asp?pid=5.206|access-date=November 30, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505105933/http://www.igt.com/GamingGroup/Games/mjgames.asp?pid=5.206|archive-date=May 5, 2005}}</ref>\n\n==International versions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
