According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt is also colloquially known as '''Isabela de Basilan''' to differentiate the city's name from the [[Isabela (province)|province of Isabela]] in [[Luzon]].\n\nWhile administratively the island province of Basilan is part of the [[Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (BARMM), Isabela City, where it served as its capital since the province's creation, itself is not part of this region, being instead placed under the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. Isabela is still being regulated by the Basilan provincial government and provincial services are provided by Basilan but regional services are being provided by Zamboanga Peninsula. The [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] lists Isabela as statistically [[independent city|independent]] from [[Basilan]]. This prompted the provincial government to transfer the capital to [[Lamitan City]].\n\nInstitutionally, the military has played a major part in Isabela City's and Basilan's volatile history, due to the ongoing conflicts borne out of the Moro Secessionist wars of the 1970s, and more recently, by Al Qaeda backed [[Islamic fundamentalist groups]] fomenting a running gun-battle with the Philippines' armed forces for more than a decade.\n\nAlso exerting great influence in everyday life is the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the Islamic mufti and imams, religious scholars and leaders who exercise a moral ascendancy over their respective groups.\n\nTrading and commerce are still predominantly in the hands of the East [[Asia]]n ([[Hokkien Chinese]]), aided more so by a recent influx of immigrants from [[Taiwan]] and by [[Korea]]ns as well.\n\n==History==\nIsabela's history is inadvertently inter-mingled with that of Basilan Island and the Sulu Archipelago, albeit culturally, Isabela is an extension of neighboring Zamboanga City.\n\n{{See also|History of Basilan}}\n\n===Pre-Hispanic Pasangen===\n[[Basilan]]'s earliest settlers was traditionally believed to be the Orang Dampuans originating from the islands of Eastern [[Indonesia]], who were the ancestors of the native [[Yakan people|Yakan]]s. They are variously called the Orang Dyaks or the Tagihamas.\n\nThe [[Yakan people|Yakan]]s, an inland brave tribe, inhabited the [[Sulu Archipelago]] together with the indigenous Sama and Bajau before the Malayan Tausug from [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] gained control of the area starting 300BCE-200BCE.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru9/R9tourism/bas_facts.htm Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091404/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru9/R9tourism/bas_facts.htm |date=2008-07-20 }}</ref>\n\nHistorians have scant knowledge of the pre-Spanish history of the indigenous Yakans, simply because they have had little contact with other ethnic groups.  Basilan's nearness to Borneo led to the theory that the Yakan originated from the Dyak. Although it is fairly safe to say that Basilan's history is related to that of the Sulu archipelago, it is by no means right to suppose that Basilan's first inhabitants came from Indonesia.\n\n====Yakan Karajaan of Kumalarang====\nRecords of pre-Hispanic Philippines gleaned from the extensive archives of China's Imperial courts mentions a \"Kingdom of Kumalarang\" located in one of the southern islands of Ma-yi (the Chinese name for the Philippine archipelago), whose King sent regular tribute to the Chinese [[Yongle Emperor]] through Chinese traders who frequented the place in the 13th and 14th centuries. Local historians attribute this long lost kingdom to modern-day Kumalarang (now reduced to a Barangay) located along the northwestern coast of Basilan island.\n\nSpecifically, according to the Ta Min Hui Tien (Great Ming compendium of laws), a report gleaned from the records of Tehchow, [[Shantung]], [[China]] (archived and researched in the years 1673, 1788 and 1935): 3 months after the death of Paduka Batara (the Tausug potentate who visited the Chinese Emperor [[Yung Lo]] and died on October 23, 1417), a High Court [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]], Chan Chien, was ordered to sail to Kumalarang (Chinese texts refer to \"Kumalalang\"), a vassal state of the Sulu Sultanate located on the northwestern coast of Taguima (Basilan Is.).\n\nChan Chien was received by Lakan Ipentun (Ch. ref. \"Kanlai Ipentun\"), presumably a Yakan Prince, who ruled the Kingdom as a vassal to the Sultan of Sulu. The Mandarin official stayed in Kumalarang for two years before returning to China.\n\n[[File:Basilan from 1578.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island circa 1578]]\nHe was accompanied by Lakan Ipentun and an entourage of several hundred, composed of his immediate family, minor chieftains (datus), and servants. They were finally given an audience with the Chinese Emperor on November 16, 1420 where he formally asked the latter to proclaim him as a recognized sovereign and vassal to the [[Dragon Throne]].\n\nLakan Ipentun wrote a missive to the Chinese Emperor on December 28, 1420, complaining about the time it took for the Chinese Emperor to act on his request. The Chinese Emperor received the petition and finally granted Lakan Ipentun with the title of \"wang\" (king). After his request was granted, a satisfied Lakan Ipentun, along with his entire retinue, started for home.\n\nOn May 27, 1421, however, unaccustomed to the cold climate of the preceding winter and due to his advancing age, Lakan Ipentun died in [[Fujian]], China, just as they were about to embark on Chinese junks that would have brought them home. His funeral was supervised by Yang Shan, administrator of the temples, and was likewise honored by a eulogy sent by the Chinese Emperor which extolled his virtues of \"determination and serenity\". His son, Lapi, was then proclaimed as rightful successor to the just bestowed title of \"wang\". Lapi sent one of his father's most trusted officials, Batikisan, to petition for an audience with the Chinese Emperor where he presented a \"memorial\" in gold plaque on November 3, 1424.\n\nThe party, with its newly proclaimed King, eventually returned to Kumalarang, and almost just as promptly faded from the historical records of the period. (Note: Kumalarang was revived as a Barangay located on the northwestern shores of Isabela City in 1973).\n\n===Spanish arrival===\n{{See also|Spanish East Indies}}\n\n====Colonization and the Jesuit \"reducciones\"====\n[[File:1578-1630 Suluzone.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Basilan island 1578-1630]]\nThe proselytization of Basilan started in earnest when Fr. Francisco Lado, a [[Jesuit]], established the first [[Catholic]] mission, in an area called [[Pasangen]] by the native [[Yakans]]. \"Pasangen\" is a Yakan term for \"commune\", \"town\" or \"a place where people visit or stay\". This coastal area, however, was already predominantly populated by Tausug and Samal settlers when the Spanish came, and therefore was likewise locally called a \"pagpasalan\" or \"settlement area\". The [[Jesuit]] missionaries from Zamboanga arrived on the same year that the removal of [[Sultan Kudarat]]'s base from [[Lamitan]] was effected, and established themselves in Pasangen on the island's northwestern coast. They constructed the first wooden mission and palisade wall near the mouth of the [[Aguada River]], and dedicated the Island to [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]], the founder of the [[Jesuit Order]].\n\n[[Catholic]] missionaries together with Spanish soldiers who inter-married into the native population were able to successfully penetrate [[Basilan]] by bringing in additional Settler soldiers. So much so that by 1654 there were about 1,000 Catholic families living in the island. Foremost among these pioneering families is the extended Lazaro Clan who, together with its cadet branches, the Saavedra, Generalao, Sison, Pardo, Barrios and Guevarra families, took most of the cultivated lands that was to form part of the growing Settlement.\n\nThus, [[Catholicism]] began to slowly spread across the island with the spirited drive of the militant Jesuits.  With no spices or gold to enrich the Spanish king's coffers, except for local taxes, the Jesuits refocused the Spanish government's agenda and made religion the object of their expansion and conquest here.\n\nIn anticipation of an invasion from the Chinese pirate-warlord [[Koxinga]], that was expected to devastate Manila, the Spanish authorities withdrew all stations in the south of the country to augment their forces holed up in [[Intramuros]], temporarily freeing Jambangan/ [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]] and Isabela from direct Spanish administration in 1663.\n\n[[File:Basilan extra.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan Island 1630-1663]]\nGovernor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara signed a decree on May 6, 1662 ordering the military evacuation of the fort in Zamboanga, and of other Spanish colonies, including that of Ternate in the spice islands of the Moluccas. The Spanish garrisons, along with a number of priests and their chosen local people, evacuated and returned to fort Cavite to help defend Manila Intramuros from a threatened invasion by Chinese pirate Koxinga, which never happened. The Zamboanga fort was finally abandoned sometime in 1663 by the last remaining Spanish troops.\n\nAs fate will have it, the Zamboangue\u00f1o (the forced Settlers from Luzon and Visayas to populate Zamboanga) and Pasangen, Jesuits included, will amazingly endure another fifty-six (56) years (1662\u20131718) of isolated existence and proliferation amidst the hostile threat and return of the Moro master seafares who overtook and destroyed the abandoned fort. The Zamboangue\u00f1os who stayed behind, including many of the founding Jesuit priests who vowed to never forsake their thousands of converted subjects and their new-found religious outpost ( prized as the southern-most Catholic strongholds in the entire Philippine islands ), were by this time already living within the confines of Zamboanga and Pasangen and its people. The Jesuits, belonging to the aggressive religious expansionists' [[Society of Jesus]], who remained in Zamboanga were historically credited for reconstructing the damaged fort in 1666, three years after the last Spanish soldiers vacated their walled post in 1663.\n\nIn the absence of Spanish Royal authorities the Jesuits formed a sort of Catholic city-state, called \"reductions\" (Spanish Reducciones, Portuguese Redu\u00e7\u00f5es) in and around their 3-decade old Presidios both in Zamboanga and Basilan. These were Societies set up according to an idealized theocratic model. The same type of communities were likewise established by the Jesuits throughout South America, but especially in present-day [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]].\n\n[[File:Spanish Palisade Fort.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illustration of the Spanish palisade fortification and Jesuit mission constructed at Pasangen, on the northwestern coast of Taguima.]]\nThe Spanish royal authorities eventually returned in 1718. After having re-established lucrative trading agreements with the native kingdoms that dotted the area, nearby Zamboanga experienced a revival in its economy. The increasingly wealthy Spanish trading post in Zamboanga became an even more sought after prize for the Moro seafares of the era, so much so that the surrounding islands started to attract the attention of other foreign powers, and chief among these coveted islands was Basilan.\n\nHostilities with the Moro natives and Lumad allies resurfaced in the 18th century and this was triggered by the decision which broke beforehand agreements not to build any additional Forts by both parties when in 1718 by Gov. Gen Juan Antonio dela Torre Bustamante went ahead to reconstruct Real Fuerza de San Jos\u00e9 in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga.  The fort completed in 1719 was renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa ([[Fort Pilar]] is its popular name today).  The rebuilt fort was inaugurated on 16 April by Don Fernando Bustillos Bustamante Rueda, senior maestro de campo of Zamboanga.  Three years later in 1722, as primary reason to build this Fort, the Spaniards were launching another expedition against Jolo.  Led by Andres Garcia, the expedition failed miserably.\n\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1663-1718.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Basilan island 1663-1718]]\nBy then, [[Badar ud-Din]], Sultan of Sulu, who was keenly interested in developing commercial ties with [[Manila]] and [[China]], approached the Spanish with a proposal of peace. According to the agreement they arrived at in 1726, the Spanish and Sulu were permitted to trade freely with each other and the Island of Basilan was ceded to Spain. However, in a series of raids on the islands of Visayas, where the Spanish themselves get manpower and resources for Zamboanga, angry subjects of the Sultan broke the treaty which resulted in the renewal of large-scale hostilities by 1730.<ref>{{Google books |id=S5q7qxi5LBgC |page=201 |title=Between Integration and Secession: The Muslim Communities of the Southern Philippines, Southern Thailand, and Western Burma/Myanmar }}</ref> In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege.  But the Spaniards left after a few days.\n\nIn order to strengthen the Spanish position in Zamboanga and the neighboring regions, three companies of native Visayan volunteers were organized in 1832. These natives together with the Spanish troops defended the town and the province from the sporadic attack by the Moros. However, these Visayan natives, mixed with released prisoners from the Luzon lived outside the Fort walls and bears the brunt of the attacks from the Moro warriors. The Spaniards call the Sultan of Sulu's army as Moros, Spanish for \"Moors\", the word Moor was in turn derived from [[Morocco]] a North African country adjacent to Spain, and peopled by Muslims which conquered and ruled [[Al Andalus]] Spain for 800 years.\n\nHalf of the Zamboanga peninsula was made into a Corregimiento (district) de Zamboanga with its jurisdiction reaching as far as Sindangan to the north and the whole of Basilan island to the south, while the northern half of the peninsula belonged to the District of Misamis. In 1837, the government was changed to a Gobierno Militar. Zamboanga was made the capital of Mindanao throughout the Spanish regime, except the period between 1872 and 1875, when the government was at Kutawato/ [[Cotabato]].\n\n====Jesuit expulsion====\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1718-1747.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island 1718-1747]]\nIn the meantime, the Jesuits were expelled from [[Portugal]], [[France]], the [[Two Sicilies]], [[Parma]] and the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1768. Jesuit missions were very controversial in Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal, where they were seen as interfering with the proper colonial enterprises of the royal governments. The Jesuits were often the only force standing between the natives and slavery. It is partly because the Jesuits protected the natives whom mainly it want to convert to Catholism that certain Spanish and Portuguese colonizers wanted to enslave that the Society of Jesus was eventually suppressed. The Recoletos de San Jose ([[Recollects]]) took over territories previously assigned to the Jesuits.\n\nIn 1755, contingent of 1,900 men led by captains Simeon Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo to avenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din.  But were roundly defeated again.  In 1775, after Moro raid on Zamboanga, Capitan Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo but was also repulsed.\n\nThroughout this brief period, however, Catholic missionaries continued their avid proselytization, converting very hard the clans of Subanen, Samals, Yakans and Tausugs to Catholicism, adding to the growing Visayan populations brought in primarily from Cebu and Panay.\n\n====The French blockade====\nBy the 1840s, colonial interests other than Spanish focused over western Mindanao, particularly the territories under the Sulu sultanate. The British, French, Germans, and Americans all became interested in these rich islands.\n\nIn 1843, the French Foreign Minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] sent a fleet to [[Vietnam]] under Admiral C\u00e9cille and Captain Charner,<ref name=\"Google page 5\">Chapuis, p.5 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=9RorGHF0fGIC |page=5 }} Google Book] Quote: ''Two years later, in 1847, Lefebvre was again captured when he returned to Vietnam. This time Cecille sent captain Lapierre to Danang. Whether Lapierre was aware or not that Lefebvre had already been freed and on his way back to Singapore, the French first dismantled masts of some Vietnamese ships. Later on April 14, 1847, in only one hour, the French sank the last five bronze-plated vessels in the bay of Danang.''</ref> which started the French intervention in Vietnam. The move responded to the successes of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in [[China]] in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.<ref>Tucker, p.27</ref> The fleet, accompanied by the diplomat Lagrene, tried to seize the island of [[Basilan]] in order to create a base similar to [[Hong Kong]], but projects had to be abandoned following the strong opposition of [[Spain]] claiming the island was part of the [[Philippines]].<ref>Chapuis, p.5</ref>\n\nWhen the [[France|French]] under [[Admiral C\u00e9cille]] blockaded Basilan in 1844\u201345,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamalashley.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/bangsa-moro-conflict-historical-antecedents-and-present-impact/ |title=Bangsa Moro Conflict - Historical Antecedents and Present Impact |publisher=The Setting Sun |date=17 April 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-05}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2008}}</ref> an island which they called Taguime, intent on establishing a network of naval stations to protect French trade in the area, the Spanish governor protested that Basilan had recognized Spain's sovereignty just the year before, in February 1844. The French then forced the Basilan datus to sign a document affirming the \u201cabsolute independence of Basilan vis-a-vis Spain\u201d on January 13, 1845 aboard the steamer Archimede.\n\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1824-1845.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island 1824\u20131845]]\nOn February 20, 1845, France forced the Sulu Sultan to formally cede Basilan Island to France in exchange for 100,000 piastres or 500,000 French francs. The French Admiral totally ignored Spanish protests. However, the inhabitants of Pasangen who remained loyal to Spain, fought against the French for a year, forcing the French King, Louis Philippe, also a Bourbon, to ultimately decide against taking Basilan although the French Cabinet already approved the annexation, even allocating the budget for Basilan for that year.\n\nFrance's claims on Basilan were based on a formal cession from the Sultan of Sulu as well as formal written agreement from the Basilan datus. These claims were eventually withdrawn by France, formalized in a proclamation dated August 5, 1845, turning over full sovereignty of the island to Spain. During the same year, a US survey mission studied the potentials of the Sulu archipelago, but U.S. intervention did not start until 1899.\n\n====Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda====\nAfter two centuries of incessant and unrelenting raids and counter-raids, the fortunes of the Spanish Empire in the Sulu Archipelago took a dramatic turn for the better in 1848, primarily due to three watershed events: the advent of Spain's steam-powered naval superiority over Sulu's outrigger-and-sail paraws; the fall of Sulu's Balangingi allies on Tungkil; and, the establishment of Fuerte Isabel Segunda or Fort Isabella Segunda on Basilan Island. These three benchmarks sparked off a series of events which, from 1848 on, saw Sulu's power wane until it was finally blighted and almost completely snuffed out on the eve of the American occupation.\n\nTo check the inroads of both the increasingly bloody Tausug pirate raids and the growing influence of Lamitan's Yakan kingdom, as well as to thwart any further attempt by other European powers to colonize Basilan (the Dutch in 1747 and the French in 1844) the Spanish commandery in Zamboanga City sent over an expeditionary force tasked at establishing Spanish fortifications on Basilan island, both to serve as an early beacon and defensive perimeter against the pirate parties, and as a trading post for Spanish interests on the island.\n\nIn 1845, Don Ramon Lobo, the Marine Chief of Zamboanga, accompanied Don Cayetano Suarez de Figueroa, District Governor of Zamboanga, to the coastal settlement of Pasangen. Wooden fortifications were initially erected on the settlement's highest point facing the narrow channel about 800 meters from the shore. The 200-year-old Jesuit mission was situated halfway between the fort and the shore. The fortification proved to be easily defensible as nearby Malamawi Island blocked direct attacks and raids from the sea. Later that same year, Governor Narciso Claveria ordered the construction of a stone fort, following the plan of engineer Emilio Bernaldez submitted in 1844. Construction lasted four years.\n\nBy 1848, the stone fort was finished, replacing the wooden fortifications. In the meantime a sizeable and growing Christian settlement continued to flourish around the Recollect mission, rededicated since the expulsion of the Jesuits, to St Isabel de Portugal ([[Elizabeth of Portugal]]). The Fort thus established was subsequently named in honor of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] and the Indies, and was named Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda. The military garrison was initially placed under the direct command of the Fuerza de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar de Zaragosa ([[Fort Pilar]]) in Zamboanga.\n\nNieto Aguilar (1894) describes the fort as \u201cmagnificent.\u201d Situated 20 meters above sea level, the fortification overlooked the two entrances to the bay, formed by Basilan and Malamawi Island. To the fort's east were the barracks. The fort had four bastions at the corner of its rectangular perimeter. It enclosed a well and had four structures for the corps of guards, the garrison personnel, the presidio, jail, artillery corps and the ''casa comandancia''.\n\nIn the fort was the governor's residence as well as that of his officials. It was also a naval station where the navy maintained small workshops for urgent repairs. It had a storehouse for coal near the shore. Total personnel: two officer, 50 men.\n\nOutside the fort were built other structures, namely: a military infirmary, school, ayuntamiento (city hall), corps of engineers\u2019 building, storehouses and dependencies of the naval station, barracks for the marine infantry, gunpowder storehouse, and the Jesuit church and convent.\n\nOn July 30, 1859, a royal decree was issued allowing the Jesuits to recover their Missions in Mindanao from the Recollects. The Jesuits finally returned to Basilan and Tetuan in 1862.\n\nBy 1863, Fort Isabela Segunda became the focal point of the 6th District of the Police-Military Government of Mindanao. And in 1879, the Spanish garrison built a \"floating\" Naval Hospital on shallows guarding the eastern entrance to the Isabela Channel.\n\nThe fort and naval hospital were demolished in the 20th century, when they were reduced to rubble by American bombs during World War II. The Basilan provincial capitol presently occupies the site of the demolished fort. Recent site excavations yielded rusted cannonballs and other late 19th- and early 20th-century paraphernalia in caverns dug deep beneath the former fort.\n\n====American regime====\nBy 1898, Basilan Island was administratively divided into three districts, the Spanish-controlled towns of Isabela and Lamitan, and the Tausug trading outpost in Maluso, which the [[Sulu Sultanate]] handed-over to Spain, subsequent to the razing and occupation of Jolo by the Spanish from 1876 up to 1899, formalized by the [[Treaty of 1878]].\n\nSpain ceded the Philippine islands to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Following the American occupation of the northern Philippine Islands during 1899, Spanish forces in Mindanao were cut off, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and [[Jolo]]. American forces relieved the Spanish at Zamboanga on May 18, 1899, and at Jolo and Basilan in December 1899.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bakbakan.com/swishkb.html |title=Swish of the Kris |last=Hurley |first=Victor |year=1936 |chapter=17.

By December 1899, the Americans led by [[Col. James S. Petit]] occupied the Spanish naval base of Isabela de Basilan.  In Basilan, an increasingly old and sickly Datu Kalun (Pedro Cuevas) supported the new colonizers. Sovereignty over both Isabela and Lamitan then was effectively transferred from Spain to the Americans.\n\nAt that time, the Philippine\u2013American War was raging in Luzon.  So as not to spread out their forces, the Americans employed the classic divide-and-rule tactic.  [[Maj. Gen. E.S. Otis]], commander-in-chief of the US Forces, sent Gen. Bates to negotiate with the Sultan of Sulu.  Known as the Bates treaty, the agreement provided for the exercise of American authority over the Sulu archipelago in exchange for the recognition of Muslim culture and religion.\n\nThe [[Bates Treaty]] of 1899 between Sulu [[Sultan Jamalul Kiram II]] and American [[Brigadier General]] [[John C. Bates]], further acknowledged American administrative control over the Sulu Archipelago, including Basilan.\n\nInitially Sultan Kiram was disappointed by the hand-over of control to the Americans and had expected to regain sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago after the defeat of the Spanish. Bates' main goal though, was to guarantee the Sultanate's neutrality in the Philippine\u2013American War, and to establish order in Mindanao. After some negotiations, the [[Bates Treaty]] was signed.\n\nThis treaty was based on the earlier Spanish treaty, and it retained the translation discrepancy: the English version described a complete dependency, while the Tausug version described a protectorate. Although the Bates Treaty granted more powers to the Americans than the original Spanish treaty, the treaty was still criticised in the United States for granting too much autonomy to the Sultan. One particular clause, which recognized the Moro practice of [[slavery]], also raised eyebrows in [[Washington, D.C.]] Bates later admitted that the treaty was merely a stop-gap measure, signed only to buy time until the war in the north was ended and more forces could be brought to bear in the south.<ref name=Bates>{{Cite web\n| url        = http://www.philippineupdate.com/Bates.htm\n| title      = The Bates Treaty\n| author     = Madge Kho\n| publisher  = philippineupdate.com\n| accessdate = 2007-12-02\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe peace created by the Bates Treaty did not last, however.  This became evident when the Muslims repudiated the Moro province, a politico-military government in Mindanao lasting from 1903 to 1914, and the [[Moro Rebellion]] soon broke out.  It is important to note that barely two months before the creation of the Moro province, the American colonial government declared and classified all unoccupied lands as public lands.  Immediately after the declaration, American investments entered Mindanao and mass migration of Christians was encouraged. (Rodil 1985:4).\n\nThe American forces eventually arrived under the command of Capt. Wendell C. Neville, who eventually became a Major General, the 14th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps in 1929\u20131930. He was initially posted as Military Governor of Basilan from 1899 to 1901, and was tasked at the establishment of a civil government for the island of Basilan.\n\nBy July 1, 1901, the Municipality of Zamboanga was inaugurated under Public Act No. 135. This constituted Zamboanga and Basilan Island.\n\n[[File:Inaugurateprvincialgovzamboanga.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of the Municipality of Zamboanga which included Basilan, July 1, 1901, with Datu Kalun (background) in attendance]]\nOn September 15, 1911, the governing body of the Moro Province, the Legislative Council, passed Act. No.272 converting the Municipality of Zamboanga into a city with a Commission form of government. The ceremony was held on January 1, 1912 with the appointment of American Christopher F. Bader as the first City Mayor. With the island of Basilan as part of Zamboanga, this made the City of Zamboanga the biggest city in the world in terms of land area. Two years later he was succeeded by Victoriano Tarrosas the first Filipino Zamboangue\u00f1o Mayor of the city when Bader resigned.\n\nThe Department of Mindanao and Sulu replaced the Moro Province in 1914, and its districts broken up into separate provinces, namely: Davao, Misamis, Lanao, Cotabato, Sulu, and Zamboanga, the city was then reverted to its original status as a municipality administered by a Municipal President and several Councilors. The municipality included the whole of Basilan Island and it remained as the capital of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, with a civil government under an American civil governor, from 1913 up to 1920.\n\nThe [[Department of Mindanao and Sulu]] under [[Gov. Frank W. Carpenter]] was created by [[Philippine Commission]] Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920 by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The [[Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes]] was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona, Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Law]] (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began.\n\nDatu Kalun died in Basilan on 16 July 1904 at the age of 58, soon after his first contact with the Americans.  His nephew Gabino Pamaran became his successor and adopted the name Datu Mursalun.  Mursalun, also pro-American, led the town of Lamitan which became an American model of civil government and development.  Mursalun worked for the material progress of Basilan, and sought ways to fight banditry and piracy in the area.\n\n[[File:President Quezon signing the Zamboanga City Charter at the Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on October 12, 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Official Signing Ceremony of the Charter of Zamboanga City by President Manuel Quezon, and witnessed by bill author Cong. Juan S. Alano and wife Ramona, Zamboanga Mayor Pablo Lorenzo, and a young Ma. Clara Lorenzo (Lobregat) in her school uniform.]]\n\n====Philippine Commonwealth====\nPolitically, Basilan became a part of the [[Moro Province]] (1899\u20131914, encompassing most of Mindanao Island). Basilan was then included in the Department of Mindanao and Sulu (1914\u20131920), a district of [[Zamboanga Province]] (1920\u20131936), and then of the Chartered City of Zamboanga (1936\u20131948), before it became a Chartered City on its own right at the beginning of the Philippine Republic.\n\nAlongside military suppression came a policy of education.  Public schools were built but Muslim enrollment was way below Christian school attendance.  Muslims considered public education a threat to their culture and religion.\n\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1936-1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island 1936-1941]]\nTo ensure Muslim participation in government affairs, the Americans soon adopted a Policy of Attraction for western Mindanao.  Moreover, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) replaced the United States Army units pursuant to colonial efforts to reduce American presence.  The replacement of American troops, mostly by Christians under the PC, increased the hostility between Muslims and Christians.\n\nIn the political sphere, the management of Muslim affairs through the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914 was unsuccessful, as leadership in the department fell in the hands of Christians.  Thus, the Muslim leaders were historically opposed to the idea of independence, which meant the incorporation of Muslim areas into a political system dominated by Christians.\n\nEarly in the American period, American plantation owners cleared vast expanses of Basilan's virgin forest land and established what was to be Basilan's primary economic activity - plantation agriculture, mainly rubber and copra. American Dr. James D. W. Strong, the Father of the Philippine Rubber Industry, inaugurated the first rubber plantation in the Philippines (inauguration was attended by President Manuel L. Quezon no-less) in Baluno, a plaque and shrine to this pioneering individual may be visited in the same Barangay to this day.\n\nThe success of what was soon to be the [[B. F. Goodrich]] rubber concession in the northern part of Isabela City, enticed other multi-national firms, such as the British-Malaysian [[Sime Darby]] and the Hispano-German [[Hans Menzi]] Corporation to open rubber plantations in the City's southern areas. The first Filipino-owned plantation was established on Malamawi Island by Don Juan S. Alano, originally of Malolos, Bulacan, who served as Representative of the entire Moro Province (Mindanao) during the Commonwealth Era (1936\u20131942), and the first Congressman of Zamboanga Province (now comprising Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City and Basilan) in the Republic's first Congress (1946\u20131949). He authored the Charter of both the Cities of Basilan and Zamboanga.\n\nMore Filipino settler families, such as the Cuevas-Flores-Pamaran-Antonio clan (progeny of the legendary Datu Kalun) in Lamitan and the Pardo, Barandino, Brown, Dans, Golveo, and Nu\u00f1al families of Isabela itself soon followed suit, establishing sizeable plantations, usually engaged in coconut/copra production.\n\n====World War II====\n[[File:Japanese Invasion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Japanese invasion of Basilan]]\nThe outbreak of World War II disrupted Commonwealth administration. In 1942 Japanese soldiers landed in Basilan and occupied it until 1945.\n\nChristians and Muslim officers and men of the military district in Mindanao and Sulu shifted to the Moro guerilla activities against the Japanese. A civil government called Free Sulu Government administered activities in the locality.\n\nThe Japanese Occupation forces established a government in Basilan to govern both Zamboanga and Basilan.  The Japanese Occupation of Basilan was rather uneventful, however, it barely affected the residents, except in terms of Japanese demand for food for their military machinery.  In fact, Datu Mursalun and his family watched, without much interest, the American bombings of the Spanish fort and naval hospital in Isabela which signaled the retaking of Basilan by joint Filipino and American troops in 1945.\n\nAlongside the Zamboanga operation, smaller units of the Military Forces of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] and the Soldiers of the U.S. 41st Division invaded the [[Sulu Archipelago]], a long stretch of islands reaching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to North Borneo. Rapidly taken in succession were [[Basilan]], Malamawi, [[Tawi-Tawi]], Sanga Sanga and [[Bongao]]. It is during this phase of the operations when American bombing raids completely destroyed Fort Isabela Segunda, which was used by the Japanese as military headquarters, prison and munitions dump, and razed the \"Spanish\" Naval Hospital. Minimal resistance from entrenched Japanese positions in Isabela and Malamawi Island brought about a quick reoccupation which was completed by the beginning of April. On 9 April, strong resistance at [[Jolo]] was encountered. Anchoring their stubborn defense around Mount Dabo, some 3,900 Japanese troops held off the U.S. 163rd Infantry supported by Filipino soldiers and other local Moro guerrillas. By 22 April, the Allies took the position after hard fighting and the rest of the troops fled and held out in the west for another two months. The 163rd suffered 40 dead and 125 wounded by mid-June, 1945, while some 2,000 Japanese perished.\n\n[[File:Sta Isabel Cathedral with Alano Bldg as background.jpg|thumb|left|Old Santa Isabel Cathedral, with the Alano Bldg. (Basilan Theater) in the background]]\n\n===Philippine Republic===\n[[File:Ph-bs.gif|thumb]]\nWhen the town of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] became a chartered city in 1936, it included Basilan. On July 1, 1948, by virtue of a bill filed by then Congressman Juan S. Alano, Basilan itself became a separate city after Republic Act. No. 288 was passed by the 1st Philippine Congress to separate the island from the Zamboanga mainland as a separate entity, which was justified owing to the distance between the island and the city of Zamboanga. \n\nThe first city mayor was Nicasio S. Valderroza, appointed by President Elpidio Quirino. He was considered a builder of cities, having been variously a Provincial Treasurer, an acting Provincial Governor of the old Province of Zamboanga, Mayor of Baguio City, first Mayor of Zamboanga City, First Mayor of Davao City and the first appointed Mayor of the new City of Basilan.\n\nWhen President Ramon Magsaysay became the Chief Executive of the republic in 1954, he appointed Leroy S. Brown as mayor of Basilan City. He served as the second and the last appointive mayor of this city until December 31, 1955. The city was then classified as a first class city.\n\nWith the approval of Republic Act. No. 1211 amending the charter of the City of Basilan, the position of the City Mayor became elective.\n\nThe first election for local officials in Basilan was held on November 8, 1955. Mayor Brown was overwhelmingly elected as the first elective mayor of the city, serving for 5 terms. The then Isabela district, being the city center, was the site for many city public works projects that gave way to an era of economic growth.\n\nHe was the first and the last elected city executive of Basilan. He served uninterrupted from January 1954 to December 31, 1975, under the Administrations of Presidents Carlos Garcia, Diosdado Macapagal and Ferdinand Marcos. During his term, the city council gave birth to a new breed of legislators and leaders from 1954 to 1975. These years have since been called Basilan's \"Golden Years\".\n\n====Municipality of Isabela====\n[[File:Old Isabela Pueblo and Plaza Rizal.jpg|thumb|Old Plaza Rizal and Plaza Misericordia, opposite Santa Isabel Cathedral, old City Hall (Provincial Capitol) atop the hill at the background.]]\nOn December 21, 1972 President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law. At that time, Basilan was in the middle of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] Uprising prompted by the expose of the [[Jabidah Massacre]] on March 18, 1968. A number of native Moro leaders joined the MNLF rebellion, making Basilan a veritable warzone. The first-ever armed confrontation occurred around the heavily forested hills of Bagbagon and Canibungan in Lantawan on the island's western area. This was followed by the occupation of the Alano Plantation (declared \"No Man's Land\" by the military) by MNLF \"munduhin\" and \"blackshirts\" and the ensuing aerial bombardment by the military which left the plantation totally devastated. MNLF rebels then laid siege over Lamitan's poblacion, but was eventually staved off by fierce resistance from Lamitan residents who volunteered to fight valiantly beside elements of the Armed Forces and the Philippine Constabulary.\n\nSeveral more raids and ambushes were made throughout the island, which succeeded in stopping all the operations of the plantations. Sporadic gun-battles, too, broke out within Isabela's poblacion, and pirate raids harried fishing operations as well as passenger ferry traffic between Basilan and Zamboanga.\n\nAfter more than two years of incessant fighting, a substantial number among Basilan's Christian populace left the place altogether reducing the Christian tribes to minority status once again. After nearly 50 years of continuous immigration from Zamboanga, the Visayas and Luzon, Basilan experienced, for the very first time, a net outflow of people.\n\nOn December 27, 1973, President Marcos issued [[Presidential Decree]] No. 356, converting the [[City]] of Basilan into the [[Province]] of Basilan \"to provide the close government attention and for the purpose of spurring its growth\". Another Presidential Decree numbered 593 dated December 2, 1974, amended P.D. 356. The law not only defines the City's territory but also provided that the capital of Basilan shall be the [[Municipality]] of Isabela. It also created ten (10) Municipalities to comprise the new Province of Basilan.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 593 was later amended by Presidential Decree No. 840 dated December 11, 1975, reducing the number of municipalities to seven (7) in order to render its \" territorial portion more complementary to the size of the area and more responsive to pacification, rehabilitation and total development of the province\". The municipalities specified in the said amendment were the following: Isabela, [[Lamitan]], [[Tuburan, Basilan|Tuburan]], [[Tipo-Tipo]], [[Sumisip]], [[Maluso]] and [[Lantawan]], of which five (5) municipalities are now in existence. It also provided for the absorption of the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Basilan into the Municipality of Isabela with its poblacion as the capital seat of the province.\n\n[[File:Martial Law in Basilan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Moro Uprising and martial law in Basilan 1968-1976]]\nThe conversion to Province-hood, and the creation of Municipalities ensured that Basilan's sparsely populated areas were \"given\" to Muslim warlords and surrendering MNLF Commanders by Presidential fiat, as a form of bounty or reward for laying down their arms. The once-progressive First-Class City of Basilan was emasculated beyond recognition, having been reduced to an area exactly One-Kilometer radius within the Isabela Poblacion.\n\nUnder [[martial law]], Basilan had its first military governor in the person of Col. Tomas G. Nanquil, Jr., then the Brigade Commander of 24th Infantry Brigade stationed in Basilan. There were three (3) vice governors during his tenure as military governor. Col. Nanquil served for about a year and half.\n\nBefore Basilan was converted to a province, it had three regular municipalities, Isabela, Lamitan, and Maluso which are districts of the city of Basilan. Even when Col. Nanquil was appointed Military Governor, the city of Basilan was still functioning under Mayor Brown until December 31, 1975 due to its territorial boundary dispute with the Province of Basilan.\n\nThe second military Governor was Rear Admiral Romulo M. Espaldon. Due to his numerous functions and responsibilities as Commanding General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Southern Command ([[SouthCom]]), South Sulu Sea Frontiers Command, over all military supervisor of Mindanao, Deputy Chief of Staff of the AFP and Regional Commissioner for Islamic Affairs in Region IX, Adm. Espaldon could not possibly attend to his duties as Military Governor of Basilan. To this effect, he designated Col. Florencio Magsino, Brigade Commander of the 21st Infantry Brigade as Military Supervisor for Basilan and Officer-In-Charge. His Deputy Brigade Commander Col. Recaredo Calvo ably assisted Col. Magsino. When Col. Magsino was appointed Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) in Baguio City and Col. Calvo was recalled to Headquarters, Col. Alfredo Rillera assumed command of the Brigade and became the Military Supervisor of Basilan. He was succeeded by Col. Salvador Mison. Col. Augusto Narag, Jr., later replaced him. The last military Supervisor was Gen. Rodolfo Tolentino, consequently, the first military with a star rank to be appointed Military Supervisor in Basilan. Admiral Espaldon was the last military governor of the province, his term lasted until December 31, 1975.\n\nOn December 11, 1975, President Marcos appointed then Vice Governor for Administration Asan G. Camlian, a thrice-elected City Councilor, which later led to the appointment of Ricardo G. Mon as the first municipal mayor of now reinstated municipal government of Isabela. On New Year's Day 1976, Isabela therefore regained independence as the capital town of Basilan province.\n\n====City of Isabela====\nBy virtue of Republic Act No. 9023 Isabela was granted cityhood, with said grant having been ratified by Isabela's residents on a plebiscite held April 25, 2001. Isabela's first city mayor then was Luis Rubio Biel II, the sitting municipal mayor elected in 1998.\n\nOn November of the same year, Isabela City's residents roundly rejected inclusion into the expanded [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), and have since remained under the administrative jurisdiction of the Zamboanga Peninsula region. The rest of Basilan's six municipalities were promptly inducted into the ARMM.\n\nThe elevation of Isabela to 4th-class city status gave the local government a much-needed boost, efficiently delivered under the Biel administration, revitalized Isabela City, making it an engine of growth for Basilan province even as the hinterlands was wracked by incessant firefights and gun-battles between the military and bandit groups such as the [[Abu Sayyaf]] and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF).\n\nThis renewed vigor was cut-short when Biel was assassinated at high noon on March 3, 2006 by a lone gunman as he was about to leave City Hall. Isabela City residents mourned the loss of the slain Mayor in what probably is the biggest funeral procession ever seen in Basilan.\n\nIsabela City then came under the short-lived administration of Vice Mayor Rodolfo Y. Tan, who served the remainder of Biel's term, relinquishing his post after having been defeated in the May 2007 local elections.\n\nFrom June 2007\u20132016, Isabela City has been under the administration of Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar, who at 32 years, is one of the youngest Mayors of Isabela, and is the first woman to hold the post. She is one of the widows of slain Congressman [[Wahab Akbar]], a 3-term Governor of Basilan. Akbar's [[Jum Jainudin Akbar|first-wife]] was the incumbent Governor, while then-Mayor Akbar (now vice mayor) is the late strongman's second-wife.\n\nIsabela City under then-Mayor Akbar figured prominently in the Anti-MOA/AD movement which was cobbled up in August 2008, when the [[Philippines|Philippine]] Government Peace Negotiating Panel and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|MILF]] was about to sign a landmark deal which would have granted the MILF a \"separate, distinct and exclusive\" [[Ancestral Domain]] and a semi-independent government, dubbed the [[Bangsamoro Juridical Entity]] ([[BJE]]). Indignation rallies in the Cities of Zamboanga and Iligan, as well as elsewhere in Mindanao were joined by protest actions staged by Isabela City residents, rejecting the proposed deal with the MILF.\n\nIn 2017, the capital was transferred from Isabela to [[Lamitan]]. Isabela still remains part of Basilan provincial services but regional services remains in Zamboanga Peninsula instead of ARMM where the province of Basilan belongs.\n\nIn 2019, Isabela's residents rejected their city's inclusion in the proposed [[Bangsamoro Autonomous Region]] during [[2019 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region creation plebiscite|the plebiscite held on January 21]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Isabela City map1.jpg|thumb|225px|Map of Isabela City]]\n[[File:Isabela poblacion1.jpg|thumb|225px|Isabela City Poblacion (urban area)]]\nIsabela City is located on the northern shore of Basilan Island, along the [[Basilan Strait]] across from [[Zamboanga City]] to the north.

The steepest grades of over 60% are found in some parts of the barangays of Menzi, Busay, Panunsulan, Calvario, Kapayawan and Kapatagan on the main island of Basilan and in the barangays of Panigayan and Santa Barbara on the offshore [[Malamawi Island]].\n\n==Barangays==\nIsabela City is politically subdivided into 45 [[barangay]]s, herein listed below with their corresponding 2010 populations in parentheses.

According to the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, it has a population of {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people.{{PH census|current}}\n\nIt is also colloquially known as '''Isabela de Basilan''' to differentiate the city's name from the [[Isabela (province)|province of Isabela]] in [[Luzon]].\n\nWhile administratively the island province of Basilan is part of the [[Bangsamoro|Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (BARMM), Isabela City, where it served as its capital since the province's creation, itself is not part of this region, being instead placed under the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. Isabela is still being regulated by the Basilan provincial government and provincial services are provided by Basilan but regional services are being provided by Zamboanga Peninsula. The [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] lists Isabela as statistically [[independent city|independent]] from [[Basilan]]. This prompted the provincial government to transfer the capital to [[Lamitan City]].\n\nInstitutionally, the military has played a major part in Isabela City's and Basilan's volatile history, due to the ongoing conflicts borne out of the Moro Secessionist wars of the 1970s, and more recently, by Al Qaeda backed [[Islamic fundamentalist groups]] fomenting a running gun-battle with the Philippines' armed forces for more than a decade.\n\nAlso exerting great influence in everyday life is the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the Islamic mufti and imams, religious scholars and leaders who exercise a moral ascendancy over their respective groups.\n\nTrading and commerce are still predominantly in the hands of the East [[Asia]]n ([[Hokkien Chinese]]), aided more so by a recent influx of immigrants from [[Taiwan]] and by [[Korea]]ns as well.\n\n==History==\nIsabela's history is inadvertently inter-mingled with that of Basilan Island and the Sulu Archipelago, albeit culturally, Isabela is an extension of neighboring Zamboanga City.\n\n{{See also|History of Basilan}}\n\n===Pre-Hispanic Pasangen===\n[[Basilan]]'s earliest settlers was traditionally believed to be the Orang Dampuans originating from the islands of Eastern [[Indonesia]], who were the ancestors of the native [[Yakan people|Yakan]]s. They are variously called the Orang Dyaks or the Tagihamas.\n\nThe [[Yakan people|Yakan]]s, an inland brave tribe, inhabited the [[Sulu Archipelago]] together with the indigenous Sama and Bajau before the Malayan Tausug from [[Sumatra]] and [[Borneo]] gained control of the area starting 300BCE-200BCE.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru9/R9tourism/bas_facts.htm Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720091404/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru9/R9tourism/bas_facts.htm |date=2008-07-20 }}</ref>\n\nHistorians have scant knowledge of the pre-Spanish history of the indigenous Yakans, simply because they have had little contact with other ethnic groups.  Basilan's nearness to Borneo led to the theory that the Yakan originated from the Dyak. Although it is fairly safe to say that Basilan's history is related to that of the Sulu archipelago, it is by no means right to suppose that Basilan's first inhabitants came from Indonesia.\n\n====Yakan Karajaan of Kumalarang====\nRecords of pre-Hispanic Philippines gleaned from the extensive archives of China's Imperial courts mentions a \"Kingdom of Kumalarang\" located in one of the southern islands of Ma-yi (the Chinese name for the Philippine archipelago), whose King sent regular tribute to the Chinese [[Yongle Emperor]] through Chinese traders who frequented the place in the 13th and 14th centuries. Local historians attribute this long lost kingdom to modern-day Kumalarang (now reduced to a Barangay) located along the northwestern coast of Basilan island.\n\nSpecifically, according to the Ta Min Hui Tien (Great Ming compendium of laws), a report gleaned from the records of Tehchow, [[Shantung]], [[China]] (archived and researched in the years 1673, 1788 and 1935): 3 months after the death of Paduka Batara (the Tausug potentate who visited the Chinese Emperor [[Yung Lo]] and died on October 23, 1417), a High Court [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]], Chan Chien, was ordered to sail to Kumalarang (Chinese texts refer to \"Kumalalang\"), a vassal state of the Sulu Sultanate located on the northwestern coast of Taguima (Basilan Is.).\n\nChan Chien was received by Lakan Ipentun (Ch. ref. \"Kanlai Ipentun\"), presumably a Yakan Prince, who ruled the Kingdom as a vassal to the Sultan of Sulu. The Mandarin official stayed in Kumalarang for two years before returning to China.\n\n[[File:Basilan from 1578.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island circa 1578]]\nHe was accompanied by Lakan Ipentun and an entourage of several hundred, composed of his immediate family, minor chieftains (datus), and servants. They were finally given an audience with the Chinese Emperor on November 16, 1420 where he formally asked the latter to proclaim him as a recognized sovereign and vassal to the [[Dragon Throne]].\n\nLakan Ipentun wrote a missive to the Chinese Emperor on December 28, 1420, complaining about the time it took for the Chinese Emperor to act on his request. The Chinese Emperor received the petition and finally granted Lakan Ipentun with the title of \"wang\" (king). After his request was granted, a satisfied Lakan Ipentun, along with his entire retinue, started for home.\n\nOn May 27, 1421, however, unaccustomed to the cold climate of the preceding winter and due to his advancing age, Lakan Ipentun died in [[Fujian]], China, just as they were about to embark on Chinese junks that would have brought them home. His funeral was supervised by Yang Shan, administrator of the temples, and was likewise honored by a eulogy sent by the Chinese Emperor which extolled his virtues of \"determination and serenity\". His son, Lapi, was then proclaimed as rightful successor to the just bestowed title of \"wang\". Lapi sent one of his father's most trusted officials, Batikisan, to petition for an audience with the Chinese Emperor where he presented a \"memorial\" in gold plaque on November 3, 1424.\n\nThe party, with its newly proclaimed King, eventually returned to Kumalarang, and almost just as promptly faded from the historical records of the period. (Note: Kumalarang was revived as a Barangay located on the northwestern shores of Isabela City in 1973).\n\n===Spanish arrival===\n{{See also|Spanish East Indies}}\n\n====Colonization and the Jesuit \"reducciones\"====\n[[File:1578-1630 Suluzone.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Basilan island 1578-1630]]\nThe proselytization of Basilan started in earnest when Fr. Francisco Lado, a [[Jesuit]], established the first [[Catholic]] mission, in an area called [[Pasangen]] by the native [[Yakans]]. \"Pasangen\" is a Yakan term for \"commune\", \"town\" or \"a place where people visit or stay\". This coastal area, however, was already predominantly populated by Tausug and Samal settlers when the Spanish came, and therefore was likewise locally called a \"pagpasalan\" or \"settlement area\". The [[Jesuit]] missionaries from Zamboanga arrived on the same year that the removal of [[Sultan Kudarat]]'s base from [[Lamitan]] was effected, and established themselves in Pasangen on the island's northwestern coast. They constructed the first wooden mission and palisade wall near the mouth of the [[Aguada River]], and dedicated the Island to [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]], the founder of the [[Jesuit Order]].\n\n[[Catholic]] missionaries together with Spanish soldiers who inter-married into the native population were able to successfully penetrate [[Basilan]] by bringing in additional Settler soldiers. So much so that by 1654 there were about 1,000 Catholic families living in the island. Foremost among these pioneering families is the extended Lazaro Clan who, together with its cadet branches, the Saavedra, Generalao, Sison, Pardo, Barrios and Guevarra families, took most of the cultivated lands that was to form part of the growing Settlement.\n\nThus, [[Catholicism]] began to slowly spread across the island with the spirited drive of the militant Jesuits.  With no spices or gold to enrich the Spanish king's coffers, except for local taxes, the Jesuits refocused the Spanish government's agenda and made religion the object of their expansion and conquest here.\n\nIn anticipation of an invasion from the Chinese pirate-warlord [[Koxinga]], that was expected to devastate Manila, the Spanish authorities withdrew all stations in the south of the country to augment their forces holed up in [[Intramuros]], temporarily freeing Jambangan/ [[Zamboanga Peninsula|Zamboanga]] and Isabela from direct Spanish administration in 1663.\n\n[[File:Basilan extra.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan Island 1630-1663]]\nGovernor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara signed a decree on May 6, 1662 ordering the military evacuation of the fort in Zamboanga, and of other Spanish colonies, including that of Ternate in the spice islands of the Moluccas. The Spanish garrisons, along with a number of priests and their chosen local people, evacuated and returned to fort Cavite to help defend Manila Intramuros from a threatened invasion by Chinese pirate Koxinga, which never happened. The Zamboanga fort was finally abandoned sometime in 1663 by the last remaining Spanish troops.\n\nAs fate will have it, the Zamboangue\u00f1o (the forced Settlers from Luzon and Visayas to populate Zamboanga) and Pasangen, Jesuits included, will amazingly endure another fifty-six (56) years (1662\u20131718) of isolated existence and proliferation amidst the hostile threat and return of the Moro master seafares who overtook and destroyed the abandoned fort. The Zamboangue\u00f1os who stayed behind, including many of the founding Jesuit priests who vowed to never forsake their thousands of converted subjects and their new-found religious outpost ( prized as the southern-most Catholic strongholds in the entire Philippine islands ), were by this time already living within the confines of Zamboanga and Pasangen and its people. The Jesuits, belonging to the aggressive religious expansionists' [[Society of Jesus]], who remained in Zamboanga were historically credited for reconstructing the damaged fort in 1666, three years after the last Spanish soldiers vacated their walled post in 1663.\n\nIn the absence of Spanish Royal authorities the Jesuits formed a sort of Catholic city-state, called \"reductions\" (Spanish Reducciones, Portuguese Redu\u00e7\u00f5es) in and around their 3-decade old Presidios both in Zamboanga and Basilan. These were Societies set up according to an idealized theocratic model. The same type of communities were likewise established by the Jesuits throughout South America, but especially in present-day [[Brazil]] and [[Paraguay]].\n\n[[File:Spanish Palisade Fort.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illustration of the Spanish palisade fortification and Jesuit mission constructed at Pasangen, on the northwestern coast of Taguima.]]\nThe Spanish royal authorities eventually returned in 1718. After having re-established lucrative trading agreements with the native kingdoms that dotted the area, nearby Zamboanga experienced a revival in its economy. The increasingly wealthy Spanish trading post in Zamboanga became an even more sought after prize for the Moro seafares of the era, so much so that the surrounding islands started to attract the attention of other foreign powers, and chief among these coveted islands was Basilan.\n\nHostilities with the Moro natives and Lumad allies resurfaced in the 18th century and this was triggered by the decision which broke beforehand agreements not to build any additional Forts by both parties when in 1718 by Gov. Gen Juan Antonio dela Torre Bustamante went ahead to reconstruct Real Fuerza de San Jos\u00e9 in Bagumbayan, Zamboanga.  The fort completed in 1719 was renamed Real Fuerza del Pilar de Zaragosa ([[Fort Pilar]] is its popular name today).  The rebuilt fort was inaugurated on 16 April by Don Fernando Bustillos Bustamante Rueda, senior maestro de campo of Zamboanga.  Three years later in 1722, as primary reason to build this Fort, the Spaniards were launching another expedition against Jolo.  Led by Andres Garcia, the expedition failed miserably.\n\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1663-1718.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Basilan island 1663-1718]]\nBy then, [[Badar ud-Din]], Sultan of Sulu, who was keenly interested in developing commercial ties with [[Manila]] and [[China]], approached the Spanish with a proposal of peace. According to the agreement they arrived at in 1726, the Spanish and Sulu were permitted to trade freely with each other and the Island of Basilan was ceded to Spain. However, in a series of raids on the islands of Visayas, where the Spanish themselves get manpower and resources for Zamboanga, angry subjects of the Sultan broke the treaty which resulted in the renewal of large-scale hostilities by 1730.<ref>{{Google books |id=S5q7qxi5LBgC |page=201 |title=Between Integration and Secession: The Muslim Communities of the Southern Philippines, Southern Thailand, and Western Burma/Myanmar }}</ref> In 1731, General Ignacio Iriberri lead a force of 1000 to Jolo and captured it after a lengthy siege.  But the Spaniards left after a few days.\n\nIn order to strengthen the Spanish position in Zamboanga and the neighboring regions, three companies of native Visayan volunteers were organized in 1832. These natives together with the Spanish troops defended the town and the province from the sporadic attack by the Moros. However, these Visayan natives, mixed with released prisoners from the Luzon lived outside the Fort walls and bears the brunt of the attacks from the Moro warriors. The Spaniards call the Sultan of Sulu's army as Moros, Spanish for \"Moors\", the word Moor was in turn derived from [[Morocco]] a North African country adjacent to Spain, and peopled by Muslims which conquered and ruled [[Al Andalus]] Spain for 800 years.\n\nHalf of the Zamboanga peninsula was made into a Corregimiento (district) de Zamboanga with its jurisdiction reaching as far as Sindangan to the north and the whole of Basilan island to the south, while the northern half of the peninsula belonged to the District of Misamis. In 1837, the government was changed to a Gobierno Militar. Zamboanga was made the capital of Mindanao throughout the Spanish regime, except the period between 1872 and 1875, when the government was at Kutawato/ [[Cotabato]].\n\n====Jesuit expulsion====\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1718-1747.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island 1718-1747]]\nIn the meantime, the Jesuits were expelled from [[Portugal]], [[France]], the [[Two Sicilies]], [[Parma]] and the [[Spanish Empire]] in 1768. Jesuit missions were very controversial in Europe, especially in Spain and Portugal, where they were seen as interfering with the proper colonial enterprises of the royal governments. The Jesuits were often the only force standing between the natives and slavery. It is partly because the Jesuits protected the natives whom mainly it want to convert to Catholism that certain Spanish and Portuguese colonizers wanted to enslave that the Society of Jesus was eventually suppressed. The Recoletos de San Jose ([[Recollects]]) took over territories previously assigned to the Jesuits.\n\nIn 1755, contingent of 1,900 men led by captains Simeon Valdez and Pedro Gastambide was sent to Jolo to avenge for the raids by Sultan Muiz ud-Din.  But were roundly defeated again.  In 1775, after Moro raid on Zamboanga, Capitan Vargas led a punitive expedition against Jolo but was also repulsed.\n\nThroughout this brief period, however, Catholic missionaries continued their avid proselytization, converting very hard the clans of Subanen, Samals, Yakans and Tausugs to Catholicism, adding to the growing Visayan populations brought in primarily from Cebu and Panay.\n\n====The French blockade====\nBy the 1840s, colonial interests other than Spanish focused over western Mindanao, particularly the territories under the Sulu sultanate. The British, French, Germans, and Americans all became interested in these rich islands.\n\nIn 1843, the French Foreign Minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]] sent a fleet to [[Vietnam]] under Admiral C\u00e9cille and Captain Charner,<ref name=\"Google page 5\">Chapuis, p.5 [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=9RorGHF0fGIC |page=5 }} Google Book] Quote: ''Two years later, in 1847, Lefebvre was again captured when he returned to Vietnam. This time Cecille sent captain Lapierre to Danang. Whether Lapierre was aware or not that Lefebvre had already been freed and on his way back to Singapore, the French first dismantled masts of some Vietnamese ships. Later on April 14, 1847, in only one hour, the French sank the last five bronze-plated vessels in the bay of Danang.''</ref> which started the French intervention in Vietnam. The move responded to the successes of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] in [[China]] in 1842, and France hoped to counterbalance these successes by accessing China from the south. The pretext however was to support British efforts in China, and to fight the persecution of French missionaries in Vietnam.<ref>Tucker, p.27</ref> The fleet, accompanied by the diplomat Lagrene, tried to seize the island of [[Basilan]] in order to create a base similar to [[Hong Kong]], but projects had to be abandoned following the strong opposition of [[Spain]] claiming the island was part of the [[Philippines]].<ref>Chapuis, p.5</ref>\n\nWhen the [[France|French]] under [[Admiral C\u00e9cille]] blockaded Basilan in 1844\u201345,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamalashley.wordpress.com/2007/04/17/bangsa-moro-conflict-historical-antecedents-and-present-impact/ |title=Bangsa Moro Conflict - Historical Antecedents and Present Impact |publisher=The Setting Sun |date=17 April 2007 |accessdate=2008-10-05}}{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2008}}</ref> an island which they called Taguime, intent on establishing a network of naval stations to protect French trade in the area, the Spanish governor protested that Basilan had recognized Spain's sovereignty just the year before, in February 1844. The French then forced the Basilan datus to sign a document affirming the \u201cabsolute independence of Basilan vis-a-vis Spain\u201d on January 13, 1845 aboard the steamer Archimede.\n\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1824-1845.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island 1824\u20131845]]\nOn February 20, 1845, France forced the Sulu Sultan to formally cede Basilan Island to France in exchange for 100,000 piastres or 500,000 French francs. The French Admiral totally ignored Spanish protests. However, the inhabitants of Pasangen who remained loyal to Spain, fought against the French for a year, forcing the French King, Louis Philippe, also a Bourbon, to ultimately decide against taking Basilan although the French Cabinet already approved the annexation, even allocating the budget for Basilan for that year.\n\nFrance's claims on Basilan were based on a formal cession from the Sultan of Sulu as well as formal written agreement from the Basilan datus. These claims were eventually withdrawn by France, formalized in a proclamation dated August 5, 1845, turning over full sovereignty of the island to Spain. During the same year, a US survey mission studied the potentials of the Sulu archipelago, but U.S. intervention did not start until 1899.\n\n====Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda====\nAfter two centuries of incessant and unrelenting raids and counter-raids, the fortunes of the Spanish Empire in the Sulu Archipelago took a dramatic turn for the better in 1848, primarily due to three watershed events: the advent of Spain's steam-powered naval superiority over Sulu's outrigger-and-sail paraws; the fall of Sulu's Balangingi allies on Tungkil; and, the establishment of Fuerte Isabel Segunda or Fort Isabella Segunda on Basilan Island. These three benchmarks sparked off a series of events which, from 1848 on, saw Sulu's power wane until it was finally blighted and almost completely snuffed out on the eve of the American occupation.\n\nTo check the inroads of both the increasingly bloody Tausug pirate raids and the growing influence of Lamitan's Yakan kingdom, as well as to thwart any further attempt by other European powers to colonize Basilan (the Dutch in 1747 and the French in 1844) the Spanish commandery in Zamboanga City sent over an expeditionary force tasked at establishing Spanish fortifications on Basilan island, both to serve as an early beacon and defensive perimeter against the pirate parties, and as a trading post for Spanish interests on the island.\n\nIn 1845, Don Ramon Lobo, the Marine Chief of Zamboanga, accompanied Don Cayetano Suarez de Figueroa, District Governor of Zamboanga, to the coastal settlement of Pasangen. Wooden fortifications were initially erected on the settlement's highest point facing the narrow channel about 800 meters from the shore. The 200-year-old Jesuit mission was situated halfway between the fort and the shore. The fortification proved to be easily defensible as nearby Malamawi Island blocked direct attacks and raids from the sea. Later that same year, Governor Narciso Claveria ordered the construction of a stone fort, following the plan of engineer Emilio Bernaldez submitted in 1844. Construction lasted four years.\n\nBy 1848, the stone fort was finished, replacing the wooden fortifications. In the meantime a sizeable and growing Christian settlement continued to flourish around the Recollect mission, rededicated since the expulsion of the Jesuits, to St Isabel de Portugal ([[Elizabeth of Portugal]]). The Fort thus established was subsequently named in honor of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] and the Indies, and was named Fuerte de la Reina Isabel Segunda. The military garrison was initially placed under the direct command of the Fuerza de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar de Zaragosa ([[Fort Pilar]]) in Zamboanga.\n\nNieto Aguilar (1894) describes the fort as \u201cmagnificent.\u201d Situated 20 meters above sea level, the fortification overlooked the two entrances to the bay, formed by Basilan and Malamawi Island. To the fort's east were the barracks. The fort had four bastions at the corner of its rectangular perimeter. It enclosed a well and had four structures for the corps of guards, the garrison personnel, the presidio, jail, artillery corps and the ''casa comandancia''.\n\nIn the fort was the governor's residence as well as that of his officials. It was also a naval station where the navy maintained small workshops for urgent repairs. It had a storehouse for coal near the shore. Total personnel: two officer, 50 men.\n\nOutside the fort were built other structures, namely: a military infirmary, school, ayuntamiento (city hall), corps of engineers\u2019 building, storehouses and dependencies of the naval station, barracks for the marine infantry, gunpowder storehouse, and the Jesuit church and convent.\n\nOn July 30, 1859, a royal decree was issued allowing the Jesuits to recover their Missions in Mindanao from the Recollects. The Jesuits finally returned to Basilan and Tetuan in 1862.\n\nBy 1863, Fort Isabela Segunda became the focal point of the 6th District of the Police-Military Government of Mindanao. And in 1879, the Spanish garrison built a \"floating\" Naval Hospital on shallows guarding the eastern entrance to the Isabela Channel.\n\nThe fort and naval hospital were demolished in the 20th century, when they were reduced to rubble by American bombs during World War II. The Basilan provincial capitol presently occupies the site of the demolished fort. Recent site excavations yielded rusted cannonballs and other late 19th- and early 20th-century paraphernalia in caverns dug deep beneath the former fort.\n\n====American regime====\nBy 1898, Basilan Island was administratively divided into three districts, the Spanish-controlled towns of Isabela and Lamitan, and the Tausug trading outpost in Maluso, which the [[Sulu Sultanate]] handed-over to Spain, subsequent to the razing and occupation of Jolo by the Spanish from 1876 up to 1899, formalized by the [[Treaty of 1878]].\n\nSpain ceded the Philippine islands to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Following the American occupation of the northern Philippine Islands during 1899, Spanish forces in Mindanao were cut off, and they retreated to the garrisons at Zamboanga and [[Jolo]]. American forces relieved the Spanish at Zamboanga on May 18, 1899, and at Jolo and Basilan in December 1899.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bakbakan.com/swishkb.html |title=Swish of the Kris |last=Hurley |first=Victor |year=1936 |chapter=17.

By December 1899, the Americans led by [[Col. James S. Petit]] occupied the Spanish naval base of Isabela de Basilan.  In Basilan, an increasingly old and sickly Datu Kalun (Pedro Cuevas) supported the new colonizers. Sovereignty over both Isabela and Lamitan then was effectively transferred from Spain to the Americans.\n\nAt that time, the Philippine\u2013American War was raging in Luzon.  So as not to spread out their forces, the Americans employed the classic divide-and-rule tactic.  [[Maj. Gen. E.S. Otis]], commander-in-chief of the US Forces, sent Gen. Bates to negotiate with the Sultan of Sulu.  Known as the Bates treaty, the agreement provided for the exercise of American authority over the Sulu archipelago in exchange for the recognition of Muslim culture and religion.\n\nThe [[Bates Treaty]] of 1899 between Sulu [[Sultan Jamalul Kiram II]] and American [[Brigadier General]] [[John C. Bates]], further acknowledged American administrative control over the Sulu Archipelago, including Basilan.\n\nInitially Sultan Kiram was disappointed by the hand-over of control to the Americans and had expected to regain sovereignty over the Sulu archipelago after the defeat of the Spanish. Bates' main goal though, was to guarantee the Sultanate's neutrality in the Philippine\u2013American War, and to establish order in Mindanao. After some negotiations, the [[Bates Treaty]] was signed.\n\nThis treaty was based on the earlier Spanish treaty, and it retained the translation discrepancy: the English version described a complete dependency, while the Tausug version described a protectorate. Although the Bates Treaty granted more powers to the Americans than the original Spanish treaty, the treaty was still criticised in the United States for granting too much autonomy to the Sultan. One particular clause, which recognized the Moro practice of [[slavery]], also raised eyebrows in [[Washington, D.C.]] Bates later admitted that the treaty was merely a stop-gap measure, signed only to buy time until the war in the north was ended and more forces could be brought to bear in the south.<ref name=Bates>{{Cite web\n| url        = http://www.philippineupdate.com/Bates.htm\n| title      = The Bates Treaty\n| author     = Madge Kho\n| publisher  = philippineupdate.com\n| accessdate = 2007-12-02\n| postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref>\n\nThe peace created by the Bates Treaty did not last, however.  This became evident when the Muslims repudiated the Moro province, a politico-military government in Mindanao lasting from 1903 to 1914, and the [[Moro Rebellion]] soon broke out.  It is important to note that barely two months before the creation of the Moro province, the American colonial government declared and classified all unoccupied lands as public lands.  Immediately after the declaration, American investments entered Mindanao and mass migration of Christians was encouraged. (Rodil 1985:4).\n\nThe American forces eventually arrived under the command of Capt. Wendell C. Neville, who eventually became a Major General, the 14th Commandant of the United States Marine Corps in 1929\u20131930. He was initially posted as Military Governor of Basilan from 1899 to 1901, and was tasked at the establishment of a civil government for the island of Basilan.\n\nBy July 1, 1901, the Municipality of Zamboanga was inaugurated under Public Act No. 135. This constituted Zamboanga and Basilan Island.\n\n[[File:Inaugurateprvincialgovzamboanga.jpg|thumb|Inauguration of the Municipality of Zamboanga which included Basilan, July 1, 1901, with Datu Kalun (background) in attendance]]\nOn September 15, 1911, the governing body of the Moro Province, the Legislative Council, passed Act. No.272 converting the Municipality of Zamboanga into a city with a Commission form of government. The ceremony was held on January 1, 1912 with the appointment of American Christopher F. Bader as the first City Mayor. With the island of Basilan as part of Zamboanga, this made the City of Zamboanga the biggest city in the world in terms of land area. Two years later he was succeeded by Victoriano Tarrosas the first Filipino Zamboangue\u00f1o Mayor of the city when Bader resigned.\n\nThe Department of Mindanao and Sulu replaced the Moro Province in 1914, and its districts broken up into separate provinces, namely: Davao, Misamis, Lanao, Cotabato, Sulu, and Zamboanga, the city was then reverted to its original status as a municipality administered by a Municipal President and several Councilors. The municipality included the whole of Basilan Island and it remained as the capital of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu, with a civil government under an American civil governor, from 1913 up to 1920.\n\nThe [[Department of Mindanao and Sulu]] under [[Gov. Frank W. Carpenter]] was created by [[Philippine Commission]] Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920 by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The [[Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes]] was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona, Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Jones Law]] (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began.\n\nDatu Kalun died in Basilan on 16 July 1904 at the age of 58, soon after his first contact with the Americans.  His nephew Gabino Pamaran became his successor and adopted the name Datu Mursalun.  Mursalun, also pro-American, led the town of Lamitan which became an American model of civil government and development.  Mursalun worked for the material progress of Basilan, and sought ways to fight banditry and piracy in the area.\n\n[[File:President Quezon signing the Zamboanga City Charter at the Malaca\u00f1ang Palace on October 12, 1936.jpg|thumb|left|Official Signing Ceremony of the Charter of Zamboanga City by President Manuel Quezon, and witnessed by bill author Cong. Juan S. Alano and wife Ramona, Zamboanga Mayor Pablo Lorenzo, and a young Ma. Clara Lorenzo (Lobregat) in her school uniform.]]\n\n====Philippine Commonwealth====\nPolitically, Basilan became a part of the [[Moro Province]] (1899\u20131914, encompassing most of Mindanao Island). Basilan was then included in the Department of Mindanao and Sulu (1914\u20131920), a district of [[Zamboanga Province]] (1920\u20131936), and then of the Chartered City of Zamboanga (1936\u20131948), before it became a Chartered City on its own right at the beginning of the Philippine Republic.\n\nAlongside military suppression came a policy of education.  Public schools were built but Muslim enrollment was way below Christian school attendance.  Muslims considered public education a threat to their culture and religion.\n\n[[File:Basilan Expanded 1936-1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Basilan island 1936-1941]]\nTo ensure Muslim participation in government affairs, the Americans soon adopted a Policy of Attraction for western Mindanao.  Moreover, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) replaced the United States Army units pursuant to colonial efforts to reduce American presence.  The replacement of American troops, mostly by Christians under the PC, increased the hostility between Muslims and Christians.\n\nIn the political sphere, the management of Muslim affairs through the organization of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu in 1914 was unsuccessful, as leadership in the department fell in the hands of Christians.  Thus, the Muslim leaders were historically opposed to the idea of independence, which meant the incorporation of Muslim areas into a political system dominated by Christians.\n\nEarly in the American period, American plantation owners cleared vast expanses of Basilan's virgin forest land and established what was to be Basilan's primary economic activity - plantation agriculture, mainly rubber and copra. American Dr. James D. W. Strong, the Father of the Philippine Rubber Industry, inaugurated the first rubber plantation in the Philippines (inauguration was attended by President Manuel L. Quezon no-less) in Baluno, a plaque and shrine to this pioneering individual may be visited in the same Barangay to this day.\n\nThe success of what was soon to be the [[B. F. Goodrich]] rubber concession in the northern part of Isabela City, enticed other multi-national firms, such as the British-Malaysian [[Sime Darby]] and the Hispano-German [[Hans Menzi]] Corporation to open rubber plantations in the City's southern areas. The first Filipino-owned plantation was established on Malamawi Island by Don Juan S. Alano, originally of Malolos, Bulacan, who served as Representative of the entire Moro Province (Mindanao) during the Commonwealth Era (1936\u20131942), and the first Congressman of Zamboanga Province (now comprising Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga City and Basilan) in the Republic's first Congress (1946\u20131949). He authored the Charter of both the Cities of Basilan and Zamboanga.\n\nMore Filipino settler families, such as the Cuevas-Flores-Pamaran-Antonio clan (progeny of the legendary Datu Kalun) in Lamitan and the Pardo, Barandino, Brown, Dans, Golveo, and Nu\u00f1al families of Isabela itself soon followed suit, establishing sizeable plantations, usually engaged in coconut/copra production.\n\n====World War II====\n[[File:Japanese Invasion.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Japanese invasion of Basilan]]\nThe outbreak of World War II disrupted Commonwealth administration. In 1942 Japanese soldiers landed in Basilan and occupied it until 1945.\n\nChristians and Muslim officers and men of the military district in Mindanao and Sulu shifted to the Moro guerilla activities against the Japanese. A civil government called Free Sulu Government administered activities in the locality.\n\nThe Japanese Occupation forces established a government in Basilan to govern both Zamboanga and Basilan.  The Japanese Occupation of Basilan was rather uneventful, however, it barely affected the residents, except in terms of Japanese demand for food for their military machinery.  In fact, Datu Mursalun and his family watched, without much interest, the American bombings of the Spanish fort and naval hospital in Isabela which signaled the retaking of Basilan by joint Filipino and American troops in 1945.\n\nAlongside the Zamboanga operation, smaller units of the Military Forces of the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] and the Soldiers of the U.S. 41st Division invaded the [[Sulu Archipelago]], a long stretch of islands reaching from the Zamboanga Peninsula to North Borneo. Rapidly taken in succession were [[Basilan]], Malamawi, [[Tawi-Tawi]], Sanga Sanga and [[Bongao]]. It is during this phase of the operations when American bombing raids completely destroyed Fort Isabela Segunda, which was used by the Japanese as military headquarters, prison and munitions dump, and razed the \"Spanish\" Naval Hospital. Minimal resistance from entrenched Japanese positions in Isabela and Malamawi Island brought about a quick reoccupation which was completed by the beginning of April. On 9 April, strong resistance at [[Jolo]] was encountered. Anchoring their stubborn defense around Mount Dabo, some 3,900 Japanese troops held off the U.S. 163rd Infantry supported by Filipino soldiers and other local Moro guerrillas. By 22 April, the Allies took the position after hard fighting and the rest of the troops fled and held out in the west for another two months. The 163rd suffered 40 dead and 125 wounded by mid-June, 1945, while some 2,000 Japanese perished.\n\n[[File:Sta Isabel Cathedral with Alano Bldg as background.jpg|thumb|left|Old Santa Isabel Cathedral, with the Alano Bldg. (Basilan Theater) in the background]]\n\n===Philippine Republic===\n[[File:Ph-bs.gif|thumb]]\nWhen the town of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] became a chartered city in 1936, it included Basilan. On July 1, 1948, by virtue of a bill filed by then Congressman Juan S. Alano, Basilan itself became a separate city after Republic Act. No. 288 was passed by the 1st Philippine Congress to separate the island from the Zamboanga mainland as a separate entity, which was justified owing to the distance between the island and the city of Zamboanga. \n\nThe first city mayor was Nicasio S. Valderroza, appointed by President Elpidio Quirino. He was considered a builder of cities, having been variously a Provincial Treasurer, an acting Provincial Governor of the old Province of Zamboanga, Mayor of Baguio City, first Mayor of Zamboanga City, First Mayor of Davao City and the first appointed Mayor of the new City of Basilan.\n\nWhen President Ramon Magsaysay became the Chief Executive of the republic in 1954, he appointed Leroy S. Brown as mayor of Basilan City. He served as the second and the last appointive mayor of this city until December 31, 1955. The city was then classified as a first class city.\n\nWith the approval of Republic Act. No. 1211 amending the charter of the City of Basilan, the position of the City Mayor became elective.\n\nThe first election for local officials in Basilan was held on November 8, 1955. Mayor Brown was overwhelmingly elected as the first elective mayor of the city, serving for 5 terms. The then Isabela district, being the city center, was the site for many city public works projects that gave way to an era of economic growth.\n\nHe was the first and the last elected city executive of Basilan. He served uninterrupted from January 1954 to December 31, 1975, under the Administrations of Presidents Carlos Garcia, Diosdado Macapagal and Ferdinand Marcos. During his term, the city council gave birth to a new breed of legislators and leaders from 1954 to 1975. These years have since been called Basilan's \"Golden Years\".\n\n====Municipality of Isabela====\n[[File:Old Isabela Pueblo and Plaza Rizal.jpg|thumb|Old Plaza Rizal and Plaza Misericordia, opposite Santa Isabel Cathedral, old City Hall (Provincial Capitol) atop the hill at the background.]]\nOn December 21, 1972 President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared Martial Law. At that time, Basilan was in the middle of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] Uprising prompted by the expose of the [[Jabidah Massacre]] on March 18, 1968. A number of native Moro leaders joined the MNLF rebellion, making Basilan a veritable warzone. The first-ever armed confrontation occurred around the heavily forested hills of Bagbagon and Canibungan in Lantawan on the island's western area. This was followed by the occupation of the Alano Plantation (declared \"No Man's Land\" by the military) by MNLF \"munduhin\" and \"blackshirts\" and the ensuing aerial bombardment by the military which left the plantation totally devastated. MNLF rebels then laid siege over Lamitan's poblacion, but was eventually staved off by fierce resistance from Lamitan residents who volunteered to fight valiantly beside elements of the Armed Forces and the Philippine Constabulary.\n\nSeveral more raids and ambushes were made throughout the island, which succeeded in stopping all the operations of the plantations. Sporadic gun-battles, too, broke out within Isabela's poblacion, and pirate raids harried fishing operations as well as passenger ferry traffic between Basilan and Zamboanga.\n\nAfter more than two years of incessant fighting, a substantial number among Basilan's Christian populace left the place altogether reducing the Christian tribes to minority status once again. After nearly 50 years of continuous immigration from Zamboanga, the Visayas and Luzon, Basilan experienced, for the very first time, a net outflow of people.\n\nOn December 27, 1973, President Marcos issued [[Presidential Decree]] No. 356, converting the [[City]] of Basilan into the [[Province]] of Basilan \"to provide the close government attention and for the purpose of spurring its growth\". Another Presidential Decree numbered 593 dated December 2, 1974, amended P.D. 356. The law not only defines the City's territory but also provided that the capital of Basilan shall be the [[Municipality]] of Isabela. It also created ten (10) Municipalities to comprise the new Province of Basilan.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 593 was later amended by Presidential Decree No. 840 dated December 11, 1975, reducing the number of municipalities to seven (7) in order to render its \" territorial portion more complementary to the size of the area and more responsive to pacification, rehabilitation and total development of the province\". The municipalities specified in the said amendment were the following: Isabela, [[Lamitan]], [[Tuburan, Basilan|Tuburan]], [[Tipo-Tipo]], [[Sumisip]], [[Maluso]] and [[Lantawan]], of which five (5) municipalities are now in existence. It also provided for the absorption of the territorial jurisdiction of the City of Basilan into the Municipality of Isabela with its poblacion as the capital seat of the province.\n\n[[File:Martial Law in Basilan.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Moro Uprising and martial law in Basilan 1968-1976]]\nThe conversion to Province-hood, and the creation of Municipalities ensured that Basilan's sparsely populated areas were \"given\" to Muslim warlords and surrendering MNLF Commanders by Presidential fiat, as a form of bounty or reward for laying down their arms. The once-progressive First-Class City of Basilan was emasculated beyond recognition, having been reduced to an area exactly One-Kilometer radius within the Isabela Poblacion.\n\nUnder [[martial law]], Basilan had its first military governor in the person of Col. Tomas G. Nanquil, Jr., then the Brigade Commander of 24th Infantry Brigade stationed in Basilan. There were three (3) vice governors during his tenure as military governor. Col. Nanquil served for about a year and half.\n\nBefore Basilan was converted to a province, it had three regular municipalities, Isabela, Lamitan, and Maluso which are districts of the city of Basilan. Even when Col. Nanquil was appointed Military Governor, the city of Basilan was still functioning under Mayor Brown until December 31, 1975 due to its territorial boundary dispute with the Province of Basilan.\n\nThe second military Governor was Rear Admiral Romulo M. Espaldon. Due to his numerous functions and responsibilities as Commanding General of the Armed Forces of the Philippines' Southern Command ([[SouthCom]]), South Sulu Sea Frontiers Command, over all military supervisor of Mindanao, Deputy Chief of Staff of the AFP and Regional Commissioner for Islamic Affairs in Region IX, Adm. Espaldon could not possibly attend to his duties as Military Governor of Basilan. To this effect, he designated Col. Florencio Magsino, Brigade Commander of the 21st Infantry Brigade as Military Supervisor for Basilan and Officer-In-Charge. His Deputy Brigade Commander Col. Recaredo Calvo ably assisted Col. Magsino. When Col. Magsino was appointed Superintendent of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) in Baguio City and Col. Calvo was recalled to Headquarters, Col. Alfredo Rillera assumed command of the Brigade and became the Military Supervisor of Basilan. He was succeeded by Col. Salvador Mison. Col. Augusto Narag, Jr., later replaced him. The last military Supervisor was Gen. Rodolfo Tolentino, consequently, the first military with a star rank to be appointed Military Supervisor in Basilan. Admiral Espaldon was the last military governor of the province, his term lasted until December 31, 1975.\n\nOn December 11, 1975, President Marcos appointed then Vice Governor for Administration Asan G. Camlian, a thrice-elected City Councilor, which later led to the appointment of Ricardo G. Mon as the first municipal mayor of now reinstated municipal government of Isabela. On New Year's Day 1976, Isabela therefore regained independence as the capital town of Basilan province.\n\n====City of Isabela====\nBy virtue of Republic Act No. 9023 Isabela was granted cityhood, with said grant having been ratified by Isabela's residents on a plebiscite held April 25, 2001. Isabela's first city mayor then was Luis Rubio Biel II, the sitting municipal mayor elected in 1998.\n\nOn November of the same year, Isabela City's residents roundly rejected inclusion into the expanded [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), and have since remained under the administrative jurisdiction of the Zamboanga Peninsula region. The rest of Basilan's six municipalities were promptly inducted into the ARMM.\n\nThe elevation of Isabela to 4th-class city status gave the local government a much-needed boost, efficiently delivered under the Biel administration, revitalized Isabela City, making it an engine of growth for Basilan province even as the hinterlands was wracked by incessant firefights and gun-battles between the military and bandit groups such as the [[Abu Sayyaf]] and [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF).\n\nThis renewed vigor was cut-short when Biel was assassinated at high noon on March 3, 2006 by a lone gunman as he was about to leave City Hall. Isabela City residents mourned the loss of the slain Mayor in what probably is the biggest funeral procession ever seen in Basilan.\n\nIsabela City then came under the short-lived administration of Vice Mayor Rodolfo Y. Tan, who served the remainder of Biel's term, relinquishing his post after having been defeated in the May 2007 local elections.\n\nFrom June 2007\u20132016, Isabela City has been under the administration of Cherrylyn Santos-Akbar, who at 32 years, is one of the youngest Mayors of Isabela, and is the first woman to hold the post. She is one of the widows of slain Congressman [[Wahab Akbar]], a 3-term Governor of Basilan. Akbar's [[Jum Jainudin Akbar|first-wife]] was the incumbent Governor, while then-Mayor Akbar (now vice mayor) is the late strongman's second-wife.\n\nIsabela City under then-Mayor Akbar figured prominently in the Anti-MOA/AD movement which was cobbled up in August 2008, when the [[Philippines|Philippine]] Government Peace Negotiating Panel and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front|MILF]] was about to sign a landmark deal which would have granted the MILF a \"separate, distinct and exclusive\" [[Ancestral Domain]] and a semi-independent government, dubbed the [[Bangsamoro Juridical Entity]] ([[BJE]]). Indignation rallies in the Cities of Zamboanga and Iligan, as well as elsewhere in Mindanao were joined by protest actions staged by Isabela City residents, rejecting the proposed deal with the MILF.\n\nIn 2017, the capital was transferred from Isabela to [[Lamitan]]. Isabela still remains part of Basilan provincial services but regional services remains in Zamboanga Peninsula instead of ARMM where the province of Basilan belongs.\n\nIn 2019, Isabela's residents rejected their city's inclusion in the proposed [[Bangsamoro Autonomous Region]] during [[2019 Bangsamoro Autonomous Region creation plebiscite|the plebiscite held on January 21]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Isabela City map1.jpg|thumb|225px|Map of Isabela City]]\n[[File:Isabela poblacion1.jpg|thumb|225px|Isabela City Poblacion (urban area)]]\nIsabela City is located on the northern shore of Basilan Island, along the [[Basilan Strait]] across from [[Zamboanga City]] to the north.
