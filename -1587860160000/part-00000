In 2005, 124 cases of [[MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 49 countries, including the United States.

Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of healthcare-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals have become more frequent in recent years.<!-- Antibiotics are not described as \"strongest\"; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed \"broad spectrum\". Vancomycin is effective against only Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --><!-- HAIs are a serious concern but do not meet the definition of a pandemic. -->\n\n=== Viral hemorrhagic fevers ===\n\nViral hemorrhagic fevers such as [[Ebola virus disease]], [[Lassa fever virus|Lassa fever]], [[Rift Valley fever]], [[Marburg virus|Marburg virus disease]] and [[Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases, with the theoretical potential to become pandemics.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fears of Ebola pandemic if violent attacks continue in DR Congo |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/fears-ebola-pandemic-drc-violent-attacks-continue-190522231352900.html |work=Al-Jazeera |date=23 May 2019}}</ref> Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], and the vector has only a short time before death or serious illness. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[quarantine]] vectors, and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur, which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm; thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Coronaviruses ===\n\n{{Main|2019-20 coronavirus pandemic}}\n\n[[Coronavirus]]es (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East Respiratory Syndrome]] (MERS-CoV) and [[Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome]] (SARS-CoV).

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is six feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish flu]] or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].\n\nFrom October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie, D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |work=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: \"We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is six feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

Inscriptions of the ancient [[South Arabia]]n calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar system]]. Both [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Mas'udi]] suggest that the ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/>\n\nThe Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of [[Tihamah]], [[Hejaz]], and [[Najd]] distinguished between two types of months, permitted (''\u1e25al\u0101l'') and forbidden (''\u1e25ar\u0101m'') months.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the [[hajj|pilgrimage]] season, Dhu al-Qa\u2018dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> A similar if not identical concept to the forbidden months is also attested by [[Procopius]], where he describes an armistice that the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir respected for two months in the [[summer solstice]] of 541 AD/CE.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The [[Qur'an]] links the four forbidden months with ''Nas\u012b\u2019'', a word that literally means \"postponement\".<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of [[Kinanah]],<ref name=Moberg2/> by a man known as the ''al-Qalammas'' of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. ''qal\u0101misa'').<ref name=Kitab/>\n\nDifferent interpretations of the concept of ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' have been proposed.<ref>For an overview of the various theories and a discussion of the problem of \"hindsight chronology\" in early and pre-Islamic sources, see [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/978/1/978.pdf?EThOS%20(BL) Maurice A.

Moberg, \"NASI'\", ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd, VII: 977.</ref> maintain that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] calendar used in central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like [[Ibn Hisham]], [[Ibn Manzur]], and the corpus of [[tafsir|Qur'anic exegesis]].<ref>{{Cite book|edition=4th|publisher=Al-maktaba al-tij\u0101riyya|last=Mu\u1e25ammad al-Khu\u1e0dar\u012b Bayk|title=Mu\u1e25\u0101\u1e0dar\u0101t t\u0101r\u012bkh al-Umam al-Isl\u0101miyya|year=1935|pages=59\u201360|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nThis is corroborated by an early [[Sabaic]] inscription, where a religious ritual was \"postponed\" (''ns'\u2019w'') due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ''ns'\u2019'' has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of ''Nas\u012b\u2019''.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> The ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' concludes ''\"The Arabic system of [Nas\u012b\u2019] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.\"''<ref>The Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, Index, p. 441.</ref> The term \"fixed calendar\" is generally understood to refer to the non-intercalated calendar.\n\nOthers concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] it was transformed into a [[lunisolar calendar]] containing an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]] added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]], and later by [[al-Biruni]],<ref name=Kitab>[[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]] (787\u2013886), ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k93171b.image.f166.langFR Kitab al-Uluf]'', ''Journal Asiatique'', series 5, '''xi''' (1858) 168+. {{in lang|fr|ar}}</ref><ref name=\"Nasi\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chronologyofanci00biru|last=al-Biruni (tr.

Moberg, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9JQ3AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA856,M1 NASI']\", ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam''.</ref> This interpretation considers ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' to be a synonym to the Arabic word for \"intercalation\" (''kab\u012bsa''). The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma'shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews.<ref name=Moberg2/><ref name=Kitab/><ref name=\"Nasi\"/> The Jewish ''Nasi'' was the official who decided when to intercalate the Jewish calendar.<ref>Bab. Talmud, Sanhedrin, p. 11.</ref> Some sources say that the Arabs followed the Jewish practice and intercalated seven months over nineteen years, or else that they intercalated nine months over 24 years; there is, however, no consensus among scholars on this issue.<ref>Bonner 2011, page 21.</ref>\n\nPostponement (''Nas\u012b\u2019'') of one ritual in a particular circumstance does not imply alteration of the sequence of months, and scholars agree that this did not happen. [[Al-Biruni]] also says this did not happen,<ref name=\"Nasi\"/> and the festivals were kept within their season by intercalation every second or third year of a month between Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram. He also says that, in terms of the fixed calendar that was not introduced until 10 AH (632 AD/CE), the first intercalation was, for example, of a month between Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram, the second of a month between Muharram and Safar, the third of a month between Safar and Rabi'I, and so on.<ref name=\"Nasi\"/> The intercalations were arranged so that there were seven of them every nineteen years. The notice of intercalation was issued at the pilgrimage, the next month would be ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' and Muharram would follow. If, on the other hand, the names relate to the intercalated rather than the fixed calendar, the second intercalation might be, for example, of a month between Muharram and Safar allowing for the first intercalation, and the third intercalation of a month between Safar and Rabi'I allowing for the two preceding intercalations, and so on. The time for the intercalation to move from the beginning of the year to the end (twelve intercalations) is the time it takes the fixed calendar to revolve once through the seasons (about 32 1/2 tropical years). There are two big drawbacks of such a system, which would explain why it is not known ever to have been used anywhere in the world. First, it cannot be regulated by means of a cycle (the only cycles known in antiquity were the [[octaeteris]] (3 intercalations in 8 years) and the [[enneadecaeteris]] (7 intercalations in 19 years). Secondly, without a cycle it is difficult to establish from the number of the year (a) if it is intercalary and (b) if it is intercalary, where exactly in the year the intercalation is located.\n\nAlthough some scholars (see list above) claim that the holy months were shuffled about for convenience without the use of intercalation, there is no documentary record of the festivals of any of the holy months being observed in any month other than those they are now observed in. The Qu'ran (sura 9.37) only refers to the \"postponement\" of a sacred month. If they were shuffled as suggested, one would expect there to be a prohibition against \"anticipation\" as well. If the festivities of the sacred months were kept in season by moving them into later months, they would move through the whole twelve months in only 33 years. Had this happened, at least one writer would have mentioned it. Sura 9.36 states \"Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months\" and sura 37 refers to \"adjusting the number of months\". Such adjustment can only be effected by intercalation.\n\nThere are a number of indications that the intercalated calendar was similar to the Jewish calendar, whose year began in the spring.<ref>al-Biruni, ''The chronology of ancient nations'', tr. [[C. Edward Sachau]] (1000/1879) 141.</ref> There are clues in the names of the months themselves:\n\n:Rabi' I - first spring\n:Rabi' II - second spring\n:Jumada I - first month of parched land\n:Jumada II - second month of parched land\n:Sha'ban - Arabs \"dispersed\" to find water\n:Ramadan - scorched\n:Shawwal - female camels \"raised\" their tails after calving\n\nIn the intercalated calendar's last year (AD/CE 632), Dhu al-Hijjah corresponded to March. The [[Battle of the Trench]] in Shawwal and Dhu'l Qi'dah of AH 5 coincided with \"harsh winter weather\". Military campaigns clustered round Ramadan, when the summer heat had dissipated, and all fighting was forbidden during Rajab, at the height of summer. The invasion of Tabak in Rajab AH 9 was hampered by \"too much hot weather\" and \"drought\". In AH 1 Muhammad noted the Jews of Yathrib observing a festival when he arrived on Monday, 8 Rabi'I. Rabi'I is the third month and if it coincided with the third month of the Jewish calendar the festival would have been the [[Feast of Weeks]], which is observed on the 6th and 7th days of that month.\n\n===Prohibiting Nas\u012b\u2019===\n{{further|Nasi'}}\n<!----Please see [[Talk:Muhammad/FAQ]] and discuss on the talk page before removing the following image:---->[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Muhammad prohibiting Nas\u012b'.

Those who disbelieve are led to error thereby, making it lawful in one year and forbidden in another in order to adjust the number of (the months) made sacred by God and make the sacred ones permissible. The evil of their course appears pleasing to them. But God gives no guidance to those who disbelieve. |''[[At-Tawba|Surah at-Tawbah]] (9), ''[[Ayah]]s'' 36\u201337<ref>{{cite quran|9|36|e=37|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\nThe prohibition of Nas\u012b' would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before the month of Nasi' began. If Nas\u012b' meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between AH 1 and AH 10 are uncertain; western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two, three or even four lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the [[The Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah AH 10 (Julian date Friday 6 March, 632 AD/CE) on [[Mount Arafat]] during the [[The Farewell Pilgrimage|farewell pilgrimage]] to Mecca.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{quote|Certainly the Nasi\u2019 is an impious addition, which has led the infidels into error.

Assuredly time, in its revolution, has returned to such as it was at the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the eyes of God the number of the months is twelve.

The Christian liturgical day, kept in monasteries, begins with [[vespers]] (see [[wiktionary:vesper|vesper]]), which is evening, in line with the other [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions. Christian and planetary weekdays begin at the following midnight. Muslims gather for worship at a mosque at noon on \"gathering day\" ({{transl|ar|Yawm al-Jum\u02bfah}}) which corresponds with Friday.\n\nThus \"gathering day\" is often regarded as the weekly day off. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g., [[Egypt|Egypt, Saudi Arabia]]) or Thursday and Friday as official weekends, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g., [[Iran]]) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest.

Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the moon's crescent (''[[wikt:hilal#Noun|hilal]]'') marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely [[Alavi Bohras|Alavis]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]] and [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Shia]] [[Ismaili]] Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and even months have 29.\n\n==Year numbering==\n{{main|Hijri year}}\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, it was customary to identify a year after a major event which took place in it. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, [[Abraha]], governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian [[Aksumite Empire|Kingdom of Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), attempted to destroy the [[Kaaba]] with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the ''[[Year of the Elephant]]'', during which Muhammad was born (sura [[al-Fil]]). Most equate this to the year 570 AD/CE, but a minority use 571 CE.\n\nThe first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to [[Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b]]:<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) 376.</ref>\n# The year of permission.\n# The year of the order of fighting.\n# The year of the trial.\n# The year of congratulation on marriage.\n# The year of the earthquake.\n# The year of enquiring.\n# The year of gaining victory.\n# The year of equality.\n# The year of exemption.\n# The year of farewell.\n\nIn AH 17 (638 AD/CE), [[Abu Musa Ashaari]], one of the officials of the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] in [[Basra]]h, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should be the year of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). [[Uthman ibn Affan]] then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I of the intercalated calendar, two months before the commencement of Muharram in the new fixed calendar.<ref name=\"WH\"/> Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijri calendar.\n\nF A Shamsi (1984) postulated that the Arabic calendar was never intercalated. According to him, the first day of the first month of the new fixed Islamic calendar (1 Muharram AH 1) was no different from what was observed at the time. The day the Prophet moved from Quba' to Medina was originally 26 Rabi' I on the pre-Islamic calendar.<ref>''Chronology of Prophetic Events'', Fazlur Rehman Shaikh (2001) p.52 Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd.</ref> 1 Muharram of the new fixed calendar corresponded to Friday, 16 July 622 AD/CE, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) pp.373\u20135, 382\u20134.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |title=Calendrica |publisher= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |archivedate=16 February 2005 |df= }}</ref> The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July.

Still, the Islamic calendar seldom varies by more than three days from the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, and roughly approximates it. Both the Islamic calendar and the astronomical-lunar-calendar take no account of the [[solar year]] in their calculations, and thus both of these strictly lunar based calendar systems have no ability to reckon the timing of the four seasons of the year.\n\nIn the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, a year of 12 lunar months is 354.37 days long. In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely at the time of the monthly \"conjunction\", when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar every four years.<ref>Emile Bi\u00e9mont, Rythmes du temps, Astronomie et calendriers, De Borck, 2000, 393p.</ref> The technical details of the adjustment are described in [[Tabular Islamic calendar]].\n\nThe Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=633#more-633|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref> Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries. Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synchronisation with one another.\n[[File:\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0636\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0642\u0645\u060c \u0639\u06a9\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c\u06cc\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u06cc \u0642\u0645 12.jpg|alt=One man watches another, who looks through a modern telescope|thumb|Clerics observe the moon.]]\n\nThis traditional practice for the determination of the start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters.<ref>Karim Meziane et [[Nidhal Guessoum]]: La visibilit\u00e9 du croissant lunaire et le ramadan, La Recherche n\u00b0 316, janvier 1999, pp. 66\u201371.</ref> Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its \"age\" since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.\n\nA number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say they do on this subject, and what they actually do. In some instances, what a country says it does is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moonsighting.com/calculation-or-sighting.html|title=Calculations or Sighting for starting an Islamic month|website=www.moonsighting.com|access-date=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508214424/http://www.moonsighting.com/calculation-or-sighting.html|archive-date=8 May 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oumma.com/Le-mois-islamique-est-il-universel|title=Le mois islamique est-il universel ou national ?|author=Oumma|date=23 June 2010|work=Oumma}}</ref>\n\nDue to the somewhat variable nature of the Islamic calendar, in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar is used primarily for religious purposes, while the Solar-based Gregorian calendar is still used primarily for matters of [[commerce]] and [[agriculture]].\n\n== Theological considerations ==\nIf the Islamic calendar were prepared using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim world could use it to meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today.

This resulted in a division of the Muslim community of France, with some members following the new rule, and others following the Saudi announcement.\n\nIsma'ili-Taiyebi Bohras having the institution of ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|da'i al-mutlaq]]'' follow the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[imam]]s.\n\n== Astronomical 12-moon calendars ==\n\n=== Islamic calendar of Turkey ===\nTurkish Muslims use an Islamic calendar which is calculated several years in advance (currently up to 1444 AH/2022 CE) by the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs]] (Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131). From 1 Muharrem 1400 AH (21 November 1979) until 29 Zilhicce 1435 (24 October 2014) the computed Turkish lunar calendar was based on the following rule: \"The lunar month is assumed to begin on the evening when, within some region of the terrestrial globe, the computed centre of the lunar crescent at local sunset is more than 5\u00b0 above the local horizon and (geocentrically) more than 8\u00b0 from the Sun.\" In the current rule the (computed) lunar crescent has to be above the local horizon of [[Ankara]] at sunset.<ref name=turkey>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/diyanetcalendar.htm|title=The Islamic Calendar of Turkey|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Saudi Arabia's ''Umm al-Qura'' calendar ===\n[[Saudi Arabia]] uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99), several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.\n\nThe country also uses the Umm al-Qura calendar, based on astronomical calculations, but this is restricted to administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes over the past decade.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.icoproject.org/pdf/khan_2001.pdf |title=Crescent sighting using the Uml al Qura calendar in Saudi Arabia }}&nbsp;(268&nbsp;KB)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/ummalqura.htm|title=The Umm al-Qura Calendar of Saudi Arabia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBefore AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon's age at sunset in [[Riyadh]] was at least 12 hours, then the day ''ending'' at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.\n\nFor AH 1420\u201322, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).\n\nSince the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Islamic Society of North America]], the ''Fiqh'' Council of North America and the European Council for ''[[Fatwa]]'' and Research announced that they will henceforth use a calendar based on calculations using the same parameters as the ''Umm al-Qura'' calendar to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify, at some future time, Muslims' calendars throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://progmuslim.meetup.com/14/messages/boards/thread/3449676|title=Log in - Meetup|last=|first=|date=|website=progmuslim.meetup.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=621#more-621|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1 October 2016, as a cost-cutting measure, Saudi Arabia no longer uses the Islamic calendar for paying the monthly salaries of government employees but the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican.ink/article/saudi-arabia-adopts-gregorian-calendar|title=Saudi Arabia adopts Gregorian calendar|date=8 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=Economist171216>[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21711938-hauling-saudi-arabia-21st-century-saudi-arabia-adopts-gregorian The prince\u2019s time machine: Saudi Arabia adopts the Gregorian calendar] [[The Economist]], Dec 17th 2016.</ref>\n\n==Other calendars using the Islamic era==\nThe [[Solar Hijri calendar]] is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan which counts its years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD/CE.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yxd3E-_AqSEC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=shah+calendar+change&source=bl&ots=54acfUnJpk&sig=dNuo-nwbrJdjzi9ChMJQTyOJyzU&hl=en&ei=TAjmSfeiIZvpnQf3lJ2nCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3 |title=Persian Pilgrimages by Afshin Molavi |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>\n\n== Tabular Islamic calendar ==\n{{main|Tabular Islamic calendar}}\nThe Tabular Islamic calendar is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 [[leap year]]s of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 solar years or 2,570 lunar years.

Microsoft claimed that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from [[Kuwait]], however it matches a known tabular calendar.\n\n== Notable dates ==\n{{main|Muslim holidays}}\nImportant dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:\n* 1 Muharram: [[Sunni]] [[Islamic New Year]].\n* 10 Muharram: [[Day of Ashura]]. For Sunnis, the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] by [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]] occurred on this day.

Theoretically, the days of the months correspond in both calendars if the displacements which are a feature of the Jewish system are ignored. The table below gives, for nineteen years, the Muslim month which corresponds to the first Jewish month.\n\n{| style=\"border:none;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"padding-right:1.0em;\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

When it goes above twelve, subtract twelve and add one to the year AH. From 412 AD/CE to 632 AD/CE inclusive the month number is 1 and the calculation gives the month correct to a month or so. 622 AD/CE corresponds to BH 1 and AH 1. For earlier years, year BH = (623 or 622) \u2013 year AD/CE).\n\nAn example calculation: What is the civil date and year AH of the first day of the first month in the year 20875 AD/CE?\n\nWe first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in 20874 AD/CE. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen because it gives the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098\u2013106)=992\u00d719 years apart. The Muslim month number corresponding to the first Jewish month is therefore 992\u00d77=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve \u2013 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y \u2013 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in 20874 AD/CE corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH 20874. The worked example in [[Hebrew calendar#Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars|Conversion between Jewish and civil dates]], shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH 20875 will therefore begin seven months later, on the first day of the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, 20875 AD/CE (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.\n\nA reading of the section which follows will show that the year AH 20875 is wholly contained within the year 20875 AD/CE, also that in the Gregorian calendar this correspondence will occur one year earlier. The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian, though less so) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.\n<!----Mean civil year = 365d 05h 48m 48s (Milankovic), synodic month = 29d 12h 44 1/18m, hence mean calendar year = 354d 08h 48 12/18m.---->\n\n===Current correlations===\nAn Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874, after which year the number of the Islamic year will always be greater than the number of the concurrent civil year. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurred entirely within the civil calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 civil years).

Once every 33 or 34 Hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, the beginning of a Hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January. Subsequent Hijri New Years move backward through the civil year back to the beginning of January again, passing through each civil month from December to January.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the [[Egyptian calendar]] was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] and the 1789 [[Rumi calendar|Ottoman calendar]] (a modified [[Julian calendar]]) were also used for agriculture in their countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the [[Levant]] and [[Iraq]] the [[Aramaic]] names of the [[Babylonian calendar]] are still used for all secular matters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the [[Maghreb]], Berber farmers in the countryside still use the Julian calendar for agrarian purposes.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |last1=Gast |first1=M. |last2=Delheur |first2=J. |last3=E.B. |title=Calendrier |url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2039 |website=Encyclop\u00e9die Berb\u00e8re, 11 (Bracelets \u2013 Caprarienses) |publisher=OpenEdition |accessdate=5 July 2018 |language=fr}}</ref> These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Islamic calendar.<ref>the start of each lunar month determined not ahead of time by astronomical calculation, but only after the crescent moon is sighted by the proper religious authorities.

Inscriptions of the ancient [[South Arabia]]n calendars reveal the use of a number of local calendars. At least some of these South Arabian calendars followed the [[lunisolar calendar|lunisolar system]]. Both [[al-Biruni]] and [[al-Mas'udi]] suggest that the ancient Arabs used the same month names as the Muslims, though they also record other month names used by the pre-Islamic Arabs.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/>\n\nThe Islamic tradition is unanimous in stating that Arabs of [[Tihamah]], [[Hejaz]], and [[Najd]] distinguished between two types of months, permitted (''\u1e25al\u0101l'') and forbidden (''\u1e25ar\u0101m'') months.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> The forbidden months were four months during which fighting is forbidden, listed as Rajab and the three months around the [[hajj|pilgrimage]] season, Dhu al-Qa\u2018dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, and Muharram.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> A similar if not identical concept to the forbidden months is also attested by [[Procopius]], where he describes an armistice that the Eastern Arabs of the Lakhmid al-Mundhir respected for two months in the [[summer solstice]] of 541 AD/CE.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> However, Muslim historians do not link these months to a particular season. The [[Qur'an]] links the four forbidden months with ''Nas\u012b\u2019'', a word that literally means \"postponement\".<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> According to Muslim tradition, the decision of postponement was administered by the tribe of [[Kinanah]],<ref name=Moberg2/> by a man known as the ''al-Qalammas'' of Kinanah and his descendants (pl. ''qal\u0101misa'').<ref name=Kitab/>\n\nDifferent interpretations of the concept of ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' have been proposed.<ref>For an overview of the various theories and a discussion of the problem of \"hindsight chronology\" in early and pre-Islamic sources, see [http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/978/1/978.pdf?EThOS%20(BL) Maurice A.

Moberg, \"NASI'\", ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', 2nd, VII: 977.</ref> maintain that the [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] calendar used in central Arabia was a purely lunar calendar similar to the modern Islamic calendar. According to this view, ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' is related to the pre-Islamic practices of the Meccan Arabs, where they would alter the distribution of the forbidden months within a given year without implying a calendar manipulation. This interpretation is supported by Arab historians and lexicographers, like [[Ibn Hisham]], [[Ibn Manzur]], and the corpus of [[tafsir|Qur'anic exegesis]].<ref>{{Cite book|edition=4th|publisher=Al-maktaba al-tij\u0101riyya|last=Mu\u1e25ammad al-Khu\u1e0dar\u012b Bayk|title=Mu\u1e25\u0101\u1e0dar\u0101t t\u0101r\u012bkh al-Umam al-Isl\u0101miyya|year=1935|pages=59\u201360|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nThis is corroborated by an early [[Sabaic]] inscription, where a religious ritual was \"postponed\" (''ns'\u2019w'') due to war. According to the context of this inscription, the verb ''ns'\u2019'' has nothing to do with intercalation, but only with moving religious events within the calendar itself. The similarity between the religious concept of this ancient inscription and the Qur'an suggests that non-calendaring postponement is also the Qur'anic meaning of ''Nas\u012b\u2019''.<ref name=\"EI2-Tarikh\"/> The ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' concludes ''\"The Arabic system of [Nas\u012b\u2019] can only have been intended to move the Hajj and the fairs associated with it in the vicinity of Mecca to a suitable season of the year. It was not intended to establish a fixed calendar to be generally observed.\"''<ref>The Encyclopedia of Islam, 2nd edition, Index, p. 441.</ref> The term \"fixed calendar\" is generally understood to refer to the non-intercalated calendar.\n\nOthers concur that it was originally a lunar calendar, but suggest that about 200 years before the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] it was transformed into a [[lunisolar calendar]] containing an [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary month]] added from time to time to keep the pilgrimage within the season of the year when merchandise was most abundant. This interpretation was first proposed by the medieval Muslim astrologer and astronomer [[Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]], and later by [[al-Biruni]],<ref name=Kitab>[[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi]] (787\u2013886), ''[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k93171b.image.f166.langFR Kitab al-Uluf]'', ''Journal Asiatique'', series 5, '''xi''' (1858) 168+. {{in lang|fr|ar}}</ref><ref name=\"Nasi\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chronologyofanci00biru|last=al-Biruni (tr.

Moberg, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9JQ3AAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover#PPA856,M1 NASI']\", ''E.J. Brill's first encyclopaedia of Islam''.</ref> This interpretation considers ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' to be a synonym to the Arabic word for \"intercalation\" (''kab\u012bsa''). The Arabs, according to one explanation mentioned by Abu Ma'shar, learned of this type of intercalation from the Jews.<ref name=Moberg2/><ref name=Kitab/><ref name=\"Nasi\"/> The Jewish ''Nasi'' was the official who decided when to intercalate the Jewish calendar.<ref>Bab. Talmud, Sanhedrin, p. 11.</ref> Some sources say that the Arabs followed the Jewish practice and intercalated seven months over nineteen years, or else that they intercalated nine months over 24 years; there is, however, no consensus among scholars on this issue.<ref>Bonner 2011, page 21.</ref>\n\nPostponement (''Nas\u012b\u2019'') of one ritual in a particular circumstance does not imply alteration of the sequence of months, and scholars agree that this did not happen. [[Al-Biruni]] also says this did not happen,<ref name=\"Nasi\"/> and the festivals were kept within their season by intercalation every second or third year of a month between Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram. He also says that, in terms of the fixed calendar that was not introduced until 10 AH (632 AD/CE), the first intercalation was, for example, of a month between Dhu al-Hijjah and Muharram, the second of a month between Muharram and Safar, the third of a month between Safar and Rabi'I, and so on.<ref name=\"Nasi\"/> The intercalations were arranged so that there were seven of them every nineteen years. The notice of intercalation was issued at the pilgrimage, the next month would be ''Nas\u012b\u2019'' and Muharram would follow. If, on the other hand, the names relate to the intercalated rather than the fixed calendar, the second intercalation might be, for example, of a month between Muharram and Safar allowing for the first intercalation, and the third intercalation of a month between Safar and Rabi'I allowing for the two preceding intercalations, and so on. The time for the intercalation to move from the beginning of the year to the end (twelve intercalations) is the time it takes the fixed calendar to revolve once through the seasons (about 32 1/2 tropical years). There are two big drawbacks of such a system, which would explain why it is not known ever to have been used anywhere in the world. First, it cannot be regulated by means of a cycle (the only cycles known in antiquity were the [[octaeteris]] (3 intercalations in 8 years) and the [[enneadecaeteris]] (7 intercalations in 19 years). Secondly, without a cycle it is difficult to establish from the number of the year (a) if it is intercalary and (b) if it is intercalary, where exactly in the year the intercalation is located.\n\nAlthough some scholars (see list above) claim that the holy months were shuffled about for convenience without the use of intercalation, there is no documentary record of the festivals of any of the holy months being observed in any month other than those they are now observed in. The Qu'ran (sura 9.37) only refers to the \"postponement\" of a sacred month. If they were shuffled as suggested, one would expect there to be a prohibition against \"anticipation\" as well. If the festivities of the sacred months were kept in season by moving them into later months, they would move through the whole twelve months in only 33 years. Had this happened, at least one writer would have mentioned it. Sura 9.36 states \"Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months\" and sura 37 refers to \"adjusting the number of months\". Such adjustment can only be effected by intercalation.\n\nThere are a number of indications that the intercalated calendar was similar to the Jewish calendar, whose year began in the spring.<ref>al-Biruni, ''The chronology of ancient nations'', tr. [[C. Edward Sachau]] (1000/1879) 141.</ref> There are clues in the names of the months themselves:\n\n:Rabi' I - first spring\n:Rabi' II - second spring\n:Jumada I - first month of parched land\n:Jumada II - second month of parched land\n:Sha'ban - Arabs \"dispersed\" to find water\n:Ramadan - scorched\n:Shawwal - female camels \"raised\" their tails after calving\n\nIn the intercalated calendar's last year (AD/CE 632), Dhu al-Hijjah corresponded to March. The [[Battle of the Trench]] in Shawwal and Dhu'l Qi'dah of AH 5 coincided with \"harsh winter weather\". Military campaigns clustered round Ramadan, when the summer heat had dissipated, and all fighting was forbidden during Rajab, at the height of summer. The invasion of Tabak in Rajab AH 9 was hampered by \"too much hot weather\" and \"drought\". In AH 1 Muhammad noted the Jews of Yathrib observing a festival when he arrived on Monday, 8 Rabi'I. Rabi'I is the third month and if it coincided with the third month of the Jewish calendar the festival would have been the [[Feast of Weeks]], which is observed on the 6th and 7th days of that month.\n\n===Prohibiting Nas\u012b\u2019===\n{{further|Nasi'}}\n<!----Please see [[Talk:Muhammad/FAQ]] and discuss on the talk page before removing the following image:---->[[File:Maome.jpg|thumb|Illustration of Muhammad prohibiting Nas\u012b'.

That is the right religion. So wrong not each other during them. And fight the unbelievers totally even as they fight you totally and know that God is with the godfearing.\n\nKnow that intercalation (nasi) is an addition to disbelief. Those who disbelieve are led to error thereby, making it lawful in one year and forbidden in another in order to adjust the number of (the months) made sacred by God and make the sacred ones permissible. The evil of their course appears pleasing to them. But God gives no guidance to those who disbelieve. |''[[At-Tawba|Surah at-Tawbah]] (9), ''[[Ayah]]s'' 36\u201337<ref>{{cite quran|9|36|e=37|s=ns}}</ref>}}\n\nThe prohibition of Nas\u012b' would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month had returned to its position just before the month of Nasi' began. If Nas\u012b' meant intercalation, then the number and the position of the intercalary months between AH 1 and AH 10 are uncertain; western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two, three or even four lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the [[The Farewell Sermon|farewell sermon]] which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah AH 10 (Julian date Friday 6 March, 632 AD/CE) on [[Mount Arafat]] during the [[The Farewell Pilgrimage|farewell pilgrimage]] to Mecca.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{quote|Certainly the Nasi\u2019 is an impious addition, which has led the infidels into error.

Assuredly time, in its revolution, has returned to such as it was at the creation of the heavens and the earth. In the eyes of God the number of the months is twelve.

The single forbidden month is [[Rajab]], month 7. These months were considered forbidden both within the new Islamic calendar and within the old pagan Meccan calendar.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n==Days of the Week==\nThe Islamic days of the week correspond to the seven days Allah created the world.\n\nThe Islamic days, like those in the [[Hebrew calendar|Hebrew]] and [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed calendar|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed]] calendars, begin at sunset. The Christian liturgical day, kept in monasteries, begins with [[vespers]] (see [[wiktionary:vesper|vesper]]), which is evening, in line with the other [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] traditions. Christian and planetary weekdays begin at the following midnight. Muslims gather for worship at a mosque at noon on \"gathering day\" ({{transl|ar|Yawm al-Jum\u02bfah}}) which corresponds with Friday.\n\nThus \"gathering day\" is often regarded as the weekly day off. This is frequently made official, with many Muslim countries adopting Friday and Saturday (e.g., [[Egypt|Egypt, Saudi Arabia]]) or Thursday and Friday as official weekends, during which offices are closed; other countries (e.g., [[Iran]]) choose to make Friday alone a day of rest. A few others (e.g., [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]]) have adopted the Saturday-Sunday weekend while making Friday a working day with a long midday break to allow time off for worship.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\n!

Traditionally this is based on actual observation of the moon's crescent (''[[wikt:hilal#Noun|hilal]]'') marking the end of the previous lunar cycle and hence the previous month, thereby beginning the new month. Consequently, each month can have 29 or 30 days depending on the visibility of the moon, astronomical positioning of the earth and weather conditions. However, certain sects and groups, most notably Bohras Muslims namely [[Alavi Bohras|Alavis]], [[Dawoodi Bohra|Dawoodis]] and [[Sulaymani]]s and [[Shia]] [[Ismaili]] Muslims, use a tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) in which odd-numbered months have thirty days (and also the twelfth month in a leap year) and even months have 29.\n\n==Year numbering==\n{{main|Hijri year}}\nIn pre-Islamic Arabia, it was customary to identify a year after a major event which took place in it. Thus, according to Islamic tradition, [[Abraha]], governor of Yemen, then a province of the Christian [[Aksumite Empire|Kingdom of Aksum]] ([[Ethiopia]]), attempted to destroy the [[Kaaba]] with an army which included several elephants. The raid was unsuccessful, but that year became known as the ''[[Year of the Elephant]]'', during which Muhammad was born (sura [[al-Fil]]). Most equate this to the year 570 AD/CE, but a minority use 571 CE.\n\nThe first ten years of the Hijra were not numbered, but were named after events in the life of Muhammad according to [[Ab\u016b Ray\u1e25\u0101n al-B\u012br\u016bn\u012b]]:<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) 376.</ref>\n# The year of permission.\n# The year of the order of fighting.\n# The year of the trial.\n# The year of congratulation on marriage.\n# The year of the earthquake.\n# The year of enquiring.\n# The year of gaining victory.\n# The year of equality.\n# The year of exemption.\n# The year of farewell.\n\nIn AH 17 (638 AD/CE), [[Abu Musa Ashaari]], one of the officials of the [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] in [[Basra]]h, complained about the absence of any years on the correspondence he received from Umar, making it difficult for him to determine which instructions were most recent. This report convinced Umar of the need to introduce an era for Muslims. After debating the issue with his counsellors, he decided that the first year should be the year of Muhammad's arrival at Medina (known as Yathrib, before Muhammad's arrival). [[Uthman ibn Affan]] then suggested that the months begin with Muharram, in line with the established custom of the Arabs at that time. The years of the Islamic calendar thus began with the month of Muharram in the year of Muhammad's arrival at the city of Medina, even though the actual emigration took place in Safar and Rabi' I of the intercalated calendar, two months before the commencement of Muharram in the new fixed calendar.<ref name=\"WH\"/> Because of the Hijra, the calendar was named the Hijri calendar.\n\nF A Shamsi (1984) postulated that the Arabic calendar was never intercalated. According to him, the first day of the first month of the new fixed Islamic calendar (1 Muharram AH 1) was no different from what was observed at the time. The day the Prophet moved from Quba' to Medina was originally 26 Rabi' I on the pre-Islamic calendar.<ref>''Chronology of Prophetic Events'', Fazlur Rehman Shaikh (2001) p.52 Ta-Ha Publishers Ltd.</ref> 1 Muharram of the new fixed calendar corresponded to Friday, 16 July 622 AD/CE, the equivalent civil tabular date (same daylight period) in the [[Julian calendar]].<ref>Sherrard Beaumont Burnaby, [https://archive.org/details/elementsofjewish00burnuoft ''Elements of the Jewish and Muhammadan calendars''] (1901) pp.373\u20135, 382\u20134.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |title=Calendrica |publisher= |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216102054/http://emr.cs.iit.edu/home/reingold/calendar-book/Calendrica.html |archivedate=16 February 2005 |df= }}</ref> The Islamic day began at the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July.

For example, al-Biruni mentioned this Julian date in the year 1000 AD/CE.<ref>al-Biruni, ''The chronology of ancient nations'', tr. [[C. Edward Sachau]] (1000/1879) 327.</ref> Although not used by either medieval Muslim astronomers or modern scholars to determine the Islamic epoch, the thin [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] would have also first become visible (assuming clouds did not obscure it) shortly after the preceding sunset on the evening of 15 July, 1.5 days after the associated [[dark moon]] (astronomical [[new moon]]) on the morning of 14 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases0601.html|title=NASA phases of the moon 601\u2013700|publisher=|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008214455/http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/phase/phases0601.html|archivedate=8 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThough [[Michael Cook (historian)|Cook]] and [[Patricia Crone|Crone]] in ''[[Hagarism: The Making of the Islamic World]]'' cite a coin from AH 17, the first surviving attested use of a Hijri calendar date alongside a date in another calendar ([[Coptic calendar|Coptic]]) is on a [[papyrus]] from [[Egypt]] in AH 22, [[PERF 558]].\n\n==Astronomical considerations==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2016}}\nDue to the fact that the Islamic calendar relies on certain variable methods of observation which are used to determine its month-start-dates, the start-dates of its months sometimes vary slightly from the month-start-dates of the [[lunar calendar|astronomical lunar calendar]], which are based directly on astronomical calculations. Still, the Islamic calendar seldom varies by more than three days from the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, and roughly approximates it. Both the Islamic calendar and the astronomical-lunar-calendar take no account of the [[solar year]] in their calculations, and thus both of these strictly lunar based calendar systems have no ability to reckon the timing of the four seasons of the year.\n\nIn the astronomical-lunar-calendar system, a year of 12 lunar months is 354.37 days long. In this calendar system, lunar months begin precisely at the time of the monthly \"conjunction\", when the Moon is located most directly between the Earth and the Sun. The month is defined as the average duration of a revolution of the Moon around the Earth (29.53 days). By convention, months of 30 days and 29 days succeed each other, adding up over two successive months to 59 full days. This leaves only a small monthly variation of 44 minutes to account for, which adds up to a total of 24 hours (i.e., the equivalent of one full day) in 2.73 years. To settle accounts, it is sufficient to add one day every three years to the lunar calendar, in the same way that one adds one day to the Gregorian calendar every four years.<ref>Emile Bi\u00e9mont, Rythmes du temps, Astronomie et calendriers, De Borck, 2000, 393p.</ref> The technical details of the adjustment are described in [[Tabular Islamic calendar]].\n\nThe Islamic calendar, however, is based on a different set of conventions being used for the determination of the month-start-dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=633#more-633|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref> Each month still has either 29 or 30 days, but due to the variable method of observations employed, there is usually no discernible order in the sequencing of either 29 or 30 day month lengths. Traditionally, the first day of each month is the day (beginning at sunset) of the first sighting of the hilal (crescent moon) shortly after sunset. If the hilal is not observed immediately after the 29th day of a month (either because clouds block its view or because the western sky is still too bright when the moon sets), then the day that begins at that sunset is the 30th. Such a sighting has to be made by one or more trustworthy men testifying before a committee of Muslim leaders. Determining the most likely day that the hilal could be observed was a motivation for Muslim interest in astronomy, which put Islam in the forefront of that science for many centuries. Still, due to the fact that both lunar reckoning systems are ultimately based on the lunar cycle itself, both systems still do roughly correspond to one another, never being more than three days out of synchronisation with one another.\n[[File:\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0647\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0631\u0645\u0636\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0631 \u0634\u0647\u0631 \u0642\u0645\u060c \u0639\u06a9\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0635\u0637\u0641\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0631\u0627\u062c\u06cc\u060c \u0628\u0644\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u06cc \u0642\u0645 12.jpg|alt=One man watches another, who looks through a modern telescope|thumb|Clerics observe the moon.]]\n\nThis traditional practice for the determination of the start-date of the month is still followed in the overwhelming majority of Muslim countries. Each Islamic state proceeds with its own monthly observation of the new moon (or, failing that, awaits the completion of 30 days) before declaring the beginning of a new month on its territory. But, the lunar crescent becomes visible only some 17 hours after the conjunction, and only subject to the existence of a number of favourable conditions relative to weather, time, geographic location, as well as various astronomical parameters.<ref>Karim Meziane et [[Nidhal Guessoum]]: La visibilit\u00e9 du croissant lunaire et le ramadan, La Recherche n\u00b0 316, janvier 1999, pp. 66\u201371.</ref> Given the fact that the moon sets progressively later than the sun as one goes west, with a corresponding increase in its \"age\" since conjunction, Western Muslim countries may, under favorable conditions, observe the new moon one day earlier than eastern Muslim countries. Due to the interplay of all these factors, the beginning of each month differs from one Muslim country to another, during the 48 hour period following the conjunction. The information provided by the calendar in any country does not extend beyond the current month.\n\nA number of Muslim countries try to overcome some of these difficulties by applying different astronomy-related rules to determine the beginning of months. Thus, [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and a few others begin each month at sunset on the first day that the moon sets after the sun (moonset after sunset). In Egypt, the month begins at sunset on the first day that the moon sets at least five minutes after the sun. A detailed analysis of the available data shows, however, that there are major discrepancies between what countries say they do on this subject, and what they actually do. In some instances, what a country says it does is impossible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moonsighting.com/calculation-or-sighting.html|title=Calculations or Sighting for starting an Islamic month|website=www.moonsighting.com|access-date=16 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508214424/http://www.moonsighting.com/calculation-or-sighting.html|archive-date=8 May 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://oumma.com/Le-mois-islamique-est-il-universel|title=Le mois islamique est-il universel ou national ?|author=Oumma|date=23 June 2010|work=Oumma}}</ref>\n\nDue to the somewhat variable nature of the Islamic calendar, in most Muslim countries, the Islamic calendar is used primarily for religious purposes, while the Solar-based Gregorian calendar is still used primarily for matters of [[commerce]] and [[agriculture]].\n\n== Theological considerations ==\nIf the Islamic calendar were prepared using astronomical calculations, Muslims throughout the Muslim world could use it to meet all their needs, the way they use the Gregorian calendar today.

This resulted in a division of the Muslim community of France, with some members following the new rule, and others following the Saudi announcement.\n\nIsma'ili-Taiyebi Bohras having the institution of ''[[Da'i al-Mutlaq|da'i al-mutlaq]]'' follow the tabular Islamic calendar (see section below) prepared on the basis of astronomical calculations from the days of [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] [[imam]]s.\n\n== Astronomical 12-moon calendars ==\n\n=== Islamic calendar of Turkey ===\nTurkish Muslims use an Islamic calendar which is calculated several years in advance (currently up to 1444 AH/2022 CE) by the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|Turkish Presidency of Religious Affairs]] (Diyanet \u0130\u015fleri Ba\u015fkanl\u0131\u011f\u0131). From 1 Muharrem 1400 AH (21 November 1979) until 29 Zilhicce 1435 (24 October 2014) the computed Turkish lunar calendar was based on the following rule: \"The lunar month is assumed to begin on the evening when, within some region of the terrestrial globe, the computed centre of the lunar crescent at local sunset is more than 5\u00b0 above the local horizon and (geocentrically) more than 8\u00b0 from the Sun.\" In the current rule the (computed) lunar crescent has to be above the local horizon of [[Ankara]] at sunset.<ref name=turkey>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/diyanetcalendar.htm|title=The Islamic Calendar of Turkey|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Saudi Arabia's ''Umm al-Qura'' calendar ===\n[[Saudi Arabia]] uses the sighting method to determine the beginning of each month of the Hijri calendar. Since AH 1419 (1998/99), several official hilal sighting committees have been set up by the government to determine the first visual sighting of the lunar crescent at the beginning of each lunar month. Nevertheless, the religious authorities also allow the testimony of less experienced observers and thus often announce the sighting of the lunar crescent on a date when none of the official committees could see it.\n\nThe country also uses the Umm al-Qura calendar, based on astronomical calculations, but this is restricted to administrative purposes. The parameters used in the establishment of this calendar underwent significant changes over the past decade.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.icoproject.org/pdf/khan_2001.pdf |title=Crescent sighting using the Uml al Qura calendar in Saudi Arabia }}&nbsp;(268&nbsp;KB)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/ummalqura.htm|title=The Umm al-Qura Calendar of Saudi Arabia|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nBefore AH 1420 (before 18 April 1999), if the moon's age at sunset in [[Riyadh]] was at least 12 hours, then the day ''ending'' at that sunset was the first day of the month. This often caused the Saudis to celebrate holy days one or even two days before other predominantly Muslim countries, including the dates for the Hajj, which can only be dated using Saudi dates because it is performed in Mecca.\n\nFor AH 1420\u201322, if moonset occurred after sunset at Mecca, then the day beginning at that sunset was the first day of a Saudi month, essentially the same rule used by Malaysia, Indonesia, and others (except for the location from which the hilal was observed).\n\nSince the beginning of AH 1423 (16 March 2002), the rule has been clarified a little by requiring the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon to occur before sunset, in addition to requiring moonset to occur after sunset at Mecca. This ensures that the moon has moved past the sun by sunset, even though the sky may still be too bright immediately before moonset to actually see the crescent.\n\nIn 2007, the [[Islamic Society of North America]], the ''Fiqh'' Council of North America and the European Council for ''[[Fatwa]]'' and Research announced that they will henceforth use a calendar based on calculations using the same parameters as the ''Umm al-Qura'' calendar to determine (well in advance) the beginning of all lunar months (and therefore the days associated with all religious observances). This was intended as a first step on the way to unify, at some future time, Muslims' calendars throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://progmuslim.meetup.com/14/messages/boards/thread/3449676|title=Log in - Meetup|last=|first=|date=|website=progmuslim.meetup.com|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabsir.net/?p=621#more-621|title=tabsir.net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince 1 October 2016, as a cost-cutting measure, Saudi Arabia no longer uses the Islamic calendar for paying the monthly salaries of government employees but the Gregorian calendar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglican.ink/article/saudi-arabia-adopts-gregorian-calendar|title=Saudi Arabia adopts Gregorian calendar|date=8 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=Economist171216>[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21711938-hauling-saudi-arabia-21st-century-saudi-arabia-adopts-gregorian The prince\u2019s time machine: Saudi Arabia adopts the Gregorian calendar] [[The Economist]], Dec 17th 2016.</ref>\n\n==Other calendars using the Islamic era==\nThe [[Solar Hijri calendar]] is a solar calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan which counts its years from the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]] or migration of Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 AD/CE.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yxd3E-_AqSEC&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=shah+calendar+change&source=bl&ots=54acfUnJpk&sig=dNuo-nwbrJdjzi9ChMJQTyOJyzU&hl=en&ei=TAjmSfeiIZvpnQf3lJ2nCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3 |title=Persian Pilgrimages by Afshin Molavi |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref>\n\n== Tabular Islamic calendar ==\n{{main|Tabular Islamic calendar}}\nThe Tabular Islamic calendar is a rule-based variation of the Islamic calendar, in which months are worked out by arithmetic rules rather than by observation or astronomical calculation. It has a 30-year cycle with 11 [[leap year]]s of 355 days and 19 years of 354 days. In the long term, it is accurate to one day in about 2,500 solar years or 2,570 lunar years. It also deviates up to about one or two days in the short term.\n\n===Kuwaiti algorithm===\n{{main|Tabular Islamic calendar#Kuwaiti algorithm}}\n[[Microsoft]] uses the \"Kuwaiti algorithm\", a variant of the tabular Islamic calendar,<ref>[http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/islam/islam_tabcal.htm#kuwait The \"Kuwaiti Algorithm\"] (Robert van Gent).</ref> to convert Gregorian dates to the Islamic ones. Microsoft claimed that the variant is based on a statistical analysis of historical data from [[Kuwait]], however it matches a known tabular calendar.\n\n== Notable dates ==\n{{main|Muslim holidays}}\nImportant dates in the Islamic (Hijri) year are:\n* 1 Muharram: [[Sunni]] [[Islamic New Year]].\n* 10 Muharram: [[Day of Ashura]]. For Sunnis, the crossing of the [[Red Sea]] by [[Islamic view of Moses|Moses]] occurred on this day. For both Shias and Sunnis, the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], the grandson of Muhammad, and his followers.\n* 12 Rabi al-Awwal: [[Mawlid]] or Birth of the Prophet for Sunnis.\n* 17 Rabi al-Awwal: [[Mawlid]] for Shias.\n* 27 Rajab: [[Isra and Mi'raj]] for the majority of Muslims.\n* 15 Sha'ban: [[Mid-Sha'ban]], or Night of Forgiveness. For Twelvers, also the birthday of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], the Twelfth Imam.\n* 1 Ramadan: [[Shia]] [[Islamic New Year]]. The first day of fasting.\n* 27 Ramadan: Nuzul al-Qur'an. The most probable day Muhammad received the first verses of the [[Quran]]. (17 Ramadan in Indonesia and Malaysia)\n* Last third of Ramadan which includes [[Laylat al-Qadr]].\n* 1 Shawwal: [[Eid ul-Fitr]].\n* 8\u201313 Dhu al-Hijjah: The [[Hajj]] to Mecca.\n* 9 Dhu al-Hijjah: [[Day of Arafa]].\n* 10 Dhu al-Hijjah: [[Eid al-Adha]].\n\nDays considered important predominantly for Shia Muslims:\n* 9 Rabi' al-Awwal: [[Eid-e-Shuja']] (Revenge taken by [[Mukhtar al-Thaqafi]]).\n* 13 Rajab: Birthday of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abi Talib]]\n* 3 Sha'ban: Birthday of [[Husayn ibn Ali]].\n* 21 Ramadan: Martyrdom of Ali ibn Abi Talib.\n\n== Converting Hijri to Gregorian date or vice versa ==\n[[File:Inscription of years by A.H.&A.D. eras.jpg|thumb|250px|Civil and Hijri establishment dates of a library in Old City, Jerusalem]]\nConversions may be made by using the [[Tabular Islamic calendar]], or, for greatest accuracy (one day in 15,186 years), via the Jewish calendar. Theoretically, the days of the months correspond in both calendars if the displacements which are a feature of the Jewish system are ignored. The table below gives, for nineteen years, the Muslim month which corresponds to the first Jewish month.\n\n{| style=\"border:none;\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|- style=\"vertical-align:top;\"\n|style=\"padding-right:1.0em;\"|\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

When it goes above twelve, subtract twelve and add one to the year AH. From 412 AD/CE to 632 AD/CE inclusive the month number is 1 and the calculation gives the month correct to a month or so. 622 AD/CE corresponds to BH 1 and AH 1. For earlier years, year BH = (623 or 622) \u2013 year AD/CE).\n\nAn example calculation: What is the civil date and year AH of the first day of the first month in the year 20875 AD/CE?\n\nWe first find the Muslim month number corresponding to the first month of the Jewish year which begins in 20874 AD/CE. Dividing 20874 by 19 gives quotient 1098 and remainder 12. Dividing 2026 by 19 gives quotient 106 and remainder 12. 2026 is chosen because it gives the same remainder on division by 19 as 20874. The two years are therefore (1098\u2013106)=992\u00d719 years apart. The Muslim month number corresponding to the first Jewish month is therefore 992\u00d77=6944 higher than in 2026. To convert into years and months divide by twelve \u2013 6944/12=578 years and 8 months. Adding, we get 1447y 10m + 20874y \u2013 2026y + 578y 8m = 20874y 6m. Therefore, the first month of the Jewish year beginning in 20874 AD/CE corresponds to the sixth month of the Muslim year AH 20874. The worked example in [[Hebrew calendar#Conversion between Jewish and civil calendars|Conversion between Jewish and civil dates]], shows that the civil date of the first day of this month (ignoring the displacements) is Friday, 14 June. The year AH 20875 will therefore begin seven months later, on the first day of the eighth Jewish month, which the worked example shows to be 7 January, 20875 AD/CE (again ignoring the displacements). The date given by this method, being calculated, may differ by a day from the actual date, which is determined by observation.\n\nA reading of the section which follows will show that the year AH 20875 is wholly contained within the year 20875 AD/CE, also that in the Gregorian calendar this correspondence will occur one year earlier. The reason for the discrepancy is that the Gregorian year (like the Julian, though less so) is slightly too long, so the Gregorian date for a given AH date will be earlier and the Muslim calendar catches up sooner.\n<!----Mean civil year = 365d 05h 48m 48s (Milankovic), synodic month = 29d 12h 44 1/18m, hence mean calendar year = 354d 08h 48 12/18m.---->\n\n===Current correlations===\nAn Islamic year will be entirely within a Gregorian year of the same number in the year 20874, after which year the number of the Islamic year will always be greater than the number of the concurrent civil year. The Islamic calendar year of 1429 occurred entirely within the civil calendar year of 2008. Such years occur once every 33 or 34 Islamic years (32 or 33 civil years).

Once every 33 or 34 Hijri years, or once every 32 or 33 civil years, the beginning of a Hijri year (1 Muharram) coincides with one of the first ten days of January. Subsequent Hijri New Years move backward through the civil year back to the beginning of January again, passing through each civil month from December to January.\n\n== Uses ==\nThe Islamic calendar is now used primarily for religious purposes, and for official dating of public events and documents in Muslim countries. Because of its nature as a purely lunar calendar, it cannot be used for agricultural purposes and historically Islamic communities have used other calendars for this purpose: the [[Egyptian calendar]] was formerly widespread in Islamic countries, and the [[Iranian calendars|Iranian calendar]] and the 1789 [[Rumi calendar|Ottoman calendar]] (a modified [[Julian calendar]]) were also used for agriculture in their countries.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the [[Levant]] and [[Iraq]] the [[Aramaic]] names of the [[Babylonian calendar]] are still used for all secular matters.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} In the [[Maghreb]], Berber farmers in the countryside still use the Julian calendar for agrarian purposes.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |last1=Gast |first1=M. |last2=Delheur |first2=J. |last3=E.B. |title=Calendrier |url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2039 |website=Encyclop\u00e9die Berb\u00e8re, 11 (Bracelets \u2013 Caprarienses) |publisher=OpenEdition |accessdate=5 July 2018 |language=fr}}</ref> These local solar calendars have receded in importance with the near-universal adoption of the Gregorian calendar for civil purposes.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The Saudi Arabia uses the lunar Islamic calendar.<ref>the start of each lunar month determined not ahead of time by astronomical calculation, but only after the crescent moon is sighted by the proper religious authorities.

Countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a [[firearms license|license]] for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for [[hunting]], [[Shooting sport|sport shooting]] ({{a.k.a.}} target shooting), [[self-defense]], collecting, and [[concealed carry]], with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\n\nGun laws are often enacted with the intention of reducing the use of small arms in criminal activity, specifying weapons perceived as being capable of inflicting the greatest damage and those most-easily concealed, such as [[handgun]]s and other short-barreled weapons. Persons restricted from legal access to firearms may include those below a certain age or having a criminal record. Firearm licenses may be denied to those felt most at risk of harming themselves or others, such as persons with a history of [[domestic violence]], alcoholism or substance abuse, mental illness, depression, or attempted suicide. Those applying for a firearm license may have to demonstrate competence by completing a [[Gun safety|gun-safety]] course and show provision for a [[gun safe|secure location]] to store weapons.\n\nThe legislation which restricts small arms may also restrict other weapons, such as explosives, crossbows, swords, [[electroshock weapon]]s, air guns, and pepper spray. It may also restrict firearm accessories, notably [[high-capacity magazine]]s and [[Suppressor|sound suppressors]].

Typically in shall-issue countries, in order to deny license, authorities must prove that someone has violated legal conditions. \n* may-issue licensing: In countries with may-issue licensing laws (e.g. [[Gun law in India|India]], [[Firearms regulation in South Africa|South Africa]], and Thailand), authorities have discretion at determining whether a person may obtain firearms. In some countries only very limited groups of people can own them (e.g. [[Gun control in China|China]], Japan, Myanmar). \n* prohibition: In few countries, including Cambodia, Eritrea, and Solomon Islands, ownership of firearms is completely prohibited.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\nThis section use the expressions ''shall issue'' and ''may issue'' which are partly specific to and defined by US system of firearm regulations.\n\n[[File:Gun laws.svg|thumb|center|850px|'''Possession of firearms by private citizens''' (''note: this map deals with possession only, not carry of firearms''):\n{{Legend|#0000ff|'''No permit required''' \u2013 permits or licenses are not required to obtain and possess firearms}}\n{{Legend|#008080ff|'''Partially licensed''' \u2013 permit required to obtain and possess for handguns, but not for certain types of shotguns and rifles}}\n{{Legend|#00ff00|'''[[Shall issue]]''' \u2013 subject to fulfillment of legal conditions, the authorities may not deny license to possess firearm(s)}}\n{{Legend|#ffff00|'''[[May issue]]''' \u2013 the authorities have final say in whether a person may obtain a license to possess firearm(s)}}\n{{Legend|#ff6600|'''May issue \u2013 restricted''' \u2013 although the law provides for possibility of obtaining licence/permit necessary to possess a firearm, in reality they are unobtainable to average citizens}}\n{{Legend|#ff3a3a|'''No-issue''' \u2013 citizens cannot legally possess firearms}}]]\n\n{{Gun laws table}}\n\n\n<!--This is a blank row - copy and paste in alphabetical order above-->\n\n==Africa==\nThe [[Bamako Convention|Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons]] was adopted in [[Bamako, Mali]], on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the 51 member states of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Juma|editor-first=Monica Kathina|title=Compendium of Key Documents Relating to Peace and Security in Africa|series=Series on peace and conflict in Africa|year=2006|publisher=Pretoria University Law Press|location=Pretoria|isbn=9780958509732|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjtcCyGjm1wC&dq|page=39|ref={{harvid|Juma|2006}}}}</ref> The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries.<ref>{{cite book| last = Parker | first = Sarah | chapter = Balancing Acts: Regulation of Civilian Firearm Possession | title = Small Arms Survey 2011: States of Security |editor1-first = Eric G. | editor1-last = Berman | editor2-first = Keith | editor2-last = Krause | editor3-first = Emile | editor3-last = LeBrun|editor4-first = Glenn | editor4-last = McDonald | display-editors = 1 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011 | location = Cambridge | isbn = 9780521146869 | chapterurl = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2011/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2011-Chapter-09-EN.pdf | url = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/yearbook/small-arms-survey-2011.html|page=4 | ref = {{harvid|Parker|2011}}}}</ref>\n\n===Botswana===\nBotswana's law allows possession of shotguns and rifles only.

To own a firearm in Argentina, one must be a legitimate user. Applicants must: be 21 years of age or older, provide a medical certificate that certifies they are physically and mentally fit, complete a safety course, provide a legitimate means of income, and undergo and pass a background check. A successful applicant is fingerprinted and issued a license which has to be renewed every five years. One may not legally fire a firearm in Argentina if they are not a legitimate user, even if that gun belongs to someone else. Once a legitimate user wants to purchase a firearm, they must provide a secure location to store the firearm(s), and give an acceptable reason for wanting a firearm \u2013 such as collecting, target shooting, hunting, business, or self-defense in the home.<ref>{{cite web|title=ANMaC|url=http://www.jus.gob.ar/tramites-y-servicios/armas/credencial-de-legitimo-usuario.aspx|website=ANMaC|accessdate=25 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627043916/http://www.jus.gob.ar/tramites-y-servicios/armas/credencial-de-legitimo-usuario.aspx|archive-date=27 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFirearms must be purchased through a licensed dealer and registered with ANMaC.

These guns require ATTs, so can only be discharged at ranges.\n# Prohibited: These weapons generally cannot be possessed by civilians, and include fully automatic weapons and many military arms, and handguns with barrel length equal to or shorter than 4.1&nbsp;inches (105&nbsp;mm), and those chambered for [[.25 ACP|.25]] and [[.32 ACP|.32]] cartridges.

Civilian gun ownership is allowed by law but discouraged by authorities, with regular press statements and campaigns denouncing the dangers of possessing firearms.\n\nPolice-issued firearm permits require applicants to be 18 years of age, provide a mental health certificate issued by a psychiatrist, have a clean criminal record with no domestic violence accusations, and pass a written test on firearm safety and knowledge. Final approval lies in a district police commander, who can deny the permit in \"justified cases\" not detailed by the law. There are five types of permits:\n* A defense permit allowing ownership of 2 firearms which must remain at the declared address.\n* A hunting permit requiring a hunting license, and allowing up to 6 firearms.\n* A sporting permit requiring membership in a registered gun club, and also allowing up to 6 firearms. It is possible for those under 18 years of age to obtain this permit.\n* A collection permit allows an unlimited number of firearms to be owned, and does allow the holder to possess ammunition.\n\nEach of these permits has limits on types of firearms used, and allows for a police-issued permit to buy a specified quantity of appropriate ammunition from a specific gun shop. Transport permits are required to take firearms from the permit-holder's residence to a specified shooting range or hunting ground, and are valid for two years. Transported firearms must be unloaded and not attached to the body.\n\nA self-defense permit allows carrying a firearm for protection against specific human threats. Such permits are valid for one year, but as the police commander can deny applications without stating a reason, they are very rarely issued. Automatic firearms are forbidden for civilian use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gu\u00eda legal sobre:  Control de Armas |url=https://www.bcn.cl/leyfacil/recurso/control-de-armas |website=Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |accessdate=22 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Colombia===\nArticle 3 of Colombia's firearm law states that civilians may possess firearms only via permit issued at discretion of the competent authority<ref name=com/>.\n\nIn 1993, Colombia legislated gun ownership, effectively establishing a government licensing monopoly.

Weapons fall into different categories, which come with different restrictions:\n\nCategory A, or forbidden weapons, include weapons disguised as other objects, firearms which can be disassembled in a faster than usual fashion for hunting and sport, shotguns with an overall length of less than 90 cm (35 in) or barrel length shorter than 45 cm (18 in), [[pump action]] shotguns, suppressors and firearms with suppressors, knuckledusters, blackjacks, steel rods, and all \"war material\", which includes, among other things: tanks, fully automatic weapons, armor-piercing weapons and some military semi-automatic rifles. Category B covers all handguns, repeating shotguns and semi-automatic weapons which are not category A (e.g. pistols, revolvers, semi-automatic rifles, and semi-automatic shotguns). Category C includes all firearms with rifled barrels that are not category A or B (e.g. repeating rifles, break-action rifles). Category D consists of all firearms with smooth-bore barrels which are not category A or B (E.g. break-action shotguns).\n\nAll firearms of category A, B, C and D are registered in the central weapon register (Zentrales Waffenregister, or short ZWR). Firearms in categories C and D are the least restricted; all citizens over 18 may purchase them at licensed sellers, even without a firearms license (barring a 3-day waiting period to check for a weapon ban on the buyer). Category B weapons have further restrictions; buyers must have a firearms license, and be 21, unless granted an exception.

Austrian law makes no distinction between concealed or open carry; with a carry permit, the holder may carry their weapon(s) freely throughout the whole country and even in certain \"gun free zones\".<ref>https://www.meinbezirk.at/wieden/c-lokales/waffen-in-wien-10235-personen-duerfen-eine-pistole-tragen_a1681292</ref><ref>https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/PR/JAHR_2018/PK0832/</ref>\n\n====Croatia====\nCroatia issues firearms permits for self-defense, hunting, sport shooting:\n* Hunting permits require a certificate indicating successfully passing the hunting exam;\n* Sporting permits require a certificate issued by a target shooting organization on active membership;\n* Self-defense permits require a certificate on capability to hold, carry and properly use weapons, issued by a competent authority of the Ministry of the Interior designated by the Minister of the Interior.\nEvery permit also requires an applicant to be at least 18 years old, not be convicted of crimes, there being no other circumstances indicating that the weapon may be abused (for example by a history of alcoholism) and passing medical examinations.\n\nThere are 266,885 (or 6.4 per 100 people) registered firearms in Croatia owned by 103,903 people, of which 132,131 can be carried concealed in public places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glas-slavonije.hr/358554/1/Vise-od-104000-hrvatskih-gradjana-ima-legalno-oruzje|title=Vi\u0161e od 104.000 hrvatskih gra\u0111ana ima legalno oru\u017eje|date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cyprus====\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nThe [[Republic of Cyprus]] has strict gun control. Private citizens are completely forbidden from owning handguns and rifles in any calibre, including .22 [[rimfire ammunition]]. Shotguns limited to two rounds are allowed with a license, issued by provincial police. Shotguns must be for hunting purposes, and a licensed citizen may own up to ten shotguns, typically [[Double-barreled shotgun|double-barrelled]]. A firearm license is required to buy ammunition, of up to 250 shells per purchase, with sales being recorded. Cyprus also controls [[airgun]]s, and airgun owners require a license. Even though purchasing automatic weapons is illegal, the military issues their reserves an automatic weapon, therefore the majority of the male population has one due to military [[conscription]].<ref name=\"Grupp, Larry 2011\">Grupp, Larry (2011). The Worldwide Gun Owner's Guide. Scottsdale, Arizona: Bloomfield Press, 365pp.</ref>\n\n====Czech Republic====\n{{Main|Gun laws in the Czech Republic}}\nThe Czech Republic is unusual in comparison to other EU countries in that the vast majority of gun owners (240,000 out of 300,000) possess their firearms for purposes of protection of life and property. Furthermore, Czech Republic has a [[shall-issue]] [[concealed carry]] permit system, whereby every self-defense license holder may carry up to two concealed firearms ready for immediate use (bullet-in-chamber). The Czech Republic had a higher rate of concealed carry licenses per capita than the US up to 2010, despite a relatively lower gun-ownership rate.\n\nGun licenses may be obtained by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Although the general firearms ownership rate remains relatively low, the ability to legally possess and carry firearms is generally considered as a symbol of liberty, alongside concepts such as freedom of speech and free elections. This is illustrated by the Czech Republic's historical experience of firearm bans that happened only under Nazi and Communist dictatorships (and lately also under the [[Eu gun ban|EU Gun Ban]]).\n\nCrime with legally owned firearms is rare, with 45 recorded incidents in 2016, 17 of which were \"dangerous threats\" (compared to the total number of over 800,000 legally possessed firearms). Gun laws had not been an issue until the 2016 EU Directive (see [[#European Union|above]]), which led to the proposal of securing Czech citizens' gun rights through adoption of a constitutional amendment that would make firearm possession in the country a national security issue, thus taking it outside the scope of EU law. However, this provision was not approved by the Senate in the Czech Parliament. The Czech government filed a lawsuit to the European Court of Justice against the EU directive restricting possession of firearms.<ref>[https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-republic-takes-legal-action-over-eu-firearms-directive CZECH REPUBLIC TAKES LEGAL ACTION OVER EU FIREARMS DIRECTIVE]</ref> In October 2017 a petition against the EU Gun Ban signed by over 100.000 citizens was debated during a public hearing in the Senate.\n\nIn February 2018, the Ministry of the Interior proposed an amendment to the current ''Weapons and ammunition law'' to comply with the EU directive. The process of approving the law was suspended in Parliament until a decision by the European Court of Justice was made. Meanwhile, in January 2019, the Ministry of the Interior unveiled a draft proposal for a completely new Firearms Act that would comply with the requirements of the EU directive while respecting the tradition of civilian firearm ownership in the country.<ref>[https://zbrojnice.com/2019/01/14/navrh-noveho-zakona-o-zbranich-i-implementace-zasobniky-tlumice-a-expanzni-strely/ New Weapons law proposal: implementation, magazines, suppressors and expanding bullets.] (in Czech)</ref>\n\n====Denmark====\nCivilians in [[Denmark]] aged 16 and above can acquire gun licenses for hunting or sport shooting. This requires passing a written multiple-choice test and a practical test, after which a certified hunting license instructor determines if the applicant is suitable to own a weapon. A license is usually provided if the applicant has no or only minor marks on their criminal record.\n\nA hunting license permits the over-the-counter-purchase and ownership of an unlimited number of shotguns of up to 12 gauge and 2-round capacity. From there, the police has to be notified of new weapon purchases through an online form. Bolt-action rifles can also be bought over-the-counter, although they require a rifle license which is obtained through the police. The allowed calibers range from the smallest possible, up to [[.50 BMG]], with .50 BMG not included. Semi-automatic rifles are allowed if the rifle is limited to 2 rounds (hunting in Denmark), or without limitation on capacity (hunting outside of Denmark). Currently, only larger calibers (.308, 6,5x55, .300wm etc.) are issued as semi-auto rifles for hunting abroad. .223/5.56x45 and similar caliber rifles are generally not approved.\nThe hunter must pass a shotgun or rifle shooting test before being allowed to hunt.\n\nFor sport-shooting purposes, shotguns can also be used, as can [[bolt-action rifle]]s of almost any caliber (.50bmg as one of the exceptions). Sporting rifles are often chambered in 22lr and 6.5 x 55&nbsp;mm.\nSemi-automatic rifles are not allowed for sports shooting.\n\nHandguns: After two years of active membership in a shooting club, one can apply for a handgun permit which is then subject to background checks and approval by the police, and one has to be 21 years old.\nApproved calibers: All calibers under 9mm (9x19, 38 Spl, 357 magnum, .32acp etc.), plus a limited number of larger calibers; .40sw, 45 ACP, 44 Spl.\nThe maximum number of handguns are 6 in 22 cal.\nWhen applying for gun number 3, a special permit from the department of justice is required. Large caliber guns, i.e. bigger than 22 cal, are restricted to a maximum of 2 in the same caliber. Therefore, one can only own 2 handguns in 9&nbsp;mm at any given time. However, it is legal to own an additional 2 handguns in 9&nbsp;mm, if these are revolvers.\nFor all handguns, the overall length must be at least 210 millimeters (8.2677 inch), regardless of caliber, measured without orthopedic grips or removal parts.\n\nA weapon permit for sporting purposes (both long and short firearms) has to be renewed every 5 years. Rifle permits for hunting rifles have to be renewed every 10 years. Shotguns are not held on individual permits; holders are allowed to own these as long as they have a valid hunting license \u2013 and they can keep it for up to 10 years after the hunting license expires \u2013 albeit they are not allowed to keep ammunition without a valid license.\n\nCarrying a firearm in public is strictly prohibited, however, a notion of proportional self-defense exists. This means that if someone is attacked with a firearm, they are legally allowed to defend themselves proportionally \u2013 e.g. with a firearm of their own.\n\nFully automatic weapons are prohibited for civilian use, unless a special permit is issued by the Ministry of Justice. These permits are extremely rare, and are normally only issued to people or companies working for, or supplying the Police or Military.\n\nIllegal possession of a firearm may be punished with imprisonment of no less than one year. Civilians may keep privately owned weapons including pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles at their residences.<ref>https://www.politi.dk/da/borgerservice/vaabentilladelse/blankvaaben.htm</ref> These, together with its ammunition have to be stored in an approved gun cabinet (EN1143-1 grade 0 or better).<ref>https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=158805  \u00a722</ref> The police may inspect a shooting club's weapons at their discretion, but require a court order to inspect privately held firearms.<ref>[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/arbejdsomr%C3%A5der/v%C3%A5ben/lovgivning Ministry of Justice \u2013 Weapons]{{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Finland}}\nThe ownership and use of firearms in Finland is regulated by the country's Firearms Act of 1998. Weapons are individually licensed by local police, with no limit on the number of licenses an individual may hold. Licenses are granted for recreational uses, exhibition or (under certain circumstances) professional use. No type of weapon is explicitly prohibited, but licenses are granted only for a reason. Self-defense is not accepted as a valid reason for licensing. In general, this excludes all but hunting and sports guns from non-professional use. Fully automatic weapons are generally not permitted. With the exception of law enforcement, only specially trained security guards may carry loaded weapons in public.\n\nIn 2007, Finland had the third largest gun-ownership rate globally (behind the US and Yemen),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Nick |title=Finland school shooting: Gunman planned massacre for six years |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/finland/3071235/Finland-school-shooting-Gunman-planned-massacre-for-six-years.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> and the first in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vote to tighten Europe gun laws |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7117042.stm |website=BBC |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> Finns are avid hunters, and as of 2007, there were 1.6 million registered weapons and 650,000 people with firearm permits in the country, i.e. 12% of the population.

The possibility of creating a dual-license for an already licensed weapon with permission of the license holder was allowed (e.g. parental permission).

In September 2015, firearms were divided into four categories that determine the regulations that apply to their possession and use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N287|title=Armes|trans-title=Arms|access-date=2016-09-06|language=fr|publisher=Direction de l'information l\u00e9gale et administrative}}</ref> Category C firearms can be obtained with a hunting license, or sport-shooting license with a medical certificate. Category C includes mainly single-shot-per-barrel shotguns and single-shot or manual repeating rifles (including [[Centerfire ammunition|centre-fire]] rifles, for hunting or target shooting). Once legally purchased these category C arms may be kept, without using them, even when no longer licensed for hunting or sport-shooting.\n\nCategory B firearms are only available to sport-shooters licensed for at least 6 months, with a medical certificate, without any felony convictions, and additionally requires at least three shooting sessions with an instructor. Specific authorisations for purchase and possession may then be sought from a local police administration, are valid for 5 years, and are renewable. Such weapons may then only be used for sport-shooting at shooting ranges, never for hunting. Category B includes all assault type rifles, such as [[AK-47]]/AKM, AK-74 or AR-15/M16/M4, and any look-alike weapons even when chambered for [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire cartridges]] (.22 LR). These must be semi-automatic only. All handguns, including those using rimfire ammunition, are classed as category B. It is illegal to possess these category B weapons after expiry of a non-renewed specific authorisation: the arms must be disposed of (sold to a gun shop or else destroyed, for example).\n\nAir-guns including pistols are freely available to adults, as category D arms, provided that their energy level does not exceed 20 J (previously 10 J).{{clarify|date=November 2019}} Typical energy levels are 6 J for a target pistol and 7.5 J for a target rifle. A scoped Field Target rifle might produce 15 or 16 J (maximum authorised in FT competition). Air-soft arms, firing non-metallic pellets and not exceeding 2 J energy, are considered to be toys, rather than weapons, and so are excluded from firearm regulations.\n\nAlso freely available are category D defensive pepper sprays up to a maximum 75 g capacity. Bigger capacity sprays are considered offensive weapons, not defensive, and so are classed in category B, and require specific authorisation.\n\nA person cannot own more than 12 centerfire firearms, and cannot own more than 10 magazines and 1,000 rounds of ammunition per firearm. A one-year carry license may be issued for persons \"exposed to exceptional risks to their life\" allowing them to carry a handgun with a maximum of 50 rounds. Such authorizations are extremely rare, however, as the state would normally insist on providing police protection in such cases. Since November 2015, police officers are authorised to carry their service weapons whilst off-duty.\n\n====Germany====\n{{Main|Gun legislation in Germany}}\nGun ownership in Germany is restrictive, being regulated by the Federal Weapons Act (German: Waffengesetz) of 1972.<ref>{{cite web|work=International Firearms Injury Prevention & Policy|url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/germany |title=Germany \u2013 Gun Facts, Figures and the Law|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>\nThe laws apply to weapons with a fire energy exceeding {{convert|7.5|J|ftlbf}}. A firearms license may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, who are deemed reliable and can justify a reason for owning a firearm. A separate license is required for each firearm owned. Target-shooters must have been a member of a shooting club with 18 recorded visits in the previous 12 months. A firearms carry permit is a second-tier license which allows concealed carrying in public, and is only issued to those with a particular need.\n\nSeveral weapons and special ammunitions are completely prohibited, such as automatic firearms. Buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and the trading of these weapons is illegal and punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the weapon and a fine of up to [[Euro|\u20ac]]10,000. Using an illegal weapon for crimes of any kind is punishable by 1 to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nGermany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms legally owned by 1.4 million people.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/28/new-german-firearms-registry-shows-55-million-guns-legally-owned-in-country/ |title=New German firearms registry shows 5.5 millions guns legally owned in country|publisher=Associated Press/Fox News |accessdate=28 December 2012 |date=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Greece====\n[[Greece]] has gun regulations in place. Shotguns (limited to a 3-round capacity), rifles and handguns require a license issued by Police Headquarters. A license may be issued to a Greek citizen over the age of 18 if: a) there are serious fears about his or her personal security along with a positive recommendation by the Prosecutor and b) it is required for the safety of shops, banks, other financial institutions, etc. To purchase handguns and rifles, citizens must either have a concealed-carry permit or a target-shooting permit (for rifles). Semi auto rifles are prohibited. Hunters can own up to 10 shotguns and rifles (with no gun barrel rifling) and sport shooters can own up to 7 guns. There is no license-check or record kept for ammunition purchases for shotguns but target shooters can only own 500 rounds per weapon.<ref>https://www.e-nomothesia.gr/kat-opla-ekrektika-puromakhika/n-3944-2011.html</ref>\n\n====Hungary====\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nGun laws in [[Hungary]] are relatively strict, regulated by Code 24/2004,<ref>{{cite web|author=Complex Kiad\u00f3 Kft. |url=http://www.complex.hu/jr/gen/hjegy_doc.cgi?docid=A0400024.TV#lbj9param |title=Hungarian gun law, 24/2004 (Hungarian) |publisher=Complex.hu |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref> governmental decision [https://net.jogtar.hu/jogszabaly?docid=A0400253.KOR&celpara= 253/2004.

A firearms license may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, and have passed a basic firearms theory/practical examination. Three categories of firearms ownership are allowed: Hunting (Firearms restricted to bolt action and double barrel shootguns), Sports shooting (only restriction is no fully automatic firearms), Self defence (Special permission from Police, very rarely granted in special cases eg: gunshop owners). Sports shooting has in recent years gained popularity with the number of sports category licenses being issued steadily climbing. Government initiatives to popularize shooting sports such as building shooting ranges and introducing shooting as a sport in the schooling system has slowly begun. It is generally excepted that obtaining (and keeping) a firearms permit is a slow and somewhat costly process, but once a permit is granted and the necessary yearly memberships are paid, yearly doctors certificates are obtained and the mandatory 2-3 sporting events are attended (for sports shooter) ownership is fairly liberal as to the type of firearm one can own.  \n\nIn 2010, there were 129,000 registered gun owners (1.3% of the population) in Hungary with 235,000 firearms. The majority of these were hunting rifles. Gun violence is very rare in Hungary due to the close monitoring and control of firearms ownership, crime with firearms are very rare and this statistic usually includes crimes committed with non-lethal \"pepper spray\" guns. Police use lethal force with a firearm less than 10 times per year, on average.<ref>{{cite web|author=F\u00fcggetlen H\u00edr\u00fcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/04/17/fegyverbe_magyar/ |title=Fegyverbe magyar? |publisher=Index.hu |date=2011-04-17 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>\n\n====Ireland====\n{{Main| Firearms legislation in Ireland}}\nGun laws in Ireland are strict, requiring all firearms to be licensed individually through the [[Garda\u00ed]] (police).

A shooting sports license permits transporting unloaded firearms and firing them in designated shooting ranges. A hunting license allows holders to engage in hunting with firearms. A concealed carry license permits a person to carry a loaded firearm in public, and requires proving a \"valid reason\" to do so (e.g.: a security guard or a jeweler at risk of robbery). The number of firearms an individual may own and retain in their home is limited to three common handguns, twelve sporting handguns or long guns, an unlimited number of hunting long guns, and eight historical firearms (manufactured before 1890). These limits can be exceeded with a collector license.\n\nPrivate firearms must be registered at the local police department within 72 hours of acquisition. Ammunition purchases must also be registered, and possession is normally limited to 200 rounds of handgun ammunition and 1500 rounds of hunting ammunition.\n\n====Lithuania====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Lithuania}}\n\n====Luxembourg====\n\nIn [[Luxembourg]], anyone wishing to purchase, possess or use a firearm must hold a permit issued by the Minister of Justice in person.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/loisirs-benevolat/permis-licences/detention-armes/autorisation-armes.html|title=Applying for a weapons licence|last=Arms|last2=Service 13|first2=Security|website=guichet.public.lu|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23|last3=to 11.30|first3=rue Erasme L.-1468 Luxembourg Luxembourg Phone :247- 84514 / 84523 / 84054 Fax :22 05 19 Mon-Fri from 8 30|last4=Arms|first4=security service Path to|last5=map|first5=security service Show on}}</ref>\n\nThe most common reasons for applying for a permit are hunting, recreational shooting, weapons collecting, and inheriting a firearm.

After successfully completing every step one will get license.\n\nThere are 102,610 registered firearms (or 22 per 100 people), including  56,000 shotguns, 10,553 pistols, 7,856 rifles, 5,369 revolvers, 501 machine guns, 477 sub-machine guns, 633 combat shotguns, 22 cannons, 7 humane killers and 2 rocket launchers.\n\nLaw allow carrying firearms while hunting, with 10,544 licensed to do so on land and 247 on sea<ref name=malta/>. Carrying loaded firearms outside of hunting grounds or shooting range is illegal. Automatic firearms are allowed only if they were produced before 1946.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], gun ownership is restricted to law enforcement, hunters, and target shooters (self-defense is not a valid reason to own firearms). A hunting license requires passing a hunters safety course. To own a gun for target shooting, the applicant must have been a member of a shooting club for a year. People with felonies, drug addictions, and mental illnesses may not possess firearms.\n\nOnce obtained, firearms must be stored in a safe and annually inspected by police. Firearms may only be used in self-defense as a matter of \"equal force\". Fully automatic firearms are banned, but there are otherwise few restrictions: semi-automatics, handguns, and magazines of all sizes are legal, as are all types of ammunition. A licensed gun owner may only have five firearms registered to his or her license at one time.<ref>[https://www.rnw.org/archive/gun-laws-netherlands Radio Netherlands Worldwide]</ref>\n\n====Poland====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Poland}}\nGun ownership in [[Poland]] is regulated and requires a permit to own or possess firearms. Permits are granted for specific purposes, such as self-defense, sports, hunting, collecting etc. and are shall issue except the ones for self-defense, which are may issue. Institutional permits allow for firearm ownership by security companies, shooting ranges, sports clubs etc.\n\nPermits are issued to permanent residents over 21, not addicted to alcohol or other substances, having no criminal record, being in good physical and mental health, who passed an exam before sporting association, hunting association or the police. Permits specify the purposes, categories and quantities of allowed guns; categories depend on permit type while quantities are assigned at the discretion of the police, based on documentation provided. Quantities can be increased when one uses up all available slots.\n\nCarrying loaded guns is allowed on self-defense and sports permits. Guns shall be carried concealed in a holster close to the body. Carrying is limited in public transport only to self-defense permit holders. It is prohibited to carry while intoxicated, and when attending public gatherings or mass events.\n\nAll legal owners are allowed to use their guns at registered shooting ranges. Discharging a firearm for training or leisure out of a registered shooting range (even on a large private property) is prohibited.\n\nFull-auto or select-fire firearms are permitted only on institutional and training permits. Since 2020 police can issue permit for firearms with silencers for hunting permits. They can only be used for sanitary shootings. See [[Gun laws in Poland#Sound suppressors|main article]] for more details. Armor-piercing, incendiary, tracer and other special ammunition is banned. Only valid permit holders are allowed to buy or possess live ammunition, and only of the types exactly matching the guns they legally own. The quantity of matching ammunition in possession is not limited. Hunters, collectors and sports shooters are allowed to manufacture (reload) ammunition, but strictly for their own use. There are further limits regarding allowed types and calibers depending on the type of permit - see main article for details. There's no limit on magazine capacity, except when hunting.\n\nReplicas of black powder firearms designed before 1885 require no permit to own. However, separate bill of law allows businesses to sell black powder to licensed customers only. This is often circumvented by obtaining a European Gun Card for your black powder firearm, asking a licensed colleague (there's no restriction on private sale or just giving out of black powder) or by buying powder in neighboring countries, mostly the Czech Republic.\n\nAirguns up to 17 Joules of muzzle energy are unregulated, others need to be registered with the police, but no permit is required.\n\nDespite quite liberal regulations, Poland remains the most disarmed country in Europe.\n\n====Romania====\nGun ownership in [[Romania]] is regulated by [http://legeaz.net/legea-295-2004-armelor-munitiilor/ Law 295/2004].

There are several categories of permits, with different requirements and rights, including hunting permits, self-defense permits, sports shooting permits and collectors permits. The only categories of people who are legally entitled to carry a weapon are owners of self-defense permits, magistrates, [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], military forces and certain categories of diplomats. A [[psychological evaluation]] is required beforehand in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, knives and daggers may in certain conditions (blade longer than 15&nbsp;cm and at least 0.4&nbsp;cm in width, double edge along the whole blade, etc.) be considered weapons and have a similar regime to those of firearms.\n\nIn order for a hunter to obtain a hunting/gun ownership license, he must spend a certain \"practice time\" with a professional hunter. To obtain a self-defense permit, one must be under witness protection. Sporting and collectors licenses require membership in a sport shooting club or collectors' association, respectively.\n\nThe amount of ammunition that can be owned is regulated by permit type. Sporting permits allow the ownership of 1000 matching cartridges per gun; hunting permits allow 300 matching cartridges per gun; self-defense permits allow 50 bullet cartridges and 50 blanks per gun; Collectors permits do not allow for private ownership of ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/monitorul-oficial-929-2015/legea-319-2015-modificarea-legii-295-2004-regim-arme-munitii | title=Legea 319 2015 | publisher=Legeaz.net |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\nExplosive weapons and ammunitions, fully automatic weapons, weapons camouflaged in the shape of another object, armor-piercing ammunition and lethal weapons that do not fit in any category defined by the law are prohibited.\n\nThe type of gun is also regulated by permit.

Gun permits are issued to applicants at least 18 years old, reliable, without criminal history and who has not been a [[conscientious objector]], who passes a medical exam and a test on firearm safety. A specific reason must be given for gun ownership: for hunting or target shooting, the applicant must provide proof of membership in a hunting or sports shooting organization; for collection, the applicant must arrange safe storage with a level of security dependent on the type of weapons; for self-defense, the applicant must prove a risk to personal safety to such an extent that a weapon is needed.\n\nAs in most EU member states, the ownership of Category A firearms is prohibited; however these can be owned by weapon collectors, providing that requirements are met. Firearms must be stored in a locked cabinet with ammunition stored separately. Concealed carry is allowed in special circumstances.

A firearm license may be obtained from the [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] after passing a police background check, a physiological and medical test, and a practical and theoretical exam. Shotgun and rifle licenses must be renewed after 5 years, subject to firearm inspection. Sporting licenses must be renewed after 3 years. Police may inspect firearms at any time. A self-defense and concealed carry license must be renewed every year, and is only available under special conditions.\n\nA license-holder may own up to 6 shotguns, and unlimited rifles. With a sporting license, valid for 3 years, 1 to 10 handguns may be owned, depending on sports-shooting level. Magazine capacity for semi-automatic centerfire rifles is limited to 4 rounds for sports shooting and 2 rounds for hunting; semi-automatic shotguns are limited to 3 rounds. Rimfire rifles, regardless of type have no magazine limit. Rifles chambered for certain cartridges with military origins are prohibited, such as .223/5.56 NATO and .50 BMG. The .308 Winchester and 7.62x39 mm (AK round) cartridges are only permitted in bolt-action, repetition or single-shot firearms. Proof of ownership of an approved safe is required for all centerfire rifles and handguns, and the owner is responsible for firearm thefts. Ammunition must be stored separately. Rifle and handgun ammunition may only be possessed for legally owned firearms, and purchases and possession is limited to 200 rounds rifle and 100 rounds for handguns. In addition, there are yearly limits in quantity (1000 for rifles,100 for handguns); however additional quantities can be petitioned, mainly for sporting use. For shotgun Ammunition, adults with a valid ID can purchase/possess up to 5,000 shells and there are no yearly limits in quantity. License-holders are only allowed to transport their unloaded firearms from their residence to the shooting range or hunting field and back, with no detours. Firearms may only be discharged at approved shooting ranges or hunting grounds (in season).\n\nThere are firearm license for private security for handguns and rifles. These cannot be used outside of work and must be stored in the workplace premises (with approved safe).\n\nIn addition there are handgun license for self-defense in concealed carry. However, this is granted on a \"may issue\" basis with several standards of necessity to be met and very few are granted. This license must be renewed annually and is not automatic.\n\nMembers of police forces and officers and non-commissioned officers of the armed forces have a special firearms license which encompasses all of the others.

Passing a hunting examination or membership in an approved sport shooting club for six months is required. Licenses for semi-automatic handguns are issued for five years and can be renewed, rifle and single-shot handgun licenses are valid for the owner's lifetime. License-holders may lend a weapon to a person at least 15 years of age for supervised use.\n\nA separate license is required for each particular firearm, caliber conversion kit or suppressor. There's no codified limit on the number of licenses a person can hold, but in practice a license-holder may own up to six hunting rifles, ten handguns, or a mix of eight rifles and handguns. Firearms must be stored in an approved safe. A firearm registered for hunting may be used for sport shooting, but not vice versa. Licenses obtained for hunting are implicitly limited to bolt-action or, more rarely, semi-automatic rifles that are \"applicable for hunting\", with no strict definition of the latter in the laws, which causes controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svenskjakt.se/start/nyhet/annu-ett-bakslag-for-polisen-i-tikka-malet/ | title=Polisen om Tikka-domen: En betydande r\u00e4ttsos\u00e4kerhet}}</ref>\n\nSelf-defense with firearms, as well as carry, is generally prohibited.

Countries which regulate access to firearms will typically restrict access to certain categories of firearms and then restrict the categories of persons who may be granted a [[firearms license|license]] for access to such firearms. There may be separate licenses for [[hunting]], [[Shooting sport|sport shooting]] ({{a.k.a.}} target shooting), [[self-defense]], collecting, and [[concealed carry]], with different sets of requirements, permissions, and responsibilities.\n\nGun laws are often enacted with the intention of reducing the use of small arms in criminal activity, specifying weapons perceived as being capable of inflicting the greatest damage and those most-easily concealed, such as [[handgun]]s and other short-barreled weapons. Persons restricted from legal access to firearms may include those below a certain age or having a criminal record. Firearm licenses may be denied to those felt most at risk of harming themselves or others, such as persons with a history of [[domestic violence]], alcoholism or substance abuse, mental illness, depression, or attempted suicide. Those applying for a firearm license may have to demonstrate competence by completing a [[Gun safety|gun-safety]] course and show provision for a [[gun safe|secure location]] to store weapons.\n\nThe legislation which restricts small arms may also restrict other weapons, such as explosives, crossbows, swords, [[electroshock weapon]]s, air guns, and pepper spray. It may also restrict firearm accessories, notably [[high-capacity magazine]]s and [[Suppressor|sound suppressors]]. There may be restrictions on the quantity or types of [[ammunition]] purchased, with certain types prohibited. Due to the global scope of this article, detailed coverage cannot be provided on all these matters; the article will instead attempt to briefly summarize each country's weapon laws in regard to small arms use and ownership by civilians.

Typically in shall-issue countries, in order to deny license, authorities must prove that someone has violated legal conditions. \n* may-issue licensing: In countries with may-issue licensing laws (e.g. [[Gun law in India|India]], [[Firearms regulation in South Africa|South Africa]], and Thailand), authorities have discretion at determining whether a person may obtain firearms. In some countries only very limited groups of people can own them (e.g. [[Gun control in China|China]], Japan, Myanmar). \n* prohibition: In few countries, including Cambodia, Eritrea, and Solomon Islands, ownership of firearms is completely prohibited.\n\n== Comparison ==\n\nThis section use the expressions ''shall issue'' and ''may issue'' which are partly specific to and defined by US system of firearm regulations.\n\n[[File:Gun laws.svg|thumb|center|850px|'''Possession of firearms by private citizens''' (''note: this map deals with possession only, not carry of firearms''):\n{{Legend|#0000ff|'''No permit required''' \u2013 permits or licenses are not required to obtain and possess firearms}}\n{{Legend|#008080ff|'''Partially licensed''' \u2013 permit required to obtain and possess for handguns, but not for certain types of shotguns and rifles}}\n{{Legend|#00ff00|'''[[Shall issue]]''' \u2013 subject to fulfillment of legal conditions, the authorities may not deny license to possess firearm(s)}}\n{{Legend|#ffff00|'''[[May issue]]''' \u2013 the authorities have final say in whether a person may obtain a license to possess firearm(s)}}\n{{Legend|#ff6600|'''May issue \u2013 restricted''' \u2013 although the law provides for possibility of obtaining licence/permit necessary to possess a firearm, in reality they are unobtainable to average citizens}}\n{{Legend|#ff3a3a|'''No-issue''' \u2013 citizens cannot legally possess firearms}}]]\n\n{{Gun laws table}}\n\n\n<!--This is a blank row - copy and paste in alphabetical order above-->\n\n==Africa==\nThe [[Bamako Convention|Bamako Declaration on an African Common Position on the Illicit Proliferation, Circulation and Trafficking of Small Arms and Light Weapons]] was adopted in [[Bamako, Mali]], on 1 December 2000 by the representatives of the 51 member states of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU).<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Juma|editor-first=Monica Kathina|title=Compendium of Key Documents Relating to Peace and Security in Africa|series=Series on peace and conflict in Africa|year=2006|publisher=Pretoria University Law Press|location=Pretoria|isbn=9780958509732|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjtcCyGjm1wC&dq|page=39|ref={{harvid|Juma|2006}}}}</ref> The provisions of this declaration recommend that the signatories would establish the illegal possession of small arms and light weapons as a criminal offence under national law in their respective countries.<ref>{{cite book| last = Parker | first = Sarah | chapter = Balancing Acts: Regulation of Civilian Firearm Possession | title = Small Arms Survey 2011: States of Security |editor1-first = Eric G. | editor1-last = Berman | editor2-first = Keith | editor2-last = Krause | editor3-first = Emile | editor3-last = LeBrun|editor4-first = Glenn | editor4-last = McDonald | display-editors = 1 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2011 | location = Cambridge | isbn = 9780521146869 | chapterurl = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2011/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2011-Chapter-09-EN.pdf | url = http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/publications/by-type/yearbook/small-arms-survey-2011.html|page=4 | ref = {{harvid|Parker|2011}}}}</ref>\n\n===Botswana===\nBotswana's law allows possession of shotguns and rifles only.

Applicants must: be 21 years of age or older, provide a medical certificate that certifies they are physically and mentally fit, complete a safety course, provide a legitimate means of income, and undergo and pass a background check. A successful applicant is fingerprinted and issued a license which has to be renewed every five years. One may not legally fire a firearm in Argentina if they are not a legitimate user, even if that gun belongs to someone else.

These guns require ATTs, so can only be discharged at ranges.\n# Prohibited: These weapons generally cannot be possessed by civilians, and include fully automatic weapons and many military arms, and handguns with barrel length equal to or shorter than 4.1&nbsp;inches (105&nbsp;mm), and those chambered for [[.25 ACP|.25]] and [[.32 ACP|.32]] cartridges.

Civilian gun ownership is allowed by law but discouraged by authorities, with regular press statements and campaigns denouncing the dangers of possessing firearms.\n\nPolice-issued firearm permits require applicants to be 18 years of age, provide a mental health certificate issued by a psychiatrist, have a clean criminal record with no domestic violence accusations, and pass a written test on firearm safety and knowledge. Final approval lies in a district police commander, who can deny the permit in \"justified cases\" not detailed by the law. There are five types of permits:\n* A defense permit allowing ownership of 2 firearms which must remain at the declared address.\n* A hunting permit requiring a hunting license, and allowing up to 6 firearms.\n* A sporting permit requiring membership in a registered gun club, and also allowing up to 6 firearms. It is possible for those under 18 years of age to obtain this permit.\n* A collection permit allows an unlimited number of firearms to be owned, and does allow the holder to possess ammunition.\n\nEach of these permits has limits on types of firearms used, and allows for a police-issued permit to buy a specified quantity of appropriate ammunition from a specific gun shop. Transport permits are required to take firearms from the permit-holder's residence to a specified shooting range or hunting ground, and are valid for two years. Transported firearms must be unloaded and not attached to the body.\n\nA self-defense permit allows carrying a firearm for protection against specific human threats. Such permits are valid for one year, but as the police commander can deny applications without stating a reason, they are very rarely issued. Automatic firearms are forbidden for civilian use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gu\u00eda legal sobre:  Control de Armas |url=https://www.bcn.cl/leyfacil/recurso/control-de-armas |website=Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile |accessdate=22 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Colombia===\nArticle 3 of Colombia's firearm law states that civilians may possess firearms only via permit issued at discretion of the competent authority<ref name=com/>.\n\nIn 1993, Colombia legislated gun ownership, effectively establishing a government licensing monopoly.

This UN protocol existing since 2005 tighten regulations on the manufacture and trafficking of small firearms, like handguns and pistols. This relies on three main legal measures: criminalizing illicit trafficking of firearms; authorizing or licensing legitimate manufacturers and vendors; and establishing marking and recording for tracing firearms.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/flash/fl_383_en.pdf</ref>\nMost, but not all, Member States have ratified the UN Firearms Protocol.\n\n====Opinions inside the EU====\nFew people own firearms in the EU. Those who own firearms are more against stricter regulation than those who do not own. Most of EU citizens believe the EU should address the issue of firearms, in cooperation with member states and neighborhood countries.\n\nMost EU citizens believe stricter regulation would help to reduce the perceived firearms-related crime while a sizeable minority would prefer other methods to be used.\nHarmonization of EU-wide common standards related to some aspects of the owning, buying and selling firearms, benefits of a strong support.<ref>http://ec.europa.eu/commfrontoffice/publicopinion/flash/fl_383_en.pdf</ref>\n\n====Austria====\n{{Main|Gun law in Austria}}\nIn [[Austria]] the ''Waffengesetz'' (Weapons Act) provides the legal terms for '''''all types''''' of weapons, including firearms.<ref>[https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=1000601 Gesamte Rechtsvorschrift f\u00fcr Waffengesetz 1996]</ref>\n\n\u00a7 1 of the law defines ''Weapons'' as objects that are designed to directly eliminate or reduce the ability of people to attack or defend themselves (e.g. knives, pepper spray, gas pistols, etc.) or for firing projectiles during hunting or sport shooting (e.g. crossbows, bows, etc.). \u00a7 2 further defines ''Firearms'' as weapons where projectiles can be fired from a barrel in a predefined direction. Weapons fall into different categories, which come with different restrictions:\n\nCategory A, or forbidden weapons, include weapons disguised as other objects, firearms which can be disassembled in a faster than usual fashion for hunting and sport, shotguns with an overall length of less than 90 cm (35 in) or barrel length shorter than 45 cm (18 in), [[pump action]] shotguns, suppressors and firearms with suppressors, knuckledusters, blackjacks, steel rods, and all \"war material\", which includes, among other things: tanks, fully automatic weapons, armor-piercing weapons and some military semi-automatic rifles. Category B covers all handguns, repeating shotguns and semi-automatic weapons which are not category A (e.g. pistols, revolvers, semi-automatic rifles, and semi-automatic shotguns). Category C includes all firearms with rifled barrels that are not category A or B (e.g. repeating rifles, break-action rifles). Category D consists of all firearms with smooth-bore barrels which are not category A or B (E.g. break-action shotguns).\n\nAll firearms of category A, B, C and D are registered in the central weapon register (Zentrales Waffenregister, or short ZWR). Firearms in categories C and D are the least restricted; all citizens over 18 may purchase them at licensed sellers, even without a firearms license (barring a 3-day waiting period to check for a weapon ban on the buyer). Category B weapons have further restrictions; buyers must have a firearms license, and be 21, unless granted an exception. Category A weapons typically require further exceptions to be granted for holders, except in the case of suppressed weapons, which may be held by those with valid hunting licenses. \"War material\" requires a further special federal permit, which is in practice only granted to approved collectors and experts.<ref>https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/NormDokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&Gesetzesnummer=10006016&FassungVom=2019-02-14&Artikel=&Paragraf=18&Anlage=&Uebergangsrecht=</ref> In general, ammunition sales are unrestricted, though handgun ammunition and some rifle ammunition requires a permit. Antique weapons made before 1871 also require no license or registration.\n\nIn addition, \u00a7 11a defines further restrictions on the purchase, possession and carrying of all weapons and ammunition for asylum seekers and many third-country nationals. Owning weapons without a permit is strictly prohibited and controlled by the police.<ref>https://www.heute.at/politik/news/story/Generelles-Waffenverbot-fuer-Auslaender-beschlossen-52346200</ref> However, holders must carry their weapons in a way that does not constitute a public nuisance; for example, openly displaying a handgun in one's belt at the movies would be considered unusual and could be considered a public nuisance if the police were called.<ref>https://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/ticker/Bewaffneter-Beamter-loeste-Grosseinsatz-in-Kino-aus;art449,2186488</ref>\n\nCarrying firearms in public generally requires a carry permit (or \"Waffenpass\"). Austrian law makes no distinction between concealed or open carry; with a carry permit, the holder may carry their weapon(s) freely throughout the whole country and even in certain \"gun free zones\".<ref>https://www.meinbezirk.at/wieden/c-lokales/waffen-in-wien-10235-personen-duerfen-eine-pistole-tragen_a1681292</ref><ref>https://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/PR/JAHR_2018/PK0832/</ref>\n\n====Croatia====\nCroatia issues firearms permits for self-defense, hunting, sport shooting:\n* Hunting permits require a certificate indicating successfully passing the hunting exam;\n* Sporting permits require a certificate issued by a target shooting organization on active membership;\n* Self-defense permits require a certificate on capability to hold, carry and properly use weapons, issued by a competent authority of the Ministry of the Interior designated by the Minister of the Interior.\nEvery permit also requires an applicant to be at least 18 years old, not be convicted of crimes, there being no other circumstances indicating that the weapon may be abused (for example by a history of alcoholism) and passing medical examinations.\n\nThere are 266,885 (or 6.4 per 100 people) registered firearms in Croatia owned by 103,903 people, of which 132,131 can be carried concealed in public places.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.glas-slavonije.hr/358554/1/Vise-od-104000-hrvatskih-gradjana-ima-legalno-oruzje|title=Vi\u0161e od 104.000 hrvatskih gra\u0111ana ima legalno oru\u017eje|date=March 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Cyprus====\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2015}}\nThe [[Republic of Cyprus]] has strict gun control. Private citizens are completely forbidden from owning handguns and rifles in any calibre, including .22 [[rimfire ammunition]]. Shotguns limited to two rounds are allowed with a license, issued by provincial police. Shotguns must be for hunting purposes, and a licensed citizen may own up to ten shotguns, typically [[Double-barreled shotgun|double-barrelled]]. A firearm license is required to buy ammunition, of up to 250 shells per purchase, with sales being recorded. Cyprus also controls [[airgun]]s, and airgun owners require a license. Even though purchasing automatic weapons is illegal, the military issues their reserves an automatic weapon, therefore the majority of the male population has one due to military [[conscription]].<ref name=\"Grupp, Larry 2011\">Grupp, Larry (2011). The Worldwide Gun Owner's Guide. Scottsdale, Arizona: Bloomfield Press, 365pp.</ref>\n\n====Czech Republic====\n{{Main|Gun laws in the Czech Republic}}\nThe Czech Republic is unusual in comparison to other EU countries in that the vast majority of gun owners (240,000 out of 300,000) possess their firearms for purposes of protection of life and property. Furthermore, Czech Republic has a [[shall-issue]] [[concealed carry]] permit system, whereby every self-defense license holder may carry up to two concealed firearms ready for immediate use (bullet-in-chamber). The Czech Republic had a higher rate of concealed carry licenses per capita than the US up to 2010, despite a relatively lower gun-ownership rate.\n\nGun licenses may be obtained by passing a gun proficiency exam, medical examination and having a clean criminal record. Although the general firearms ownership rate remains relatively low, the ability to legally possess and carry firearms is generally considered as a symbol of liberty, alongside concepts such as freedom of speech and free elections. This is illustrated by the Czech Republic's historical experience of firearm bans that happened only under Nazi and Communist dictatorships (and lately also under the [[Eu gun ban|EU Gun Ban]]).\n\nCrime with legally owned firearms is rare, with 45 recorded incidents in 2016, 17 of which were \"dangerous threats\" (compared to the total number of over 800,000 legally possessed firearms). Gun laws had not been an issue until the 2016 EU Directive (see [[#European Union|above]]), which led to the proposal of securing Czech citizens' gun rights through adoption of a constitutional amendment that would make firearm possession in the country a national security issue, thus taking it outside the scope of EU law. However, this provision was not approved by the Senate in the Czech Parliament. The Czech government filed a lawsuit to the European Court of Justice against the EU directive restricting possession of firearms.<ref>[https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-republic-takes-legal-action-over-eu-firearms-directive CZECH REPUBLIC TAKES LEGAL ACTION OVER EU FIREARMS DIRECTIVE]</ref> In October 2017 a petition against the EU Gun Ban signed by over 100.000 citizens was debated during a public hearing in the Senate.\n\nIn February 2018, the Ministry of the Interior proposed an amendment to the current ''Weapons and ammunition law'' to comply with the EU directive. The process of approving the law was suspended in Parliament until a decision by the European Court of Justice was made. Meanwhile, in January 2019, the Ministry of the Interior unveiled a draft proposal for a completely new Firearms Act that would comply with the requirements of the EU directive while respecting the tradition of civilian firearm ownership in the country.<ref>[https://zbrojnice.com/2019/01/14/navrh-noveho-zakona-o-zbranich-i-implementace-zasobniky-tlumice-a-expanzni-strely/ New Weapons law proposal: implementation, magazines, suppressors and expanding bullets.] (in Czech)</ref>\n\n====Denmark====\nCivilians in [[Denmark]] aged 16 and above can acquire gun licenses for hunting or sport shooting. This requires passing a written multiple-choice test and a practical test, after which a certified hunting license instructor determines if the applicant is suitable to own a weapon. A license is usually provided if the applicant has no or only minor marks on their criminal record.\n\nA hunting license permits the over-the-counter-purchase and ownership of an unlimited number of shotguns of up to 12 gauge and 2-round capacity. From there, the police has to be notified of new weapon purchases through an online form. Bolt-action rifles can also be bought over-the-counter, although they require a rifle license which is obtained through the police. The allowed calibers range from the smallest possible, up to [[.50 BMG]], with .50 BMG not included. Semi-automatic rifles are allowed if the rifle is limited to 2 rounds (hunting in Denmark), or without limitation on capacity (hunting outside of Denmark). Currently, only larger calibers (.308, 6,5x55, .300wm etc.) are issued as semi-auto rifles for hunting abroad. .223/5.56x45 and similar caliber rifles are generally not approved.\nThe hunter must pass a shotgun or rifle shooting test before being allowed to hunt.\n\nFor sport-shooting purposes, shotguns can also be used, as can [[bolt-action rifle]]s of almost any caliber (.50bmg as one of the exceptions). Sporting rifles are often chambered in 22lr and 6.5 x 55&nbsp;mm.\nSemi-automatic rifles are not allowed for sports shooting.\n\nHandguns: After two years of active membership in a shooting club, one can apply for a handgun permit which is then subject to background checks and approval by the police, and one has to be 21 years old.\nApproved calibers: All calibers under 9mm (9x19, 38 Spl, 357 magnum, .32acp etc.), plus a limited number of larger calibers; .40sw, 45 ACP, 44 Spl.\nThe maximum number of handguns are 6 in 22 cal.\nWhen applying for gun number 3, a special permit from the department of justice is required. Large caliber guns, i.e. bigger than 22 cal, are restricted to a maximum of 2 in the same caliber. Therefore, one can only own 2 handguns in 9&nbsp;mm at any given time. However, it is legal to own an additional 2 handguns in 9&nbsp;mm, if these are revolvers.\nFor all handguns, the overall length must be at least 210 millimeters (8.2677 inch), regardless of caliber, measured without orthopedic grips or removal parts.\n\nA weapon permit for sporting purposes (both long and short firearms) has to be renewed every 5 years. Rifle permits for hunting rifles have to be renewed every 10 years. Shotguns are not held on individual permits; holders are allowed to own these as long as they have a valid hunting license \u2013 and they can keep it for up to 10 years after the hunting license expires \u2013 albeit they are not allowed to keep ammunition without a valid license.\n\nCarrying a firearm in public is strictly prohibited, however, a notion of proportional self-defense exists. This means that if someone is attacked with a firearm, they are legally allowed to defend themselves proportionally \u2013 e.g. with a firearm of their own.\n\nFully automatic weapons are prohibited for civilian use, unless a special permit is issued by the Ministry of Justice. These permits are extremely rare, and are normally only issued to people or companies working for, or supplying the Police or Military.\n\nIllegal possession of a firearm may be punished with imprisonment of no less than one year. Civilians may keep privately owned weapons including pistols, revolvers, shotguns and rifles at their residences.<ref>https://www.politi.dk/da/borgerservice/vaabentilladelse/blankvaaben.htm</ref> These, together with its ammunition have to be stored in an approved gun cabinet (EN1143-1 grade 0 or better).<ref>https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=158805  \u00a722</ref> The police may inspect a shooting club's weapons at their discretion, but require a court order to inspect privately held firearms.<ref>[http://www.justitsministeriet.dk/arbejdsomr%C3%A5der/v%C3%A5ben/lovgivning Ministry of Justice \u2013 Weapons]{{in lang|da}}</ref>\n\n====Finland====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Finland}}\nThe ownership and use of firearms in Finland is regulated by the country's Firearms Act of 1998. Weapons are individually licensed by local police, with no limit on the number of licenses an individual may hold. Licenses are granted for recreational uses, exhibition or (under certain circumstances) professional use. No type of weapon is explicitly prohibited, but licenses are granted only for a reason. Self-defense is not accepted as a valid reason for licensing. In general, this excludes all but hunting and sports guns from non-professional use. Fully automatic weapons are generally not permitted. With the exception of law enforcement, only specially trained security guards may carry loaded weapons in public.\n\nIn 2007, Finland had the third largest gun-ownership rate globally (behind the US and Yemen),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Nick |title=Finland school shooting: Gunman planned massacre for six years |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/finland/3071235/Finland-school-shooting-Gunman-planned-massacre-for-six-years.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> and the first in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vote to tighten Europe gun laws |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7117042.stm |website=BBC |accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref> Finns are avid hunters, and as of 2007, there were 1.6 million registered weapons and 650,000 people with firearm permits in the country, i.e. 12% of the population.

The possibility of creating a dual-license for an already licensed weapon with permission of the license holder was allowed (e.g. parental permission).

In September 2015, firearms were divided into four categories that determine the regulations that apply to their possession and use.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/N287|title=Armes|trans-title=Arms|access-date=2016-09-06|language=fr|publisher=Direction de l'information l\u00e9gale et administrative}}</ref> Category C firearms can be obtained with a hunting license, or sport-shooting license with a medical certificate. Category C includes mainly single-shot-per-barrel shotguns and single-shot or manual repeating rifles (including [[Centerfire ammunition|centre-fire]] rifles, for hunting or target shooting). Once legally purchased these category C arms may be kept, without using them, even when no longer licensed for hunting or sport-shooting.\n\nCategory B firearms are only available to sport-shooters licensed for at least 6 months, with a medical certificate, without any felony convictions, and additionally requires at least three shooting sessions with an instructor. Specific authorisations for purchase and possession may then be sought from a local police administration, are valid for 5 years, and are renewable. Such weapons may then only be used for sport-shooting at shooting ranges, never for hunting. Category B includes all assault type rifles, such as [[AK-47]]/AKM, AK-74 or AR-15/M16/M4, and any look-alike weapons even when chambered for [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire cartridges]] (.22 LR). These must be semi-automatic only. All handguns, including those using rimfire ammunition, are classed as category B. It is illegal to possess these category B weapons after expiry of a non-renewed specific authorisation: the arms must be disposed of (sold to a gun shop or else destroyed, for example).\n\nAir-guns including pistols are freely available to adults, as category D arms, provided that their energy level does not exceed 20 J (previously 10 J).{{clarify|date=November 2019}} Typical energy levels are 6 J for a target pistol and 7.5 J for a target rifle. A scoped Field Target rifle might produce 15 or 16 J (maximum authorised in FT competition). Air-soft arms, firing non-metallic pellets and not exceeding 2 J energy, are considered to be toys, rather than weapons, and so are excluded from firearm regulations.\n\nAlso freely available are category D defensive pepper sprays up to a maximum 75 g capacity. Bigger capacity sprays are considered offensive weapons, not defensive, and so are classed in category B, and require specific authorisation.\n\nA person cannot own more than 12 centerfire firearms, and cannot own more than 10 magazines and 1,000 rounds of ammunition per firearm. A one-year carry license may be issued for persons \"exposed to exceptional risks to their life\" allowing them to carry a handgun with a maximum of 50 rounds. Such authorizations are extremely rare, however, as the state would normally insist on providing police protection in such cases. Since November 2015, police officers are authorised to carry their service weapons whilst off-duty.\n\n====Germany====\n{{Main|Gun legislation in Germany}}\nGun ownership in Germany is restrictive, being regulated by the Federal Weapons Act (German: Waffengesetz) of 1972.<ref>{{cite web|work=International Firearms Injury Prevention & Policy|url=http://www.gunpolicy.org/firearms/region/germany |title=Germany \u2013 Gun Facts, Figures and the Law|date=27 June 2012|accessdate=26 February 2013}}</ref>\nThe laws apply to weapons with a fire energy exceeding {{convert|7.5|J|ftlbf}}. A firearms license may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, who are deemed reliable and can justify a reason for owning a firearm. A separate license is required for each firearm owned. Target-shooters must have been a member of a shooting club with 18 recorded visits in the previous 12 months. A firearms carry permit is a second-tier license which allows concealed carrying in public, and is only issued to those with a particular need.\n\nSeveral weapons and special ammunitions are completely prohibited, such as automatic firearms. Buying, possessing, lending, using, carrying, crafting, altering and the trading of these weapons is illegal and punishable by up to five years imprisonment, confiscation of the weapon and a fine of up to [[Euro|\u20ac]]10,000. Using an illegal weapon for crimes of any kind is punishable by 1 to 10 years imprisonment.\n\nGermany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5.5 million firearms legally owned by 1.4 million people.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/28/new-german-firearms-registry-shows-55-million-guns-legally-owned-in-country/ |title=New German firearms registry shows 5.5 millions guns legally owned in country|publisher=Associated Press/Fox News |accessdate=28 December 2012 |date=28 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Greece====\n[[Greece]] has gun regulations in place. Shotguns (limited to a 3-round capacity), rifles and handguns require a license issued by Police Headquarters. A license may be issued to a Greek citizen over the age of 18 if: a) there are serious fears about his or her personal security along with a positive recommendation by the Prosecutor and b) it is required for the safety of shops, banks, other financial institutions, etc. To purchase handguns and rifles, citizens must either have a concealed-carry permit or a target-shooting permit (for rifles). Semi auto rifles are prohibited. Hunters can own up to 10 shotguns and rifles (with no gun barrel rifling) and sport shooters can own up to 7 guns.

A firearms license may be granted to those over the age of 18 who have no criminal convictions or mental disability, and have passed a basic firearms theory/practical examination. Three categories of firearms ownership are allowed: Hunting (Firearms restricted to bolt action and double barrel shootguns), Sports shooting (only restriction is no fully automatic firearms), Self defence (Special permission from Police, very rarely granted in special cases eg: gunshop owners). Sports shooting has in recent years gained popularity with the number of sports category licenses being issued steadily climbing. Government initiatives to popularize shooting sports such as building shooting ranges and introducing shooting as a sport in the schooling system has slowly begun. It is generally excepted that obtaining (and keeping) a firearms permit is a slow and somewhat costly process, but once a permit is granted and the necessary yearly memberships are paid, yearly doctors certificates are obtained and the mandatory 2-3 sporting events are attended (for sports shooter) ownership is fairly liberal as to the type of firearm one can own.  \n\nIn 2010, there were 129,000 registered gun owners (1.3% of the population) in Hungary with 235,000 firearms. The majority of these were hunting rifles. Gun violence is very rare in Hungary due to the close monitoring and control of firearms ownership, crime with firearms are very rare and this statistic usually includes crimes committed with non-lethal \"pepper spray\" guns. Police use lethal force with a firearm less than 10 times per year, on average.<ref>{{cite web|author=F\u00fcggetlen H\u00edr\u00fcgyn\u00f6ks\u00e9g |url=http://index.hu/belfold/2011/04/17/fegyverbe_magyar/ |title=Fegyverbe magyar? |publisher=Index.hu |date=2011-04-17 |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>\n\n====Ireland====\n{{Main| Firearms legislation in Ireland}}\nGun laws in Ireland are strict, requiring all firearms to be licensed individually through the [[Garda\u00ed]] (police). Applicants must be 16 years of age and have a good reason for ownership, a secure location to store firearms, proof of competency with the firearm or arrangements to achieve such, provide access to medical records and two character references, and be of sound mind and temperate habits. Applicants convicted of certain specified offenses will be denied a firearms certificate. Personal protection is not a valid reason for ownership.\n\nIrish firearms law is based on the Firearms Act 1925,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1925/en/act/pub/0017/print.html|title=Firearms Act, 1925|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> which was amended by several following acts in 1964,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1964/en/act/pub/0001/index.html|title=Firearms Act, 1964|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> 1968,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1968/en/act/pub/0020/index.html|title=Firearms (Proofing) Act, 1968|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> 1971,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1971/en/act/pub/0013/index.html|title=Firearms Act, 1971|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0012/index.html|title=Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/act/pub/0032/index.html|title=Firearms (temporary Provisions) Act, 1998|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> and 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2000/en/act/pub/0020/index.html|title=Firearms (Firearm Certificates for Non-Residents) Act, 2000|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> The cumulative effect of these modifications, along with modifications in other acts and confusion over which amendments applied, resulted in a 2006 Irish Law Reform Commission recommendation that all extant legislation be restated (written in a single document with all prior Acts repealed).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/news/report-on-legislation-directory-and-consultation-paper-on-classified-list-of-legislation-in-ireland.339.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207172508/http://www.lawreform.ie/news/report-on-legislation-directory-and-consultation-paper-on-classified-list-of-legislation-in-ireland.339.html |archivedate=7 February 2011|title=Report on Legislation Directory and Consultation Paper on Classified List of Legislation in Ireland|date=14 January 2011|publisher=[[Law Reform Commission (Ireland)|Law Reform Commission of Ireland]]}}</ref> However, the Criminal Justice Act 2006,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2006/en/act/pub/0026/index.html|title=Criminal Justice Act 2006|website=Irish Statute Book|publisher=Office of the [[Attorney General of Ireland]]}}</ref> contained a rewriting almost 80% of the Firearms Act.

Extensive complaints have arisen over the application of the legislation, with several hundred judicial review cases won in the High Court and Supreme Court by firearms owners, all relating to licensing decisions which had not adhered to the Firearms Act.\n\n====Italy====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Italy}}\nIn Italy, national police issue gun licenses to those over the age of 18 without criminal records, who are not mentally ill or known substance abusers, and who can prove competence with firearm safety. A shooting sports license permits transporting unloaded firearms and firing them in designated shooting ranges. A hunting license allows holders to engage in hunting with firearms. A concealed carry license permits a person to carry a loaded firearm in public, and requires proving a \"valid reason\" to do so (e.g.: a security guard or a jeweler at risk of robbery). The number of firearms an individual may own and retain in their home is limited to three common handguns, twelve sporting handguns or long guns, an unlimited number of hunting long guns, and eight historical firearms (manufactured before 1890). These limits can be exceeded with a collector license.\n\nPrivate firearms must be registered at the local police department within 72 hours of acquisition. Ammunition purchases must also be registered, and possession is normally limited to 200 rounds of handgun ammunition and 1500 rounds of hunting ammunition.\n\n====Lithuania====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Lithuania}}\n\n====Luxembourg====\n\nIn [[Luxembourg]], anyone wishing to purchase, possess or use a firearm must hold a permit issued by the Minister of Justice in person.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/loisirs-benevolat/permis-licences/detention-armes/autorisation-armes.html|title=Applying for a weapons licence|last=Arms|last2=Service 13|first2=Security|website=guichet.public.lu|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23|last3=to 11.30|first3=rue Erasme L.-1468 Luxembourg Luxembourg Phone :247- 84514 / 84523 / 84054 Fax :22 05 19 Mon-Fri from 8 30|last4=Arms|first4=security service Path to|last5=map|first5=security service Show on}}</ref>\n\nThe most common reasons for applying for a permit are hunting, recreational shooting, weapons collecting, and inheriting a firearm. Anyone who inherits a firearm must have a permit even if they have no intention to ever touch or use the gun.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSelf-defence is not a valid reason for owning a firearm. However, the Ministry of Justice is concerned that some permit holders falsely cite another reason (such as recreational shooting) as a justification for acquiring their permit when their sole actual motivation is self-defence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://luxtimes.lu/archives/10171-87-322-registered-guns-in-luxembourg|title=87,322 registered guns in Luxembourg|website=luxtimes.lu|language=en|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref>\n\n====Malta====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Malta}}\nFirearms are allowed in Malta for sport shooting, collection and hunting purposes. To get firearm license one must join a shooting or collectors club for training, which will issue a recommendation letter for the police, after which applicant must pass knowledge of firearm safety and the Arms Act. After successfully completing every step one will get license.\n\nThere are 102,610 registered firearms (or 22 per 100 people), including  56,000 shotguns, 10,553 pistols, 7,856 rifles, 5,369 revolvers, 501 machine guns, 477 sub-machine guns, 633 combat shotguns, 22 cannons, 7 humane killers and 2 rocket launchers.\n\nLaw allow carrying firearms while hunting, with 10,544 licensed to do so on land and 247 on sea<ref name=malta/>. Carrying loaded firearms outside of hunting grounds or shooting range is illegal. Automatic firearms are allowed only if they were produced before 1946.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], gun ownership is restricted to law enforcement, hunters, and target shooters (self-defense is not a valid reason to own firearms). A hunting license requires passing a hunters safety course. To own a gun for target shooting, the applicant must have been a member of a shooting club for a year. People with felonies, drug addictions, and mental illnesses may not possess firearms.\n\nOnce obtained, firearms must be stored in a safe and annually inspected by police. Firearms may only be used in self-defense as a matter of \"equal force\". Fully automatic firearms are banned, but there are otherwise few restrictions: semi-automatics, handguns, and magazines of all sizes are legal, as are all types of ammunition. A licensed gun owner may only have five firearms registered to his or her license at one time.<ref>[https://www.rnw.org/archive/gun-laws-netherlands Radio Netherlands Worldwide]</ref>\n\n====Poland====\n{{Main|Gun laws in Poland}}\nGun ownership in [[Poland]] is regulated and requires a permit to own or possess firearms. Permits are granted for specific purposes, such as self-defense, sports, hunting, collecting etc. and are shall issue except the ones for self-defense, which are may issue. Institutional permits allow for firearm ownership by security companies, shooting ranges, sports clubs etc.\n\nPermits are issued to permanent residents over 21, not addicted to alcohol or other substances, having no criminal record, being in good physical and mental health, who passed an exam before sporting association, hunting association or the police. Permits specify the purposes, categories and quantities of allowed guns; categories depend on permit type while quantities are assigned at the discretion of the police, based on documentation provided. Quantities can be increased when one uses up all available slots.\n\nCarrying loaded guns is allowed on self-defense and sports permits. Guns shall be carried concealed in a holster close to the body. Carrying is limited in public transport only to self-defense permit holders. It is prohibited to carry while intoxicated, and when attending public gatherings or mass events.\n\nAll legal owners are allowed to use their guns at registered shooting ranges. Discharging a firearm for training or leisure out of a registered shooting range (even on a large private property) is prohibited.\n\nFull-auto or select-fire firearms are permitted only on institutional and training permits. Since 2020 police can issue permit for firearms with silencers for hunting permits. They can only be used for sanitary shootings. See [[Gun laws in Poland#Sound suppressors|main article]] for more details. Armor-piercing, incendiary, tracer and other special ammunition is banned. Only valid permit holders are allowed to buy or possess live ammunition, and only of the types exactly matching the guns they legally own. The quantity of matching ammunition in possession is not limited. Hunters, collectors and sports shooters are allowed to manufacture (reload) ammunition, but strictly for their own use. There are further limits regarding allowed types and calibers depending on the type of permit - see main article for details. There's no limit on magazine capacity, except when hunting.\n\nReplicas of black powder firearms designed before 1885 require no permit to own. However, separate bill of law allows businesses to sell black powder to licensed customers only. This is often circumvented by obtaining a European Gun Card for your black powder firearm, asking a licensed colleague (there's no restriction on private sale or just giving out of black powder) or by buying powder in neighboring countries, mostly the Czech Republic.\n\nAirguns up to 17 Joules of muzzle energy are unregulated, others need to be registered with the police, but no permit is required.\n\nDespite quite liberal regulations, Poland remains the most disarmed country in Europe.\n\n====Romania====\nGun ownership in [[Romania]] is regulated by [http://legeaz.net/legea-295-2004-armelor-munitiilor/ Law 295/2004].

There are several categories of permits, with different requirements and rights, including hunting permits, self-defense permits, sports shooting permits and collectors permits. The only categories of people who are legally entitled to carry a weapon are owners of self-defense permits, magistrates, [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], military forces and certain categories of diplomats. A [[psychological evaluation]] is required beforehand in all cases.\n\nFurthermore, knives and daggers may in certain conditions (blade longer than 15&nbsp;cm and at least 0.4&nbsp;cm in width, double edge along the whole blade, etc.) be considered weapons and have a similar regime to those of firearms.\n\nIn order for a hunter to obtain a hunting/gun ownership license, he must spend a certain \"practice time\" with a professional hunter. To obtain a self-defense permit, one must be under witness protection. Sporting and collectors licenses require membership in a sport shooting club or collectors' association, respectively.\n\nThe amount of ammunition that can be owned is regulated by permit type. Sporting permits allow the ownership of 1000 matching cartridges per gun; hunting permits allow 300 matching cartridges per gun; self-defense permits allow 50 bullet cartridges and 50 blanks per gun; Collectors permits do not allow for private ownership of ammunition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legeaz.net/monitorul-oficial-929-2015/legea-319-2015-modificarea-legii-295-2004-regim-arme-munitii | title=Legea 319 2015 | publisher=Legeaz.net |date=2015-12-15 |accessdate=2016-10-26}}</ref>\n\nExplosive weapons and ammunitions, fully automatic weapons, weapons camouflaged in the shape of another object, armor-piercing ammunition and lethal weapons that do not fit in any category defined by the law are prohibited.\n\nThe type of gun is also regulated by permit.

Shotgun and rifle licenses must be renewed after 5 years, subject to firearm inspection. Sporting licenses must be renewed after 3 years. Police may inspect firearms at any time. A self-defense and concealed carry license must be renewed every year, and is only available under special conditions.\n\nA license-holder may own up to 6 shotguns, and unlimited rifles. With a sporting license, valid for 3 years, 1 to 10 handguns may be owned, depending on sports-shooting level. Magazine capacity for semi-automatic centerfire rifles is limited to 4 rounds for sports shooting and 2 rounds for hunting; semi-automatic shotguns are limited to 3 rounds. Rimfire rifles, regardless of type have no magazine limit. Rifles chambered for certain cartridges with military origins are prohibited, such as .223/5.56 NATO and .50 BMG. The .308 Winchester and 7.62x39 mm (AK round) cartridges are only permitted in bolt-action, repetition or single-shot firearms. Proof of ownership of an approved safe is required for all centerfire rifles and handguns, and the owner is responsible for firearm thefts. Ammunition must be stored separately.

Passing a hunting examination or membership in an approved sport shooting club for six months is required. Licenses for semi-automatic handguns are issued for five years and can be renewed, rifle and single-shot handgun licenses are valid for the owner's lifetime. License-holders may lend a weapon to a person at least 15 years of age for supervised use.\n\nA separate license is required for each particular firearm, caliber conversion kit or suppressor. There's no codified limit on the number of licenses a person can hold, but in practice a license-holder may own up to six hunting rifles, ten handguns, or a mix of eight rifles and handguns. Firearms must be stored in an approved safe. A firearm registered for hunting may be used for sport shooting, but not vice versa. Licenses obtained for hunting are implicitly limited to bolt-action or, more rarely, semi-automatic rifles that are \"applicable for hunting\", with no strict definition of the latter in the laws, which causes controversy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://svenskjakt.se/start/nyhet/annu-ett-bakslag-for-polisen-i-tikka-malet/ | title=Polisen om Tikka-domen: En betydande r\u00e4ttsos\u00e4kerhet}}</ref>\n\nSelf-defense with firearms, as well as carry, is generally prohibited. Carry permits can be issued by the police under very special circumstances like an immediate and proven life threat. Transportation of unloaded firearms is allowed to and from approved shooting ranges or hunting grounds.\n\nFirearm collectors must have a clearly stated demarcation of their interest in collecting (e.g.: pre-World War II British handguns). The police may demand security measures on keeping the collection. Collectors may request a time-limited permit to discharge their weapons. Firearms manufactured before 1890 and not using sealed cartridges are exempt from the weapon law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/sv/Dokument-Lagar/Lagar/Svenskforfattningssamling/Vapenlag-199667_sfs-1996-67/#K1 |title=Svensk f\u00f6rfattningssamling 1996:67 Vapenlag (1996:67) |publisher=riksdagen.se |accessdate=2014-04-19}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{Main|Firearms policy in the United Kingdom}}\nThe UK increased firearm regulation through several Firearms Acts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/ukpga_19970005_en_1 |title=Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-02-18}}</ref>\nleading to an outright ban on automatic firearms and many semi-automatic firearms.

Section 1 firearms require a Firearms Certificate (FAC), and include bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles in [[Rimfire ammunition|rimfire]] only, and all shotguns that do not conform to section 2 requirements. There are additional requirements for both sections, such as length and ammunition type, and some accessories such as suppressors are also subject to licensing restrictions. All firearms and accessories that do not conform to section one or 2 requirements are designated as prohibited weapons and require a section 5 license from the [[Home Office]] for legal possession.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/518193/Guidance_on_Firearms_Licensing_Law_April_2016_v20.pdf|title=Guide on Firearms Licensing Law|last=Home Office|first=|date=1 April 2016|website=Gov.UK|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAn SGC allows the holder to purchase and own any number of shotguns, so long as they can be securely stored, and does not restrict purchase or storage of ammunition; additionally they may legally give shotgun ammunition to non-licence holders.

A custodial sentence of between 3 months and 3 years disqualifies applicants for 5 years from release; 3 years or greater disqualifies applicants for life. \"Intemperate habits\", such as substance abuse, may disqualify applicants. Being of \"unsound mind\", meaning a history of mental illness, or other relevant medical conditions may disqualify applicants, however there are no conditions that \"make them automatically unsuitable to possess a firearm\", and police will contact the applicant's [[General practitioner|General Practitioner]], who place a flag on the records of all license holders<ref name=\":1\" />. Applicants must also have suitable measures for storing firearms and ammunition, such as a gun safe.The FAC additionally requires demonstrating a good reason for each firearm the applicant wishes to own (such as hunting, pest control, collecting, or target shooting). Self-defense is only accepted as a good reason in [[Northern Ireland]].\n\n==Oceania==\nFirearms are completely prohibited for civilian use without exceptions in [[Nauru]], [[Palau]] and [[Marshall Islands]]. [[Fiji]] suspended all firearm licenses in 2000, [[Cook Islands]] and [[Solomon Islands]] did the same respectively in 1999 and 1992. [[Papua New Guinea]] does not issue new licenses since 2000, but former are still valid.

A firearms license may be issued by police to applicants who attend a safety lecture, pass a written test on safety and the Arms Code, and have secure storage for firearms and ammunition; the police will also interview the applicant and two references to be certain the applicant is \"fit and proper\" to own a firearm. Having criminal associations, a history of domestic violence, mental instability, or alcohol or drug abuse almost always result in the application being denied. Misbehavior involving firearms commonly leads to a firearms license being revoked by police. Even when licensed, a person may only be in possession of a firearm for a particular lawful, proper and sufficient purpose,<ref>[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/your-duties-and-legal-requirements \"Arms Code Section 5: Your duties and legal requirements\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203093025/http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/your-duties-and-legal-requirements |date=3 February 2017 }}, NZ Police</ref>\nfor which the NZ Police policy is to exclude self-defense, however this is not written in the Arms Act or supporting regulations.<ref>[http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/firearms-licensing \"''The law does not permit the possession of firearms 'in anticipation' that a firearm may need to be used in self-defence.''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029173445/http://www.police.govt.nz/about-us/publication/arms-code/firearms-licensing |date=29 October 2015 }} NZ Police</ref>\n\nOwnership of certain types of firearms require stricter vetting procedures, a higher level of storage security, and a \"special reason\" for obtaining the weapon. The applicant must gain an appropriate endorsement on their license and a permit to procure before obtaining handguns, machine guns, or selective-fire assault rifles. After the [[Christchurch mosque shootings]] in 2019, legislation to restrict semi-automatic firearms and magazines with a capacity of more than 10 rounds, and provide an amnesty and buyback of such weapons was introduced and passed by the New Zealand parliament.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Arms Trade Treaty]]\n* [[Concealed carry]]\n* [[Defensive gun use]]\n* [[Global gun cultures]]\n* [[Glossary of firearms terms]]\n* [[Gun control]]\n* [[Gun violence]]\n* [[Index of gun politics articles]]\n* [[List of countries by firearm-related death rate]]\n* [[List of countries by gun ownership]]\n* [[Right to arms]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=N}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Prone to spam|date=April 2014}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n* [http://www.gunpolicy.org/ GunPolicy.org] \u2013 University of Sydney hosted database on armed violence, firearm law and gun control\n* [http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/ Small Arms Survey] with [http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2007/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2007-Chapter-02-annexe-4-EN.pdf 2007 survey of 178 countries]\n* [http://www.ipu.org/PDF/publications/missing_en.pdf Missing Pieces: A Guide for Reducing Gun Violence through parliamentary action] [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]], [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], 2007\n* [http://www.unodc.org/pdf/crime/seventh_survey/InstrumentE.pdf Questionnaire for the Seventh United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems, covering the period 1998\u2013\u20132000]\n{{Gun laws by country}}\n{{Americas topic|Gun laws in}}\n{{Europe topic|Gun politics in}}\n{{Law country lists}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Overview of gun laws by nation}}\n[[Category:Firearms|Gun Politics]]\n[[Category:Firearm laws]]\n[[Category:Gun politics| ]]\n", "name_user": "Katabatic03", "label": "safe", "comment": "Grammar and typo fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overview_of_gun_laws_by_nation"}
