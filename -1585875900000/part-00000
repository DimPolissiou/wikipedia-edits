Larson]]. The franchise began with the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original television series]] in 1978 and was followed by a short-run sequel series (''[[Galactica 1980]]''), a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games. A re-imagined version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|two-part, three-hour miniseries]] developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]] in 2003. That miniseries led to a [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|weekly television series]], which aired until 2009. A prequel series, ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', aired in 2010.\n\nAll ''Battlestar Galactica'' productions share the premise that in a distant part of the universe, a human civilization has extended to a group of planets known as the Twelve Colonies, to which they have migrated from their ancestral homeworld of [[Kobol]]. The Twelve Colonies have been engaged in a lengthy war with a cybernetic race known as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], whose goal is the extermination of the human race. The Cylons offer peace to the humans, which proves to be a ruse. With the aid of a human named [[Baltar (Battlestar Galactica)|Baltar]], the Cylons carry out a massive attack on the Twelve Colonies and on the Colonial Fleet of starships that protect them. These attacks devastate the Colonial Fleet, lay waste to the Colonies, and virtually destroy their populations. Scattered survivors flee into outer space aboard a ragtag array of available spaceships. Of the entire Colonial battle fleet, only the [[Battlestar Galactica (fictional spacecraft)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], a gigantic battleship and spacecraft carrier, appears to have survived the Cylon attack. Under the leadership of Commander [[William Adama]], the ''Galactica'' and the pilots of \"Viper fighters\" lead a fugitive fleet of survivors in search of the fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].\n\n==Original series==\n\n===''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978)===\n{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)}}\n[[Glen A. Larson]], the creator and [[executive producer]] of ''Battlestar Galactica'', claimed he had conceived of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' premise, which he called ''Adam's Ark'', during the late 1960s. As James E. Ford detailed in \u201c''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Theology,\u201d a paper read at the Joint Conference of the American Culture and Popular Culture Associations on April 17, 1980 (and published as \u201cTheology in Prime Time Science Fiction: ''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Doctrine,\u201d ''Journal of Popular Culture'' #17 [1983]: 83\u201387), the series incorporated many themes from [[Mormons|Mormon]] theology, such as marriage for \"time and eternity\", a \"council of twelve,\" a lost thirteenth tribe of humans, and a planet called [[Kobol]] (an anagram of [[Kolob]]), as Larson was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1979/08/news-of-the-church/lds-scene \"LDS Scene,\"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]],'' August 1979, p. 80. In 1979, Larson received an award from the Associated Latter-day Media Artists.</ref><ref>Mormon Expression, Episode 135: Battlestar Galactica and Mormon Theology [http://mormonexpression.com/2011/05/17/135-battlestar-galactica-and-mormon-theology/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722021121/http://mormonexpression.com/2011/05/17/135-battlestar-galactica-and-mormon-theology/ |date=July 22, 2015 }}</ref> However, he was unable to find financial backing for his [[TV series]] for a number of years. ''Battlestar Galactica'' was finally produced in the wake of the success of the 1977 film [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']]. The original Cylons of Battlestar Galactica, robotic antagonists bent on destroying all humankind, owe much to [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|berserker]] stories, including Saberhagen's fictional race The Builders whose \"sliding single red eye\" became the signature design element for the Cylons.\n\nLarson had envisioned ''Battlestar Galactica'' as a series of [[television film|made-for-TV movies]] (a three-hour [[television pilot|pilot program]] and two two-hour episodes) for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). A shortened version of the three-hour pilot, ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', was screened in Canadian theaters (before the TV series was [[broadcasting|telecast]]) and in American, European and Australian theaters later on. Instead of two additional TV movies, ABC decided to commission a weekly TV series of one-hour episodes.\n\nIn 1979 at the sixth annual [[People's Choice Awards]], the TV series won in the category of \"Best New TV Drama Series\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |title=People's Choice Awards Past Winners: 1979 |publisher=pcavote.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023849/http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe first episode of the TV series (the long pilot TV movie) was broadcast on September 17, 1978. However, about 30 minutes before the end, that broadcast was interrupted by the announcement of the signing of the Egyptian\u2013Israeli [[Camp David Accords]]. After the interruption (which was nearly an hour in length), the episode picked back up where it left off.\n\nDuring the eight months after the pilot's first broadcast, 17 original episodes of the series were made (five of them two-part shows), equivalent to a standard 24-episode TV season. Citing declining ratings and cost overruns, ABC canceled ''Battlestar Galactica'' in April 1979. Its final episode \"[[The Hand of God (1978 Battlestar Galactica)|The Hand of God]]\" was telecast on April 29, 1979.\n{{further|List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes{{!}}List of ''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978 TV series) and ''Galactica 1980'' episodes}}\n\n===''Galactica 1980''===\n{{Main|Galactica 1980}}\n\nDuring the autumn of 1979, ABC executives met with ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'}}s creator Glen Larson to consider restarting the series. A suitable concept was needed to draw viewers, and it was decided that the arrival of the Colonial Fleet at present-day Earth would be the storyline. A new [[TV movie]] called  ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' was produced. Again, it was decided this new version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' would be made into a weekly TV series. Despite the early success of the premiere, this program failed to achieve the popularity of the original series, and it was canceled after just ten episodes.\n\nIn this 1980 sequel series, the Colonial fleet finds the Earth, and then it covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., recycling footage from the 1974 [[Universal Studios]] movie [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] during a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as limiting the number of acts of violence and being required to shoehorn educational content into the script and dialogue.\n\nTo cut costs, the show was set mostly on the contemporary Earth, to the great dismay of fans. Another factor for fan apathy was the nearly complete recasting of the original series: [[Lorne Greene]] reprised his role as Adama (working unpaid),{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Herb Jefferson, Jr.]] played \"Colonel\" Boomer in about half of the episodes (with little screentime), and [[Dirk Benedict]] as Starbuck for one episode (the abrupt final episode, though his character was to have also appeared in the unfilmed episode \"Wheel of Fire\", which was a semi-sequel to \"The Return of Starbuck\"). [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for ''Galactica 1980'', but he turned it down since he was not sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galactica.tv/battlestar-galactica-1978---interviews/richard-hatch-galactica.tv-interview.html |title=Richard Hatch GALACTICA.TV interview |author=Mike Egnor |publisher=www.galactica.tv |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome [[television syndication|TV syndication]] packages for ''Battlestar Galactica'' incorporate the episodes of this series.\n\n===Cinema releases===\nBesides a re-edited version of the pilot, released in Canada, Europe, parts of Latin America, and, following the broadcast of the series, in the U.S., two other ''Battlestar Galactica'' feature films were released in cinemas. ''Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack'' and ''Conquest of the Earth'' were made up of various episodes of the original series and ''Galactica 1980'' respectively.

Comics]] published a 23-issue comic book series based upon the show between 1978 and 1981. Walt Simonson, who later wrote and drew ''Thor'' and had a long stint on Marvel's ''Star Wars'' comic, was the artist for the series at its conclusion. Other comics have since been published by [[Maximum Press]], Grandreams, ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine, Realm Press, and [[Dynamite Comics]]. Of all these series, only those by Marvel, Grandreams, and ''Look-In'' completed their storylines and brought the story to a conclusion. All the other series were cancelled at various points during their run, with no resolutions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Grandreams and ''Look-In'' comic strips take place early in the series. The other comic series based on the 1978 series have been set after the final episode of the series and ignored ''[[Galactica 1980]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Maximum Press series began with the discovery of a completely unpopulated Earth some fifteen years after the TV show. The look and the feel of the comics was changed considerably from the series, to give the stories a \"more nineties\" feel.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Realm Press series picked up immediately after the original series' final episode, in an attempt to present what they called \"Season Two\" of the original show.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[Dynamite Entertainment]] was the last company to publish comic books featuring both the classic and reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' series. They also released a 4-issue ''Galactica 1980'' comic miniseries written by [[Marc Guggenheim]]. The limited miniseries was a re-imagining of the original series but at the end featured a second, smaller ''Battlestar'' (replacing the original which was destroyed) also named ''Galactica'' but strongly resembling the ship seen in the reimagined Sci-Fi Channel series.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Books==\nBoth the original and the reimagined series have had books published about the series, academically oriented analysis, novelizations, and new works based on the characters.\n\n===Original series books===\nThese ''Battlestar Galactica'' softcover novelisations were written by [[Glen A.

Larson]]. The franchise began with the [[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|original television series]] in 1978 and was followed by a short-run sequel series (''[[Galactica 1980]]''), a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games. A re-imagined version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' aired as a [[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|two-part, three-hour miniseries]] developed by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[David Eick]] in 2003. That miniseries led to a [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|weekly television series]], which aired until 2009. A prequel series, ''[[Caprica (TV series)|Caprica]]'', aired in 2010.\n\nAll ''Battlestar Galactica'' productions share the premise that in a distant part of the universe, a human civilization has extended to a group of planets known as the Twelve Colonies, to which they have migrated from their ancestral homeworld of [[Kobol]]. The Twelve Colonies have been engaged in a lengthy war with a cybernetic race known as the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], whose goal is the extermination of the human race. The Cylons offer peace to the humans, which proves to be a ruse. With the aid of a human named [[Baltar (Battlestar Galactica)|Baltar]], the Cylons carry out a massive attack on the Twelve Colonies and on the Colonial Fleet of starships that protect them. These attacks devastate the Colonial Fleet, lay waste to the Colonies, and virtually destroy their populations. Scattered survivors flee into outer space aboard a ragtag array of available spaceships. Of the entire Colonial battle fleet, only the [[Battlestar Galactica (fictional spacecraft)|Battlestar ''Galactica'']], a gigantic battleship and spacecraft carrier, appears to have survived the Cylon attack. Under the leadership of Commander [[William Adama]], the ''Galactica'' and the pilots of \"Viper fighters\" lead a fugitive fleet of survivors in search of the fabled thirteenth colony known as [[Earth in fiction#Battlestar Galactica|Earth]].\n\n==Original series==\n\n===''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978)===\n{{Main|Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)}}\n[[Glen A. Larson]], the creator and [[executive producer]] of ''Battlestar Galactica'', claimed he had conceived of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' premise, which he called ''Adam's Ark'', during the late 1960s. As James E. Ford detailed in \u201c''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Theology,\u201d a paper read at the Joint Conference of the American Culture and Popular Culture Associations on April 17, 1980 (and published as \u201cTheology in Prime Time Science Fiction: ''Battlestar Galactica'' and Mormon Doctrine,\u201d ''Journal of Popular Culture'' #17 [1983]: 83\u201387), the series incorporated many themes from [[Mormons|Mormon]] theology, such as marriage for \"time and eternity\", a \"council of twelve,\" a lost thirteenth tribe of humans, and a planet called [[Kobol]] (an anagram of [[Kolob]]), as Larson was a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].<ref>[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/1979/08/news-of-the-church/lds-scene \"LDS Scene,\"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]],'' August 1979, p. 80.

''Battlestar Galactica'' was finally produced in the wake of the success of the 1977 film [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']]. The original Cylons of Battlestar Galactica, robotic antagonists bent on destroying all humankind, owe much to [[Fred Saberhagen]]'s [[Berserker (Saberhagen)|berserker]] stories, including Saberhagen's fictional race The Builders whose \"sliding single red eye\" became the signature design element for the Cylons.\n\nLarson had envisioned ''Battlestar Galactica'' as a series of [[television film|made-for-TV movies]] (a three-hour [[television pilot|pilot program]] and two two-hour episodes) for the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). A shortened version of the three-hour pilot, ''[[Saga of a Star World]]'', was screened in Canadian theaters (before the TV series was [[broadcasting|telecast]]) and in American, European and Australian theaters later on. Instead of two additional TV movies, ABC decided to commission a weekly TV series of one-hour episodes.\n\nIn 1979 at the sixth annual [[People's Choice Awards]], the TV series won in the category of \"Best New TV Drama Series\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |title=People's Choice Awards Past Winners: 1979 |publisher=pcavote.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2009  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102023849/http://www.pcavote.com/pca/history.jsp?year=1979 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe first episode of the TV series (the long pilot TV movie) was broadcast on September 17, 1978. However, about 30 minutes before the end, that broadcast was interrupted by the announcement of the signing of the Egyptian\u2013Israeli [[Camp David Accords]]. After the interruption (which was nearly an hour in length), the episode picked back up where it left off.\n\nDuring the eight months after the pilot's first broadcast, 17 original episodes of the series were made (five of them two-part shows), equivalent to a standard 24-episode TV season. Citing declining ratings and cost overruns, ABC canceled ''Battlestar Galactica'' in April 1979. Its final episode \"[[The Hand of God (1978 Battlestar Galactica)|The Hand of God]]\" was telecast on April 29, 1979.\n{{further|List of Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series) and Galactica 1980 episodes{{!}}List of ''Battlestar Galactica'' (1978 TV series) and ''Galactica 1980'' episodes}}\n\n===''Galactica 1980''===\n{{Main|Galactica 1980}}\n\nDuring the autumn of 1979, ABC executives met with ''Battlestar Galactica''{{'}}s creator Glen Larson to consider restarting the series. A suitable concept was needed to draw viewers, and it was decided that the arrival of the Colonial Fleet at present-day Earth would be the storyline. A new [[TV movie]] called  ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' was produced. Again, it was decided this new version of ''Battlestar Galactica'' would be made into a weekly TV series. Despite the early success of the premiere, this program failed to achieve the popularity of the original series, and it was canceled after just ten episodes.\n\nIn this 1980 sequel series, the Colonial fleet finds the Earth, and then it covertly protects it from the Cylons. This series was a quick failure due to its low budget (e.g., recycling footage from the 1974 [[Universal Studios]] movie [[Earthquake (1974 film)|''Earthquake'']] during a [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylon]] attack sequence), widely panned writing, and ill-chosen time slot (Sunday evenings, a time generally reserved for family-oriented programming and, more specifically, also for the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' newsmagazine program). The TV series also had to adhere to strict content restrictions such as limiting the number of acts of violence and being required to shoehorn educational content into the script and dialogue.\n\nTo cut costs, the show was set mostly on the contemporary Earth, to the great dismay of fans. Another factor for fan apathy was the nearly complete recasting of the original series: [[Lorne Greene]] reprised his role as Adama (working unpaid),{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} [[Herb Jefferson, Jr.]] played \"Colonel\" Boomer in about half of the episodes (with little screentime), and [[Dirk Benedict]] as Starbuck for one episode (the abrupt final episode, though his character was to have also appeared in the unfilmed episode \"Wheel of Fire\", which was a semi-sequel to \"The Return of Starbuck\"). [[Richard Hatch (actor)|Richard Hatch]] (Apollo in the original series) was sent a script for ''Galactica 1980'', but he turned it down since he was not sure what his part in the series would be now that all the characters had changed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.galactica.tv/battlestar-galactica-1978---interviews/richard-hatch-galactica.tv-interview.html |title=Richard Hatch GALACTICA.TV interview |author=Mike Egnor |publisher=www.galactica.tv |date=December 30, 2008 |accessdate=December 30, 2008}}</ref>\n\nSome [[television syndication|TV syndication]] packages for ''Battlestar Galactica'' incorporate the episodes of this series.\n\n===Cinema releases===\nBesides a re-edited version of the pilot, released in Canada, Europe, parts of Latin America, and, following the broadcast of the series, in the U.S., two other ''Battlestar Galactica'' feature films were released in cinemas.

Comics]] published a 23-issue comic book series based upon the show between 1978 and 1981. Walt Simonson, who later wrote and drew ''Thor'' and had a long stint on Marvel's ''Star Wars'' comic, was the artist for the series at its conclusion. Other comics have since been published by [[Maximum Press]], Grandreams, ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine, Realm Press, and [[Dynamite Comics]]. Of all these series, only those by Marvel, Grandreams, and ''Look-In'' completed their storylines and brought the story to a conclusion. All the other series were cancelled at various points during their run, with no resolutions.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Grandreams and ''Look-In'' comic strips take place early in the series. The other comic series based on the 1978 series have been set after the final episode of the series and ignored ''[[Galactica 1980]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Maximum Press series began with the discovery of a completely unpopulated Earth some fifteen years after the TV show. The look and the feel of the comics was changed considerably from the series, to give the stories a \"more nineties\" feel.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe Realm Press series picked up immediately after the original series' final episode, in an attempt to present what they called \"Season Two\" of the original show.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n[[Dynamite Entertainment]] was the last company to publish comic books featuring both the classic and reimagined ''Battlestar Galactica'' series. They also released a 4-issue ''Galactica 1980'' comic miniseries written by [[Marc Guggenheim]]. The limited miniseries was a re-imagining of the original series but at the end featured a second, smaller ''Battlestar'' (replacing the original which was destroyed) also named ''Galactica'' but strongly resembling the ship seen in the reimagined Sci-Fi Channel series.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Books==\nBoth the original and the reimagined series have had books published about the series, academically oriented analysis, novelizations, and new works based on the characters.\n\n===Original series books===\nThese ''Battlestar Galactica'' softcover novelisations were written by [[Glen A.

The episodic novels featured expanded scenes, excerpts from \"The Adama Journals,\" more background on the characters, and the expansion of the ragtag fleet to almost 22,000 ships as opposed to the 220 in the TV series.

The series was created by [[Chuck Lorre]], [[Eddie Gorodetsky]] and Gemma Baker. It follows Christy Plunkett ([[Anna Faris]]), a single mother who, upon reaching a turning point in her battle with alcoholism and drug addiction, decides to restart her life in [[Napa, California]]'s wine country, working as a waitress at the restaurant Rustic Fig and attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. Her mother Bonnie Plunkett ([[Allison Janney]]) is also a recovering drug and alcohol addict who attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her fianc\u00e9, Adam ([[William Fichtner]]), a paraplegic ex-stuntman; and her 17-year-old daughter Violet ([[Sadie Calvano]]) \u2014 born when Christy was just 16 \u2013 was herself pregnant by way of her boyfriend Luke ([[Spencer Daniels]]) in season 1. Christy also has a younger son Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) by her ex-husband Baxter ([[Matt L. Jones]]), a deadbeat [[marijuana]] addict in the first season. Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill ([[Jaime Pressly]]), the overly emotional Wendy ([[Beth Hall]]), and the loudmouth but sweet Tammy ([[Kristen Johnston]]).

The series was created by [[Chuck Lorre]], [[Eddie Gorodetsky]] and Gemma Baker. It follows Christy Plunkett ([[Anna Faris]]), a single mother who, upon reaching a turning point in her battle with alcoholism and drug addiction, decides to restart her life in [[Napa, California]]'s wine country, working as a waitress at the restaurant Rustic Fig and attending [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] meetings. Her mother Bonnie Plunkett ([[Allison Janney]]) is also a recovering drug and alcohol addict who attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her fianc\u00e9, Adam ([[William Fichtner]]), a paraplegic ex-stuntman; and her 17-year-old daughter Violet ([[Sadie Calvano]]) \u2014 born when Christy was just 16 \u2013 was herself pregnant by way of her boyfriend Luke ([[Spencer Daniels]]) in season 1. Christy also has a younger son Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) by her ex-husband Baxter ([[Matt L. Jones]]), a deadbeat [[marijuana]] addict in the first season. Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill ([[Jaime Pressly]]), the overly emotional Wendy ([[Beth Hall]]), and the loudmouth but sweet Tammy ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them. Recurring characters in the first few seasons include: Gabriel ([[Nate Corddry]]), the manager of Rustic Fig and Rudy ([[French Stewart]]), Rustic Fig\u2019s head chef.\n \nWith the exception of the pilot, episode titles contain two odd topics (often unrelated) that are mentioned in that episode's dialogue.
