These dogs were used for both companionship and food and were introduced alongside poultry and pigs to various islands.

Modern studies done on the [[DNA]] of the Polynesian dogs indicate that they descended from the domesticated dogs of [[Southeast Asia]] and may have shared a remote ancestor with the [[dingo]].\n\n==Taxonomy==\nIn 1839, the British naturalist [[Charles Hamilton Smith]] gave this dog the [[scientific name]] of ''Canis pacificus'' in his 1840 book ''The Natural History of Dogs: Canidae Or Genus Canis of Authors; Including Also the Genera Hyaena and Proteles''.{{sfn|Smith|1840|pages=210\u2013212}} In the third edition of ''[[Mammal Species of the World]]'' published in 2005, the mammalogist [[W.

This short haplotype was named Arc2 and corresponds to mDNA haplotypes A75 and A120, and it could be found in 70% of samples found as far away as Hawaii and New Zealand. No dogs from Taiwan nor the Philippines carried the dingo or Polynesian haplotypes, which indicates that dogs did not enter the Pacific from a northeastern route.<ref name=oskarsson2011 />\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at the mDNA sequences taken from ancient New Zealand Kur\u012b dog samples discovered at an archaeological site at [[Wairau Bar]] and found they correspond to the a2 mDNA sub-haplogroup. The dog samples all carried the mDNA haplotype A192, which has only been reported in some modern village dogs from Bali, Indonesia. When compared with the two ancient Polynesian haplotypes Arc1 and  Arc2, all of the Wairau Bar dogs matched Arc2. Dogs from Wairau Bar likely represent part of the initial population of dogs introduced to New Zealand, having arrived with people around the beginning of the fourteenth century.<ref name=greig2016 /><ref name=greig2015 />\n\nAll of these dogs carry haplotypes that fall under the mDNA a2 sub-haplogroup and are therefore descendants of a dog/Chinese wolf hybrid ancestor. In 2015, the most comprehensive study of mDNA haplotypes to date found that the a2 sub-haplogroup represents 3% of all dogs in Southeast Asia, 22% in the Indian subcontinent and 16% in East Asia.<ref name=duleba2015 />\n\n===Dogs enter Oceania from southern China===\nIn 2020, an mDNA study of ancient dog fossils from the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze River]] basins of southern China showed that most of the ancient dogs fell within mDNA haplogroup A1b, as do the Australian dingoes and the pre-colonial dogs of the Pacific, but in low frequency in China today. The specimen from the Tianluoshan archaeological site, [[Zhejiang]] province dates to 7,000 YBP and is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the entire lineage. The dogs belonging to this haplogroup were once widely distributed in southern China, then dispersed through Southeast Asia into New Guinea and [[Oceania]], but were replaced in China 2,000 YBP by dogs of other lineages.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/molbev/msz311|pmid=31913480|title=Ancient DNA evidence from China reveals the expansion of Pacific dogs|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|year=2020|last1=Zhang|first1=Ming|last2=Sun|first2=Guoping|last3=Ren|first3=Lele|last4=Yuan|first4=Haibing|last5=Dong|first5=Guanghui|last6=Zhang|first6=Lizhao|last7=Liu|first7=Feng|last8=Cao|first8=Peng|last9=Ko|first9=Albert Min-Shan|last10=Yang|first10=Melinda A.|last11=Hu|first11=Songmei|last12=Wang|first12=Guo-Dong|last13=Fu|first13=Qiaomei}}</ref>\n\n{{Further|Canis lupus dingo}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em\n\n<ref name=wozencraft2005>{{MSW3 Wozencraft|id=14000751|pages=575\u2013577}} url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgAMbNSt8ikC&pg=PA576</ref><!--Note: the url must be kept outside of the MSW3 template for the link to arrive on the correct page-->\n}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite web|title=Canis pacificus|work=IBIS-Mammals|url=http://mammals.indianbiodiversity.org/mammals/mammalia/carnivora/canidae/canis/canis-pacificus|accessdate=August 14, 2018|ref={{harvid|IBIS-Mammals}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared M.|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLKTa_OeoNIC&pg=PA60|year=1997|publisher=[[W.

They were said to rarely bark, but would howl occasionally.{{sfn|Luomala|1960|pages=193, 203, 221}}{{sfn|Titcomb|Pukui|1969|pages=1\u201348}}\n\nThe distinct breeds of the Polynesian Dog became extinct during the 19th and early 20th century due to [[interbreeding]] with introduced European dog breeds; declining consumption of dog meat was another contributing factor.{{sfn|Luomala|1960|pages=193, 203, 221}}{{sfn|Titcomb|Pukui|1969|pages=1\u201348}}\n\n== In mythology ==\nDogs were an important part of the [[Polynesian narrative]]. They are often associated with the legendary exploits of the demigod [[M\u0101ui (mythology)|M\u0101ui]]. According to [[M\u0101ori mythology|M\u0101ori narrative]], M\u0101ui transformed his brother-in-law [[Irawaru]], husband of [[Hina (goddess)|Hina]], into the first dog which was used to explain the human characteristics of dogs.{{sfn|Luomala|1958|pages=49\u201350, 202\u2013203}} In the [[Tongan narrative]], Maui-Atalaga and his son/brother Maui-Kijikiji attempted to hunt down Fulububuta, an enormous [[man-eating]] dog, larger than a horse, living in a cave on the Fijian island of [[Moturiki]]. However, Atalaga is killed and dragged into a cave by the monster, which is later slain by Maui-Kijikiji, who wastes away mourning his dead father.{{sfn|Luomala|1949|pages=49\u201350, 202\u2013203}}\n\n== Genetic studies ==\n[[File:South East Asia island dog migration.png|thumb|right|Proposed route for the migration of dogs based on mDNA.

This short haplotype was named Arc2 and corresponds to mDNA haplotypes A75 and A120, and it could be found in 70% of samples found as far away as Hawaii and New Zealand. No dogs from Taiwan nor the Philippines carried the dingo or Polynesian haplotypes, which indicates that dogs did not enter the Pacific from a northeastern route.<ref name=oskarsson2011 />\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at the mDNA sequences taken from ancient New Zealand Kur\u012b dog samples discovered at an archaeological site at [[Wairau Bar]] and found they correspond to the a2 mDNA sub-haplogroup. The dog samples all carried the mDNA haplotype A192, which has only been reported in some modern village dogs from Bali, Indonesia. When compared with the two ancient Polynesian haplotypes Arc1 and  Arc2, all of the Wairau Bar dogs matched Arc2. Dogs from Wairau Bar likely represent part of the initial population of dogs introduced to New Zealand, having arrived with people around the beginning of the fourteenth century.<ref name=greig2016 /><ref name=greig2015 />\n\nAll of these dogs carry haplotypes that fall under the mDNA a2 sub-haplogroup and are therefore descendants of a dog/Chinese wolf hybrid ancestor. In 2015, the most comprehensive study of mDNA haplotypes to date found that the a2 sub-haplogroup represents 3% of all dogs in Southeast Asia, 22% in the Indian subcontinent and 16% in East Asia.<ref name=duleba2015 />\n\n===Dogs enter Oceania from southern China===\nIn 2020, an mDNA study of ancient dog fossils from the [[Yellow River]] and [[Yangtze River]] basins of southern China showed that most of the ancient dogs fell within mDNA haplogroup A1b, as do the Australian dingoes and the pre-colonial dogs of the Pacific, but in low frequency in China today. The specimen from the Tianluoshan archaeological site, [[Zhejiang]] province dates to 7,000 YBP and is [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the entire lineage. The dogs belonging to this haplogroup were once widely distributed in southern China, then dispersed through Southeast Asia into New Guinea and [[Oceania]], but were replaced in China 2,000 YBP by dogs of other lineages.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/molbev/msz311|pmid=31913480|title=Ancient DNA evidence from China reveals the expansion of Pacific dogs|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|year=2020|last1=Zhang|first1=Ming|last2=Sun|first2=Guoping|last3=Ren|first3=Lele|last4=Yuan|first4=Haibing|last5=Dong|first5=Guanghui|last6=Zhang|first6=Lizhao|last7=Liu|first7=Feng|last8=Cao|first8=Peng|last9=Ko|first9=Albert Min-Shan|last10=Yang|first10=Melinda A.|last11=Hu|first11=Songmei|last12=Wang|first12=Guo-Dong|last13=Fu|first13=Qiaomei}}</ref>\n\n{{Further|Dingo|Canis lupus dingo}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em\n\n<ref name=wozencraft2005>{{MSW3 Wozencraft|id=14000751|pages=575\u2013577}} url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgAMbNSt8ikC&pg=PA576</ref><!--Note: the url must be kept outside of the MSW3 template for the link to arrive on the correct page-->\n}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite web|title=Canis pacificus|work=IBIS-Mammals|url=http://mammals.indianbiodiversity.org/mammals/mammalia/carnivora/canidae/canis/canis-pacificus|accessdate=August 14, 2018|ref={{harvid|IBIS-Mammals}}}}\n*{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Jared M.|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLKTa_OeoNIC&pg=PA60|year=1997|publisher=[[W.

The [[Carthaginian army]], led by [[Hannibal]], [[Encirclement|surrounded]] and practically [[Battle of annihilation|annihilated]] a larger Roman army under the [[Roman consul|consuls]] [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro]]. It is regarded as one of the greatest [[military tactics|tactical]] feats in [[military history]] and one of the worst defeats in Roman history.\n\nHaving recovered from their losses at [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] (218 BC) and [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at [[Cannae]], with approximately 86,000 Roman and [[Socii|allied troops]]. They massed their [[heavy infantry]] in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal used the [[double envelopment]] tactic and surrounded his enemy, trapping the majority of the [[Roman army of the mid-Republic|Roman army]], who were then slaughtered. The loss of life on the Roman side was one of the most lethal single day's fighting in history; [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] equates the death toll at Cannae to \"the massed slaughter of the British Army on the [[First day on the Somme|first day of the Somme offensive]] in 1916.\"{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=159}} Only about 15,000 Romans, most of whom were from the garrisons of the camps and had not taken part in the battle, escaped death. Following the defeat, [[Capua]] and several other Italian [[city-state]]s defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.\n\nAs news of this defeat reached [[Rome]], the city was gripped in panic. Authorities resorted to extraordinary measures, which included consulting the [[Sibylline Oracles]], dispatching a delegation led by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] to consult the [[Delphic oracle]] in Greece, and [[Human sacrifice|burying four people alive]] as a sacrifice to their gods. To raise two new [[Roman legion|legions]], the authorities lowered the draft age and enlisted criminals, debtors and even slaves. Despite the extreme loss of men and equipment, and a second massive defeat later that same year at [[Battle of Silva Litana|Silva Litana]], the Romans refused to surrender to Hannibal. His offer to ransom survivors was brusquely refused. With grim determination the Romans fought for 14 more years until they achieved victory at the [[Battle of Zama]].\n\nAlthough for most of the following decades the battle was seen solely as a major Roman disaster, by modern times Cannae acquired a mythic quality, and is often used as an example of the perfect defeat of an enemy army.\n\n==Strategic background==\n\n[[File:Hannibal route of invasion.gif|thumb|300px|Hannibal's route of invasion]]\nShortly after the start of the Second Punic War, [[Hannibal]] crossed into Italy by traversing the [[Hannibal's Crossing of the Alps|Pyrenees and the Alps]] during the summer and early autumn of 218 BC.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=28}} He quickly won major victories over the Romans at [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] and at [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=36\u201337}} After these losses, the Romans appointed [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] as [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to deal with the threat.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.8</ref>{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=38}} Fabius used [[attrition warfare]] against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding [[pitched battle]]s. These tactics proved unpopular with the Romans who, as they recovered from the shock of Hannibal's victories, began to question the wisdom of the [[Fabian strategy]], which had given the Carthaginian army a chance to regroup.<ref name=\"hart\">[[Basil Liddell Hart|Liddell Hart, Basil]]. ''Strategy''. New York City, New York: Penguin, 1967.</ref> The majority of Romans were eager to see a quick conclusion to the war.

But on this occasion, so great was the alarm and terror of what would happen, they resolved to bring not only four but eight legions into the field. | Polybius, ''The Histories of Polybius''<ref name=\"polybius\">Polybius, ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Historiae]]'' (\"The Histories\"), iii.107; translated by Evelyn S.

However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies.<ref name=Polybius-107/> Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command on the day of the battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=119}} However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a [[scapegoat]] by the aristocratic establishment.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=119}} He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation\u2014most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of [[Scipio Aemilianus]], the patron of Polybius (one of the main sources of this history).{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[Image:Monumento Battaglia di Canne.JPG|thumb|upright|250px|A modern monument near the site of the Battle of Cannae]]\nIn the spring of 216 BC Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae, in the Apulian plain, placing himself between the Romans and their crucial source of supply.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=75}} As Polybius noted, the capture of Cannae \"caused great commotion in the Roman army; for it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it that distressed them, but the fact that it commanded the surrounding district\".<ref name=\"polybius\" /> The consuls, resolving to confront Hannibal, marched southward in search of him.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=77}} After two days' march, they found him on the left bank of the river [[Aufidus]], and encamped {{convert|5|miles|km|spell=in|abbr=out|0}} away.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=77}}\n\nVarro, in command on the first day, is presented by contemporary sources as a man of reckless nature and [[hubris]], who was determined to defeat Hannibal. While the Romans were approaching Cannae, some of Hannibal's light infantry and cavalry [[ambush]]ed them.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=80}} Varro repelled the attack and continued slowly on his way to Cannae.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=80}} This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro's part. Paullus, however, was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it was foolish to fight on open ground, despite the Romans' numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry (both in quality and quantity). Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the river Aufidus, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side {{convert|1|miles|km|spell=in|abbr=out|0}} away from the main camp.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=81}} The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.<ref>Cottrell, Leonard. Enemy of Rome. Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 94</ref><!-- Cottrell as a reliable secondary source is questionable, as he added fictitious and/or inflated events, accounts, and circumstances throughout this entire book, and his timeline maintains consistent inaccuracies. -->\n\nThe two armies stayed in their respective locations for two days. During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=82}} When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance of water from the Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry to the smaller Roman camp to harass water-bearing soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=82}} According to Polybius,<ref name=\"polybius\" /> Hannibal's cavalry boldly rode up to the edge of the Roman encampment, causing havoc and thoroughly disrupting the supply of water to the Roman camp.<ref name=\"caven\">Caven, B. ''Punic Wars''. London: George Werdenfeld and Nicholson Ltd., 1980.</ref>\n\nOn the morning of the battle, as the forces drew up, a Carthaginian officer named [[Gisgo]] reportedly remarked to Hannibal that the size of the Roman army was astonishing. \"There is one thing, Gisgo, yet more astonishing\", Hannibal coolly replied, \"which you take no notice of.\" He then explained, \"In all those great numbers before us, there is not one man called Gisgo\", provoking laughter that spread through the Carthaginian ranks.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Fabius|\"Fabius Maximus\"]].</ref>\n\nAuthors like [[Appian]] and [[Livy]] inform that Hannibal sent a small contingent of 500-600 mercenaries to pretend to desert to the Roman side. Those men, [[Celtiberians]] according to Appian and [[Numidians]] according to Livy, would have handed their weapons to the Romans as a sign of good will while retaining hidden short swords in their clothes. Once the battle started, following Hannibal's plans, the mercenaries would have attacked, stealing weapons and shields from their victims and causing chaos and confusion in the Roman camp. However, the veracity of this part is disputed.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=43}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Date===\nAncient historians rarely provide the precise dates for the events they describe; for example, Livy provides no explicit dates for any of the battles of the Second Punic War. However, [[Macrobius]], citing the Roman annalist [[Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius]], states the battle was fought ''ante diem iiii nones [[Sextilis]]'', or 2 August.<ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', 1.1.6.26</ref>\n\nThe months of the pre-Julian [[Roman calendar]] are known not to correspond to its namesake [[Julian day]]; for example, Livy records a [[lunar eclipse]] in 168&nbsp;BC as occurring on 4 September, when astronomical calculations show it happened on Julian day 21 June of that year.<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', XLIV.37.8</ref> This discrepancy arose from the failure of the [[college of pontiffs|pontifices]] to properly perform [[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]s, either by accident or for political advantage. A review of the evidence led P.S. Derow to identify the equivalent Julian date would be 1 July 216&nbsp;BC; other authorities have suggested other Julian dates.<ref>Derow, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1087297 \"The Roman Calendar, 218\u2013191 B.C.\"], ''Phoenix'', 30 (1976), pp. 277ff</ref>\n\n===Armies===\n[[Image:Balearic Slinger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Modern interpretation of a slinger from the [[Balearic Islands]] (famous for the skill of their slingers)]]\nFigures for troops involved in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They should be treated with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=32}} The Carthaginian army was a combination of warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000\u201350,000. Their infantry comprised an estimated 8,000 [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], 5,500 [[Gaetuli]]an, 16,000 [[Gauls]], mainly [[Boii]] and [[Insubres]] (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and 8,000 of several tribes of [[Hispania]], including [[Iberians]], [[Celtiberians]] and [[Lusitanians]].{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=94}} Hannibal's cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 [[Numidians|Numidian]], 2,000 Iberian peninsular, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had an auxiliary [[skirmisher]] contingent consisting of 1,000-2,000 [[Balearics|Balearic]] [[Sling (weapon)#Written history|slingers]] and 6,000 mixed-nationality javelinmen, possibly including [[Lusitanians]] too.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=106}} The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=29\u201332}}{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=81\u2013112}}\n\n===Equipment===\nRome's forces used typical [[Roman military personal equipment#Torso armour|Roman equipment]] including ''[[Pilum|pila]]'' (heavy javelins) and ''[[hasta (spear)|hastae]]'' (thrusting spears) as weapons as well as traditional bronze helmets, bodyshields and body armor.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=44}} On the other hand, the Carthaginian army used a variety of equipment. The Iberians fought with [[falcata]]s, while Celtiberians and Lusitanians would use straight [[Gladius|gladii]],{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=100}} as well as [[javelin]]s and various types of [[spear]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} For defense, warriors from Hispania carried large oval shields and often wore a crested helmet made of animal sinews.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} Most Gallic foot warriors likely had no protection other than large shields, and the typical Gallic weapon was a long slashing sword.<ref name=Polybius-114>Polybius, ''Historiae'', iii.114</ref> The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and wearing no armor but carrying small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or a longer blade.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} In contrast, the heavier Iberian peninsular cavalry carried round shields, swords, javelins and thrusting spears.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=99}} The similarly heavy Gallic cavalry added the four-horned [[saddle]], with the wealthier ones being clad in mail, a Gallic invention.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or javelins. The [[Balearic slingers]], who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself, like many Roman officers on the opposing side, might have been wearing a bronze ''[[muscle cuirass|musculata]]'' and carrying a [[falcata]] as his personal sidearm.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe equipment of the Libyan line infantry has been much debated.

It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well,{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=89}} though a general reading suggests he meant the whole panoply of arms and armor, and even tactical organization. Apart from his description of the battle itself, when later discussing the subject of the [[Roman legion]] versus the Greek [[phalanx]], Polybius says that \"...against Hannibal, the defeats they suffered had nothing to do with weapons or formations\" because \"Hannibal himself... discarded the equipment with which he had started out [and] armed his troops with Roman weapons\".<ref name=Polybius-114/> Gregory Daly is inclined to the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=90}} [[Peter Connolly]] has argued that they were armed as a [[Macedonian phalanx|pike phalanx]].<ref name=\"Connolly, Peter: ''Hannibal and the Enemies of Rome'' (1998), p148\">Connolly (1998), p. 148.</ref> This has been disputed by Head, because [[Plutarch]] states they carried spears shorter than the Roman [[triarii]]<ref name=\"Duncan Head p144\" /> and by Daly because they could not have carried an unwieldy pike at the same time as a heavy Roman-style shield.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=89}}\n\n===Tactical deployment===\nThe conventional deployment for armies of the time was placement of infantry in the center, with the cavalry in two flanking wings. The Romans followed this convention fairly closely, but chose extra depth rather than breadth for the infantry in hopes of breaking quickly through the center of Hannibal's [[Line (formation)|line]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=100}} Varro knew how the Roman infantry had managed to penetrate Hannibal's center at [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]], and he planned to recreate this on an even greater scale.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=102}} The ''[[principes]]'' were stationed immediately behind the ''[[hastati]]'', ready to push forward at first contact to ensure the Romans presented a unified front.

The typical style of ancient warfare was to continuously pour infantry into the center and attempt to overpower the enemy.

Not only would the morning sun shine low into the Romans' eyes, but the southeasterly winds would blow sand and dust into their faces as they approached the battlefield.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Hannibal's deployment of his army, based on his perception of the terrain and understanding of the capabilities of his troops, proved decisive.\n\n===Battle===\nAs the armies advanced on one another, Hannibal gradually extended the center of his line, as Polybius described: \"After thus drawing up his whole army in a straight line, he took the central companies of Hispanics and Celts and advanced with them, keeping the rest of them in contact with these companies, but gradually falling off, so as to produce a crescent-shaped formation, the line of the flanking companies growing thinner as it was prolonged, his object being to employ the Africans as a reserve force and to begin the action with the Hispanics and Celts.\" Polybius described the weak Carthaginian center as deployed in a crescent, curving out toward the Romans in the middle with the African troops on their flanks in [[echelon formation]].<ref name=\"polybius\" /> It is believed that the purpose of this formation was to break the forward momentum of the Roman infantry, and delay its advance before other developments allowed Hannibal to deploy his African infantry most effectively.{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=77}} While the majority of historians feel that Hannibal's action was deliberate, some have called this account fanciful, and claim that the actions of the day represent either the natural curvature that occurs when a broad front of infantry marches forward, or the bending back of the Carthaginian center from the shock action of meeting the heavily massed Roman center.{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=84}}\n\n[[Image:Battle cannae destruction.gif|thumb|Destruction of the Roman army]]\nThe battle began with a fierce cavalry engagement on the flanks.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=118\u2013120}} Polybius described many of the Hispanic and Celtic horsemen facing the Romans dismounting due to the lack of space to fight on horseback, and called the struggle \"barbaric\" in the sense of its utter brutality.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=120}} When the Carthaginian cavalry got the upper hand, they cut down their Roman opponents without giving quarter.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=126}}<ref name=\"polybius\" /> On the other flank the Numidians engaged in a way that merely kept the Roman allied cavalry occupied.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=126}} Hasdrubal kept his victorious Hispanic and Gallic cavalry under control and did not chase the retreating Roman right wing.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=126}} Instead, he led them to the other side of the field to attack the socii cavalry still fighting the Numidians.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=149}} Assailed from both sides, the allied cavalry broke before Hasdrubal could charge into contact and the Numidians pursued them off the field.<ref name=\"polybius\" />{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=149}}\n\nWhile the Carthaginian cavalry were in the process of defeating the Roman horsemen, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.{{sfn|Daly|2002}}\n\nThe light infantry on both sides engaged in indecisive skirmishing, inflicting few casualties and quickly withdrawing through the ranks of their heavy infantry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=114\u2013116}} As the Roman heavy infantry attacked, Hannibal stood with his men in the weak center and held them together in a controlled retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew step by step. Knowing the superiority of the Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as troops from the reserve lines advanced into the growing gaps.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=147}} Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent.{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=84}} This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings.<ref>Cottrell, Leonard. ''Enemy of Rome''. Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 99</ref> At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an [[encirclement]] in one of the earliest known examples of a [[pincer movement]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=148}}\n\nWhen the Carthaginian cavalry attacked the Romans in the rear and the African flanking echelons assailed them on their right and left, the advance of the Roman infantry was brought to an abrupt halt.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=150}} The Romans were henceforth enclosed in a pocket with no means of escape.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=152}} The Carthaginians created a wall and began to systematically massacre them.

It is Pictor whom Livy names when reporting the casualties at the [[Battle of Trebia]].<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.7</ref> In addition to the consul Paullus, Livy goes on to record that among the dead were 2 [[quaestor]]s, 29 of the 48 [[military tribune]]s (some of consular rank, including the consul of the previous year, [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]], and the former [[Magister equitum]], [[Marcus Minucius Rufus]]), and 80 \"senators or men who had held offices which would have given them the right to be elected to the Senate\".<ref name=Livy-49/>\n\nLater Roman and Greco-Roman historians largely follow Livy's figures.

No other nation surely would not have been overwhelmed by such an accumulation of misfortune.|sign=[[Livy]]|source=on the Roman Senate's reaction to the defeat<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.54</ref>}}\n\nFor a brief period, the Romans were in complete disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, and the only remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was not a single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the [[Adriatic Sea]] (perhaps one of the last instances of [[human sacrifice]]s by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]).<ref name=Palmer_1997>{{cite book | last = Palmer | first = Robert EA | title = Rome and Carthage at peace | publisher = Stuttgart, F.

''Enemy of Rome''. Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 102</ref> Furthermore, the morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. After Cannae, the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Magna Graecia|southern provinces]] of Arpi, Salapia, Herdonia, Uzentum, including the cities of [[Capua]] and [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (two of the largest city-states in Italy) revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal. As Livy noted, \"How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome's allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for the simple reason that they despaired of Roman power.\"<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.61</ref> That the same year the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the [[First Macedonian War]] against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new King [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]], the only independent king left in Sicily.\n{{clear}}\n[[Image:Hannibal Slodtz Louvre MR2093.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hannibal counting the signet rings of the [[Equestrian order|Roman knights]] killed during the battle, statue by [[S\u00e9bastien Slodtz]], 1704, [[Louvre]]]]\nLivy illustrates the state of Roman morale with two vivid anecdotes. The first concerns Hannibal's brother Mago, who had returned to Carthage with news of the victory. He reported to their senate that in several engagements with the Romans Hannibal had killed over 200,000 soldiers and taken 50,000 prisoner; of six commanders, two consuls and a [[Master of horse]] had been slain; and a number of Roman allies had gone over to the Carthaginians. Then Mago concluded his report by having a collection of golden rings poured upon the council floor in front of the assembled senators. He explained that each ring belonged to one [[equites]] who had been slain in battle and had earned the ring through exceptional bravery. Livy notes one unnamed authority stated the volume of jewelry amounted to three and one-half measures ([[Congius]]?), only to add \"it is generally and more credibly held that there was not more than one measure of them\".<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxiii.11\u201312</ref>\n\nThe second concerns Lucius Caecilius Metellus and three other [[military tribune]]s, who had taken refuge at [[Canusium]] with other Roman refugees. Demoralized at the defeat, they discussed the possibility of setting sail overseas and finding employment as mercenaries for some foreign prince. Word of this meeting reached the young [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] who, with only a few followers, strode to where the discussion was underway and burst into the chamber holding his naked sword over their heads. Before the wavering men Scipio is reported to have cried,\n\n{{quote|I swear with all the passion in my heart that I will never desert our homeland, or permit any other citizen of Rome to leave her in the lurch.

And the rest of you, swear it too. If anyone refuse, against him this sword is drawn.<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.53</ref>}}\n\nFollowing the battle, the commander of the Numidian cavalry, [[Maharbal]], urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: \"Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but you do not know how to make use of your victory.\"<ref name=\"Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xxii.51\"/> Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian [[Hans Delbr\u00fcck]] pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy.{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1975|pp=337\u2013338}} Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, and the fact that he first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1975|pp=338\u2013339, 362}}\n\nImmediately after Cannae, Hannibal sent a delegation led by [[Carthalo]] to negotiate a peace treaty with the Senate on moderate terms. Despite the multiple catastrophes Rome had suffered, the Senate refused to parley. Instead, they redoubled their efforts, declaring full mobilization of the male Roman population, and raised new legions, enlisting landless peasants and even slaves.<ref>Cottrell, Leonard. ''Enemy of Rome''. Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 104</ref> So firm were these measures that the word \"peace\" was prohibited, mourning was limited to only 30 days, and public tears were prohibited even to women.<ref name=\"dodge\" />{{Rp|386}} For the remainder of the war in Italy, they did not amass such large forces under one command against Hannibal; they used several independent armies, still outnumbering the Punic forces in numbers of armies and soldiers. The war still had occasional battles, but was focused on taking strongpoints and constant fighting according to the [[Fabian strategy]]. This finally forced Hannibal with his shortage of manpower to retreat to [[Crotone|Croton]] from where he was called to Africa for the [[battle of Zama]], ending the war with a complete Roman victory.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Historical significance==\n===Effects on Roman military doctrine===\n[[Image:Shield of Henry II of France.jpg|thumb|upright|Shield of [[Henry II of France]] depicting Hannibal's victory at Cannae, an allusion to France's conflict with the Holy Roman Empire during the 16th century.]]\n\nCannae played a major role in shaping the [[Roman military structure|military structure]] and [[Roman infantry tactics, strategy and battle formations|tactical organization]] of the [[Military establishment of the Roman Republic|Roman Republican army]]. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek [[phalanx]]. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of [[double envelopment]] since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn the years following Cannae, striking reforms were introduced to address these deficiencies. First, the Romans \"articulated the phalanx, then divided it into columns, and finally split it up into a great number of small tactical bodies that were capable, now of closing together in a compact impenetrable union, now of changing the pattern with consummate flexibility, of separating one from the other and turning in this or that direction.\"<ref>Peter Paret, Gordon A. Craig, Felix Gilbert, ''Makers of Modern Strategy from Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age'' (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1986), page 337.</ref> For instance, at [[Battle of Ilipa|Ilipa]] and [[Battle of Zama|Zama]], the ''[[principes]]'' were formed up well to the rear of the ''[[hastati]]''\u2014a deployment that allowed a greater degree of mobility and maneuverability. The culminating result of this change marked the transition from the traditional [[maniple (military unit)|manipular]] system to the [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] under [[Gaius Marius]], as the basic infantry unit of the Roman army.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn addition, a unified command came to be seen as a necessity. After various political experiments, [[Scipio Africanus]] was made general-in-chief of the Roman armies in Africa, and was assured this role for the duration of the war. This appointment may have violated the constitutional laws of the [[Roman Republic]] but, as Delbr\u00fcck wrote, it \"effected an internal transformation that increased her military potentiality enormously\" while foreshadowing the decline of the Republic's political institutions. Furthermore, the battle exposed the limits of a citizen-[[militia]] army. Following Cannae, the Roman army gradually developed into a professional force: the nucleus of Scipio's army at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] was composed of veterans who had been fighting the Carthaginians in [[Hispania]] for nearly sixteen years, and had been moulded into a superb fighting force.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Status in military history===\nCannae is as famous for Hannibal's [[military tactics|tactics]] as it is for the role it played in [[Military history of ancient Rome|Roman history]]. Not only did Hannibal inflict a defeat on the Roman Republic in a manner unrepeated for over a century until the lesser-known [[Battle of Arausio]], the battle has acquired a significant reputation in [[military history]]. As military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] wrote:\n{{quote|Few battles of ancient times are more marked by ability... than the battle of Cannae.

The advance at the proper moment of the African infantry, and its wheel right and left upon the flanks of the disordered and crowded Roman legionaries, is far beyond praise.

As [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II, wrote, \"Every ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in [[modern warfare|modern war]] the classic example of Cannae\". Furthermore, the totality of Hannibal's victory has made the name \"Cannae\" a byword for military success, and is studied in detail in military academies around the world. The notion that an entire army could be encircled and annihilated within a single stroke led to a fascination among Western generals for centuries (including [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] and [[Helmuth Graf von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke]]), who attempted to emulate its tactical paradigm of envelopment and re-create their own \"Cannae\".<ref name=\"cowley\" />\nDelbr\u00fcck's seminal study of the battle had a profound influence on German military theorists, in particular the Chief of the [[German General Staff]], [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], whose eponymous \"[[Schlieffen Plan]]\" was inspired by Hannibal's double envelopment maneuver. Schlieffen taught that the \"Cannae model\" would continue to be applicable in [[maneuver warfare]] throughout the 20th century:\n\n{{quote|A battle of annihilation can be carried out today according to the same plan devised by Hannibal in long forgotten times. The enemy front is not the goal of the principal attack. The mass of the troops and the reserves should not be concentrated against the enemy front; the essential is that the flanks be crushed. The wings should not be sought at the advanced points of the front but rather along the entire depth and extension of the enemy formation. The annihilation is completed through an attack against the enemy's rear... To bring about a decisive and annihilating victory requires an attack against the front and against one or both flanks...}}\n\nSchlieffen later developed his own [[operational art|operational]] doctrine in a series of articles, many of which were translated and published in a work entitled ''Cannae''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 1991, General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], commander of [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition forces]] in the [[Gulf War]], cited Hannibal's triumph at Cannae as inspiration for the rapid and successful coalition operations during the conflict.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=180}}\n\n==Historical sources==\n[[File:The battle of Cannae.jpg|thumb|Medieval representation of the battle of Cannae]]\nThere are three main accounts of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is [[Polybius]], who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. [[Livy]] wrote in the time of Augustus, and [[Appian]] later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated\u2014\"more symbolic than factual\".{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=21\u201323}} Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=24\u201325}} Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin\u2014\"a worthless farrago\"\u2014is typical.<ref>Sabin, Philip. ''Lost Battles'', p. 183.</ref>\n\nHistorian Martin Samuels has questioned whether it was in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command.{{sfn|Samuels|1990|p=23}} Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the [[Battle of Zama]] Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes that it is impossible to be sure who was in command on the day.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=120}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Ancient sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite web|author=Appian| authorlink=Appian|title=Hannibalic War|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0230%3Atext%3DHann.%3Achapter%3D2|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|year=1999|ref=harv}}\n* Titus Livius ([[Livy]]), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita]]'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/From_the_Founding_of_the_City translation] by Cannon Roberts. \n* {{cite web|author=Plutarch|authorlink=Plutarch|title=Life of Fabius Maximus|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Fabius_Maximus*.html|year=1916|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|ref=harv}}\n* [[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Histories_(Paton_translation) translation] by W.R.

The [[Carthaginian army]], led by [[Hannibal]], [[Encirclement|surrounded]] and practically [[Battle of annihilation|annihilated]] a larger Roman army under the [[Roman consul|consuls]] [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 219 BC)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and [[Gaius Terentius Varro]]. It is regarded as one of the greatest [[military tactics|tactical]] feats in [[military history]] and one of the worst defeats in Roman history.\n\nHaving recovered from their losses at [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] (218 BC) and [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]] (217 BC), the Romans decided to engage Hannibal at [[Cannae]], with approximately 86,000 Roman and [[Socii|allied troops]]. They massed their [[heavy infantry]] in a deeper formation than usual, while Hannibal used the [[double envelopment]] tactic and surrounded his enemy, trapping the majority of the [[Roman army of the mid-Republic|Roman army]], who were then slaughtered. The loss of life on the Roman side was one of the most lethal single day's fighting in history; [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] equates the death toll at Cannae to \"the massed slaughter of the British Army on the [[First day on the Somme|first day of the Somme offensive]] in 1916.\"{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=159}} Only about 15,000 Romans, most of whom were from the garrisons of the camps and had not taken part in the battle, escaped death. Following the defeat, [[Capua]] and several other Italian [[city-state]]s defected from the Roman Republic to Carthage.\n\nAs news of this defeat reached [[Rome]], the city was gripped in panic. Authorities resorted to extraordinary measures, which included consulting the [[Sibylline Oracles]], dispatching a delegation led by [[Quintus Fabius Pictor]] to consult the [[Delphic oracle]] in Greece, and [[Human sacrifice|burying four people alive]] as a sacrifice to their gods. To raise two new [[Roman legion|legions]], the authorities lowered the draft age and enlisted criminals, debtors and even slaves. Despite the extreme loss of men and equipment, and a second massive defeat later that same year at [[Battle of Silva Litana|Silva Litana]], the Romans refused to surrender to Hannibal. His offer to ransom survivors was brusquely refused. With grim determination the Romans fought for 14 more years until they achieved victory at the [[Battle of Zama]].\n\nAlthough for most of the following decades the battle was seen solely as a major Roman disaster, by modern times Cannae acquired a mythic quality, and is often used as an example of the perfect defeat of an enemy army.\n\n==Strategic background==\n\n[[File:Hannibal route of invasion.gif|thumb|300px|Hannibal's route of invasion]]\nShortly after the start of the Second Punic War, [[Hannibal]] crossed into Italy by traversing the [[Hannibal's Crossing of the Alps|Pyrenees and the Alps]] during the summer and early autumn of 218 BC.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=28}} He quickly won major victories over the Romans at [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]] and at [[Battle of Lake Trasimene|Lake Trasimene]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=33}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=36\u201337}} After these losses, the Romans appointed [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus]] as [[Roman dictator|dictator]] to deal with the threat.<ref>[[Livy|Titus Livius]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.8</ref>{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=38}} Fabius used [[attrition warfare]] against Hannibal, cutting off his supply lines and avoiding [[pitched battle]]s.

However, the Senate feared a real threat and not only deployed all four legions to the field but all eight, including allies.<ref name=Polybius-107/> Ordinarily, each of the two consuls would command his own portion of the army, but since the two armies were combined into one, Roman law required them to alternate their command on a daily basis. The traditional account puts Varro in command on the day of the battle, and much of the blame for the defeat has been laid on his shoulders.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=119}} However, his low origins seem to be exaggerated in the sources, and Varro may have been made a [[scapegoat]] by the aristocratic establishment.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=119}} He lacked the powerful descendants that Paullus had, descendants who were willing and able to protect his reputation\u2014most notably, Paullus was the grandfather of [[Scipio Aemilianus]], the patron of Polybius (one of the main sources of this history).{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=119\u2013120}}\n\n==Prelude==\n[[Image:Monumento Battaglia di Canne.JPG|thumb|upright|250px|A modern monument near the site of the Battle of Cannae]]\nIn the spring of 216 BC Hannibal took the initiative and seized the large supply depot at Cannae, in the Apulian plain, placing himself between the Romans and their crucial source of supply.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=75}} As Polybius noted, the capture of Cannae \"caused great commotion in the Roman army; for it was not only the loss of the place and the stores in it that distressed them, but the fact that it commanded the surrounding district\".<ref name=\"polybius\" /> The consuls, resolving to confront Hannibal, marched southward in search of him.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=77}} After two days' march, they found him on the left bank of the river [[Aufidus]], and encamped {{convert|5|miles|km|spell=in|abbr=out|0}} away.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=77}}\n\nVarro, in command on the first day, is presented by contemporary sources as a man of reckless nature and [[hubris]], who was determined to defeat Hannibal. While the Romans were approaching Cannae, some of Hannibal's light infantry and cavalry [[ambush]]ed them.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=80}} Varro repelled the attack and continued slowly on his way to Cannae.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=80}} This victory, though essentially a mere skirmish with no lasting strategic value, greatly bolstered the confidence of the Roman army, perhaps leading to overconfidence on Varro's part. Paullus, however, was opposed to the engagement as it was taking shape. Unlike Varro, he was prudent and cautious, and he believed it was foolish to fight on open ground, despite the Romans' numerical strength. This was especially true since Hannibal held the advantage in cavalry (both in quality and quantity). Despite these misgivings, Paullus thought it unwise to withdraw the army after the initial success, and camped two-thirds of the army east of the river Aufidus, sending the remainder to fortify a position on the opposite side {{convert|1|miles|km|spell=in|abbr=out|0}} away from the main camp.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=81}} The purpose of this second camp was to cover the foraging parties from the main camp and harass those of the enemy.<ref>Cottrell, Leonard.

During the second day (August 1) Hannibal, aware that Varro would be in command the following day, left his camp and offered battle, but Paullus refused.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=82}} When his request was rejected, Hannibal, recognizing the importance of water from the Aufidus to the Roman troops, sent his cavalry to the smaller Roman camp to harass water-bearing soldiers that were found outside the camp fortifications.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=82}} According to Polybius,<ref name=\"polybius\" /> Hannibal's cavalry boldly rode up to the edge of the Roman encampment, causing havoc and thoroughly disrupting the supply of water to the Roman camp.<ref name=\"caven\">Caven, B. ''Punic Wars''. London: George Werdenfeld and Nicholson Ltd., 1980.</ref>\n\nOn the morning of the battle, as the forces drew up, a Carthaginian officer named [[Gisgo]] reportedly remarked to Hannibal that the size of the Roman army was astonishing. \"There is one thing, Gisgo, yet more astonishing\", Hannibal coolly replied, \"which you take no notice of.\" He then explained, \"In all those great numbers before us, there is not one man called Gisgo\", provoking laughter that spread through the Carthaginian ranks.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[Parallel Lives]]'', [[s:Lives (Dryden translation)/Fabius|\"Fabius Maximus\"]].</ref>\n\nAuthors like [[Appian]] and [[Livy]] inform that Hannibal sent a small contingent of 500-600 mercenaries to pretend to desert to the Roman side. Those men, [[Celtiberians]] according to Appian and [[Numidians]] according to Livy, would have handed their weapons to the Romans as a sign of good will while retaining hidden short swords in their clothes. Once the battle started, following Hannibal's plans, the mercenaries would have attacked, stealing weapons and shields from their victims and causing chaos and confusion in the Roman camp. However, the veracity of this part is disputed.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=43}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Date===\nAncient historians rarely provide the precise dates for the events they describe; for example, Livy provides no explicit dates for any of the battles of the Second Punic War. However, [[Macrobius]], citing the Roman annalist [[Quintus Claudius Quadrigarius]], states the battle was fought ''ante diem iiii nones [[Sextilis]]'', or 2 August.<ref>Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'', 1.1.6.26</ref>\n\nThe months of the pre-Julian [[Roman calendar]] are known not to correspond to its namesake [[Julian day]]; for example, Livy records a [[lunar eclipse]] in 168&nbsp;BC as occurring on 4 September, when astronomical calculations show it happened on Julian day 21 June of that year.<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', XLIV.37.8</ref> This discrepancy arose from the failure of the [[college of pontiffs|pontifices]] to properly perform [[intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalation]]s, either by accident or for political advantage.

They should be treated with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=32}} The Carthaginian army was a combination of warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000\u201350,000. Their infantry comprised an estimated 8,000 [[Ancient Libya|Libyans]], 5,500 [[Gaetuli]]an, 16,000 [[Gauls]], mainly [[Boii]] and [[Insubres]] (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and 8,000 of several tribes of [[Hispania]], including [[Iberians]], [[Celtiberians]] and [[Lusitanians]].{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=94}} Hannibal's cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 [[Numidians|Numidian]], 2,000 Iberian peninsular, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had an auxiliary [[skirmisher]] contingent consisting of 1,000-2,000 [[Balearics|Balearic]] [[Sling (weapon)#Written history|slingers]] and 6,000 mixed-nationality javelinmen, possibly including [[Lusitanians]] too.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=106}} The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=29\u201332}}{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=81\u2013112}}\n\n===Equipment===\nRome's forces used typical [[Roman military personal equipment#Torso armour|Roman equipment]] including ''[[Pilum|pila]]'' (heavy javelins) and ''[[hasta (spear)|hastae]]'' (thrusting spears) as weapons as well as traditional bronze helmets, bodyshields and body armor.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=44}} On the other hand, the Carthaginian army used a variety of equipment. The Iberians fought with [[falcata]]s, while Celtiberians and Lusitanians would use straight [[Gladius|gladii]],{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=100}} as well as [[javelin]]s and various types of [[spear]]s.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} For defense, warriors from Hispania carried large oval shields and often wore a crested helmet made of animal sinews.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} Most Gallic foot warriors likely had no protection other than large shields, and the typical Gallic weapon was a long slashing sword.<ref name=Polybius-114>Polybius, ''Historiae'', iii.114</ref> The Numidian cavalry were very lightly equipped, lacking saddles and bridles for their horses, and wearing no armor but carrying small shields, javelins and possibly a knife or a longer blade.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} In contrast, the heavier Iberian peninsular cavalry carried round shields, swords, javelins and thrusting spears.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=99}} The similarly heavy Gallic cavalry added the four-horned [[saddle]], with the wealthier ones being clad in mail, a Gallic invention.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=54}} Skirmishers acting as light infantry carried either slings or javelins. The [[Balearic slingers]], who were famous for their accuracy, carried short, medium and long slings used to cast stones or bullets. They may have carried a small shield or simple leather pelt on their arms, but this is uncertain. Hannibal himself, like many Roman officers on the opposing side, might have been wearing a bronze ''[[muscle cuirass|musculata]]'' and carrying a [[falcata]] as his personal sidearm.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=107\u2013108}}\n\nThe equipment of the Libyan line infantry has been much debated. Duncan Head has argued in favor of short stabbing spears.<ref name=\"Duncan Head p144\">Duncan Head, ''Armies of the Macedonian and Punic Wars'' (Wargames Research Group, 1983) p. 144.</ref> Polybius states that the Libyans fought with equipment taken from previously defeated Romans. It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well,{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=89}} though a general reading suggests he meant the whole panoply of arms and armor, and even tactical organization. Apart from his description of the battle itself, when later discussing the subject of the [[Roman legion]] versus the Greek [[phalanx]], Polybius says that \"...against Hannibal, the defeats they suffered had nothing to do with weapons or formations\" because \"Hannibal himself... discarded the equipment with which he had started out [and] armed his troops with Roman weapons\".<ref name=Polybius-114/> Gregory Daly is inclined to the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=90}} [[Peter Connolly]] has argued that they were armed as a [[Macedonian phalanx|pike phalanx]].<ref name=\"Connolly, Peter: ''Hannibal and the Enemies of Rome'' (1998), p148\">Connolly (1998), p. 148.</ref> This has been disputed by Head, because [[Plutarch]] states they carried spears shorter than the Roman [[triarii]]<ref name=\"Duncan Head p144\" /> and by Daly because they could not have carried an unwieldy pike at the same time as a heavy Roman-style shield.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=89}}\n\n===Tactical deployment===\nThe conventional deployment for armies of the time was placement of infantry in the center, with the cavalry in two flanking wings. The Romans followed this convention fairly closely, but chose extra depth rather than breadth for the infantry in hopes of breaking quickly through the center of Hannibal's [[Line (formation)|line]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=100}} Varro knew how the Roman infantry had managed to penetrate Hannibal's center at [[Battle of the Trebia|Trebia]], and he planned to recreate this on an even greater scale.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=102}} The ''[[principes]]'' were stationed immediately behind the ''[[hastati]]'', ready to push forward at first contact to ensure the Romans presented a unified front. As Polybius wrote, \"the [[maniple (military unit)|maniples]] were nearer each other, or the intervals were decreased . . . and the maniples showed more depth than front\".<ref name=\"polybius\" /><ref name=\"dodge\">[[Theodore Ayrault Dodge|Dodge, Theodore]].

The typical style of ancient warfare was to continuously pour infantry into the center and attempt to overpower the enemy.

Hasdrubal was given 6,000\u20137,000 cavalry, and [[Hanno, son of Bomilcar|Hanno]] had 3,000\u20134,000 [[Numidians]] on the right.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=108}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=112}}\n\nHannibal intended that his cavalry, comprising mainly medium Hispanic cavalry and Numidian light horse, and positioned on the flanks, would defeat the weaker Roman cavalry and swing around to attack the Roman infantry from the rear as it pressed upon Hannibal's weakened center.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=111\u2013112}} His veteran African troops would then press in from the flanks at the crucial moment, and encircle the overextended Romans.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=112}}\n\nThe Romans were in front of the hill leading to Cannae and hemmed in on their right flank by the river Aufidus, so that their left flank was the only viable means of retreat.<ref name=\"bradford\">Bradford, E. ''Hannibal''. London: Macmillan London Ltd., 1981.</ref> In addition, the Carthaginian forces had maneuvered so that the Romans would face east. Not only would the morning sun shine low into the Romans' eyes, but the southeasterly winds would blow sand and dust into their faces as they approached the battlefield.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Hannibal's deployment of his army, based on his perception of the terrain and understanding of the capabilities of his troops, proved decisive.\n\n===Battle===\nAs the armies advanced on one another, Hannibal gradually extended the center of his line, as Polybius described: \"After thus drawing up his whole army in a straight line, he took the central companies of Hispanics and Celts and advanced with them, keeping the rest of them in contact with these companies, but gradually falling off, so as to produce a crescent-shaped formation, the line of the flanking companies growing thinner as it was prolonged, his object being to employ the Africans as a reserve force and to begin the action with the Hispanics and Celts.\" Polybius described the weak Carthaginian center as deployed in a crescent, curving out toward the Romans in the middle with the African troops on their flanks in [[echelon formation]].<ref name=\"polybius\" /> It is believed that the purpose of this formation was to break the forward momentum of the Roman infantry, and delay its advance before other developments allowed Hannibal to deploy his African infantry most effectively.{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=77}} While the majority of historians feel that Hannibal's action was deliberate, some have called this account fanciful, and claim that the actions of the day represent either the natural curvature that occurs when a broad front of infantry marches forward, or the bending back of the Carthaginian center from the shock action of meeting the heavily massed Roman center.{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=84}}\n\n[[Image:Battle cannae destruction.gif|thumb|Destruction of the Roman army]]\nThe battle began with a fierce cavalry engagement on the flanks.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=118\u2013120}} Polybius described many of the Hispanic and Celtic horsemen facing the Romans dismounting due to the lack of space to fight on horseback, and called the struggle \"barbaric\" in the sense of its utter brutality.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=120}} When the Carthaginian cavalry got the upper hand, they cut down their Roman opponents without giving quarter.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=126}}<ref name=\"polybius\" /> On the other flank the Numidians engaged in a way that merely kept the Roman allied cavalry occupied.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=126}} Hasdrubal kept his victorious Hispanic and Gallic cavalry under control and did not chase the retreating Roman right wing.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=126}} Instead, he led them to the other side of the field to attack the socii cavalry still fighting the Numidians.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=149}} Assailed from both sides, the allied cavalry broke before Hasdrubal could charge into contact and the Numidians pursued them off the field.<ref name=\"polybius\" />{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=149}}\n\nWhile the Carthaginian cavalry were in the process of defeating the Roman horsemen, the masses of infantry on both sides advanced towards each other in the center of the field. The wind from the east blew dust in the Romans' faces and obscured their vision. While the wind was not a major factor, the dust that both armies created would have been potentially debilitating to sight.<ref name=\"dodge\" /> Although it made seeing difficult, troops would still have been able to see others in the vicinity. The dust, however, was not the only psychological factor involved in battle. Because of the somewhat distant battle location, both sides were forced to fight on little sleep. Another Roman disadvantage was thirst caused by Hannibal's attack on the Roman encampment during the previous day. Furthermore, the massive number of troops would have led to an overwhelming amount of background noise. All of these psychological factors made battle especially difficult for the infantrymen.{{sfn|Daly|2002}}\n\nThe light infantry on both sides engaged in indecisive skirmishing, inflicting few casualties and quickly withdrawing through the ranks of their heavy infantry.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=114\u2013116}} As the Roman heavy infantry attacked, Hannibal stood with his men in the weak center and held them together in a controlled retreat. The crescent of Hispanic and Gallic troops buckled inwards as they gradually withdrew step by step. Knowing the superiority of the Roman infantry, Hannibal had instructed his infantry to withdraw deliberately, creating an even tighter semicircle around the attacking Roman forces. By doing so, he had turned the strength of the Roman infantry into a weakness. While the front ranks were gradually advancing, the bulk of the Roman troops began to lose their cohesion, as troops from the reserve lines advanced into the growing gaps.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=147}} Soon they were compacted together so closely that they had little space to wield their weapons. In pressing so far forward in their desire to destroy the retreating and seemingly collapsing line of Hispanic and Gallic troops, the Romans had ignored (possibly due to the dust) the African troops that stood uncommitted on the projecting ends of this now-reversed crescent.{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=84}} This also gave the Carthaginian cavalry time to drive the Roman cavalry off on both flanks and attack the Roman center in the rear. The Roman infantry, now stripped of protection on both its flanks, formed a wedge that drove deeper and deeper into the Carthaginian semicircle, driving itself into an alley formed by the African infantry on the wings.<ref>Cottrell, Leonard. ''Enemy of Rome''. Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 99</ref> At this decisive point, Hannibal ordered his African infantry to turn inwards and advance against the Roman flanks, creating an [[encirclement]] in one of the earliest known examples of a [[pincer movement]].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=148}}\n\nWhen the Carthaginian cavalry attacked the Romans in the rear and the African flanking echelons assailed them on their right and left, the advance of the Roman infantry was brought to an abrupt halt.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=150}} The Romans were henceforth enclosed in a pocket with no means of escape.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=152}} The Carthaginians created a wall and began to systematically massacre them. Polybius wrote: \"as their outer ranks were continually cut down, and the survivors forced to pull back and huddle together, they were finally all killed where they stood.\"{{sfn|Healy|1994|p=85}}\n\nAs [[Livy]] described, \"So many thousands of Romans were dying... Some, whom their wounds, pinched by the morning cold, had roused, as they were rising up, covered with blood, from the midst of the heaps of slain, were overpowered by the enemy.

It is Pictor whom Livy names when reporting the casualties at the [[Battle of Trebia]].<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.7</ref> In addition to the consul Paullus, Livy goes on to record that among the dead were 2 [[quaestor]]s, 29 of the 48 [[military tribune]]s (some of consular rank, including the consul of the previous year, [[Gnaeus Servilius Geminus]], and the former [[Magister equitum]], [[Marcus Minucius Rufus]]), and 80 \"senators or men who had held offices which would have given them the right to be elected to the Senate\".<ref name=Livy-49/>\n\nLater Roman and Greco-Roman historians largely follow Livy's figures.

No other nation surely would not have been overwhelmed by such an accumulation of misfortune.|sign=[[Livy]]|source=on the Roman Senate's reaction to the defeat<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.54</ref>}}\n\nFor a brief period, the Romans were in complete disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, and the only remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as there was not a single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the [[Roman Forum|Forum]] of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the [[Adriatic Sea]] (perhaps one of the last instances of [[human sacrifice]]s by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]).<ref name=Palmer_1997>{{cite book | last = Palmer | first = Robert EA | title = Rome and Carthage at peace | publisher = Stuttgart, F.

''Enemy of Rome''. Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 102</ref> Furthermore, the morale effect of this victory was such that most of southern Italy joined Hannibal's cause. After Cannae, the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Magna Graecia|southern provinces]] of Arpi, Salapia, Herdonia, Uzentum, including the cities of [[Capua]] and [[Taranto|Tarentum]] (two of the largest city-states in Italy) revoked their allegiance to Rome and pledged their loyalty to Hannibal. As Livy noted, \"How much more serious was the defeat of Cannae than those which preceded it, can be seen by the behavior of Rome's allies; before that fateful day, their loyalty remained unshaken, now it began to waver for the simple reason that they despaired of Roman power.\"<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.61</ref> That the same year the Greek cities in Sicily were induced to revolt against Roman political control, while the Macedonian king, [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]], pledged his support to Hannibal, initiating the [[First Macedonian War]] against Rome. Hannibal also secured an alliance with the new King [[Hieronymus of Syracuse]], the only independent king left in Sicily.\n{{clear}}\n[[Image:Hannibal Slodtz Louvre MR2093.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hannibal counting the signet rings of the [[Equestrian order|Roman knights]] killed during the battle, statue by [[S\u00e9bastien Slodtz]], 1704, [[Louvre]]]]\nLivy illustrates the state of Roman morale with two vivid anecdotes. The first concerns Hannibal's brother Mago, who had returned to Carthage with news of the victory. He reported to their senate that in several engagements with the Romans Hannibal had killed over 200,000 soldiers and taken 50,000 prisoner; of six commanders, two consuls and a [[Master of horse]] had been slain; and a number of Roman allies had gone over to the Carthaginians. Then Mago concluded his report by having a collection of golden rings poured upon the council floor in front of the assembled senators. He explained that each ring belonged to one [[equites]] who had been slain in battle and had earned the ring through exceptional bravery. Livy notes one unnamed authority stated the volume of jewelry amounted to three and one-half measures ([[Congius]]?), only to add \"it is generally and more credibly held that there was not more than one measure of them\".<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxiii.11\u201312</ref>\n\nThe second concerns Lucius Caecilius Metellus and three other [[military tribune]]s, who had taken refuge at [[Canusium]] with other Roman refugees. Demoralized at the defeat, they discussed the possibility of setting sail overseas and finding employment as mercenaries for some foreign prince. Word of this meeting reached the young [[Scipio Africanus|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] who, with only a few followers, strode to where the discussion was underway and burst into the chamber holding his naked sword over their heads. Before the wavering men Scipio is reported to have cried,\n\n{{quote|I swear with all the passion in my heart that I will never desert our homeland, or permit any other citizen of Rome to leave her in the lurch.

And the rest of you, swear it too. If anyone refuse, against him this sword is drawn.<ref>Livy, ''Ab Urbe Condita'', xxii.53</ref>}}\n\nFollowing the battle, the commander of the Numidian cavalry, [[Maharbal]], urged Hannibal to seize the opportunity and march immediately on Rome. It is told that the latter's refusal caused Maharbal's exclamation: \"Of a truth the gods have not bestowed all things upon the same person. You know how to conquer, Hannibal; but you do not know how to make use of your victory.\"<ref name=\"Livy, Ab Urbe Condita, xxii.51\"/> Hannibal had good reasons to judge the strategic situation after the battle differently from Maharbal. As the historian [[Hans Delbr\u00fcck]] pointed out, due to the high numbers of killed and wounded among its ranks, the Punic army was not in a condition to perform a direct assault on Rome. It would have been a fruitless demonstration that would have nullified the psychological effect of Cannae on the Roman allies. Even if his army was at full strength, a successful siege of Rome would have required Hannibal to subdue a considerable part of the hinterland to cut the enemy's supplies and secure his own. Even after the tremendous losses suffered at Cannae and the defection of a number of her allies, Rome still had abundant manpower to prevent this and maintain considerable forces in Iberia, Sicily, Sardinia and elsewhere despite Hannibal's presence in Italy.{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1975|pp=337\u2013338}} Hannibal's conduct after the victories at Trasimene (217 BC) and Cannae, and the fact that he first attacked Rome only five years later, in 211 BC, suggests that his strategic aim was not the destruction of his foe but to dishearten the Romans by carnage on the battlefield and to wear them down to a moderate peace agreement by stripping them of their allies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|pp=162\u2013163}}{{sfn|Delbr\u00fcck|1975|pp=338\u2013339, 362}}\n\nImmediately after Cannae, Hannibal sent a delegation led by [[Carthalo]] to negotiate a peace treaty with the Senate on moderate terms. Despite the multiple catastrophes Rome had suffered, the Senate refused to parley. Instead, they redoubled their efforts, declaring full mobilization of the male Roman population, and raised new legions, enlisting landless peasants and even slaves.<ref>Cottrell, Leonard.

Evans Bros, 1965, {{ISBN|0-237-44320-1}}. p. 104</ref> So firm were these measures that the word \"peace\" was prohibited, mourning was limited to only 30 days, and public tears were prohibited even to women.<ref name=\"dodge\" />{{Rp|386}} For the remainder of the war in Italy, they did not amass such large forces under one command against Hannibal; they used several independent armies, still outnumbering the Punic forces in numbers of armies and soldiers. The war still had occasional battles, but was focused on taking strongpoints and constant fighting according to the [[Fabian strategy]]. This finally forced Hannibal with his shortage of manpower to retreat to [[Crotone|Croton]] from where he was called to Africa for the [[battle of Zama]], ending the war with a complete Roman victory.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Historical significance==\n===Effects on Roman military doctrine===\n[[Image:Shield of Henry II of France.jpg|thumb|upright|Shield of [[Henry II of France]] depicting Hannibal's victory at Cannae, an allusion to France's conflict with the Holy Roman Empire during the 16th century.]]\n\nCannae played a major role in shaping the [[Roman military structure|military structure]] and [[Roman infantry tactics, strategy and battle formations|tactical organization]] of the [[Military establishment of the Roman Republic|Roman Republican army]]. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek [[phalanx]]. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's tactic of [[double envelopment]] since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn the years following Cannae, striking reforms were introduced to address these deficiencies. First, the Romans \"articulated the phalanx, then divided it into columns, and finally split it up into a great number of small tactical bodies that were capable, now of closing together in a compact impenetrable union, now of changing the pattern with consummate flexibility, of separating one from the other and turning in this or that direction.\"<ref>Peter Paret, Gordon A.

The culminating result of this change marked the transition from the traditional [[maniple (military unit)|manipular]] system to the [[cohort (military unit)|cohort]] under [[Gaius Marius]], as the basic infantry unit of the Roman army.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn addition, a unified command came to be seen as a necessity. After various political experiments, [[Scipio Africanus]] was made general-in-chief of the Roman armies in Africa, and was assured this role for the duration of the war. This appointment may have violated the constitutional laws of the [[Roman Republic]] but, as Delbr\u00fcck wrote, it \"effected an internal transformation that increased her military potentiality enormously\" while foreshadowing the decline of the Republic's political institutions. Furthermore, the battle exposed the limits of a citizen-[[militia]] army. Following Cannae, the Roman army gradually developed into a professional force: the nucleus of Scipio's army at [[Battle of Zama|Zama]] was composed of veterans who had been fighting the Carthaginians in [[Hispania]] for nearly sixteen years, and had been moulded into a superb fighting force.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Status in military history===\nCannae is as famous for Hannibal's [[military tactics|tactics]] as it is for the role it played in [[Military history of ancient Rome|Roman history]]. Not only did Hannibal inflict a defeat on the Roman Republic in a manner unrepeated for over a century until the lesser-known [[Battle of Arausio]], the battle has acquired a significant reputation in [[military history]]. As military historian [[Theodore Ayrault Dodge]] wrote:\n{{quote|Few battles of ancient times are more marked by ability... than the battle of Cannae. The position was such as to place every advantage on Hannibal's side. The manner in which the far from perfect Hispanic and Gallic foot was advanced in a wedge in [[echelon formation|echelon]]... was first held there and then withdrawn step by step, until it had the reached the converse position... is a simple masterpiece of battle tactics. The advance at the proper moment of the African infantry, and its wheel right and left upon the flanks of the disordered and crowded Roman legionaries, is far beyond praise. The whole battle, from the Carthaginian standpoint, is a consummate piece of art, having no superior, few equal, examples in the history of war.<ref>Theodore Ayrault Dodge, ''Hannibal'' (N.Y., N.Y.: Perseus Publishing, 2004), pages 378\u2013379.</ref>}}\n\nAs [[Will Durant]] wrote, \"It was a supreme example of generalship, never bettered in history... and it set the lines of military tactics for 2,000 years\".<ref>Will Durant, ''The Story of Civilization'', vol. III (N.Y., N.Y.: Simon and Schuster, 1944), page 51.</ref>\n\nHannibal's [[double envelopment]] at Cannae is often viewed as one of the greatest battlefield maneuvers in history, and is cited as the first successful use of the [[pincer movement]] within the [[Western world]] to be recorded in detail.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Neill |first=Timothy R. |url=http://home.comcast.net/~8cv/references/rotr-handbook.pdf |title=Reconnaissance on the Rappahannock Field Manual |page=65 |accessdate=July 4, 2013 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930221705/http://home.comcast.net/~8cv/references/rotr-handbook.pdf |archivedate=September 30, 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===\"Cannae model\"===\nApart from being one of the greatest defeats inflicted on Roman arms, Cannae represents the [[archetype|archetypal]] [[battle of annihilation]], a strategy whose successful implementation has been rare in modern history. As [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force in World War II, wrote, \"Every ground commander seeks the battle of annihilation; so far as conditions permit, he tries to duplicate in [[modern warfare|modern war]] the classic example of Cannae\". Furthermore, the totality of Hannibal's victory has made the name \"Cannae\" a byword for military success, and is studied in detail in military academies around the world. The notion that an entire army could be encircled and annihilated within a single stroke led to a fascination among Western generals for centuries (including [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] and [[Helmuth Graf von Moltke|Helmuth von Moltke]]), who attempted to emulate its tactical paradigm of envelopment and re-create their own \"Cannae\".<ref name=\"cowley\" />\nDelbr\u00fcck's seminal study of the battle had a profound influence on German military theorists, in particular the Chief of the [[German General Staff]], [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], whose eponymous \"[[Schlieffen Plan]]\" was inspired by Hannibal's double envelopment maneuver. Schlieffen taught that the \"Cannae model\" would continue to be applicable in [[maneuver warfare]] throughout the 20th century:\n\n{{quote|A battle of annihilation can be carried out today according to the same plan devised by Hannibal in long forgotten times. The enemy front is not the goal of the principal attack. The mass of the troops and the reserves should not be concentrated against the enemy front; the essential is that the flanks be crushed. The wings should not be sought at the advanced points of the front but rather along the entire depth and extension of the enemy formation. The annihilation is completed through an attack against the enemy's rear... To bring about a decisive and annihilating victory requires an attack against the front and against one or both flanks...}}\n\nSchlieffen later developed his own [[operational art|operational]] doctrine in a series of articles, many of which were translated and published in a work entitled ''Cannae''.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn 1991, General [[Norman Schwarzkopf Jr.]], commander of [[Coalition of the Gulf War|coalition forces]] in the [[Gulf War]], cited Hannibal's triumph at Cannae as inspiration for the rapid and successful coalition operations during the conflict.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2001|p=180}}\n\n==Historical sources==\n[[File:The battle of Cannae.jpg|thumb|Medieval representation of the battle of Cannae]]\nThere are three main accounts of the battle, none of them contemporary. The closest is [[Polybius]], who wrote his account 50 years after the battle. [[Livy]] wrote in the time of Augustus, and [[Appian]] later still. Appian's account describes events that have no relation with those of Livy and Polybius.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Polybius portrays the battle as the ultimate nadir of Roman fortunes, functioning as a literary device such that the subsequent Roman recovery is more dramatic. For example, some argue that his casualty figures are exaggerated\u2014\"more symbolic than factual\".{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=21\u201323}} Livy portrays the Senate in the role of hero and hence assigns blame for the Roman defeat to the low-born Varro. Blaming Varro also serves to lift blame from the Roman soldiers, whom Livy has a tendency to idealize.{{sfn|Daly|2002|pp=24\u201325}} Scholars tend to discount Appian's account. The verdict of Philip Sabin\u2014\"a worthless farrago\"\u2014is typical.<ref>Sabin, Philip. ''Lost Battles'', p. 183.</ref>\n\nHistorian Martin Samuels has questioned whether it was in fact Varro in command on the day on the grounds that Paullus may have been in command on the right. The warm reception that Varro received after the battle from the Senate was in striking contrast to the savage criticism meted out to other commanders. Samuels doubts whether Varro would have been received with such warmth had he been in command.{{sfn|Samuels|1990|p=23}} Gregory Daly notes that, in the Roman military, the right was always the place of command. He suggests that at the [[Battle of Zama]] Hannibal was quoted saying that he had fought Paullus at Cannae and concludes that it is impossible to be sure who was in command on the day.{{sfn|Daly|2002|p=120}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Ancient sources===\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite web|author=Appian| authorlink=Appian|title=Hannibalic War|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0230%3Atext%3DHann.%3Achapter%3D2|publisher=Perseus Digital Library|year=1999|ref=harv}}\n* Titus Livius ([[Livy]]), ''[[Ab Urbe Condita]]'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/From_the_Founding_of_the_City translation] by Cannon Roberts. \n* {{cite web|author=Plutarch|authorlink=Plutarch|title=Life of Fabius Maximus|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Fabius_Maximus*.html|year=1916|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|ref=harv}}\n* [[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Histories_(Paton_translation) translation] by W.R.
