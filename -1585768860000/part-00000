The concept of \"Greater Nepal\" does not include those parts of Tibet that the Gurkha army occupied very briefly after defeating Tibetans in wars fought from 1789 to 1791 but from where the Gurkha army was ejected by Chinese army which defeated the Gurkha king in 1792 [[Sino-Nepalese War]].<ref name=\"Nascent\" /> In 1813, this historical \"Greater Nepal\" extended from the Sutlej to the [[Teesta River]], spanning 1,500&nbsp;km. Rule over this expanse was brief, however, and in the aftermath of the 1814-1815 war with the East India Company the Gorkhali realm was whittled down considerably. The real time Gorkhali presence in Garhwal was for a little over a decade; Kumaon for 25 years; and Sikkim for 33 years. The Treaty of Sugauli, between the Gorkhali king and the Company, was ratified in 1816. It caused Nepal's rulers to lose about 105,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory and left Nepal as it is today, with 147,181&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of present total area.

He then attacked and absorbed dozens of other small principalities and gave a new name \"Nepal\" to his Gorkha kingdom. After his death in 1775, his eldest son [[Pratap Singh Shah]] continued defeating other smaller princes and absorbing their fiefdoms. Pratap Shah died at the age of twenty-five in 1777.

Includes roads, mountain passes and the residences of important Lamas. Extends fully into the Tibetan plateau as far as Te Shoo Loomboo and the Road to Lhasa (Lassa).]]\n\n==Wars with kingdoms in neighbouring countries (India and Tibet)==\nPrithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s second son, Bahadur Shah, wanted Nepal to become a pan-Himalayan kingdom and started demanding that kings of all the hill kingdoms in the Himalayas surrender to him. He won all small kingdoms up to [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|Kali River]] in the west. He turned his attention to kingdoms in neighbouring India across the Kali River and attacked them when they rebuffed him. He defeated some of them in wars and won some areas. However, the next Shah soon lost them to the British [[East India Company]] which had come to rule much of north India by then and had become the de facto ruler of India east of [[Sutlej|Satluj]] river in place of the [[Moghul]]s, [[Maratha]]s and other kings, especially after defeating the Marathas in 1803 in [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]].\n\nBahadur Shah also attacked [[Tibet]] in 1789-1792 to control the trade routes through the mountains and the trade itself due to a dispute over contaminated silver coins and had initial success but was defeated by the Chinese who intervened in favour of Tibet. The Chinese pushed the Gorkha army back almost to the doors of Kathmandu and a desperate Bahadur Shah appealed to the British [[East India Company]] for guns and help in saving his kingdom. Thus Bahadur Shah lost his northwards gambit in Tibet but his successor kings continued their attempts westward towards [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] and eastward in [[Sikkim]] because the Sikkim army under its king [[Chogyal]] was not as powerful as the Chinese army.\n\n===Victory over Kumaon, Garhwal and Kangra kingdoms===\nThe Gorkha army invaded [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and occupied it in 1790\u201391.\n<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.uttaranchal.org.uk/coinhistory.php |title =Kumaon and Garhwal Coin History - Uttarakhand Worldwide - Excerpts from the history of Uttaranchal Through Coins |access-date =2010-10-12 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170907185020/http://www.uttaranchal.org.uk/coinhistory.php |archive-date =2017-09-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/nepal/11.htm |title=The Enclosing of Nepal |work=[[U.S. Library of Congress]] |publisher=countrystudies.us |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> Then the Gorkha army invaded [[Garhwal Kingdom]] and occupied it in 1804 after defeating its King Pradyuman Shah. In 1806, the Gorkha army absorbed all the small kingdoms like [[Sirmoor|Sirmudh state]], Hindur and Besahar lying across the Garhwal and up to [[Sutlej|Satluj]] River. In this way, the Gorkhas occupied the hilly regions such as [[Nainital]], [[Almora]] and [[Dehradun]] without crossing the [[Satluj River]]. However, when the Gorkhas crossed the Satluj river, the Gorkha's attack on [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] and siege of [[Kangra Fort]] west of Satluj river was repulsed by the Kangra king with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 1809.\n\n===Victory over Sikkim and Darjeeling===\nPreviously [[Darjeeling]] formed a part of dominions of the Raja of Sikkim, who had been engaged in an unsuccessful warfare against the Gorkhas. From 1780 the Gorkhas continually made inroads into Sikkim. In the [[Sino-Nepalese War|Sino-Nepal treaty]], Sikkim lost some of its land to Nepal and by the beginning of the 19th century, the Gorkhas had overrun Sikkim as far-eastward as the [[Teesta river|Teesta]] and had conquered and annexed the [[Terai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darjeeling.gov.in/darj-hist.html |title=History - Pre-Independence |publisher=darjeeling.gov.in |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Historical boundaries==\nBefore Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah started attacking and defeating other principalities and established Nepal as a country in 1769, there was no Nepal as it is known today. Nepal\u2019s western boundary was east of [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|Kali River]] when his second son, Bahadur Shah, thought of making Nepal a pan-Himalayan kingdom. Bahadur Shah and his successors won kingdoms west of Kali River after 1790 and extended Nepal\u2019s boundaries westward to beyond [[Sutlej|Satluj River]] until the tide turned in 1809 and [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] king repulsed Gorkha army eastward with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh.

After firmly establishing its rule over [[Delhi]] in 1803, the Company attacked the Gorkhas, defeated them in 1814\u201315 [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] and ejected them from [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]] in the area west of Kali river and in Sikkim and north Bengal east of Teesta river by 1815. The Gorkhas were forced to accept a peace treaty with the British (the [[Sugauli Treaty]]) in March 1816 just as they had been forced to a peace treaty with the Chinese (the [[Sino-Nepalese War|Sino-Nepalese Treaty]]) in 1792 and ceded to East India Company the territories in India they had won since 1791.\n\nThe British restored some Terai area to Nepal in December 1816.

These lands were surveyed by Commissioners appointed for the survey by the British government in presence of the Commissioners deputed by the Nepal [[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]; masonry pillars were erected to mark the agreed boundary of Nepal and British India and the territory was formally delivered over to the Nepali Durbar. A treaty was signed between the King of Nepal (by Maharaja Jung Bahadur Rana, on behalf of Maharajah Dheraj Soorinder (''sic'') Vikram Sah) and the British government on 1 November 1860 to secure the agreed boundaries.\n\nArticle 3 of the 1860 treaty stated \"The boundary line surveyed by the British Commissioners appointed for the purpose extending eastward from the River Kali or Sardah to the foot of the hills north of Bagowra Tal, and marked by pillars, shall henceforth be the boundary between the British Province of Oudh and the Territories of the Maharajah of Nipal.\"\n\nThe other territories in India that the Gurkha army had occupied briefly between 1791 and 1814 but lost in 1814\u201316 remained in India after transfer of some territories to Nepal in 1860 as per the treaty.\n\n==Nascent, irredentist concept==\nThe re-acquisition of the territories lost in 1814\u201315 war by the Gurkha king or ceded in 1816 by the Sugauli treaty between the British [[East India Company]] and the Gurkha king is a goal held by some Nepali political groups.<ref name=\"Complete (Greater) Nepal\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-10-25/india/27867268_1_india-and-nepal-prachanda-maoist-camps |title=Nepal Maoists claim parts of India |author=Pervez Iqbal Siddiqui |date=25 October 2005 |newspaper=The Times of India |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> \"Greater Nepal\" is a concept that started to be talked about by the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] after the year 2000.

The Gorkha king had come into their possession after defeating some kings in wars and he had lost them again to another power after being defeated by the other power within less than twenty five years. Until the 19th century (and even in early 20th century until the [[World War I|first world war]]), kings and kingdoms fought wars, won territories and lost territories; some kingdoms or countries disappeared from maps while some new countries appeared on maps and the borders of many countries changed.

Rule over this expanse was brief, however, and in the aftermath of the 1814-1815 war with the East India Company the Gorkhali realm was whittled down considerably. The real time Gorkhali presence in Garhwal was for a little over a decade; Kumaon for 25 years; and Sikkim for 33 years. The Treaty of Sugauli, between the Gorkhali king and the Company, was ratified in 1816. It caused Nepal's rulers to lose about 105,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of territory and left Nepal as it is today, with 147,181&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of present total area.

He defeated major principalities in wars and unified them under his rule starting from the 1740s ending with shifting of his [[Gorkha Kingdom]]\u2019s capital from [[Gorkha district|Gorkha]] region to [[Kathmandu]] in 1769. He then attacked and absorbed dozens of other small principalities and gave a new name \"Nepal\" to his Gorkha kingdom. After his death in 1775, his eldest son [[Pratap Singh Shah]] continued defeating other smaller princes and absorbing their fiefdoms. Pratap Shah died at the age of twenty-five in 1777. Then Prithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s second son, [[Bahadur Shah of Nepal|Bahadur Shah]], ruled until 1794.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.karma99.com/2015/03/timeline-of-unification-of-nepal.html?m=1 |title=Timeline of the Unification of Nepal (1744-1791)  |date= |publisher=Karma99 |access-date=9 July 2017 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1814 Thomson Map of Northern India and Nepal - Geographicus - IndiaNepal-t-1814.jpg|200px|thumb|This fascinating hand coloured 1814 map by Edinburgh cartographer John Thomson depicts northern India and Nepal.

Includes roads, mountain passes and the residences of important Lamas. Extends fully into the Tibetan plateau as far as Te Shoo Loomboo and the Road to Lhasa (Lassa).]]\n\n==Wars with kingdoms in neighbouring countries (India and Tibet)==\nPrithvi Narayan Shah\u2019s second son, Bahadur Shah, wanted Nepal to become a pan-Himalayan kingdom and started demanding that kings of all the hill kingdoms in the Himalayas surrender to him. He won all small kingdoms up to [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|Kali River]] in the west. He turned his attention to kingdoms in neighbouring India across the Kali River and attacked them when they rebuffed him. He defeated some of them in wars and won some areas. However, the next Shah soon lost them to the British [[East India Company]] which had come to rule much of north India by then and had become the de facto ruler of India east of [[Sutlej|Satluj]] river in place of the [[Moghul]]s, [[Maratha]]s and other kings, especially after defeating the Marathas in 1803 in [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]].\n\nBahadur Shah also attacked [[Tibet]] in 1789-1792 to control the trade routes through the mountains and the trade itself due to a dispute over contaminated silver coins and had initial success but was defeated by the Chinese who intervened in favour of Tibet. The Chinese pushed the Gorkha army back almost to the doors of Kathmandu and a desperate Bahadur Shah appealed to the British [[East India Company]] for guns and help in saving his kingdom. Thus Bahadur Shah lost his northwards gambit in Tibet but his successor kings continued their attempts westward towards [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] and eastward in [[Sikkim]] because the Sikkim army under its king [[Chogyal]] was not as powerful as the Chinese army.\n\n===Victory over Kumaon, Garhwal and Kangra kingdoms===\nThe Gorkha army invaded [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and occupied it in 1790\u201391.\n<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.uttaranchal.org.uk/coinhistory.php |title =Kumaon and Garhwal Coin History - Uttarakhand Worldwide - Excerpts from the history of Uttaranchal Through Coins |access-date =2010-10-12 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20170907185020/http://www.uttaranchal.org.uk/coinhistory.php |archive-date =2017-09-07 |url-status =dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/nepal/11.htm |title=The Enclosing of Nepal |work=[[U.S. Library of Congress]] |publisher=countrystudies.us |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref> Then the Gorkha army invaded [[Garhwal Kingdom]] and occupied it in 1804 after defeating its King Pradyuman Shah. In 1806, the Gorkha army absorbed all the small kingdoms like [[Sirmoor|Sirmudh state]], Hindur and Besahar lying across the Garhwal and up to [[Sutlej|Satluj]] River. In this way, the Gorkhas occupied the hilly regions such as [[Nainital]], [[Almora]] and [[Dehradun]] without crossing the [[Satluj River]]. However, when the Gorkhas crossed the Satluj river, the Gorkha's attack on [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] and siege of [[Kangra Fort]] west of Satluj river was repulsed by the Kangra king with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh of [[Punjab region|Punjab]] in 1809.\n\n===Victory over Sikkim and Darjeeling===\nPreviously [[Darjeeling]] formed a part of dominions of the Raja of Sikkim, who had been engaged in an unsuccessful warfare against the Gorkhas. From 1780 the Gorkhas continually made inroads into Sikkim. In the [[Sino-Nepalese War|Sino-Nepal treaty]], Sikkim lost some of its land to Nepal and by the beginning of the 19th century, the Gorkhas had overrun Sikkim as far-eastward as the [[Teesta river|Teesta]] and had conquered and annexed the [[Terai]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.darjeeling.gov.in/darj-hist.html |title=History - Pre-Independence |publisher=darjeeling.gov.in |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Historical boundaries==\nBefore Gorkha king Prithvi Narayan Shah started attacking and defeating other principalities and established Nepal as a country in 1769, there was no Nepal as it is known today. Nepal\u2019s western boundary was east of [[Kali River (Uttarakhand)|Kali River]] when his second son, Bahadur Shah, thought of making Nepal a pan-Himalayan kingdom. Bahadur Shah and his successors won kingdoms west of Kali River after 1790 and extended Nepal\u2019s boundaries westward to beyond [[Sutlej|Satluj River]] until the tide turned in 1809 and [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] king repulsed Gorkha army eastward with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In the east, Nepal\u2019s boundary extended to [[Teesta River]]. The southern border was the [[Siwan district]] of [[Bihar]] and the southern border of Nepal extended to [[Allahabad]] after absorption of Palpa Kingdom, including the [[Terai]] sector of Butwal taken by the king of [[Palpa district|Palpa]] from the king of [[Awadh]] on lease in 1801.\n\n{{multiple image\n| image1 = Joppen1907India1795a.jpg | width1= 400\n| caption1 = British India and Nepal in 1795.
