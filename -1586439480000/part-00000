And throughout the land, everyone was happy... until the sun went down and they saw that their daughter was cursed with a frightful enchantment that took hold each and every night. Desperate, they sought the help of a fairy godmother who had them lock the young princess away in a tower, there to await the kiss... of the handsome Prince Charming. [horse whinnies] It was he who would chance the perilous journey through blistering cold and scorching desert traveling for many days and nights, risking life and limb to reach the Dragon's keep. [crows caw] For he was the bravest, and most handsome... in all the land. And it was destiny that his kiss would break the dreaded curse. He alone would climb to the highest room of the tallest tower to enter the princess's chambers, cross the room to her sleeping silhouette, pull back the gossamer curtains to find her... [gasps] What? - Princess... Fiona? - No! [sighs relief] Oh, thank heavens. Where is she? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? - She's on her honeymoon. - Honeymoon? With whom? [ Counting Crows: Accidentally In Love] So she said what's the problem, baby? What's the problem? I don't know Well, maybe I'm in love Think about it every time I think 'bout it Can't stop thinking 'bout it How much longer will it take to cure this? Just to cure it, 'cause I can't ignore it If it's love, love Makes me wanna turn around and face me But I don't know nothing 'bout love Oh, come on, come on - [screams] - Turn a little faster Come on, come on The world will follow after Come on, come on Everybody's after love So I said I'm a snowball running Running down into this spring that's coming all this love Melting under blue skies belting out sunlight Shimmering love Well, baby, I surrender To the strawberry ice cream Never ever end of all this love Well, I didn't mean to do it But there's no escaping your love These lines of lightning mean we're never alone Never alone, no, no Come on, come on Jump a little higher Come on, come on If you feel a little lighter Come on, come on We were once upon a time in love Hyah!

[Donkey sings] - Two can be as bad as one... - Donkey? Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you two a sight for sore eyes! Give us a hug, Shrek, you old love machine. [chuckles] And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How 'bout a side of sugar for the steed? Donkey, what are you doing here? Taking care of your love nest for you. Oh, you mean like... sorting the mail and watering the plants? - Yeah, and feeding the fish! - I don't have any fish. You do now. I call that one Shrek and the other Fiona. That Shrek is a rascally devil. Get your... Look at the time. I guess you'd better be going. Don't you want to tell me about your trip? Or how about a game of Parcheesi? Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you be getting home to Dragon? Oh, yeah, that. I don't know. She's been all moody and stuff lately. I thought I'd move in with you. You know we're always happy to see you, Donkey. But Fiona and I are married now. We need a little time, you know, to be together. Just with each other. Alone. Say no more. You don't have to worry about a thing. I will always be here to make sure nobody bothers you. - Donkey! - Yes, roomie? You're bothering me. Oh, OK. All right, cool. I guess... Me and Pinocchio was going to catch a tournament, anyway, so... Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday for a barbecue or something. He'll be fine. Now, where were we? [giggles] Oh. I think I remember. - Donkey! - [Fiona yelps] I know, I know! Alone! I'm going! I'm going. What do you want me to tell these other guys? [fanfare] [ theme to Hawaii Five-O] Enough, Reggie. [clears throat] \"Dearest Princess Fiona. \"You are hereby summoned to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away \"for a royal ball in celebration of your marriage \"at which time the King \"will bestow his royal blessing... upon you and your...\" uh...\"Prince Charming. \"Love, the King and Queen of Far, Far Away. \"aka Mom and Dad.\" Mom and Dad? - Prince Charming? - Royal ball? Can I come? - We're not going. - [both] What? I mean, don't you think they might be a bit... shocked to see you like this? [chuckles] Well, they might be a bit surprised. But they're my parents, Shrek. They love me. And don't worry. They'll love you, too. Yeah, right. Somehow I don't think I'll be welcome at the country club. Stop it. They're not like that. How do you explain Sergeant Pompous and the Fancy Pants Club Band? Oh, come on! You could at least give them a chance. To do what? Sharpen their pitchforks? No! They just want to give you their blessing. Oh, great. Now I need their blessing? If you want to be a part of this family, yes! Who says I want to be part of this family? You did! When you married me! Well, there's some fine print for you! [exasperated sigh] So that's it. You won't come? Trust me. It's a bad idea. We are not going! And that's final! Come on! We don't want to hit traffic! [Gingy] Don't worry! We'll take care of everything. [all cheer] - Hey, wait for me. Oof! - [glass breaks] [sighs] [ Chic: Le Freak] Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head 'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Rawhide! Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Move 'em on! Rawhide! Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead! Make 'em tea! Buy 'em drinks! Meet their mamas! Milk 'em hard! Rawhide! Yee-haw! - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Shrek] No. - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Fiona] Not yet. - [Donkey] OK, are we there yet? - [Fiona] No. - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Shrek] No! - [Donkey] Are we there yet? - [Shrek] Yes. - Really? - No! - Are we there yet? - [Fiona] No! - Are we there yet? - [Shrek] We are not! - Are we there yet? - [Shrek & Fiona] No! - Are we there yet? - [Shrek mimics] - That's not funny. That's really immature. - [Shrek mimics] - This is why nobody likes ogres. - [Shrek mimics] - Your loss! - [Shrek mimics] - I'm gonna just stop talking. - Finally! This is taking forever, Shrek. There's no in-flight movie or nothing! The Kingdom of Far, Far Away, Donkey. That's where we're going. Far, far... [softly] away! All right, all right, I get it. I'm just so darn bored. Well, find a way to entertain yourself. [sighs] [deep sigh] [clicks tongue] [popping] - [popping] - [exasperated sigh] For five minutes... Could you not be yourself... [shouts]... for five minutes! - [popping] - [shrieks] Are we there yet? - [chuckles] Yes! - Oh, finally! [fanfare] [ Lipps, Inc: Funkytown] Wow!

Gotta make a move to a town that's right for me We are definitely not in the swamp anymore. [whistle] Halt! Well, I talk about it, talk about it, talk about it, talk about it Hey, everyone, look. Talk about, talk about movin'... Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh? You working that hat. [Donkey] Swimming pools! Movie stars! [cheering] [applause] [fanfare] Announcing the long-awaited return of the beautiful Princess Fiona and her new husband. Well, this is it. - This is it. - This is it. This is it. [fanfare] [fanfare and cheering stop] [gasps] [tweeting] [baby wails] Uh... why don't you guys go ahead? I'll park the car. [chuckles] So... you still think this was a good idea? Of course! Look. Mom and Dad look happy to see us. - [softly] Who on earth are they? - [softly] I think that's our little girl. That's not little! That's a really big problem. Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince Charming and break the spell? Well, he's no Prince Charming, but they do look... [softly] Happy now? We came. We saw them. Now let's go before they light the torches. - They're my parents. - Hello? They locked you in a tower. That was for my own... Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back inside and pretend we're not home. Harold, we have to be... Quick! While they're not looking we can make a run for it. Shrek, stop it! Everything's gonna be... A disaster! There is no way... - You can do this. - I really... - Really... - don't... want... to... be... Here! Mom... Dad... I'd like you to meet my husband... Shrek. Well, um... It's easy to see where Fiona gets her good looks from. [chuckles nervously] [gulps] [belches] - Excuse me. - [Shrek & Fiona laugh] Better out than in, I always say, eh, Fiona? [both giggle] [Shrek] That's good. I guess not. What do you mean, \"not on the list\"? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What do you mean, \"not on the list\"? Don't tell me you don't know who I am. What's happening, everybody? Thanks for waiting. - I had the hardest time finding this place. - No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down! No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right. He's with us. - He helped rescue me from the dragon. - That's me: the noble steed. Waiter! How 'bout a bowl for the steed? Oh, boy. [slurps] - Um, Shrek? - Yeah? Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs Q. Mmm! No, no. Darling. [chuckles nervously] Oh! So, Fiona, tell us about where you live. Well... Shrek owns his own land. - Don't you, honey? - Oh, yes! It's in an enchanted forest abundant in squirrels and cute little duckies and... [laughing] What? I know you ain't talking about the swamp. An ogre from a swamp. Oh! How original. I suppose that would be a fine place to raise the children. - [splutters] - [chokes] It's a bit early to be thinking about that, isn't it? - Indeed. I just started eating. - Harold! - What's that supposed to mean? - Dad. It's great, OK? - For his type, yes. - My type? I got to go to the bathroom. - Dinner is served! - Never mind. I can hold it. Bon appetit! Oh, Mexican food! My favorite. Let's not sit here with our tummies rumbling. Everybody dig in. Don't mind if I do, Lillian. I suppose any grandchildren I could expect from you would be... Ogres, yes! Not that there's anything wrong with that. Right, Harold? Oh, no! No! Of course, not! That is, assuming you don't eat your own young! Dad! No, we usually prefer the ones who've been locked away in a tower! - Shrek, please! - I only did that because I love her. Aye, day care or dragon-guarded castle. You wouldn't understand. You're not her father! It's so nice to have the family together for dinner. - Harold! - Shrek! - Fiona! - Fiona! - Mom! - Harold... Donkey! [glissando] Your fallen tears have called to me So, here comes my sweet remedy I know what every princess needs For her to live life happily... [both gasp] Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you. You're all grown up. - Who are you? - Oh, sweet pea! I'm your fairy godmother. - I have a fairy godmother? - Shush, shush. Now, don't worry. I'm here to make it all better. With just a... Wave of my magic wand Your troubles will soon be gone With a flick of the wrist and just a flash You'll land a prince with a ton of cash A high-priced dress made by mice no less Some crystal glass pumps And no more stress Your worries will vanish, your soul will cleanse Confide in your very own furniture friends We'll help you set a new fashion trend - I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great - The kind of girl a prince would date!

Nip and tuck, here and there To land that prince with the perfect hair Stop! [chuckles] Look... Thank you very much, Fairy Godmother, but I really don't need all this. [gasps and mutterings of disapproval] - Fine. Be that way. - We didn't like you, anyway. - [knocking] - [Shrek] Fiona? Fiona? [dog barks] Oh! You got a puppy? All I got in my room was shampoo. Oh, uh... Fairy Godmother, furniture... [giggles] I'd like you to meet my husband, Shrek. Your husband? What? What did you say? When did this happen? Shrek is the one who rescued me. - But that can't be right. - Oh, great, more relatives! She's just trying to help. Good! She can help us pack. Get your coat, dear. We're leaving. - What? - I don't want to leave. When did you decide this? - Shortly after arriving. - Look, I'm sorry... No, that's all right. I need to go, anyway. But remember, dear. If you should ever need me... happiness... is just a teardrop away. Thanks, but we've got all the happiness we need. Happy, happy, happy... [laughs] So I see. Let's go, Kyle. - Very nice, Shrek. - What? I told you coming here was a bad idea. You could've at least tried to get along with my father. I don't think I was going to get Daddy's blessing, even if I did want it. Do you think it might be nice if somebody asked me what I wanted? Sure. Do you want me to pack for you? You're unbelievable! You're behaving like a... - Go on! Say it! - Like an ogre! Here's a news flash for you! Whether your parents like it or not... I am an ogre! - [yelps] - [roars] And guess what, Princess? That's not about to change. I've made changes for you, Shrek. Think about that. That's real smooth, Shrek. \"I'm an ogre!\" [mimics Shrek roaring] [sniffling] I knew this would happen. [Lillian] You should. You started it. I can hardly believe that, Lillian. He's the ogre. Not me. I think, Harold, you're taking this a little too personally. This is Fiona's choice. But she was supposed to choose the prince we picked for her. I mean, you expect me to give my blessings to this... thing? Fiona does. And she'll never forgive you if you don't. I don't want to lose our daughter again, Harold. Oh, you act as if love is totally predictable. Don't you remember when we were young? We used to walk down by the lily pond and... - they were in bloom... - Our first kiss. It's not the same! I don't think you realize that our daughter has married a monster! Oh, stop being such a drama king. Fine! Pretend there's nothing wrong! La, di, da, di, da! Isn't it all wonderful! I'd like to know how it could get any worse! - Hello, Harold. - [gasps] - What happened? - Nothing, dear! Just the old crusade wound playing up a bit! [chuckles] I'll just stretch it out here for a while. You better get in. We need to talk. Actually, Fairy Godmother, off to bed. [yawns] Already taken my pills, and they tend to make me a bit drowsy. So, how about... we make this a quick visit. What? Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha! So, what's new? You remember my son, Prince Charming? Is that you? My gosh! It's been years. When did you get back? Oh, about five minutes ago, actually. After I endured blistering winds, scorching desert... I climbed to the highest room in the tallest tower... Mommy can handle this. He endures blistering winds and scorching desert! He climbs to the highest bloody room of the tallest bloody tower... And what does he find? Some gender-confused wolf telling him that his princess is already married. It wasn't my fault. He didn't get there in time. Stop the car! [crash] Harold. You force me to do something I really don't want to do. [gasps] Where are we? Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy! May I take your order? My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy. Er... okay. Two Renaissance Wraps, no mayo... chili rings... - I'll have the Medieval Meal. - One Medieval Meal and, Harold... - Curly fries? - No, thank you. - Sourdough soft taco, then? - No, really, I'm fine. Your order, Fairy Godmother. This comes with the Medieval Meal. There you are, dear. We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you don't want me to go back on my part. [sighs deeply] Indeed not. So, Fiona and Charming will be together. - Yes. - Believe me, Harold. It's what's best. Not only for your daughter... but for your Kingdom. What am I supposed to do about it? Use your imagination. [whooshing] [whinnies] Oh... Come on in, Your Majesty. [piano plays, people talk] I like my town With a little drop of poison Nobody knows... [barman belches] [clears throat] Excuse me. Do I know you? No, you must be mistaking me for someone else. Uh... excuse me. I'm looking for the Ugly Stepsister. Ah! There you are. Right. You see, I need to have someone taken care of. - Who's the guy? - Well, he's not a guy, per se. Um... He's an ogre. [crowd gasp] Hey, buddy, let me clue you in. There's only one fellow who can handle a job like that, and, frankly... he don't like to be disturbed. he don't like to be disturbed. Where could I find him? [knock on door] Hello? Who dares enter my room? Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but I'm told you're the one to talk to about an ogre problem? You are told correct. But for this, I charge a great deal of money. Would... this be enough? You have engaged my valuable services, Your Majesty. Just tell me where I can find this ogre. [ Eels: I Need Some Sleep] [snoring] [chimes] Everyone says I'm getting down too low Everyone says you've just gotta let it go You just gotta let it go I need some sleep Time to put the old horse down I'm in too deep And the wheels keep spinning round Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Everyone says you've just gotta let it go Dear Knight, I pray that you take this favor as a token of my gratitude. [plays tune] Dear Diary... Sleeping Beauty is having a slumber party tomorrow, but Dad says I can't go. He never lets me out after sunset. Dad says I'm going away for a while. Must be like some finishing school. Mom says that when I'm old enough, my Prince Charming will rescue me from my tower and bring me back to my family, and we'll all live happily ever after. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. Mrs. Fiona Charming. [echoing] Mrs. Fiona Charming. [knock on door] Sorry. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. No, no. I was just reading a, uh... a scary book. I was hoping you'd let me apologize for my despicable behavior earlier. - Okay... - I don't know what came over me. Do you suppose we could pretend it never happened and start over... - Look, Your Majesty, I just... - Please. Call me Dad. Dad. We both acted like ogres. Maybe we just need some time to get to know each other. Excellent idea! I was actually hoping you might join me for a morning hunt. A little father-son time? I know it would mean the world to Fiona. [sighs] Shall we say, : by the old oak? [birds twitter] [Shrek] Face it, Donkey! We're lost. We can't be lost. We followed the King's instructions exactly. \"Head to the darkest part of the woods...\" \"Past the sinister trees with scary-looking branches.\" - The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey! - We passed that three times already! You were the one who said not to stop for directions. Oh, great. My one chance to fix things up with Fiona's dad and I end up lost in the woods with you! Don't get huffy! I'm only trying to help. I know! I know. - I'm sorry, all right? - Hey, don't worry about it. I just really need to make things work with this guy. Yeah, sure. Now let's go bond with Daddy. [purring] [purring] Well, well, well, Donkey. I know it was kind of a tender moment back there, but the purring? What? I ain't purring. Sure. What's next? A hug? Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What do you think I am, some kind of a... Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare! [hisses] Look! A little cat. - Look out, Shrek! He got a piece! - It's a cat, Donkey. Come here, little kitty, kitty. Come on, little kitty. Come here. Oh! Come here, little kitty. - [screaming] - Whoa! - Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming! - Come on! Get it off! Get it off! Oh, God. Oh... No! - Look out, Shrek! Hold still! - Get it off! Shrek! Hold still! - Did I miss? - No. You got them. Now, ye ogre, pray for mercy from... Puss... in Boots! I'll kill that cat! Ah-ha-ha! [coughs] [wheezes] [retches] [coughs] - [chuckles] Hairball. - Oh! That is nasty! What should we do with him? Take the sword and neuter him. Give him the Bob Barker treatment. Oh, no! Por favor! Please! I implore you! It was nothing personal, Se\u00f1or. I was doing it only for my family. My mother, she is sick. And my father lives off the garbage! The King offered me much in gold and I have a litter of brothers... Whoa, whoa, whoa! Fiona's father paid you to do this? The rich King? S\u00ed. [screams] Well, so much for Dad's royal blessing. Don't feel bad. Almost everybody that meets you wants to kill you. Gee, thanks. Maybe Fiona would've been better off if I were some sort of Prince Charming. That's what the King said. Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that question was directed at me. Shrek, Fiona knows you'd do anything for her. Well, it's not like I wouldn't change if I could. I just... I just wish I could make her happy. Hold the phone... \"Happiness.\" \"A tear drop away.\" Donkey! Think of the saddest thing that's ever happened to you! Aw, man, where do I begin? First there was the time that old farmer tried to sell me for some magic beans. Then this fool had a party and he have the guests trying to pin the tail on me. Then they got drunk and start beating me with a stick, going \"Pi\u00f1ata!!\" What is a pi\u00f1ata, anyway? No, Donkey! I need you to cry! Don't go projecting on me. I know you're feeling bad, but you got to... Aaaahhh! You little, hairy, litter-licking sack of... What? Is it on? Is it on? [clears throat] This is Fairy Godmother. I'm either away from my desk or with a client. But if you come by the office, we'll be glad to make you an appointment. Have a \"happy ever after.\" Oh... Are you up for a little quest, Donkey? That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey, on another whirlwind adventure! Ain't no stoppin' us now! Whoo! We're on the move! - Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you. - Join the club. We've got jackets. On my honor, I am obliged to accompany you until I have saved your life as you have spared me mine. The position of annoying talking animal has already been taken. Let's go, Shrek. Shrek? - Shrek! - Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him... in his wee little boots. You know, how many cats can wear boots? Honestly. - Let's keep him! - Say what? [purrs] Ahh! Listen. He's purring! - Oh, so now it's cute. - Come on, Donkey. Lighten up. Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look who's telling who to lighten up! [giggles] Shrek! [barks] [barks] Shrek? They're both festive, aren't they? What do you think, Harold? Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine. [sighs] Try to at least pretend you're interested in your daughter's wedding ball. Honestly, Lillian, I don't think it matters. How do we know there will even be a ball? Mom. Dad. - Oh, hello, dear. - What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming. Mom, have you seen Shrek? I haven't. You should ask your father. Be sure and use small words, dear. He's a little slow this morning. - Can I help you, Your Majesty? - Ah, yes! Um... Mmm! Exquisite. What do you call this dish? That would be the dog's breakfast, Your Majesty. Ah, yes. Very good, then. Carry on, Cedric. - Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek? - No, I haven't, dear. I'm sure he just went off to look for a nice... mud hole to cool down in. You know, after your little spat last night. Oh. You heard that, huh? The whole kingdom heard you. I mean, after all, it is in his nature to be... well, a bit of a brute. Him? You know, you didn't exactly roll out the Welcome Wagon. Well, what did you expect? Look at what he's done to you. Shrek loves me for who I am. I would think you'd be happy for me. Darling, I'm just thinking about what's best for you. Maybe you should do the same. [both whisper] No, really? [both laugh] [Shrek] Shh... Oh... [hooter blasts] Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place. Let's back away slowly. That's the Fairy Godmother's cottage. She's the largest producer of hexes and potions in the whole kingdom. Then why don't we pop in there for a spell? Ha-ha! Spell! [Puss in Boots shrieks with laughter] [Puss in Boots] He makes me laugh. Hi. I'm here to see the... The Fairy Godmother. I'm sorry. She is not in. Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo. Now! [sighs] Yes, Fairy Godmother. Right away. Look, she's not seeing any clients today, OK? That's OK, buddy. We're from the union. The union? We represent the workers in all magical industries, both evil and benign. Oh! Oh, right. Are you feeling at all degraded or oppressed? Uh... a little. We don't even have dental. They don't even have dental. Okay, we'll just have a look around. Oh. By the way. I think it'd be better if the Fairy Godmother didn't know we were here. - Know what I'm saying? Huh? - Huh? Huh? Huh? - Stop it. - Of course. Go right in. [voices and grinding machines] [explosion] A drop of desire. [giggles] Naughty! A pinch of passion. [laughs] And just a hint of... lust! [laughs] - [Shrek] Excuse me. - [gasps] Sorry to barge in like this... What in Grimm's name are you doing here? Well, it seems that Fiona's not exactly happy. Oh-ho-ho! And there's some question as to why that is? Well, let's explore that, shall we? Ah. P, P, P... Princess. Cinderella. Here we are. \"Lived happily ever after.\" Oh... [laughs] No ogres! Let's see. Snow White. A handsome prince. Oh, no ogres. Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres! Hansel and Gretel? No! Thumbelina? No. The Golden Bird, the Little Mermaid, Pretty Woman... No, no, no, no, no! You see, ogres don't live happily ever after. All right, look, lady! Don't you point... those dirty green sausages at me! Your Monte Cristo and coffee. Oh! Sorry. Ah... that's okay. We were just leaving. Very sorry to have wasted your time, Miss Godmother. Just... go. Come on, guys. [whistles tune] TGIF, eh, buddy? Working hard or hardly working, eh, Mac? Get your fine Corinthian footwear and your cat cheeks out of my face! Man, that stinks! You don't exactly smell like a basket of roses. - Well, one of these has got to help. - I was just concocting this very plan! Already our minds are becoming one. Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call. Shrek, this is a bad idea. Look. Make yourself useful and go keep watch. Puss, do you think you could get to those on top? No problema, boss. In one of my nine lives, I was the great cat burglar of Santiago de Compostela. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Shrek, are you off your nut? Donkey, keep watch. Keep watch? Yeah, I'll keep watch. I'll watch that wicked witch come and whammy a world of hurt up your backside. I'll laugh, too. I'll be giggling to myself. - What do you see? - Toad Stool Softener? I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect solution for marital problems. - Elfa Seltzer? - Uh-uh. - Hex Lax? - No! Try \"handsome.\" Sorry. No handsome. Hey! How about \"Happily Ever After\"?

Just get this place cleaned up! And somebody bring me something deep fried and smothered in chocolate! - Mother! - Charming. Sweetheart. This isn't a good time, pumpkin. Mama's working. Whoa, what happened here? - The ogre, that's what! - What? Where is he, Mom? I shall rend his head from his shoulders! I will smite him where he stands! He will rue the very day he stole my kingdom from me! Oh, put it away, Junior! You're still going to be king. We'll just have to come up with something smarter. Pardon. Um... Everything is accounted for, Fairy Godmother, except for one potion. What? Oh... I do believe we can make this work to our advantage. \"Happily Ever After Potion. Maximum strength. \"For you and your true love. \"If one of you drinks this, you both will be fine. \"Happiness, comfort and beauty divine.\" - You both will be fine? - I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too. Hey, man, this don't feel right. My donkey senses are tingling all over. Drop that jug o' voodoo and let's get out of here. It says, \"Beauty Divine.\" How bad can it be? [sneezes] See, you're allergic to that stuff. You'll have a reaction. And if you think that I'll be smearing Vapor Rub over your chest, think again! Boss, just in case there is something wrong with the potion... allow me to take the first sip. It would be an honor to lay my life on the line for you. Oh, no, no. I don't think so. If there'll be any animal testing, I'll do it. That's the best friend's job. Now give me that bottle. How do you feel? I don't feel any different. I look any different? You still look like an ass to me. Maybe it doesn't work on donkeys. - Well, here's to us, Fiona. - Shrek? - You drink that, there's no going back. - I know. - No more wallowing in the mud? - I know. - No more itchy butt crack? - I know! - But you love being an ogre! - I know! But I love Fiona more. Shrek, no! Wait! [gurgling] [farts] Got to be... I think you grabbed the \"Farty Ever After\" potion. Maybe it's a dud. Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. Or maybe Fiona and I were never meant to be. [thunder rumbles] Uh-oh. What did I tell you? I feel something coming on. I don't want to die. I don't want to die. I don't want to die! Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy. I'm melting! I'm melting! It's just the rain, Donkey. [chuckles] Oh. Don't worry. Things seem bad because it's dark and rainy and Fiona's father hired a sleazy hitman to whack you. [hisses] lt'll be better in the morning. You'll see... The sun'll come out... Tomorrow [yawns] Bet your bottom... Bet my bottom? I'm coming, Elizabeth! Donkey? Are you all right? - Hey, boss. Let's shave him. - D-Donkey? [groans] [Puss In Boots shrieks] There you are! We missed you at dinner. What is it, darling? Dad... I've been thinking about what you said. And I'm going to set things right. Ah! Excellent! That's my girl. It was a mistake to bring Shrek here. I'm going to go out and find him. And then we'll go back to the swamp where we belong. [Lillian] Fiona, please! Let's not be rash, darling. You can't go anywhere right now. [rain patters] [Both] Fiona! Look, I told you he was here. Look at him! Quiet. Look at him. [Shrek groans] Good morning, sleepyhead. [Shrek shouts] [All] Good morning!

I'll be your true love! - I'll be your true love. I'll be true... enough. Look, ladies, I already have a true love. [all] Oh... And take it from me, Boss. You are going to have one satisfied Princess. And let's face it. You are a lot easier on the eyes. Inside you're the same old mean, salty... - Easy. ...cantankerous, foul, angry ogre you always been. And you're still the same annoying donkey. - Yeah. - [sighs] Well... Look out, Princess. Here comes the new me. First things first. - We need to get you out of those clothes. - [all gasp] - Ready? - Ready! - [Donkey screams] - Driver, stop! Oh, God! Help me, please! My racing days are over! I'm blind! Tell the truth. Will I ever play the violin again? You poor creature! Is there anything I can do for you? Well, I guess there is one thing. Take off the powdered wig and step away from your drawers. - Not bad. - Not bad at all. [both laugh] Father? Is everything all right, Father? Thank you, gentlemen! Someday, I will repay you.

Tell Princess Fiona her husband, Sir Shrek, is here to see her. Still don't know what I was looking for And my time was running wild, a million dead-end streets Every time I thought I'd got it made It seemed the taste was not so sweet - [screams] - Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn and face the strange - Shrek? - Ch-Ch-Changes Don't wanna be a richer one Time may change me But I can't trace time Fiona? Hello, handsome. Shrek! - Princess! - Donkey? Wow! That potion worked on you, too? What potion? Shrek and I took some magic potion. And well... Now, we're sexy! Shrek? [purrs] For you, baby... I could be. - Yeah, you wish. - Donkey, where is Shrek? He went inside looking for you. Shrek? Fiona! Fiona! You want to dance, pretty boy? Are you going so soon? Don't you want to see your wife? Fiona? Shrek? Aye, Fiona. It is me. What happened to your voice? The potion changed a lot of things, Fiona. But not the way I feel about you. Fiona? - Charming? - Do you think so? [laughs] Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve. - Um... Who are you? - Mom, it's me, Shrek. I know you never get a second chance at a first impression, but, well, what do you think? [Shrek in distance] Fiona! Fiona! Fiona! - Fiona! - Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho! Oh, shoot! I don't think they can hear us, pigeon. [sighs deeply] Don't you think you've already messed her life up enough? I just wanted her to be happy. And now she can be. Oh, sweetheart. She's finally found the prince of her dreams. But look at me. Look what I've done for her. It's time you stop living in a fairy tale, Shrek. She's a princess, and you're an ogre. That's something no amount of potion will ever change. But... I love her. If you really love her... you'll let her go. [ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good] [ Nick Cave: People Ain't No Good] Shrek? Se\u00f1or. What's going on? Where are you going? You wouldn't have had anything to do with this, would you, Harold? People just ain't no good I think that's well understood There you go, boys. Just leave the bottle, Doris. Hey. Why the long face? It was all just a stupid mistake. I never should have rescued her from that tower in the first place. I hate Mondays. I can't believe you'd walk away from the best thing that happened to you. What choice do I have? She loves that pretty boy, Prince Charming. Come on. Is he really that good-looking? Are you kidding? He's gorgeous! He has a face that looks like it was carved by angels. - Oh. He sounds dreamy. - You know... shockingly, this isn't making me feel any better. Look, guys. It's for the best. Mom and Dad approve, and Fiona gets the man she's always dreamed of. Everybody wins. Except for you. I don't get it, Shrek. You love Fiona. Aye. And that's why I have to let her go. Excuse me, is she here? She's, uh... in the back. Oh, hello again. Fairy Godmother. Charming. You'd better have a good reason for dragging us down here, Harold. Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really... warming up to Prince Charming. - FYI, not my fault. - No, of course it's not, dear. I mean, how charming can I be when I have to pretend I'm that dreadful ogre? No, no, it's nobody's fault. Perhaps it's best if we just call the whole thing off, okay? - [both] What? - You can't force someone to fall in love! I beg to differ. I do it all the time! Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall in love with the first man she kisses, which will be Charming. - Umm... no. - What did you say? I can't. I won't do it. Oh, yes, you will. If you remember, I helped you with your happily ever after. And I can take it away just as easily. Is that what you want? Is it? - No. - Good boy. Now, we have to go. I need to do Charming's hair before the ball. He's hopeless. He's all high in the front. He can never get to the back. You need someone to do the back. Oh. Thank you, Mother. [Donkey] Mother? Um...

We'll be right back with the Royal Far, Far Away Ball after these messages. I hate these ball shows. They bore me to tears. Flip over to Wheel Of Torture! I'm not flipping anywhere, sir, until I see Shrek and Fiona. Whizzes on you guys. Hey, mice, pass me a buffalo wing! No, to your left. Your left! - Tonight on \"Knights\"... - Now here's a good show! We got a white bronco heading east into the forest. Requesting backup. It's time to teach these madcap mammals their \"devil may mare\" attitudes just won't fly. Why you grabbing me? Police brutality! I have to talk to Princess Fiona! - We warned you! - Ow! Ow! Did someone let the cat out of the bag? You capitalist pig dogs! [shrieks] - Catnip! - That's not mine. Find Princess Fiona! I'm a donkey! Tell her Shrek... I'm her husband, Shrek! Quick! Rewind it! I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow! [knock on door] Darling? Ah. I thought I might find you here. How about a nice hot cup of tea before the ball? I'm not going. The whole Kingdom's turned out to celebrate your marriage. There's just one problem. That's not my husband. I mean, look at him. Yes, he is a bit different, but people change for the ones they love. You'd be surprised how much I changed for your mother. Change? He's completely lost his mind! Why not come down to the ball and give him another chance? You might find you like this new Shrek. But it's the old one I fell in love with, Dad. I'd give anything to have him back. Darling. That's mine. Decaf. Otherwise I'm up all night. Thanks. I got to get out of here! I got to get out of here! You can't lock us up like this! Let me go! What about my Miranda rights? You're supposed to say I have the right to remain silent. Nobody said I have the right to remain silent! You have the right to remain silent. What you lack is the capacity. I must hold on before I, too, go totally mad. Shrek? Donkey? Too late. Gingy! Pinocchio! Get us out of here! Oh... [ Theme from Mission Impossible] Fire in ze hole! [explosion, rumbling] Look out below! Quick! Tell a lie! - What should I say? - Anything, but quick! Say something crazy like \"I'm wearing ladies' underwear!\" I am wearing ladies' underwear. - Are you? - I most certainly am not! It looks like you most certainly am are! - I am not! - What kind? - It's a thong! - Oww! They're briefs! - Are not. - Are too! - Are not! - Are too! Here we go. Hang tight. [Donkey] Wait, wait, wait! Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey! Ow! - Excuse me? - What? Puss! Pardon me, would you mind letting me go? - Sorry, boss. - Quit messing around! We've got to stop that kiss! I thought you was going to let her go. I was, but I can't let them do this to Fiona. Boom! That's what I like to hear. Look who's coming around! It's impossible! We'll never get in. The castle's guarded. There's a moat and everything! Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate creek without a Popsicle stick. - What? - Do you still know the Muffin Man? Well, sure! He's down on Drury Lane. Why? Because we're gonna need flour. Lots and lots of flour. Gingy! Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man! We've got a big order to fill! [evil chuckle] [Gingy] It's alive!

Presenting Princess Fiona and her new husband, Prince Shrek. [applause, cheering] Shrek, what are you doing? I'm just playing the part, Fiona. Is that glitter on your lips? Mm. Cherry flavored. Want to taste? - Ugh! What is with you? - But, Muffin Cake... [piano plays] C Minor, put it in C Minor. Ladies and gentlemen. [applause, cheering] I'd like to dedicate this song to...

Where's the streetwise Hercules To fight the rising odds? Since when do you dance? Fiona, my dearest, if there's one thing I know, it's that love is full of surprises.

Ogres don't live happily ever after. [screams] Woo! Ha! [breathes deeply] [gasping] Oh, Dad! [sobbing] - Is he...? - Yup. [croaking] He croaked. Harold? Dad? I'd hoped you'd never see me like this. - And he gave you a hard time! - Donkey! No, no, he's right. I'm sorry. To both of you. I only wanted what was best for Fiona. But I can see now... she already has it. Shrek, Fiona... Will you accept an old frog's apologies... and my blessing? Harold? I'm sorry, Lillian. I just wish I could be the man you deserve. You're more that man today than you ever were... warts and all. [ribbits] [clock chimes] [clock chimes] Boss! The Happily Ever After Potion! Midnight! Fiona. Is this what you want? To be this way forever? - What? - Because if you kiss me now... we can stay like this. You'd do that? - For me? - Yes. I want what any princess wants.

Beginning in January 2012,  participating school districts will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator's official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities.

Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/summaries_of_annual_financial_report_data/7673/afr_excel_data_files/509047 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Act 511 Tax Report |year=2004}}</ref> When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.steb.state.pa.us/aboutusmain.asp |title=State Tax Equalization Board About US |author=State Tax Equalization Board |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114000816/http://www.steb.state.pa.us/aboutusmain.asp |archivedate=2012-11-14 }}</ref> In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auditorgen.state.pa.us/reports/performance/special/spesteb021011.pdf |title=A Special Performance Audit of the Pennsylvania State Tax Equalization Boards |author=Pennsylvania Auditor General office - Bureau of Audits |date=February 2011}}</ref>\n*2011-12 - 96.4012 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2011}}</ref> \n*2010-11 - 92.3250 mills <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2010}}</ref>\n*2009-10 - 115.3000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Elements Reports |year=2010}}</ref>\n*2008-09 - 110.3000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=Financial Elements Reports 2008-09 Real Estate Mills |year=2009}}</ref>\n*2007-08 - 104.0000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2008}}</ref>\n*2006-07 - 99.0000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2006}}</ref>\n*2005-06 - 94.0000 mills.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/financial_data_elements/7672 |title=Real Estate Tax Millage by School District |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |year=2005}}</ref>\n\n====Act 1 Adjusted Index====\nThe Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not permitted to raise property taxes above that Index unless they either: allow voters to vote by referendum or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] in the [[U.S. Department of Labor]], for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of 0.75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |title=2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines |year=2010}}</ref> In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11216/1164959-57-0.stm |title=Law could restrict school construction projects |author=Kaitlynn Riely |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=August 4, 2011}}</ref> Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.pa.us/CFDOCS/Legis/PN/Public/btCheck.cfm?txtType=PDF&sessYr=2011&sessInd=0&billBody=S&billTyp=B&billNbr=0330&pn=1459 |author1=Pennsylvania General Assembly |title=SB330 of 2011 |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |title=Property tax reform final piece of state budget |author=Eric Boehm |work=PA Independent |date=July 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704192251/http://paindependent.com/2011/07/property-tax-reform-final-piece-of-state-budget/ |archivedate=July 4, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe School District Adjusted Index for the Bellwood-Antis School District 2006-2007 through 2011-2012.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.portal.state.pa.us/portal/server.pt/community/property_tax_relief/7452/act_1_index/510332 |title=Special Session Act 1 of 2006 School District Adjusted Index for 2006-2007 through 2010-2011 |author=Pennsylvania Department of Education |date=May 2010}}</ref>\n\n*2006-07 - 5.5%, Base 3.9%\t\n*2007-08 - 4.7%, Base 3.4%\t\n*2008-09 - 6.1%, Base 4.4%\t\n*2009-10 - 5.8%, Base 4.1%\t\n*2010-11 - 4.1%, Base 2.9%\t\n*2011-12 - 2.0%, Base 1.4%\n*2012-13 - 2.4%, Base 1.7% <ref>Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2012-2013 School District Adjusted Index, May 2012</ref>\n\nFor the 2012-13 budget year, Bellwood-Antis School Board did not apply for an exception to exceed the Act 1 Index.

Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently people who have an income of substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This tax rebate can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

While the clinical presentation of the virus can be severe, it has also been found in mild cases of respiratory infection.  The [[comorbidity]] of HCoV-NL63 with other ry infections, has made the specific symptoms of the virus difficult to pinpoint.  A study of clinical symptoms in HCoV-NL63 patients without secondary infection, reported the most common symptoms to be fever, cough, [[rhinitis]], sore throat, hoarseness, [[bronchitis]], [[bronchiolitis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[croup]]. An early study investigating children with lower respiratory tract illness, found that HCoV-NL63 was more commonly found in outpatients than hospitalized patients, suggesting that it is a common cold virus similar to [[Human coronavirus 229E|HCoV-229E]] and [[Human coronavirus OC43|HCoV-OC43]], which generally cause less severe symptoms.<ref name=\"van_der_Hoek_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Hoek L, Berkhout B | title = Questions concerning the New Haven coronavirus | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 192 | issue = 2 | pages = 350\u20131; author reply 353\u20134 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15962232 | doi = 10.1086/430795 }}</ref> However, the high frequency of [[croup]] is specific to HCoV-NL63 infection.\n\n==Cause==\nIt is believed that the route of HCoV-NL63 spread is through direct person-to-person transmission in highly populated areas.

Therefore, entrance into the cell is either through direct [[cell fusion]] with the [[plasma membrane]] or [[endocytosis]] followed by fusion with the membrane.

While the clinical presentation of the virus can be severe, it has also been found in mild cases of respiratory infection.  The [[comorbidity]] of HCoV-NL63 with other respiratory infections, has made the specific symptoms of the virus difficult to pinpoint.  A study of clinical symptoms in HCoV-NL63 patients without secondary infection, reported the most common symptoms to be fever, cough, [[rhinitis]], sore throat, hoarseness, [[bronchitis]], [[bronchiolitis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[croup]]. An early study investigating children with lower respiratory tract illness, found that HCoV-NL63 was more commonly found in outpatients than hospitalized patients, suggesting that it is a common cold virus similar to [[Human coronavirus 229E|HCoV-229E]] and [[Human coronavirus OC43|HCoV-OC43]], which generally cause less severe symptoms.<ref name=\"van_der_Hoek_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Hoek L, Berkhout B | title = Questions concerning the New Haven coronavirus | journal = The Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume = 192 | issue = 2 | pages = 350\u20131; author reply 353\u20134 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15962232 | doi = 10.1086/430795 }}</ref> However, the high frequency of [[croup]] is specific to HCoV-NL63 infection.\n\n==Cause==\nIt is believed that the route of HCoV-NL63 spread is through direct person-to-person transmission in highly populated areas.

These population include children under the age of 5, the elderly, and [[immunocompromised]] individuals.  The virus seems to have seasonal incidence, occurring most frequently in the winter months in [[temperate climate]]s.  In more extreme and [[tropical climate]]s the virus has no preference toward a particular season.  Many studies have reported the co-occurrence of HCoV-NL63 with other [[human coronavirus]], ''[[Influenza A virus]]'', ''[[Human orthopneumovirus]]'' (RSV), [[parainfluenza virus]], and ''[[Human metapneumovirus]]'' (hMPV).<ref name=\"Abdul-Rasool_2010\" />\n\n==Mechanism==\nTransmission of HCoV-NL63 is likely through droplet expulsion from the [[respiratory tract]], which may be airborne or spread through close personal contact. The virus is able to survive for up to seven days in respiratory secretions and remains infective at room temperature.<ref name=\"Hofmann_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hofmann H, Pyrc K, van der Hoek L, Geier M, Berkhout B, P\u00f6hlmann S | title = Human coronavirus NL63 employs the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus receptor for cellular entry | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 22 | pages = 7988\u201393 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15897467 | pmc = 1142358 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0409465102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.7988H }}</ref> Once the virus has entered the host it binds to [[cellular receptors]] using spike proteins, similar to those found in [[HIV-1]].  The virus is able to use Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 ([[ACE2]]) as an entry receptor to bind to and enter target cells.<ref name=\"Hofmann_2005\"/> No determination of the specific entry of the virus into the host cell has been completed.  Therefore, entrance into the cell is either through direct [[cell fusion]] with the [[plasma membrane]] or [[endocytosis]] followed by fusion with the membrane.  Due to the lack of a [[cDNA]] clone of HCoV-NL63, research on the replication cycle is limited.  Because it is a positive single-stranded [[RNA virus]], the processes of replication via [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]] can be carried out in the [[cytoplasm]] of the infected cell.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nIt is difficult to distinguish between symptoms caused by infection of the HCoV-NL63 virus and those caused by other common human viruses, making diagnosis and detection complex.  [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] of samples collected through [[nasopharyngeal swab]] is the most commonly used method for detection of the virus.<ref name=\"Abdul-Rasool_2010\" /> [[Viral culture]] or [[blood serum]] testing for [[antibodies]] may also be used for the confirmation of infection.\n\n==Prevention==\nThe United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) recommends several measures for the prevention of infection with HCoV-NL63 including:  washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and not touching the eyes, mouth, or nose.<ref>{{cite web | work = Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/about/ | title = About Coronavirus | access-date = July 22, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n==Treatment and prognosis==\nTreatment for the HCoV-NL63 virus is dependent on the severity of associated symptomology.  Most mild to moderate infections will go away on their own.  Symptoms can be relieved by taking a pain reliever or fever medication, taking a hot shower, or using a [[humidifier]].  [[Antiviral]] treatment may be necessary for infected patients that end up in the [[intensive care unit]] (ICU) due to [[acute respiratory infection]].  [[Intravenous immunoglobulin]] is an [[FDA]] approved HCoV-NL63 inhibitor that is also used to treat [[primary immune deficiency]], [[Human respiratory syncytial virus|RSV]], and [[Kawasaki disease]].<ref name=\"van_der_Hoek_2006\" />\n\n==Recent research==\nRecent data suggest an association of ''HCoV-NL63'' infection with [[Kawasaki disease]], a systemic [[vasculitis]] in childhood that may result in [[aneurysm]]s of the coronary arteries.

In 1885, 27 Romanian families settled on the island as colonists but were not successful in forming communities.

In 1899, Davis Trietsch, a delegate to the Third Zionist Congress at Basel, in August 1899, attempted to get an endorsement for Jewish colonisation in Cyprus, especially for Romanian Jews. Although, his proposal was refused by the council; Trietsch persisted, convincing two dozen Romanian Jews to immigrate to the land. Twenty-eight Romanian families followed these and received assistance from the Jewish Colonization Association. These settlers established farms at Margo, and at Asheriton. The Jewish Colonisation Association continued to give a small support to the work in Cyprus. Most Jewish communities during the early 1900s (decade) were located in Nicosia.  In 1901, the Jewish population of the island was 63 men and 56 women. In 1902, [[Theodore Herzl]]  presented in a pamphlet to the Parliamentary committee on alien immigration in London, bearing the title \"The Problem of Jewish Immigration to England and the United States Solved by Furthering the Jewish Colonisation of Cyprus.\"\n\nDuring [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], Cyprus played a major role for the Jewish communities of Europe. After the rise of Nazism in 1933, hundreds of Jews escaped to Cyprus. Following the liquidation of the concentration camps of Europe, the British set up a [[Cyprus internment camps|detention camp in Cyprus]] for Holocaust survivors illegally trying to enter Palestine. From 1946 until the establishment of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948, the British confined 50,000 Jewish refugees on the island.

In 1885, 27 Romanian families settled on the island as colonists but were not successful in forming communities. Romanian Jews in 1891, again bought land in Cyprus, even though they did not immigrate to the country.<ref> Yossi Ben-Artzi,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20728555 'Jewish rural settlement in Cyprus 1882\u20141935: a \"springboard\" or a destiny?,'] [[Jewish History]], Vol. 21, No. 3/4 (2007), pp. 361-383 </ref><ref>John M.Shaftesley [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29778771 'Nineteenth-Century Jewish Colonies in Cyprus,'] [[Jewish Historical Society of England|Transactions & Miscellanies (Jewish Historical Society of England)]], Vol. 22 (1968-1969), pp. 88-107. </ref>\n\nFifteen Russian families under the leadership of Walter Cohen founded a colony in the year 1897 at Margo, with the help of the Ahawat Zion of [[London]] and the Jewish Colonisation Association. In 1899, Davis Trietsch, a delegate to the Third Zionist Congress at Basel, in August 1899, attempted to get an endorsement for Jewish colonisation in Cyprus, especially for Romanian Jews. Although, his proposal was refused by the council; Trietsch persisted, convincing two dozen Romanian Jews to immigrate to the land. Twenty-eight Romanian families followed these and received assistance from the Jewish Colonization Association. These settlers established farms at Margo, and at Asheriton. The Jewish Colonisation Association continued to give a small support to the work in Cyprus. Most Jewish communities during the early 1900s (decade) were located in Nicosia.  In 1901, the Jewish population of the island was 63 men and 56 women. In 1902, [[Theodore Herzl]]  presented in a pamphlet to the Parliamentary committee on alien immigration in London, bearing the title \"The Problem of Jewish Immigration to England and the United States Solved by Furthering the Jewish Colonisation of Cyprus.\"\n\nDuring [[World War II]] and the [[Holocaust]], Cyprus played a major role for the Jewish communities of Europe. After the rise of Nazism in 1933, hundreds of Jews escaped to Cyprus. Following the liquidation of the concentration camps of Europe, the British set up a [[Cyprus internment camps|detention camp in Cyprus]] for Holocaust survivors illegally trying to enter Palestine. From 1946 until the establishment of the State of [[Israel]] in 1948, the British confined 50,000 Jewish refugees on the island. Once the State of Israel was created, most of the refugees [[aliyah|moved to Israel]]. About 2,000 babies were born on the island as they waited to enter Israel.<ref name=\"Morley\" />\n\nIn 2014 a \"Garden of Peace\" to commemorate the plight of thousands Jewish refugees imprisoned in British run camps on Cyprus after World War Two was opened in [[Xylotymbou|Xylotympou]] on the east coast of Cyprus.<ref name=\"Morley\" >Nathan Morley,[https://cyprus-mail.com/2016/08/14/just-footnote-history/ 'More than just a footnote to history,'] [[Cyprus Mail]] 14 August 2016.</ref>\n\n== Today ==\n[[File:Rabbi_Arie_Zeev_Raskin_meets_the_last_President_of_Cyprus_Mr_Tassos_Papadopoulos.jpg|thumb|[[Arie Zeev Raskin]], rabbi of [[Larnaca Synagogue]], with the former President of Cyprus, [[Tassos Papadopoulos]]]]\n[[File:Hanukkah sign Nicosia Republic of Cyprus.JPG|thumb|[[public menorah|Public Hanukkah menorah]] in [[Nicosia]]]]\n\nIsrael has had [[Diplomacy|diplomatic]] relations with Cyprus since Israel's independence in 1948, when Cyprus was a British protectorate.
