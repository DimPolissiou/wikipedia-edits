Armoured trains usually include railroad cars armed with [[artillery]],[[machine gun]]s and [[autocannon]]s, some also had slits used to fire [[small arms]] like [[pistols]] and [[rifles]] from the inside of the train, this feature was especially prevalent in earlier versions of armoured trains. For the most part they were used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of [[firepower]]. Most countries discontinued their use \u2013 road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and train tracks proved too vulnerable to sabotage as well as to attacks from the air. However, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] used improvised armoured trains in the [[Second Chechen War]] of 1999\u20132009.\n\n== Design and equipment ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n[[Image:Pociag pancerny Danuta z 1939 r.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish armoured train, the ''[[Danuta (armoured train)|Danuta]]'', in 1939.

Typical roles included:\n* [[Artillery]] - fielding a mixture of guns, machine guns and rocket launchers. See also [[railway guns]].\n* [[Infantry]] - designed to carry infantry units, may also mount machine guns.\n* [[Machine gun]] - dedicated to machine guns.\n* [[Anti-aircraft]] - equipped with anti-aircraft weapons.\n* [[Command and control|Command]] - similar to infantry wagons, but designed to be a train command centre\n* [[Anti-tank gun|Anti-tank]] - equipped with anti-tank guns, usually in a [[tank]] [[gun turret]]\n* Platform - unarmoured, used for any purpose from the transport of [[ammunition]] or vehicles, through track repair or derailing protection to [[railroad plough]]s for track destruction.\n* [[Troop sleeper]]s\n* The German [[Wehrmacht]] would sometimes put a ''Fremdger\u00e4t'', such as a captured French [[Somua S-35]] or Czech [[PzKpfw 38(t)]] light tank, or [[Panzer II]] light tank on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy partisans\n* [[Missile]] transport - the [[USSR]] had railway-based [[RT-23 Molodets]] ICBMs by the late 1980s (to reduce the chances of a [[first strike]] succeeding in destroying the launchers for a retaliatory strike). The US at one time proposed having a railway-based system for the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX Missile program]] but this never got past the planning stage\n\nDifferent types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.\n\nArmoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a [[draisine]]. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm [[MG-13|MG13]] machine gun turrets from [[Panzer I]] light tanks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    = Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper - 18610518 - p1 - Railroad Battery.png\n| alt1      = Photo of an 1861 \"Railroad battery\" used to protect workers during the [[American Civil War]]\n| caption1  = An 1861 \"Railroad battery\" used to protect workers during the [[American Civil War]]\n| image2    = CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889-108.jpg\n| alt2      = Photo of an armoured [[CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889]] locomotive derailed on 12 October 1899 during the first engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] at [[Battle of Kraaipan|Kraaipan]]\n| caption2  = An armoured [[CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889]] locomotive derailed on 12 October 1899 during the first engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] at [[Battle of Kraaipan|Kraaipan]]\n}}\nArmoured trains saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902). During the Second Boer War, [[Winston Churchill]], then a war-correspondent, was travelling aboard an armoured train on 15 November 1899, when a [[Boer]] commando led by General [[Louis Botha]] ambushed the train. The Boers captured Churchill and many of the train's contingent, but many others escaped, including wounded soldiers who had been carried on the train's engine.<ref name=ZalogaBryan>{{cite book \n| title = Armoured Trains\n| last = Zaloga | first = Steven J \n| author2 = Bryan, Tony\n| year = 2008 \n| publisher = Osprey Publishing\n|location = Oxford, UK\n|isbn = 978-1-84603-242-4| pages=7 }}</ref>\n\nEarly in the 20th century, Russia used armoured trains during the [[Russo-Japanese War]].<ref name=Zaloga24>{{cite book |title=Soviet Tanks and Combat Vehicles of World War Two\n |last=Zaloga |first=Steven J |author2= Grandsen, James |year=1984 |publisher=Arms and Armour Press |isbn=0-85368-606-8 |page=24 }}</ref>  Armoured trains went on to see use during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910\u20131920) and [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920). The [[Spanish Civil War]] saw a little use of armoured trains, though [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) saw more. The French used them during the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954), and a number of countries had armoured trains during the Cold War. The last combat use appears to have been during the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the 1990s.\n\n===American Civil War===\nThe most successful armoured train was a single car built to defend the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]]. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front; and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] modified a baggage car in late April 1861. A [[Caliber#Pounds as a measure of cannon bore|24-pounder]] [[howitzer]] was placed on a swivel mount at the opposite end of the car from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the car were sheathed with {{convert|2.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} oak planks covered with {{convert|0.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} boiler plate. The end of the car around the howitzer was fitted with hinged {{convert|2|ft|cm|sing=on}} panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with [[grapeshot]] or [[canister shot]]. The remainder of the car contained fifty ports for riflemen. The car was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such cars of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] locomotive pushing an armoured train; and then piled tires around the armoured car and set them afire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dome |first=Steam |year=1974 |title=A Civil War Iron Clad Car |journal=Railroad History |volume=130 |issue=Spring 1974 |pages=51\u201353 |publisher=The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society}}</ref>\n\n===Volunteers===\nIn 1884 Charles Gervaise Boxall (1852\u20131914), a [[Brighton]]-born solicitor and officer in the [[1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers]], published ''The Armoured Train for Coast Defence in Great Britain'', outlining a new way to employ heavy artillery.

[[Winston Churchill]] accompanied the mission as a war correspondent. The train was ambushed and part-derailed, and Haldane, Churchill and some 70 of the troops were captured after a fire-fight, although the locomotive got away with the wounded.<ref>Gen Sir Aylmer Haldane, ''A Soldier's Saga'', Edinburgh: William Blackwood, 1948, pp. 139\u201346.</ref><ref>Rayne Kruger, ''Goodbye Dolly Gray'', London: Cassell 1959/Pan 1974, {{ISBN|0-330-23861-2}}, pp. 104\u20135.</ref><ref>Thomas Pakenham, ''The Boer War'', London, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1979/abridged edition 1993, {{ISBN|0-297-83222-0}}, pp. 95\u20136.</ref> Recalling his experience in [[My Early Life]], Churchill wrote \"Nothing looks more formidable and impressive than an armoured train; but nothing is in fact more vulnerable and helpless.

Armoured trains usually include railroad cars armed with [[artillery]],[[machine gun]]s and [[autocannon]]s, some also had slits used to fire [[small arms]] like [[pistols]] and [[rifles]] from the inside of the train, this feature was especially prevalent in earlier versions of armoured trains. For the most part they were used during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they offered an innovative way to quickly move large amounts of [[firepower]]. Most countries discontinued their use \u2013 road vehicles became much more powerful and offered more flexibility, and train tracks proved too vulnerable to sabotage as well as to attacks from the air. However, the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] used improvised armoured trains in the [[Second Chechen War]] of 1999\u20132009.\n\n== Design and equipment ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n[[Image:Pociag pancerny Danuta z 1939 r.jpg|thumb|right|A Polish armoured train, the ''[[Danuta (armoured train)|Danuta]]'', in 1939.

Typical roles included:\n* [[Artillery]] - fielding a mixture of guns, machine guns and rocket launchers. See also [[railway guns]].\n* [[Infantry]] - designed to carry infantry units, may also mount machine guns.\n* [[Machine gun]] - dedicated to machine guns.\n* [[Anti-aircraft]] - equipped with anti-aircraft weapons.\n* [[Command and control|Command]] - similar to infantry wagons, but designed to be a train command centre\n* [[Anti-tank gun|Anti-tank]] - equipped with anti-tank guns, usually in a [[tank]] [[gun turret]]\n* Platform - unarmoured, used for any purpose from the transport of [[ammunition]] or vehicles, through track repair or derailing protection to [[railroad plough]]s for track destruction.\n* [[Troop sleeper]]s\n* The German [[Wehrmacht]] would sometimes put a ''Fremdger\u00e4t'', such as a captured French [[Somua S-35]] or Czech [[PzKpfw 38(t)]] light tank, or [[Panzer II]] light tank on a flatbed car which could be quickly offloaded by means of a ramp and used away from the range of the main railway line to chase down enemy partisans\n* [[Missile]] transport - the [[USSR]] had railway-based [[RT-23 Molodets]] ICBMs by the late 1980s (to reduce the chances of a [[first strike]] succeeding in destroying the launchers for a retaliatory strike). The US at one time proposed having a railway-based system for the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX Missile program]] but this never got past the planning stage\n\nDifferent types of armour were used to protect from attack by tanks. In addition to various metal plates, concrete and sandbags were used in some cases for improvised armoured trains.\n\nArmoured trains were sometimes escorted by a kind of rail-tank called a [[draisine]]. One such example was the 'Littorina' armoured trolley which had a cab in the front and rear, each with a control set so it could be driven down the tracks in either direction. Littorina mounted two dual 7.92mm [[MG-13|MG13]] machine gun turrets from [[Panzer I]] light tanks.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Origins ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right \n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 220\n| image1    = Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper - 18610518 - p1 - Railroad Battery.png\n| alt1      = Photo of an 1861 \"Railroad battery\" used to protect workers during the [[American Civil War]]\n| caption1  = An 1861 \"Railroad battery\" used to protect workers during the [[American Civil War]]\n| image2    = CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889-108.jpg\n| alt2      = Photo of an armoured [[CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889]] locomotive derailed on 12 October 1899 during the first engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] at [[Battle of Kraaipan|Kraaipan]]\n| caption2  = An armoured [[CGR 3rd Class 4-4-0 1889]] locomotive derailed on 12 October 1899 during the first engagement of the [[Second Boer War]] at [[Battle of Kraaipan|Kraaipan]]\n}}\nArmoured trains saw use during the 19th century in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u20131871), the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War|Second]] Boer Wars (1880\u20131881 and 1899\u20131902).

The most intensive use of armoured trains was during the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918\u20131920). The [[Spanish Civil War]] saw a little use of armoured trains, though [[World War II]] (1939\u20131945) saw more. The French used them during the [[First Indochina War]] (1946\u20131954), and a number of countries had armoured trains during the Cold War. The last combat use appears to have been during the [[Yugoslav wars]] of the 1990s.\n\n===American Civil War===\nThe most successful armoured train was a single car built to defend the [[Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad]]. The railroad had been attacked by southern forces to prevent transport of Union soldiers to the front; and snipers were discouraging men attempting to repair the damage. [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] modified a baggage car in late April 1861. A [[Caliber#Pounds as a measure of cannon bore|24-pounder]] [[howitzer]] was placed on a swivel mount at the opposite end of the car from the pushing locomotive. The sides of the car were sheathed with {{convert|2.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} oak planks covered with {{convert|0.5|inch|cm|sing=on}} boiler plate. The end of the car around the howitzer was fitted with hinged {{convert|2|ft|cm|sing=on}} panels which could be temporarily lifted to aim and fire the howitzer and then lowered to protect the crew of six men loading the howitzer with [[grapeshot]] or [[canister shot]]. The remainder of the car contained fifty ports for riflemen. The car was effective for its original purpose, but vulnerability to artillery rendered such cars of comparatively little use during later stages of the war. In August 1864, a Confederate raiding party disabled a [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] locomotive pushing an armoured train; and then piled tires around the armoured car and set them afire.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dome |first=Steam |year=1974 |title=A Civil War Iron Clad Car |journal=Railroad History |volume=130 |issue=Spring 1974 |pages=51\u201353 |publisher=The Railway & Locomotive Historical Society}}</ref>\n\n===Volunteers===\nIn 1884 Charles Gervaise Boxall (1852\u20131914), a [[Brighton]]-born solicitor and officer in the [[1st Sussex Artillery Volunteers]], published ''The Armoured Train for Coast Defence in Great Britain'', outlining a new way to employ heavy artillery.

These have promising activity against a biological target related to COVID-19 disease. At the beginning of vaccine or drug development, little is known about the safety, [[toxicity]], [[pharmacokinetics]], and [[metabolism]] of the NCE in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> It is the function and obligation of drug development to assess all of these parameters prior to human clinical trials to prove safety and efficacy. A further major objective of drug development is to recommend the dose and schedule for the first use in a human clinical trial (\"[[Phase I study|first-in-human]]\" [FIH] or First Human Dose [FHD], previously also known as \"first-in-man\" [FIM]).\n\nIn addition, drug development must establish the [[physicochemistry|physicochemical properties]] of the NCE: its chemical makeup, stability, and solubility. Manufacturers must optimize the process they use to make the chemical so they can scale up from a [[medicinal chemist]] producing milligrams, to manufacturing on the kilogram and [[ton]] scale.<ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/> They further examine the product for suitability to package as [[Capsule (pharmacy)|capsules]], [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablets]], aerosol, intramuscular injectable, subcutaneous injectable, or [[intravenous]] [[formulations]]. Together, these processes are known in preclinical and clinical development as ''chemistry, manufacturing, and control'' (CMC).<ref name=strovel/>\n\nMany aspects of drug development focus on satisfying the [[new drug application|regulatory requirements]] of drug licensing authorities.<ref name=fda-ddp/> These generally constitute tests designed to determine the major toxicities of a novel compound prior to first use in humans.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/> It is a regulatory requirement that an assessment of major organ toxicity be performed (effects on the heart and lungs, brain, kidney, liver and digestive system), as well as effects on other parts of the body that might be affected by the drug (e.g., the skin if the new vaccine is to be delivered by skin injection). Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/><ref name=cdc-vacc/>  If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase,<ref name=fda-ddp/> and the progress of performance in humans &ndash; if a vaccine under development in the United States &ndash; is monitored by the FDA in a \"vaccine approval process.\"<ref name=\"fda-vacc\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Product Approval Process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trial phases===\n{{Main|Clinical trial}}\n\n[[Clinical trial]] programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=\"aziz\">{{cite web |last=Kaiser J. |first=Aziz |title=FDA update (2018) \u2013 The FDA's new drug approval process: Development and premarket applications |url=https://drug-dev.com/fda-update-the-fdas-new-drug-approval-process-development-premarket-applications/ |publisher=Drug Development and Delivery |accessdate=25 March 2020 |date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.\n* Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.\n* Phase III trials are [[Randomized controlled trial|large, pivotal trials]] to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage to begin marketing.<ref name=fda-ddp/>\n* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called [[post-market surveillance]] studies. Until a vaccine is provided to the general population, all potential [[adverse event]]s remain unidentified, requiring that vaccines undergo Phase IV studies with regular reports by the manufacturer to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) to identify problems after use in the population begins.<ref name=fda-vacc/>\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE is advanced into human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).<ref name=strovel/><ref name=fda-vacc/> If a vaccine candidate or antiviral compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the manufacturer can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it.<ref name=fda-ddp/> In the United States, this process is called a \"[[new drug application]]\" or NDA.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/>\n\n====Adaptive designs for COVID-19 trials====\nA clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an \"adaptive design\" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.<ref name=\"fda-adaptive\">{{cite web |title=Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Guidance for Industry |url=https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"pallmann\">{{cite journal | last=Pallmann | first=Philip | last2=Bedding | first2=Alun W. | last3=Choodari-Oskooei | first3=Babak | last4=Dimairo | first4=Munyaradzi | last5=Flight | first5=Laura | last6=Hampson | first6=Lisa V. | last7=Holmes | first7=Jane | last8=Mander | first8=Adrian P. | last9=Odondi | first9=Lang\u2019o | last10=Sydes | first10=Matthew R. | last11=Villar | first11=Sof\u00eda S. | last12=Wason | first12=James M.

Increasingly, these tests are made using ''[[in vitro]]'' methods (e.g., with isolated cells), but many tests can only be made by using experimental animals to demonstrate the complex interplay of metabolism and drug exposure on toxicity.<ref name=strovel/>\n\nThe information is gathered from this preclinical testing, as well as information on CMC, and submitted to regulatory authorities (in the US, to the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]), as an [[Investigational New Drug]] (IND) or [[Biologics License Application]] application for a vaccine.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/><ref name=taylor/><ref name=cdc-vacc/>  If the IND is approved, development moves to the clinical phase,<ref name=fda-ddp/> and the progress of performance in humans &ndash; if a vaccine under development in the United States &ndash; is monitored by the FDA in a \"vaccine approval process.\"<ref name=\"fda-vacc\">{{cite web |title=Vaccine Product Approval Process |url=https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-product-approval-process |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=21 March 2020 |date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Clinical trial phases===\n{{Main|Clinical trial}}\n\n[[Clinical trial]] programs involve three, multiple-year stages toward product approval, and a fourth, post-approval stage for ongoing safety monitoring of the vaccine or drug therapy:<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=\"aziz\">{{cite web |last=Kaiser J. |first=Aziz |title=FDA update (2018) \u2013 The FDA's new drug approval process: Development and premarket applications |url=https://drug-dev.com/fda-update-the-fdas-new-drug-approval-process-development-premarket-applications/ |publisher=Drug Development and Delivery |accessdate=25 March 2020 |date=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n* Phase I trials, usually in healthy volunteers, determine safety and dosing.\n* Phase II trials are used to establish an initial reading of efficacy and further explore safety in small numbers of people having the disease targeted by the NCE.\n* Phase III trials are [[Randomized controlled trial|large, pivotal trials]] to determine safety and efficacy in sufficiently large numbers of people with the COVID-19 infection. If safety and efficacy are adequately proved, clinical testing may stop at this step and the NCE advances to the [[new drug application]] (NDA) stage to begin marketing.<ref name=fda-ddp/>\n* Phase IV trials are post-approval trials that may be a condition attached by the FDA, also called [[post-market surveillance]] studies. Until a vaccine is provided to the general population, all potential [[adverse event]]s remain unidentified, requiring that vaccines undergo Phase IV studies with regular reports by the manufacturer to the [[Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System]] (VAERS) to identify problems after use in the population begins.<ref name=fda-vacc/>\n\nThe process of defining characteristics of the drug does not stop once an NCE is advanced into human clinical trials. In addition to the tests required to move a novel vaccine or antiviral drug into the clinic for the first time, manufacturers must ensure that any long-term or chronic toxicities are well-defined, including effects on systems not previously monitored (fertility, reproduction, immune system, among others).<ref name=strovel/><ref name=fda-vacc/> If a vaccine candidate or antiviral compound emerges from these tests with an acceptable toxicity and safety profile, and the manufacturer can further show it has the desired effect in clinical trials, then the NCE portfolio of evidence can be submitted for marketing approval in the various countries where the manufacturer plans to sell it.<ref name=fda-ddp/> In the United States, this process is called a \"[[new drug application]]\" or NDA.<ref name=fda-ddp/><ref name=strovel/>\n\n====Adaptive designs for COVID-19 trials====\nA clinical trial design in progress may be modified as an \"adaptive design\" if accumulating data in the trial provide early insights about positive or negative efficacy of the treatment.<ref name=\"fda-adaptive\">{{cite web |title=Adaptive Designs for Clinical Trials of Drugs and Biologics: Guidance for Industry |url=https://www.fda.gov/media/78495/download |publisher=US Food and Drug Administration |accessdate=3 April 2020 |date=1 November 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"pallmann\">{{cite journal | last=Pallmann | first=Philip | last2=Bedding | first2=Alun W. | last3=Choodari-Oskooei | first3=Babak | last4=Dimairo | first4=Munyaradzi | last5=Flight | first5=Laura | last6=Hampson | first6=Lisa V. | last7=Holmes | first7=Jane | last8=Mander | first8=Adrian P. | last9=Odondi | first9=Lang\u2019o | last10=Sydes | first10=Matthew R. | last11=Villar | first11=Sof\u00eda S. | last12=Wason | first12=James M.

It was originally released in 1998 for the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo-Geo MVS]] arcade platform as the sequel to the popular 1996 game ''[[Metal Slug (1996 video game)|Metal Slug]]''. It was re-released in 1999 in a slightly modified form as {{nihongo|'''''Metal Slug X: Super Vehicle-001'''''|\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0X}}. It has been ported to the [[Neo Geo CD]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Virtual Console]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and to the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] (as part of the ''[[Metal Slug Anthology]]''). The game added several new features to the gameplay of the original ''Metal Slug'', such as new weapons, vehicles and the ability to transform the character. It received generally positive reviews.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:NEOGEO Metal Slug 2 (Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001-II).png|thumb|left|One of the new weapons, the Laser, being used on the Mars People]]\n\nGameplay in ''Metal Slug 2'' is very similar to the previous game; the player(s) must shoot constantly at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of each level. At this point, the player confronts a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], who is usually considerably larger and tougher than regular enemies. On the way through each level, the player can find numerous weapon upgrades and \"Metal Slug\" [[tank]]s. The tank is known as the SV-001 (\"SV\" stands for Super Vehicle), which not only increases the player's offense, but considerably adds to their defense.\n\nIn addition to shooting, the player can also perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die simply by coming into contact with enemies, and correspondingly, many of the enemy troops also have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is also destructible, and occasionally, this reveals extra items or power-ups, although most of the time it simply results in [[collateral damage]].\n\nDuring the course of a level, the player also encounters [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s, who, if freed, offer the player bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. At the end of each level, the player receives a scoring bonus based on the number of freed POWs. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs  reverts to zero.\n\n===New features===\n====Vehicles and weapons====\n''Metal Slug 2'' added several new weapons to the player's arsenal. A single shot from the Laser is capable of killing a column of [[infantry]], and sustained fire can quickly destroy vehicles. Fire Bombs found in the second level can help to clear away [[Mummy|mummies]]. Armor Piercing Shells give the Metal Slug tank [[Shell (projectile)|cannon shells]] that only fire straight, but which do tremendous damage.\n\nThe game also included more vehicles. Though just as susceptible to enemy fire as the Metal Slug, these vehicles provide alternate modes of transportation, with each having their own advantages.\n* The \"Camel Slug\" is a [[M61 Vulcan|Vulcan cannon]] mounted on a [[camel]]. The rider is elevated and still vulnerable to enemy fire, but has improved movement.\n* To help fight a boss that crawls up a tower, the \"Slugnoid\" armored frame is capable of leaping great heights. Its cannon is pointed downward, to assail the enemy attacking from below. Twin Vulcan cannons provide firepower, but they are stripped each time the Slugnoid is hit.\n* The \"Slug Flyer\" is a [[VTOL]] jet fighter which can fire powerful [[air-to-air missile]]s. It also has a Vulcan Cannon, which is designed to fire upon forward targets. Another player can \"wing-walk\", or ride on top of the plane.\n\n====Character transformation====\n''Metal Slug 2'' also introduced the ability for characters to transform during the course of the game. The first transformation is into a mummy during the second mission. Any hit from the purple tinged attacks of the mummy-variants or potions dropped by bats will trigger the transformation. This causes a drastic reduction in player movement speed and loss of any special weapons. Mummified characters hold only a pistol, which they fire at a rate of 50% slower than normal. Tossing a [[grenade]] also takes longer. Players also cannot use the knife, make use of heavy weaponry or vehicles when mummified. If the player is hit by another purple mist whilst mummified, they will die. Antidotes which can restore the player to human form are hidden throughout the level, dropped by enemies and given by rescued POWs.\n\nAnother transformation is the ability to become [[Obesity|obese]]. This transformation is effected by eating too many food items during a single game-life. Once enough food is obtained the announcer yells \"Uh-oh, big!,\" and the character is radically transformed. Movement speed is slowed, and every weapon's attack is altered: melee attacks are changed from a knife to a fork (or a belt whip if sitting), grenades are changed to larger [[Cherry bomb|cherry-style bombs]], and the current weapon is replaced with a version that has larger bullets, and its offensive properties improved (for example, the [[rocket launcher]] has an improved tracking ability). The player returns to regular form if a diet-powder canister is found, enough time passes without picking up any food items, or if the player is killed.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nAs well as doubling the number of available player characters from two to four, ''Metal Slug 2'' is the first game in the series to introduce in-game characters to help the player in battle. The first is Hyakutaro Ichimonji, a prisoner who, when rescued, will fight alongside the player, throwing [[Street Fighter#Hadouken|Hadouken]] balls at enemies, or roundhouse kicking them if they get within melee range. Another character is Sgt. Rumi Aikawa, an army supplier who lacks a sense of direction, earning her the title \"The Wandering Ghost\"; she carries a huge, overstuffed backpack and drops random items for the player to collect (more are dropped if the backpack is shot or cut).\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years have passed since the end of ''Metal Slug'', when Capt. Marco Rossi and Lt. Tarma Roving of Peregrine Falcon Strike Force defeated and apparently killed the evil General Morden, who had staged a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against the worlds' governments. Since then, various factions sympathetic to Morden have been in operation, but have always been considered insignificant. Recently, however, they have begun to act in unison, and army intelligence concludes that the only way this could happen is if Morden himself is in fact still alive and is attempting a new ''coup''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 2|url=http://www.metalslug10th.com/english/history/series2/index.php|publisher=SNK|4=|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052527/http://www.metalslug10th.com/english/history/series2/index.php|archive-date=May 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> As such, Rossi (now a Major) and Roving (now a Captain) are sent to once again battle Morden. However, such is the importance of the mission, that they are accompanied by two members of the Intelligence Agency's [[special operations|Special Ops]] Squad S.P.A.R.R.O.W.S.; Sgt. Eri Kasamoto and Sgt. 1st Class Fiolina Germi.\n\nAs the levels unfold, it is revealed that Morden has formed an alliance with aliens in an effort to facilitate his plans (the previous game ended with one of Morden's soldiers sending a [[paper plane|paper airplane]] into [[outer space]]). In the final mission, however, the aliens turn on Morden, attacking his troops and taking him prisoner. An [[ad hoc]] alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat. After a long battle, they succeed in defeating the [[Mother ship]]. As the ship explodes (the scene reminiscent from the movie [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]), Morden falls to the ground, strapped to a solid iron plate. While his soldiers celebrate his survival, the plate loses its balance and crushes him. The game ends with Rossi, Roving, Kasamoto and Germi celebrating their victory.\n\n==''Metal Slug X''==\n{{Infobox video game\n|title         = Metal Slug X\n|collapsible   = yes\n|image         = Metal Slug X arcade flyer.jpg\n|caption       = European Arcade flyer with art by [[Shinkiro]]\n|developer     = [[SNK]]<br />Prosoft Corporation <small>(PS1)</small><br />[[DotEmu]] <small>(Mobile/PC)</small>\n|publisher     ={{collapsible list|title=SNK|titlestyle=font-weight:normal;font-size:inherit;background:transparent;text-align:left|[[SNK#2003\u20132016: SNK Playmore|SNK Playmore]], [[Sony Computer Entertainment America|SCEA]]<br /><small>(PlayStation Network)</small><br />[[D4 Enterprise]]<br /><small>(Virtual Console)</small><br />[[DotEmu]] <small>(Mobile/PC)</small><br />[[Hamster Corporation|HAMSTER Corporation]] <small>(PS4/Switch/Xbox One)</small>}}\n|producer      = [[Takashi Nishiyama]]\n|designer      = Meeher\n|programmer    = Andy<br />Hirokun<br />Nakatsuka\n|artist        = Akio<br />Cannon<br />Kon.

both ''Metal Slug 2'' and ''Metal Slug X'' received generally positive reviews. Many of the subsequent ports and re-releases have received mixed reviews. For example, the iOS version of ''Metal Slug 2'' holds an aggregate score of 77% on [[GameRankings]], based on 5 reviews,<ref name=\"GRiOS\" /> and 76 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 6 reviews.<ref name=\"MCiOS\" />\n\nWhen ''Metal Slug 2'' was released on the Virtual Console in 2008, [[IGN]]'s Lucas M. Thomas scored it 7.5 out of 10. He was highly critical of the slowdown (a common criticism of the game when it was first released, and one of the major selling points for ''Metal Slug X''), but praised other aspects; \"It's still a pretty solid game on its own, and there's no denying it's both hilarious and filled to the brim with great run-and-gun action.\"<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 2 Review|url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2009/01/31/metal-slug-2-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Lucas M. |last=Thomas|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Whitehead scored the game 7 out of 10, criticizing the price; \"The ''Metal Slug Anthology'' collates seven games from the series on disc, and can now be bought for just over twice the price of this solitary offering. If you like frantic blasting and silly humour then I heartily recommend you seek out ''Metal Slug''. Just don't feel obliged to do it via Virtual Console.\"<ref name=\"Euro\">{{cite web|title=Virtual Console Roundup Review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/virtual-console-roundup-review_4|publisher=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Dan|last=Whitehead|date=January 18, 2009|accessdate=August 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201214450/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/virtual-console-roundup-review_4|archive-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nEuroGamer's Tom Bramwell scored the 2001 PlayStation version of ''Metal Slug X'' 8 out of 10. Although he felt the game was somewhat dated by current PlayStation standards, he concluded \"''Metal Slug X'' is a fan-pleasingly simple update to the ''MS'' series, and to the rest of us it's the best game of its kind on the PlayStation.\"<ref name=\"EuroPS\" /> [[Game Revolution]]'s Johnny Liu rated the game a B, writing \"as there are fewer and fewer good Playstation games, let alone a quality port. You could do much worse these days.\"<ref name=\"Rev\" /> [[GameSpot]]'s Ryan Davis scored it 8.2 out of 10, writing \"What really separates ''Metal Slug X'' from the rest of the crowd is its tongue-in-cheek presentation. For example, enemy soldiers laugh when you die but shriek in horror when they realize you've come back. Or when a certain midboss is defeated, his corpse falls off the screen and is devoured by a giant killer whale. This skewed sense of humor, combined with its frenzied gameplay, gives the game a unique flavor and makes it one of the best side-scrolling shooters out there.\"<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n \nScott Steinberg reviewed the PlayStation version of ''Metal Slug X'' for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"A derivative but instantly endearing military shooter that earns its stripes.\"<ref name=\"NG\">{{cite magazine|last=Steinberg|first=Scott|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|volume=4|issue=5|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=May 2001|page=87}}</ref>\n\nIn a retrospective review, Neo-Geo.com scored ''Metal Slug X'' 10 out of 10; \"''Metal Slug X'' is different enough in many small ways that if you're a completist, you'll still want ''MS2'' in your collection. However, if you're simply looking for the best-playing game of the two, ''Metal Slug X'' outshines its closely related cousin with a simple formula of \"more, more, and more.\" This really is [[2D

game#Run and gun platformers|run and gun]] [[video game]] developed by [[SNK]]. It was originally released in 1998 for the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo-Geo MVS]] arcade platform as the sequel to the popular 1996 game ''[[Metal Slug (1996 video game)|Metal Slug]]''. It was re-released in 1999 in a slightly modified form as {{nihongo|'''''Metal Slug X: Super Vehicle-001'''''|\u30e1\u30bf\u30eb\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b0X}}. It has been ported to the [[Neo Geo CD]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Virtual Console]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and to the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] (as part of the ''[[Metal Slug Anthology]]''). The game added several new features to the gameplay of the original ''Metal Slug'', such as new weapons, vehicles and the ability to transform the character. It received generally positive reviews.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:NEOGEO Metal Slug 2 (Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001-II).png|thumb|left|One of the new weapons, the Laser, being used on the Mars People]]\n\nGameplay in ''Metal Slug 2'' is very similar to the previous game; the player(s) must shoot constantly at a continual stream of enemies in order to reach the end of each level. At this point, the player confronts a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]], who is usually considerably larger and tougher than regular enemies. On the way through each level, the player can find numerous weapon upgrades and \"Metal Slug\" [[tank]]s. The tank is known as the SV-001 (\"SV\" stands for Super Vehicle), which not only increases the player's offense, but considerably adds to their defense.\n\nIn addition to shooting, the player can also perform melee attacks by using a knife and/or kicking. The player does not die simply by coming into contact with enemies, and correspondingly, many of the enemy troops also have melee attacks. Much of the game's scenery is also destructible, and occasionally, this reveals extra items or power-ups, although most of the time it simply results in [[collateral damage]].\n\nDuring the course of a level, the player also encounters [[Prisoner of war|POW]]s, who, if freed, offer the player bonuses in the form of random items or weapons. At the end of each level, the player receives a scoring bonus based on the number of freed POWs. If the player dies before the end of the level, the tally of freed POWs  reverts to zero.\n\n===New features===\n====Vehicles and weapons====\n''Metal Slug 2'' added several new weapons to the player's arsenal. A single shot from the Laser is capable of killing a column of [[infantry]], and sustained fire can quickly destroy vehicles. Fire Bombs found in the second level can help to clear away [[Mummy|mummies]]. Armor Piercing Shells give the Metal Slug tank [[Shell (projectile)|cannon shells]] that only fire straight, but which do tremendous damage.\n\nThe game also included more vehicles. Though just as susceptible to enemy fire as the Metal Slug, these vehicles provide alternate modes of transportation, with each having their own advantages.\n* The \"Camel Slug\" is a [[M61 Vulcan|Vulcan cannon]] mounted on a [[camel]]. The rider is elevated and still vulnerable to enemy fire, but has improved movement.\n* To help fight a boss that crawls up a tower, the \"Slugnoid\" armored frame is capable of leaping great heights. Its cannon is pointed downward, to assail the enemy attacking from below. Twin Vulcan cannons provide firepower, but they are stripped each time the Slugnoid is hit.\n* The \"Slug Flyer\" is a [[VTOL]] jet fighter which can fire powerful [[air-to-air missile]]s. It also has a Vulcan Cannon, which is designed to fire upon forward targets. Another player can \"wing-walk\", or ride on top of the plane.\n\n====Character transformation====\n''Metal Slug 2'' also introduced the ability for characters to transform during the course of the game. The first transformation is into a mummy during the second mission. Any hit from the purple tinged attacks of the mummy-variants or potions dropped by bats will trigger the transformation. This causes a drastic reduction in player movement speed and loss of any special weapons. Mummified characters hold only a pistol, which they fire at a rate of 50% slower than normal. Tossing a [[grenade]] also takes longer. Players also cannot use the knife, make use of heavy weaponry or vehicles when mummified. If the player is hit by another purple mist whilst mummified, they will die. Antidotes which can restore the player to human form are hidden throughout the level, dropped by enemies and given by rescued POWs.\n\nAnother transformation is the ability to become [[Obesity|obese]]. This transformation is effected by eating too many food items during a single game-life. Once enough food is obtained the announcer yells \"Uh-oh, big!,\" and the character is radically transformed. Movement speed is slowed, and every weapon's attack is altered: melee attacks are changed from a knife to a fork (or a belt whip if sitting), grenades are changed to larger [[Cherry bomb|cherry-style bombs]], and the current weapon is replaced with a version that has larger bullets, and its offensive properties improved (for example, the [[rocket launcher]] has an improved tracking ability). The player returns to regular form if a diet-powder canister is found, enough time passes without picking up any food items, or if the player is killed.\n\n===Supporting characters===\nAs well as doubling the number of available player characters from two to four, ''Metal Slug 2'' is the first game in the series to introduce in-game characters to help the player in battle. The first is Hyakutaro Ichimonji, a prisoner who, when rescued, will fight alongside the player, throwing [[Street Fighter#Hadouken|Hadouken]] balls at enemies, or roundhouse kicking them if they get within melee range. Another character is Sgt. Rumi Aikawa, an army supplier who lacks a sense of direction, earning her the title \"The Wandering Ghost\"; she carries a huge, overstuffed backpack and drops random items for the player to collect (more are dropped if the backpack is shot or cut).\n\n==Plot==\nTwo years have passed since the end of ''Metal Slug'', when Capt. Marco Rossi and Lt. Tarma Roving of Peregrine Falcon Strike Force defeated and apparently killed the evil General Morden, who had staged a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' against the worlds' governments. Since then, various factions sympathetic to Morden have been in operation, but have always been considered insignificant. Recently, however, they have begun to act in unison, and army intelligence concludes that the only way this could happen is if Morden himself is in fact still alive and is attempting a new ''coup''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 2|url=http://www.metalslug10th.com/english/history/series2/index.php|publisher=SNK|4=|accessdate=June 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511052527/http://www.metalslug10th.com/english/history/series2/index.php|archive-date=May 11, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> As such, Rossi (now a Major) and Roving (now a Captain) are sent to once again battle Morden. However, such is the importance of the mission, that they are accompanied by two members of the Intelligence Agency's [[special operations|Special Ops]] Squad S.P.A.R.R.O.W.S.; Sgt. Eri Kasamoto and Sgt. 1st Class Fiolina Germi.\n\nAs the levels unfold, it is revealed that Morden has formed an alliance with aliens in an effort to facilitate his plans (the previous game ended with one of Morden's soldiers sending a [[paper plane|paper airplane]] into [[outer space]]). In the final mission, however, the aliens turn on Morden, attacking his troops and taking him prisoner. An [[ad hoc]] alliance is formed between the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force and General Morden's army to combat the greater alien threat. After a long battle, they succeed in defeating the [[Mother ship]]. As the ship explodes (the scene reminiscent from the movie [[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]), Morden falls to the ground, strapped to a solid iron plate. While his soldiers celebrate his survival, the plate loses its balance and crushes him. The game ends with Rossi, Roving, Kasamoto and Germi celebrating their victory.\n\n==''Metal Slug X''==\n{{Infobox video game\n|title         = Metal Slug X\n|collapsible   = yes\n|image         = Metal Slug X arcade flyer.jpg\n|caption       = European Arcade flyer with art by [[Shinkiro]]\n|developer     = [[SNK]]<br />Prosoft Corporation <small>(PS1)</small><br />[[DotEmu]] <small>(Mobile/PC)</small>\n|publisher     ={{collapsible list|title=SNK|titlestyle=font-weight:normal;font-size:inherit;background:transparent;text-align:left|[[SNK#2003\u20132016: SNK Playmore|SNK Playmore]], [[Sony Computer Entertainment America|SCEA]]<br /><small>(PlayStation Network)</small><br />[[D4 Enterprise]]<br /><small>(Virtual Console)</small><br />[[DotEmu]] <small>(Mobile/PC)</small><br />[[Hamster Corporation|HAMSTER Corporation]] <small>(PS4/Switch/Xbox One)</small>}}\n|producer      = [[Takashi Nishiyama]]\n|designer      = Meeher\n|programmer    = Andy<br />Hirokun<br />Nakatsuka\n|artist        = Akio<br />Cannon<br />Kon.

These items are often hidden.\n* Many environmental elements have different reactions when shot, such as exploding with unexpected results or randomly spewing out items or enemies.\n* Stronger versions of the [[heavy machine gun]], [[flamethrower|flame shot]], [[shotgun]], [[raygun|laser rifle]], and [[rocket launcher]] are available. Each deals more damage than their normal counterpart, has a different appearance and a wider (or longer) area of impact. If the player happens to be fat while using these heavier weapons, they appear differently and can cause even more damage.\n* Several new weapons are included: [[Stone]]s, Iron Lizard, [[missile|Enemy Chaser]], [[grenade launcher|Super Grenade]], Drop Shot, a new Golden Metal Slug, which is available in Mission 3, and the [[armor-piercing shells|Armor Piercer]], available in Mission 4.\n* Added Fio's death sound (In Metal Slug 2, she uses Eri's)\n* New enemies are added or replaced, like the Mummy Dogs.\n* The original art for ''[[Metal Slug (1996 video game)|Metal Slug]]'' is shown at the end of the game while the credits are rolling, instead of the black screen used in ''Metal Slug 2''.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Later releases==\nHome versions of ''Metal Slug 2'' were released for the Neo Geo AES in April 1998,<ref name=\"NEOGEOsnk\">{{cite web|url=http://neogeomuseum.snk-corp.co.jp/english/catalogue/|title=Title Catalogue - NEOGEO MUSEUM|publisher=[[SNK#2003\u20132016: SNK Playmore|SNK Playmore]]|date=2010|access-date=2020-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180828035857/http://neogeomuseum.snk-corp.co.jp/english/catalogue/|archive-date=2018-08-28|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Neo Geo CD]] in June 1998.<ref name=\"NEOGEOsnk\"/> The Neo Geo CD version features a \"Combat School\" mode (similar to the CD-ROM based versions of the previous game) where the player can play new versions of previously-played missions with new objectives.\n\n''Metal Slug X'' was ported to the Neo Geo AES in May 1999 and the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in January 2001.<ref name=\"PSx\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vgchartz.com/game/29913/metal-slug-x/|title=Metal Slug X (PlayStation) |publisher=[[VG Chartz]]|accessdate=October 17, 2013}}</ref> The PlayStation version was released in North America and PAL regions by [[Agetec]] and features the same \"Combat School\" mode featured in the Neo Geo CD versions of the first two games.\n\nIn 2006, ''[[Metal Slug Anthology]]'' (titled ''Metal Slug Complete'' in Japan) was released for the [[Wii]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]].

both ''Metal Slug 2'' and ''Metal Slug X'' received generally positive reviews.

Thomas scored it 7.5 out of 10. He was highly critical of the slowdown (a common criticism of the game when it was first released, and one of the major selling points for ''Metal Slug X''), but praised other aspects; \"It's still a pretty solid game on its own, and there's no denying it's both hilarious and filled to the brim with great run-and-gun action.\"<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|title=Metal Slug 2 Review|url=http://ie.ign.com/articles/2009/01/31/metal-slug-2-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Lucas M. |last=Thomas|date=January 30, 2009|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}</ref> [[Eurogamer]]'s Dan Whitehead scored the game 7 out of 10, criticizing the price; \"The ''Metal Slug Anthology'' collates seven games from the series on disc, and can now be bought for just over twice the price of this solitary offering.

You could do much worse these days.\"<ref name=\"Rev\" /> [[GameSpot]]'s Ryan Davis scored it 8.2 out of 10, writing \"What really separates ''Metal Slug X'' from the rest of the crowd is its tongue-in-cheek presentation. For example, enemy soldiers laugh when you die but shriek in horror when they realize you've come back. Or when a certain midboss is defeated, his corpse falls off the screen and is devoured by a giant killer whale. This skewed sense of humor, combined with its frenzied gameplay, gives the game a unique flavor and makes it one of the best side-scrolling shooters out there.\"<ref name=\"GSpot\" />\n \nScott Steinberg reviewed the PlayStation version of ''Metal Slug X'' for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'', rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"A derivative but instantly endearing military shooter that earns its stripes.\"<ref name=\"NG\">{{cite magazine|last=Steinberg|first=Scott|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|volume=4|issue=5|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=May 2001|page=87}}</ref>\n\nIn a retrospective review, Neo-Geo.com scored ''Metal Slug X'' 10 out of 10; \"''Metal Slug X'' is different enough in many small ways that if you're a completist, you'll still want ''MS2'' in your collection.

The proposal is intended to divert high-speed bicycle and skater traffic from the W&OD Trail in Bluemont Park by constructing a parallel bypass trail on the opposite side of Four Mile Run.  The bypass would begin at the intersection of the W&OD Trail and the Bluemont Junction Trail near the soccer field, run on the original W&OD railroad right-of-way under the VEPCO power lines.  While BCA supports the concept of a bypass, we are opposed to the bypass as planned, due to the likelihood of significant environmental damage, the lack of a proper Environmental Assessment and the omission of key interested parties in the decision making process.

The NVRPA has desired to connect the W&OD trail segments since the original construction of the trail. NVRPA's property adjacent to Bluemont Park is the last section of the railroad right of way to be developed with the trail. In the early 1990s, funding by NVRPA was proposed to be included in its capital budget and public discussion of the project was initiated. ..... Because of concerns about the environmental impacts of the project, the County Board directed that the trail connection be reviewed by the Environment and Energy Conservation Commission (E2C2), and that citizens and bicycle advisory groups be included in that review. ..... NVRPA has agreed to limit routine mowing along the new trail to three feet from the edge of the asphalt, to install a storm water detention facility, and to identify and establish alternate meadow sites both within the project area and elsewhere along the W&OD trail.

The proposal is intended to divert high-speed bicycle and skater traffic from the W&OD Trail in Bluemont Park by constructing a parallel bypass trail on the opposite side of Four Mile Run.  The bypass would begin at the intersection of the W&OD Trail and the Bluemont Junction Trail near the soccer field, run on the original W&OD railroad right-of-way under the VEPCO power lines.  While BCA supports the concept of a bypass, we are opposed to the bypass as planned, due to the likelihood of significant environmental damage, the lack of a proper Environmental Assessment and the omission of key interested parties in the decision making process.  As proposed, the bypass would virtually eliminate a meadow and could significantly disrupt Four Mile Run. |url-status=dead}}<br>(2) {{cite web|last=Donahue |first=William T., County Manager |url=http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/CountyBoard/meetings/2000/oct7/11..htm |title=Memorandum to The County Board of Arlington County, Virginia: Approval of License Agreement With Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA) to Construct and Maintain a Section of the Washington & Old Dominion Trail Along with Related Improvements On County Owned Property (Bluemont Park) for the Public's Use |location=Arlington County, Virginia |publisher=Arlington County Government |date=October 4, 2000 |accessdate=June 13, 2012 |quote=The Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA) has requested a License Agreement (License) from the County to permit NVRPA to construct and maintain a portion of the Washington & Old Dominion Trail and related improvements in Bluemont Park where it crosses North Carlin Springs Road. ..... The proposed trail will connect the existing W&OD Trail from just south of Carlin Springs Road to the intersection of the W&OD Trail and the Bluemont Junction Trail, thereby providing an alternative for pedestrian and bicycle traffic from the Four Mile Run Trail through Bluemont Park. ..... The proposed trail would also connect the only unpaved portion of the W&OD Trail on NVRPA property along its 45 mile path from Arlington to Purcellville. ..... At North Carlin Springs Road, the proposed trail is on County property as it approaches and goes under the bridge at Four Mile Run. After crossing under the bridge, the trail reenters the NVRPA property, and crosses a new bridge to connect with the existing W&OD Trail. ..... The NVRPA has desired to connect the W&OD trail segments since the original construction of the trail. NVRPA's property adjacent to Bluemont Park is the last section of the railroad right of way to be developed with the trail. In the early 1990s, funding by NVRPA was proposed to be included in its capital budget and public discussion of the project was initiated. ..... Because of concerns about the environmental impacts of the project, the County Board directed that the trail connection be reviewed by the Environment and Energy Conservation Commission (E2C2), and that citizens and bicycle advisory groups be included in that review. ..... NVRPA has agreed to limit routine mowing along the new trail to three feet from the edge of the asphalt, to install a storm water detention facility, and to identify and establish alternate meadow sites both within the project area and elsewhere along the W&OD trail. NVRPA again reviewed alternate routes and determined that the suggested alternative routes would not resolve the safety issues and would have greater impact on the environment than the proposed route. |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208163114/http://www.arlingtonva.us/Departments/CountyBoard/meetings/2000/oct7/11..htm |archivedate=February 8, 2012}}<br>(3) A ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new W&OD Trail section in and near Bluemont Park took place on May 11, 2002.

It created the [[Northwest Territory]], the first [[organized territory]] of the United States, from lands beyond the [[Appalachian Mountains]], between [[British North America]] and the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Ohio River]] to the south. The upper [[Mississippi River]] formed the territory's western boundary. \n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which formally ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] yielded this region to the United States. However, the Confederation Congress faced numerous problems gaining control of the land; these included: the unsanctioned movement of [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory|American settlers]] into the Ohio Valley, violent confrontations with the region's [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], the ongoing presence of the British Army which continued to occupy forts in the region, and an empty U.S. treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Land Ordinance of 1785| url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Land_Ordinance_of_1785?rec=1472| publisher=Ohio History Central| accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> The ordinance superseded the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] (which declared that [[U.S. state|states]] would one day be formed within the region) and the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] (which described how the Confederation Congress would sell the land to private citizens). Designed to serve as a blueprint for the development and settlement of the region, what the 1787 ordinance lacked was a strong central government to implement it. This need was addressed shortly thereafter, when the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] came into existence in 1789. The [[1st United States Congress]] reaffirmed the 1787 ordinance, and, with slight modifications, renewed it through the '''Northwest Ordinance of 1789'''.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Horsman| first=Reginald| title=The Northwest Ordinance and the Shaping of an Expanding Republic| journal=The Wisconsin Magazine of History| date=Autumn 1989| volume=73| issue=1| pages=21\u201332| jstor=4636235}}</ref>\n\nConsidered one of the most important legislative acts of the Confederation Congress,<ref>{{cite web |title=Primary Documents in American History: Northwest Ordinance |url=https://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |website=loc.gov |publisher=The [[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=7 April 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191211164800/https://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |archivedate=December 11, 2019}}</ref> it established the precedent by which the Federal government would be sovereign and expand westward with the [[admission to the Union|admission of new states]], rather than with the expansion of existing states and their established sovereignty under the [[Articles of Confederation]].  It also set legislative precedent with regard to American [[public domain (land)|public domain lands]].<ref name=\"HistLandQuest\">Sh\u014dsuke Sat\u014d, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PY0VAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false History of the land question in the United States], Johns Hopkins University, (1886), p.352</ref> The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] recognized the authority of the Northwest Ordinance of 1789 within the applicable [[Northwest Territory]] as constitutional in ''[[Strader v.

Graham|volume=51|page=82|pin=96-97|year=1851|reporter=How.|reporter-volume=10}}.</ref> but did not extend the Ordinance to cover the respective states once they were admitted to the Union.\n\nThe prohibition of slavery in the territory had the practical effect of establishing the Ohio River as the geographic divide between [[slave states and free states]] from the Appalachian Mountains to the Mississippi River (an extension of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]]). It also helped set the stage for later political conflicts over slavery at the federal level in the 19th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Context and history==\n{{Main|Northwest Territory}}\n\nThe territory was acquired by [[Great Britain]] from [[France]] following victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain took over the [[Ohio Country]], as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and signing of the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio.  The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting [[State cession|claims of the states]] of [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]] dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe region had long been desired for expansion by colonists.  The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the US government's ''de facto'' opening of the area to settlement following the defeat of Great Britain.  In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, proposed that the states should relinquish their particular claims to all the territory west of the Appalachians, and the area should be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson's proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 46\u201347, 114}}</ref> Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: ''Cherronesus'', ''Sylvania'', ''Assenisipia'', ''Illinoia'', ''Metropotamia'', ''Polypotamia'', ''Pelisipia'', ''Washington'', ''Michigania'' and ''Saratoga''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 }}</ref> The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal, passing it as the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]].  This ordinance established the example that would become the basis for the Northwest Ordinance three years later.\n\nThe 1784 ordinance was criticized by [[George Washington]] in 1785 and [[James Monroe]] in 1786. Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance's plan for organizing governments in new states, and worried that the new states' relatively small sizes would undermine the original states' power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nWhen passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson.

The first state created from the Northwest Territory was [[Ohio]], in 1803, at which time the remainder was renamed Indiana Territory.

Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate [[Nathan Dane]]. To smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company.  By changing the office of provisional governor from an elected to an appointed position, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.<ref>McDougall, Walter A.

It created the [[Northwest Territory]], the first [[organized territory]] of the United States, from lands beyond the [[Appalachian Mountains]], between [[British North America]] and the [[Great Lakes]] to the north and the [[Ohio River]] to the south. The upper [[Mississippi River]] formed the territory's western boundary. \n\nIn the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which formally ended the [[American Revolutionary War]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] yielded this region to the United States. However, the Confederation Congress faced numerous problems gaining control of the land; these included: the unsanctioned movement of [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory|American settlers]] into the Ohio Valley, violent confrontations with the region's [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], the ongoing presence of the British Army which continued to occupy forts in the region, and an empty U.S. treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Land Ordinance of 1785| url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Land_Ordinance_of_1785?rec=1472| publisher=Ohio History Central| accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> The ordinance superseded the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] (which declared that [[U.S. state|states]] would one day be formed within the region) and the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] (which described how the Confederation Congress would sell the land to private citizens). Designed to serve as a blueprint for the development and settlement of the region, what the 1787 ordinance lacked was a strong central government to implement it. This need was addressed shortly thereafter, when the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] came into existence in 1789.

It also helped set the stage for later political conflicts over slavery at the federal level in the 19th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Context and history==\n{{Main|Northwest Territory}}\n\nThe territory was acquired by [[Great Britain]] from [[France]] following victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain took over the [[Ohio Country]], as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and signing of the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio.  The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting [[State cession|claims of the states]] of [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]] dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe region had long been desired for expansion by colonists.  The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the US government's ''de facto'' opening of the area to settlement following the defeat of Great Britain.  In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, proposed that the states should relinquish their particular claims to all the territory west of the Appalachians, and the area should be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson's proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 46\u201347, 114}}</ref> Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: ''Cherronesus'', ''Sylvania'', ''Assenisipia'', ''Illinoia'', ''Metropotamia'', ''Polypotamia'', ''Pelisipia'', ''Washington'', ''Michigania'' and ''Saratoga''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 }}</ref> The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal, passing it as the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]].  This ordinance established the example that would become the basis for the Northwest Ordinance three years later.\n\nThe 1784 ordinance was criticized by [[George Washington]] in 1785 and [[James Monroe]] in 1786. Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance's plan for organizing governments in new states, and worried that the new states' relatively small sizes would undermine the original states' power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nWhen passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson. It called for dividing the territory into gridded townships, so that once the lands were surveyed, they could be sold to individuals and speculative land companies.  This would provide both a new source of federal government revenue and an orderly pattern for future settlement.<ref>Jerel A. Rosati, James M.

The legislation was revolutionary in that it established the precedent for new lands to be administered by the central government, albeit temporarily, rather than under the jurisdiction of the individually sovereign original states, as it was with the [[Articles of Confederation]].

A portion (about a third) of what later became the state of Minnesota was also part of the territory.\n\n===Education===\nThe ordinance of Congress called for a [[public university]] as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Northwest Territory]], further stipulating, \"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" In 1786, [[Manasseh Cutler]] became interested in the settlement of western lands by [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]]. The following year, as agent of the [[Ohio Company of Associates]] that he had been involved in creating, he organized a contract with Congress whereby his associates (former soldiers of the Revolutionary War) might purchase {{convert|1,500,000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land at the mouth of the [[Muskingum River]] with their Certificate of Indebtedness. Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate [[Nathan Dane]]. To smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company.  By changing the office of provisional governor from an elected to an appointed position, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.<ref>McDougall, Walter A.

Originally named in 1802 as the American Western University, the school never opened. Instead, [[Ohio University]] was formally established on February 18, 1804, when its charter was approved by the Ohio General Assembly. Its establishment came 11 months after [[Ohio]] was admitted to the Union. The first three students enrolled in 1809. Ohio University graduated two students with bachelor's degrees in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=786|title=Ohio University|publisher=Ohio History Central: An Online Encyclopedia of Ohio History|accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of territorial government===\nWhile the population of free, male inhabitants of a territory was less than 5,000, there would be a limited form of government: a governor, a secretary, and three judges, all appointed by Congress. The governor\u2014appointed for a three-year term and given a \"freehold estate therein, in one thousand acres of land\"\u2014would be commander-in-chief of the militia, appoint magistrates and other civil officers, and help create and publish laws as they saw fit for their territory. The secretary\u2014appointed for a four-year term and given a similar freehold estate as the governor but of five hundred acres\u2014would be in charge of keeping and preserving the acts and laws passed by the territorial legislatures, keeping the public records of the district, and transmitting authentic copies of such acts and proceedings every six months to the secretary of the Continental Congress. Three judges\u2014whose appointments would continue indefinitely \"during good behaviour\" and each given the same freehold as the secretary\u2014would be in charge of helping the governor create and pass acts and laws and in making official court rulings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northwest Ordinance |url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |date=July 13, 1787 |pages=335\u2013337 |website=Library of Congress |department=Primary Documents in American History |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOnce the population of a territory reached 5,000 free, male inhabitants, then they would receive authority to elect representatives from their counties or townships to a territorial general assembly. For every 500 free males there would be one representative, until there were 25 representatives. Then the Congress would control the number and proportion of the representatives from that legislature. No male could be a representative unless they were a citizen of the United States for at least three years or lived in the district for three years and who did not own at least 200 acres of land within the same district. These representatives would serve for a term of two years. If a representative died or was removed from office, a new one would be elected to serve out the remaining time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northwest Ordinance |url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |date=July 13, 1787 |pages=337\u2013338 |website=Library of Congress |department=Primary Documents in American History |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of natural rights===\nThe [[natural rights]] provisions of the ordinance foreshadowed the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the first ten amendments to the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chardavoyne |first1=David G. |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Finkelman\n| editor2-last  = Hershock | editor2-first = Martin J. |title=The history of Michigan law |series=Ohio University Press series on law, society, and politics in the Midwest |year=2006 |publisher=Ohio University Press |location=Athens, Ohio |isbn=978-0-8214-1661-7 |oclc=65205057 |chapter=The Northwest Ordinance and Michigan's Territorial Heritage |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjSD45-P2_YC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote=Its provisions established a structure of government that encouraged settlement of that vast region and provided those settlers a startling set of civil rights that presaged the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights }}</ref> Many of the concepts and guarantees of the Ordinance of 1787 were incorporated in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].

In a conflict sometimes known as the [[Northwest Indian War]], [[Blue Jacket]] of the [[Shawnee]]s and [[Little Turtle]] of the [[Miami tribe|Miamis]] formed a confederation to stop white expropriation of the territory. After the Indian confederation had killed more than 800 soldiers in two battles \u2013 the worst defeats ever suffered by the U.S. at the hands of the Indians \u2013 [[George Washington|President Washington]] assigned [[Anthony Wayne|General Anthony Wayne]] command of a [[Legion of the United States|new army]], which eventually defeated the confederation and thus allowed European-Americans to continue settling the territory.\n\n==Commemoration==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"min-width:200px\" |[[File:DSCN3504 ohiocompany e.JPG|200px]]\n|In 1907, a plaque commemorating the \"first permanent settlement in the territory northwest of the Ohio\" and the Northwest Ordinance was placed on the exterior of the [[Federal Hall National Memorial]] at the corner of Broad and Nassau Streets in [[Lower Manhattan]].

In the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] it was only seat in England and Wales where a sitting Conservative MP was unseated, while nationally his party's seat majority increased. However, in 2010, the Conservatives won and held the seat in 2015 and 2017, with an increased majority. The seat is believed to be marginal, but the figures show that this is not the case. The seat was officially known as Montgomery before 1997. It is the only seat in Wales never to have elected a Labour MP. \n\nUntil 1918 this seat, in common with many others, contained an [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|enclaved seat]] which was comprised the boroughs of Montgomery, Llanfyllin, Llanidloes, Newtown and Welshpool. This seat survived the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] which abolished many similar seats. The seat was finally abolished in 1918 and absorbed into the wider Montgomery seat where it remains today.\n\n===Proposed constituency changes===\nUnder proposed constituency boundary changes announced in September 2016, ahead of the next general election, the seat was to be partitioned, the northern half including Welshpool to be merged with [[Clwyd South (UK Parliament constituency)|Clwyd South]] to form a new seat of South Clwyd and North Montgomeryshire; most of the southern including Newtown will be merged with the [[Brecon and Radnor (UK Parliament constituency)|Brecon and Radnor seat]] to form a seat renamed as Brecon, Radnor and Montgomery,<ref>{{cite news|title=It's All Change For MPs, Political map to be transformed|work=Shropshire Star|date=13 September 2016|page=1}}Report by Mark Andrews.</ref> and the wards of Llanidloes and Blaen Hafren merged into the [[Ceredigion (UK Parliament constituency)|Ceredigion constituency]] which would form part of a new seat called Ceredigion and North Pembrokeshire.<ref>{{cite news|title=Former MP urges re-think on move|work=Shropshire Star|date=17 September 2016|page=16}}Report based on criticism of proposals by former Montgomeryshire MP Delwyn Williams.</ref> However, the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2019|2019]] were fought on existing boundaries.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\n\n===1542\u20131604===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Parliament!!Member\n|-\n|1542|| [[James Leche]]<ref name = HoP>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1509-1558/constituencies/montgomeryshire | title= History of Parliament| accessdate= 2011-08-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|1545|| [[Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498-1562 or later)|Humphrey Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1547|| [[Humphrey Lloyd (by 1498-1562 or later)|Humphrey Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1553 (Mar)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1553 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1554 (Apr)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1554 (Nov)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1555||''Not known''\n|-\n|1558|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP/>\n|-\n|1559 (Jan)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2>{{cite web | url= http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/constituencies/montgomeryshire | title= History of Parliament| accessdate= 2011-08-30}}</ref>\n|-\n|1562\u20131563|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1571|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1572|| [[John Price (died 1602)|John Price]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1584 (Oct)|| [[Richard Herbert (c.1557-1596)|Richard Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1586 (Oct)|| [[Oliver Lloyd (MP)|Oliver Lloyd]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1588 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert (died 1593)|Edward Herbert I]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1593|| [[Reginald Williams (MP)|Reginald WIlliams]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1597 (Sep)|| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|-\n|1601 (Oct)|| [[Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury|Edward Herbert]]<ref name = HoP2/>\n|}\n\n===1604\u2013present===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|m|3|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|\n|1604\u20131611\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1614\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1621\u20131622\n| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1624\n| [[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1624\u20131629\n|[[William Herbert, 1st Baron Powis|William Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Short Parliament|1640]]\n|[[Richard Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Richard Herbert]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Long Parliament|1640]]\u20131642\n|[[Sir John Pryce, 1st Baronet|John Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|''1642''\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Seat vacant from 12 September 1642, when Pryce was disabled from sitting''\n|-\n|\n|1647\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1648\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Seat vacant after Vaughan was excluded in [[Pride's Purge]]''\n|-\n|\n|1653\n|colspan=\"2\"|''Not separately represented in the [[Barebones Parliament]]''\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1654\u20131655<br/>''(two members)''\n|[[Sir Charles Lloyd, 1st Baronet (of Garth)|Charles Lloyd]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Sir John Pryce, 1st Baronet|John Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|rowspan=\"2\"|1656\u20131658<br/>''(two members)''\n|[[Sir Charles Lloyd, 1st Baronet (of Garth)|Charles Lloyd]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|[[Hugh Pryce]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1659\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]] \n||\n|-\n|\n|1660\n|[[John Purcell (MP)|John Purcell]]\n||\n|-\n|\n|1661\n| [[Edward Vaughan (of Llwydiarth)|Edward Vaughan]]\n||\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Tories (British political party)/meta/color}}\" |\n|1661\n|[[Andrew Newport|Hon.

[[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] represented in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Created in 1542, it elects one [[Member of Parliament]] (MP), traditionally known as the [[knight of the shire]], by the [[first-past-the-post]] system of election.\n\nThe [[Montgomeryshire (Assembly constituency)|Montgomeryshire Welsh Assembly constituency]] was created with the same boundaries in 1999.\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe seat is based on the ancient county of [[Montgomeryshire]], in the [[Subdivisions of Wales|principal area]] of [[Powys]]. One of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s most rural and isolated constituencies, Montgomeryshire elected Liberal or Liberal-affiliated candidates from 1880, until a Conservative victory in the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]]. In the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]] it was only seat in England and Wales where a sitting Conservative MP was unseated, while nationally his party's seat majority increased. However, in 2010, the Conservatives won and held the seat in 2015 and 2017, with an increased majority. The seat is believed to be marginal, but the figures show that this is not the case. The seat was officially known as Montgomery before 1997. It is the only seat in Wales never to have elected a Labour MP. \n\nUntil 1918 this seat, in common with many others, contained an [[Montgomery (UK Parliament constituency)|enclaved seat]] which was comprised the boroughs of Montgomery, Llanfyllin, Llanidloes, Newtown and Welshpool.

Baxter|Dr. Frank Baxter]], an English professor at the [[University of Southern California]], explains the premise of the movie and its basis in reality. He briefly discusses the [[hollow earth]] theories of [[John Cleves Symmes, Jr.|John Symmes]] and [[Cyrus Teed]] among others, and says that the movie is a fictionalized representation of these unorthodox theories.\n\n[[Archaeologist]]s Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin find a race of [[Sumer]]ian [[albino]]s living deep under the Earth. They keep mutant humanoid [[mole (animal)|mole]] men as their slaves to harvest [[mushroom]]s, which serve as their primary food source. The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. They believe the men are messengers of [[Ishtar]], their goddess. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of Ishtar. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] skin who is disdained by the others since she has the \"mark of darkness.\"\n\nWhen one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods. He orders their capture and takes the flashlight to control the Mole People, not knowing it is depleted. The archaeologists are then sent to the Eye of Ishtar just as the Mole People rebel. Adad goes to the Eye only to realize it is really natural light coming from the surface and that the men had survived. They then climb to the surface. Unfortunately, Adad dies after reaching the surface when an earthquake causes a column to fall over and crush her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Agar]] as Dr. Roger Bentley\n* Cynthia Patrick as Adad\n* [[Hugh Beaumont]] as Dr. Jud Bellamin\n* [[Alan Napier]] as Elinu, the High Priest\n* [[Nestor Paiva]] as Prof. Etienne Lafarge\n* [[Phil Chambers]] as Dr. Paul Stuart\n* [[Rodd Redwing]] as Nazar\n* [[Robin Hughes]] as First Officer\n* [[Frank C. Baxter|Frank Baxter]] as Himself\n\n==Home media==\nUniversal first released ''The Mole People'' on [[VHS]] on June 30, 1993.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mole_people/</ref> Then, in 2006, the film was then released on [[DVD]] in a boxed set called ''The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection'', which features 4 other films (''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', ''[[The Monolith Monsters]]'', and ''[[Monster on the Campus]]''). Universal then re-released this film in 2015 as a stand-alone DVD as part of its ''Universal Vault Series''. Shout Factory's 2019 Blu-ray release includes an audio commentary by Tom Weaver, David Schecter and Jan Alan Henderson, plus other extras. There is also a Region 2 DVD release of this film.\n\n==In other media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThis movie was featured on the television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The characters respond to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending by bitterly declaring \"And no one trusted a John Agar movie again.\"; the ending was changed from a typical happily-ever-after scenario because members of the studio felt that Bentley's romance with Adad would promote interracial relationships.\n\nA segment of this movie was used for the 1968 movie ''[[The Wild World of Batwoman]]'', as creatures created by one of the movie's villains. This use was itself parodied by Mystery Science Theater 3000, with [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]] mocking the classic slogan for [[Reese's]] Peanut Butter cups followed by [[Michael J. Nelson|Mike Nelson]] imitating the movie's villain, proclaiming \"That's enough of THAT film.\"\n\nShown on the [[MeTV]] show [[Svengoolie]] on February 15, 2020.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Kudurru Melishipak Louvre Sb23 Ishtar-star.jpg|thumb|One version of the star symbol of Inanna / Ishtar.]]\nThe fictionalized Mesopotamian history presented by the movie is based largely on [[Panbabylonism]], as both Sumerian and Judaic stories describe the same events of the movie. Dr. Bentley states that the [[Flood geology|Biblical flood]] is an established archaeological fact, and the stranding of the Sumerians atop the mountain is a reference to the tale of [[Noah's Ark]].\n\nSimilarly to the protagonists of the movie [[Ishtar]] descends to the underworld.<ref name=\"Jastrow\">[[#Reference-Jastrow|Jastrow]]</ref> There is a Panbabylonic connection between Ishtar's descent and the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. The [[descent to the underworld]] is a common story of world mythologies, as is the [[flood myth]].\n\nThe movie erroneously associates Ishtar and the Sumerians. Ishtar was the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] counterpart of the Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]]. The imagery associated with Ishtar in the movie is entirely fictional: Ishtar's symbol was an eight-pointed star representing Venus rather than the uneven chevron in the movie.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |first=Jeremy |last=Black |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0 |pages=156, 169\u2013170 }}</ref> Viewers might also notice that all of the gods depicted on the temple walls are Egyptian, not Sumerian.\n\n[[Adad]] is an Akkadian (male) storm-god, counterpart to the Sumerian Ishkur.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mole Man]] (1961), character from the Marvel Universe\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Mole People (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0049516|title=The Mole People}}\n* {{Amg movie|33053|The Mole People}}\n* [http://www.mst3kinfo.com/aceg/8/803/ep803.html MST3K Episode Guide: The Mole People]\n* [http://www.altfg.com/blog/film-reviews/mole-people-virgil-vogel/ DVD Review of The Mole People]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mole People, The}}\n[[Category:1950s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1956 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Lost world films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Hollow Earth in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000]]\n[[Category:1956 directorial debut films]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the film|possible homeless people living underground|Mole people|Jennifer Toth's book of that name|Jennifer Toth}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2016}}\n{{missing information|the film's production, theatrical and home media releases, and reception|date=April 2016}}\n{{lead too short|date=April 2016}}\n}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name = The Mole People\n| image = Mole People.jpg\n| caption = Poster by Joseph Smith\n| writer = [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00f6r\u00f6g (writer)|L\u00e1szl\u00f3 G\u00f6r\u00f6g]]\n| starring = [[John Agar]]<br>[[Hugh Beaumont]]<br>[[Cynthia Patrick]]\n| director = [[Virgil W.

He briefly discusses the [[hollow earth]] theories of [[John Cleves Symmes, Jr.|John Symmes]] and [[Cyrus Teed]] among others, and says that the movie is a fictionalized representation of these unorthodox theories.\n\n[[Archaeologist]]s Dr. Roger Bentley and Dr. Jud Bellamin find a race of [[Sumer]]ian [[albino]]s living deep under the Earth. They keep mutant humanoid [[mole (animal)|mole]] men as their slaves to harvest [[mushroom]]s, which serve as their primary food source. The Sumerian albinos' ancestors relocated into the subterranean after cataclysmic floods in ancient [[Mesopotamia]]. They believe the men are messengers of [[Ishtar]], their goddess. Whenever their population increases, they sacrifice old people to the Eye of Ishtar. These people have lived underground for so long that they are weakened by bright light which the archaeologists brought in the form of a flashlight. However, there is one girl named Adad who has natural [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] skin who is disdained by the others since she has the \"mark of darkness.\"\n\nWhen one of the archaeologists is killed by a mole person, Elinu, the High Priest, realizes they are not gods. He orders their capture and takes the flashlight to control the Mole People, not knowing it is depleted. The archaeologists are then sent to the Eye of Ishtar just as the Mole People rebel. Adad goes to the Eye only to realize it is really natural light coming from the surface and that the men had survived. They then climb to the surface. Unfortunately, Adad dies after reaching the surface when an earthquake causes a column to fall over and crush her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Agar]] as Dr. Roger Bentley\n* Cynthia Patrick as Adad\n* [[Hugh Beaumont]] as Dr. Jud Bellamin\n* [[Alan Napier]] as Elinu, the High Priest\n* [[Nestor Paiva]] as Prof. Etienne Lafarge\n* [[Phil Chambers]] as Dr. Paul Stuart\n* [[Rodd Redwing]] as Nazar\n* [[Robin Hughes]] as First Officer\n* [[Frank C. Baxter|Frank Baxter]] as Himself\n\n==Home media==\nUniversal first released ''The Mole People'' on [[VHS]] on June 30, 1993.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mole_people/</ref> Then, in 2006, the film was then released on [[DVD]] in a boxed set called ''The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection'', which features 4 other films (''[[Tarantula (film)|Tarantula]]'', ''[[The Incredible Shrinking Man]]'', ''[[The Monolith Monsters]]'', and ''[[Monster on the Campus]]''). Universal then re-released this film in 2015 as a stand-alone DVD as part of its ''Universal Vault Series''. Shout Factory's 2019 Blu-ray release includes an audio commentary by Tom Weaver, David Schecter and Jan Alan Henderson, plus other extras. There is also a Region 2 DVD release of this film.\n\n==In other media==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}\nThis movie was featured on the television program ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''. The characters respond to the abrupt and unsatisfying ending by bitterly declaring \"And no one trusted a John Agar movie again.\"; the ending was changed from a typical happily-ever-after scenario because members of the studio felt that Bentley's romance with Adad would promote interracial relationships.\n\nA segment of this movie was used for the 1968 movie ''[[The Wild World of Batwoman]]'', as creatures created by one of the movie's villains. This use was itself parodied by Mystery Science Theater 3000, with [[Crow T. Robot]] and [[Tom Servo]] mocking the classic slogan for [[Reese's]] Peanut Butter cups followed by [[Michael J. Nelson|Mike Nelson]] imitating the movie's villain, proclaiming \"That's enough of THAT film.\"\n\nShown on the [[MeTV]] show [[Svengoolie]] on February 15, 2020.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Kudurru Melishipak Louvre Sb23 Ishtar-star.jpg|thumb|One version of the star symbol of Inanna / Ishtar.]]\nThe fictionalized Mesopotamian history presented by the movie is based largely on [[Panbabylonism]], as both Sumerian and Judaic stories describe the same events of the movie. Dr. Bentley states that the [[Flood geology|Biblical flood]] is an established archaeological fact, and the stranding of the Sumerians atop the mountain is a reference to the tale of [[Noah's Ark]].\n\nSimilarly to the protagonists of the movie [[Ishtar]] descends to the underworld.<ref name=\"Jastrow\">[[#Reference-Jastrow|Jastrow]]</ref> There is a Panbabylonic connection between Ishtar's descent and the [[Old Testament]] story of [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]. The [[descent to the underworld]] is a common story of world mythologies, as is the [[flood myth]].\n\nThe movie erroneously associates Ishtar and the Sumerians. Ishtar was the [[Babylonian religion|Babylonian]] counterpart of the Sumerian goddess [[Inanna]]. The imagery associated with Ishtar in the movie is entirely fictional: Ishtar's symbol was an eight-pointed star representing Venus rather than the uneven chevron in the movie.<ref>{{cite book |title=Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary |first=Jeremy |last=Black |first2=Anthony |last2=Green |year=1992 |isbn=0-292-70794-0 |pages=156, 169\u2013170 }}</ref> Viewers might also notice that all of the gods depicted on the temple walls are Egyptian, not Sumerian.\n\n[[Adad]] is an Akkadian (male) storm-god, counterpart to the Sumerian Ishkur.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mole Man]] (1961), character from the Marvel Universe\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|The Mole People (film)}}\n* {{IMDb title|id=0049516|title=The Mole People}}\n* {{Amg movie|33053|The Mole People}}\n* [http://www.mst3kinfo.com/aceg/8/803/ep803.html MST3K Episode Guide: The Mole People]\n* [http://www.altfg.com/blog/film-reviews/mole-people-virgil-vogel/ DVD Review of The Mole People]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mole People, The}}\n[[Category:1950s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:1956 films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Lost world films]]\n[[Category:Universal Pictures films]]\n[[Category:Hollow Earth in fiction]]\n[[Category:Films featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000]]\n[[Category:1956 directorial debut films]]\n", "name_user": "Bender235", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mole_People"}

Three months later, The Locke family relocates to Matheson, Massachusetts, after family patriarch Rendell's murder. They move into Keyhouse, Rendell\u2019s ancestral home, with the help of Rendell's younger brother Duncan. Youngest Locke son Bode comes across the well house, where he hears the voice of a woman claiming to be his echo. As eldest son Tyler and daughter Kinsey start school, Bode explores Keyhouse and hears strange whispers that lead him to magical keys hidden throughout the house. He finds the Anywhere Key, which can be used on any door to travel to any place he has seen, and the Mirror Key, which opens a portal to a dimension within any mirror. The Locke children's mother, Nina, becomes trapped in the mirror dimension. Echo tells Bode she can save his mom if he gives her the Anywhere Key. He does so, but she uses the key to escape the well house. Tyler and Kinsey arrive in time to help Nina out from the mirror.

Bode fears that Echo may come back and bonds with Rufus, the young Keyhouse groundskeeper. With help from Rufus, Bode tries to set a trap for Echo, but when she returns after using the Anywhere Key to travel the world, she sees right through it and warns Bode not to disappoint her. Bode finds another key and, after seeing a keyhole appear on the back of a store clerk's neck, tries to use it on himself just as Tyler and Kinsey arrive home.

After a hockey game, Tyler finds one of the school bullies hitting on Kinsey, and he beats the bully up due to repressed guilt, a decision that gets him in trouble with Joe Ridgeway. The next day, Tyler lets Kinsey use the Head Key to enter her mind, fashioned after a shopping mall, to find more memories of their father. The two are chased by a representation of Kinsey's fear before they escape. Meanwhile, Bode finds the Ghost Key, which frees his soul from his body and allows him to speak to the dead, including his great-great-grandfather Chamberlain Locke, who mentions Rendell and Duncan had visited him often when they were younger. Nina goes out for dinner with Ellie, Rendell's old friend, and when Nina mentions Bode searching the well house, Ellie becomes gravely concerned.

Ellie helps Nina tear down a wall put up in the house's basement to block a recreation room, where Nina finds an old cabinet. Kinsey invites Scot back to her house and uses the Head Key to show him her mind, where they share a kiss.

Tyler warns Kinsey about abusing the key powers, not wanting to draw attention. That evening, Tyler and Kinsey hear more whispering and find the Plant Key in the graveyard. When they use it on a nearby tree, several jars are uprooted from the ground. The jars contain memories from Duncan's childhood and find one of a young Rendell beating his friend Lucas Caravaggio to death. Meanwhile, Nina becomes suspicious of a scar on Ellie's chest that is identical to one Rendell had.

Kinsey claims it is buried outside, directing him to where she buried her fear monster. During Sam's absence, Tyler helps free Nina, and when Sam returns after overpowering Kinsey's fear, Tyler uses the Head Key on him. Sam's inner self is apologetic. Tyler realizes he did not cause his own father's death when Sam explains Rendell's murder was not planned and that he simply wanted to find the keys for Dodge. Sam removes the Head Key from his own neck just as Dodge appears. She stabs him and takes all of the keys before disappearing.

Tyler and Kinsey travel to the cave with the Omega Door and find a list of the \"Keepers of the Keys\" that includes Rendell and his friends. Kinsey decides to visit Erin at the facility where she lives. Dodge beats her there and uses the Head Key to find the location of the Omega Key from Erin. By the time Kinsey arrives, Erin identifies Dodge as Lucas, one of Rendell's old friends. Dodge, having taken the form of Lucas using the Identity Key, is staying with Ellie and Rufus.

Ellie and her friends hid all evidence of this, including removing Duncan's memories, and split up and hid the keys to prevent anyone from using them again. However, years later, still longing for Lucas, Ellie used the Echo Key at the well house to try to bring him back, only to bring back the entity that had possessed him instead. Ellie had called Mark about Rendell's murder so that he would use the Matchstick Key to immolate himself and keep the mapped locations of the other keys from Dodge. Once Dodge escaped the well house, she took Lucas's form to live with Ellie and Rufus, coercing Ellie to steal the Crown of Shadows from Keyhouse. Ellie and Rufus take the Shadow Key and go back to their house to retrieve the crown.

Bode finds Rufus injured but alive, but discovers no sign of Ellie. Rufus is sent to live with his aunt and uncle in Nebraska. The Lockes decide to stay in Matheson, and Kinsey starts dating Gabe, unaware he is another form of Dodge; Dodge had used the Identity Key to change Ellie's form into Dodge, and it was Ellie the friends had thrown through the Omega Door.

As eldest son Tyler and daughter Kinsey start school, Bode explores Keyhouse and hears strange whispers that lead him to magical keys hidden throughout the house. He finds the Anywhere Key, which can be used on any door to travel to any place he has seen, and the Mirror Key, which opens a portal to a dimension within any mirror. The Locke children's mother, Nina, becomes trapped in the mirror dimension. Echo tells Bode she can save his mom if he gives her the Anywhere Key.

Kinsey claims it is buried outside, directing him to where she buried her fear monster. During Sam's absence, Tyler helps free Nina, and when Sam returns after overpowering Kinsey's fear, Tyler uses the Head Key on him. Sam's inner self is apologetic. Tyler realizes he did not cause his own father's death when Sam explains Rendell's murder was not planned and that he simply wanted to find the keys for Dodge. Sam removes the Head Key from his own neck just as Dodge appears. She stabs him and takes all of the keys before disappearing.

By the time Kinsey arrives, Erin identifies Dodge as Lucas, one of Rendell's old friends. Dodge, having taken the form of Lucas using the Identity Key, is staying with Ellie and Rufus.

Ellie and her friends hid all evidence of this, including removing Duncan's memories, and split up and hid the keys to prevent anyone from using them again. However, years later, still longing for Lucas, Ellie used the Echo Key at the well house to try to bring him back, only to bring back the entity that had possessed him instead. Ellie had called Mark about Rendell's murder so that he would use the Matchstick Key to immolate himself and keep the mapped locations of the other keys from Dodge.
