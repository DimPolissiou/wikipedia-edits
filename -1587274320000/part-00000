''Pan Tadeusz'' recounts the story of two feuding noble families, and the love between Tadeusz Soplica (the title character) of one family, and Zosia of the other. A sub-plot involves a spontaneous revolt of the local inhabitants against the occupying Russian [[garrison]]. Mickiewicz, an exile in Paris and thus beyond the reach of Russian censorship, wrote openly about the occupation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/work/pan-tadeusz-adam-mickiewicz |title=Pan Tadeusz - Adam Mickiewicz |access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Polish national poem begins with the words \"O Lithuania\"; this largely stems from the fact that the 19th-century concept of [[nationality]] had not yet been [[Geopolitics|geopoliticized]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The term \"[[Lithuania]]\" used by Mickiewicz refers to a geographical region encompassed by the present-day borders of Belarus and Lithuania as well as the eastern edge of present-day Poland.\n\n''[[Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw]]'', the oldest cookbook in Polish, served as an inspiration for Mickiewicz's nostalgic description of \"the last Old Polish feast\" in Pan Tadeusz.<ref>{{cite journal|last=B\u0105bel|first=Agnieszka M.|year=2000a|title=Garnek i ksi\u0119ga \u2013 zwi\u0105zki tekstu kulinarnego z tekstem literackim w literaturze polskiej XIX wieku|trans-title=The pot and the book: relationships between culinary and literary texts in Polish literature of the 19th century|pages=163\u2013181|journal=Teksty Drugie: Teoria literatury, krytyka, interpretacja|volume=6|language=Polish|publisher=Instytut Bada\u0144 Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk|location=Warszawa|issn=0867-0633|url=http://rcin.org.pl/Content/59114/WA248_76148_P-I-2524_babel-garnek_o.pdf|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> In his account of the fictional banquet in Book 12, the poet included the names of several dishes described in ''Compendium ferculorum'', such as \"royal borscht\", as well as two of the master chef's secrets: the broth with pearls and a coin, and the three-way fish.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ocieczek|first=Renarda|year=2000|chapter='Zabytek drogi prawych zwyczaj\u00f3w' \u2013 o ksi\u0105\u017cce kucharskiej, kt\u00f3r\u0105 czytywa\u0142 Mickiewicz|trans-chapter = \"The Precious Monument of Righteous Customs\" \u2013 on the cookery book that Mickiewicz used to read|pages=171\u2013191|editor-last=Piechota|editor-first=Marek|title=\"Pie\u015bni ogromnych dwana\u015bcie...\": Studia i szkice o ''Panu Tadeuszu''|trans-title=\"Twelve great cantos...\": Studies and essays on ''Pan Tadeusz''|language=Polish|publisher=Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu \u015al\u0105skiego|location=Katowice|isbn=83-226-0598-2|ignore-isbn-error = true|issn=0208-6336|url=http://www.sbc.org.pl/Content/67443/piesni_ogromnych_dwanascie.pdf|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Fame ==\nAll of Mickiewicz's works, including ''Pan Tadeusz'', are written in the [[Polish language]]. He had been brought up in the [[multicultural]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a  state that incorporated most of what today are the separate countries of Poland, [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. (Hence a waggish [[witticism]] has it that Mickiewicz, who grew up in a Polish family in [[Belarus]] and studied at [[Vilnius University]] in [[Lithuania]], was \"a Belarusin poet who wrote about Lithuania in Polish\".) Of numerous passages from ''Pan Tadeusz'' that are familiar to Poles, the most celebrated is its opening [[quatrain]]:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 3em\">''Litwo!

''Pan Tadeusz'' recounts the story of two feuding noble families, and the love between Tadeusz Soplica (the title character) of one family, and Zosia of the other. A sub-plot involves a spontaneous revolt of the local inhabitants against the occupying Russian [[garrison]]. Mickiewicz, an exile in Paris and thus beyond the reach of Russian censorship, wrote openly about the occupation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://culture.pl/en/work/pan-tadeusz-adam-mickiewicz |title=Pan Tadeusz - Adam Mickiewicz |access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>\n\nThe Polish national poem begins with the words \"O Lithuania\"; this largely stems from the fact that the 19th-century concept of [[nationality]] had not yet been [[Geopolitics|geopoliticized]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} The term \"[[Lithuania]]\" used by Mickiewicz refers to a geographical region encompassed by the present-day borders of Belarus and Lithuania as well as the eastern edge of present-day Poland.\n\n''[[Compendium ferculorum, albo Zebranie potraw]]'', the oldest cookbook in Polish, served as an inspiration for Mickiewicz's nostalgic description of \"the last Old Polish feast\" in Pan Tadeusz.<ref>{{cite journal|last=B\u0105bel|first=Agnieszka M.|year=2000a|title=Garnek i ksi\u0119ga \u2013 zwi\u0105zki tekstu kulinarnego z tekstem literackim w literaturze polskiej XIX wieku|trans-title=The pot and the book: relationships between culinary and literary texts in Polish literature of the 19th century|pages=163\u2013181|journal=Teksty Drugie: Teoria literatury, krytyka, interpretacja|volume=6|language=Polish|publisher=Instytut Bada\u0144 Literackich Polskiej Akademii Nauk|location=Warszawa|issn=0867-0633|url=http://rcin.org.pl/Content/59114/WA248_76148_P-I-2524_babel-garnek_o.pdf|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref> In his account of the fictional banquet in Book 12, the poet included the names of several dishes described in ''Compendium ferculorum'', such as \"royal borscht\", as well as two of the master chef's secrets: the broth with pearls and a coin, and the three-way fish.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ocieczek|first=Renarda|year=2000|chapter='Zabytek drogi prawych zwyczaj\u00f3w' \u2013 o ksi\u0105\u017cce kucharskiej, kt\u00f3r\u0105 czytywa\u0142 Mickiewicz|trans-chapter = \"The Precious Monument of Righteous Customs\" \u2013 on the cookery book that Mickiewicz used to read|pages=171\u2013191|editor-last=Piechota|editor-first=Marek|title=\"Pie\u015bni ogromnych dwana\u015bcie...\": Studia i szkice o ''Panu Tadeuszu''|trans-title=\"Twelve great cantos...\": Studies and essays on ''Pan Tadeusz''|language=Polish|publisher=Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu \u015al\u0105skiego|location=Katowice|isbn=83-226-0598-2|ignore-isbn-error = true|issn=0208-6336|url=http://www.sbc.org.pl/Content/67443/piesni_ogromnych_dwanascie.pdf|access-date=2017-01-03}}</ref>\n\n== Fame ==\nAll of Mickiewicz's works, including ''Pan Tadeusz'', are written in the [[Polish language]]. He had been brought up in the [[multicultural]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a  state that incorporated most of what today are the separate countries of Poland, [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. (Hence a waggish [[witticism]] has it that Mickiewicz, who grew up in a Polish family in [[Belarus]] and studied at [[Vilnius University]] in [[Lithuania]], was \"a Belarusin poet who wrote about Lithuania in Polish\".) Of numerous passages from ''Pan Tadeusz'' that are familiar to Poles, the most celebrated is its opening [[quatrain]]:\n\n<poem style=\"margin-left: 3em\">''Litwo!

CBC had applied for the license in June 1979<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Satellite network sought by CBC; cable firms angry|last=Palango|first=Paul|date=July 5, 1979|work=Globe and Mail|access-date=|url-status=live|page=13}}</ref> to broadcast the House of Commons video feed with additional commentary. A competitive bid, by Canadian cable tv consortium, Cable Satellite Network (CSN) did not get a licesnse for this service. The responsibility to distribute the signal was assigned to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. CBC used the [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] satellites to distribute the proceedings to Canadian cable companies.\n\nFor most of the network's history, [[John Warren (journalist)|John Warren]] hosted a preview [[monologue]] before the beginning of daily proceedings and provided a short summary afterward.\n\nIn 1989, the CBC and a consortium of cable television providers made a joint proposal for the creation of a new entity, the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPaC) that would carry the proceedings of the House of Commons and committees, along with proceedings of royal commissions, enquiries, court hearings and provincial legislatures, and public affairs programming. A review of parliamentary broadcasting resulted but the CPaC proposal was not acted upon. In December 1990, the CBC announced that as a result of budget cuts the CBC \"is no longer able to bear the cost of operating the English- and French-language parliamentary channels. The government will seek the views of the Speaker of the House and consider means of maintaining the service.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp242-e.htm |title=Television and the House of Commons (BP-242E) |access-date=2016-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305232704/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp242-e.htm |archive-date=2009-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The CBC announced that it was discontinuing its role as the parliamentary broadcaster effective April 1, 1991. As an interim measure, the House of Commons' Board of Internal Economy negotiated a temporary contract with the CBC to provide parliamentary coverage for an additional year while the Board considered proposals to take over the service. In 1992, the Board came to an agreement with Canadian Parliamentary Channel, Inc., a consortium of 25 cable companies, to take over the CBC's role. The [[CPAC (TV channel)|Cable Public Affairs Channel]], owned by a consortium of Canadian cable companies, took over responsibility for broadcasting the [[House of Commons of Canada]] proceedings in 1992.\n\n== Hours of operation ==\n\n{| align=center\n|+Live Coverage (Eastern Time)\n!Day\n!Time Period\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Monday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:55&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Tuesday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:55&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Wednesday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Thursday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:55&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Friday\n|10:55&nbsp;p.m. to 1 p.m.; 1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 5 p.m.\n|}\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nAt times of special occasions, the network was used to carry coverage of [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) hearings, as happened in the fall of 1981 to license Canada's first [[pay television]] services.\n\nDuring the summer of 1984, [[Pope John Paul II]] toured [[Canada]].

CBC had applied for the license in June 1979<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Satellite network sought by CBC; cable firms angry|last=Palango|first=Paul|date=July 5, 1979|work=Globe and Mail|access-date=|url-status=live|page=13}}</ref> to broadcast the House of Commons video feed with additional commentary. A competitive bid, by Canadian cable tv consortium, Cable Satellite Netwrk (CSN) did not get a licesnse for this service. The responsibility to distribute the signal was assigned to the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]. CBC used the [[Anik (satellite)|Anik]] satellites to distribute the proceedings to Canadian cable companies.\n\nFor most of the network's history, [[John Warren (journalist)|John Warren]] hosted a preview [[monologue]] before the beginning of daily proceedings and provided a short summary afterward.\n\nIn 1989, the CBC and a consortium of cable television providers made a joint proposal for the creation of a new entity, the Canadian Parliamentary Channel (CPaC) that would carry the proceedings of the House of Commons and committees, along with proceedings of royal commissions, enquiries, court hearings and provincial legislatures, and public affairs programming. A review of parliamentary broadcasting resulted but the CPaC proposal was not acted upon. In December 1990, the CBC announced that as a result of budget cuts the CBC \"is no longer able to bear the cost of operating the English- and French-language parliamentary channels. The government will seek the views of the Speaker of the House and consider means of maintaining the service.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp242-e.htm |title=Television and the House of Commons (BP-242E) |access-date=2016-09-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305232704/http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/PRBpubs/bp242-e.htm |archive-date=2009-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The CBC announced that it was discontinuing its role as the parliamentary broadcaster effective April 1, 1991. As an interim measure, the House of Commons' Board of Internal Economy negotiated a temporary contract with the CBC to provide parliamentary coverage for an additional year while the Board considered proposals to take over the service. In 1992, the Board came to an agreement with Canadian Parliamentary Channel, Inc., a consortium of 25 cable companies, to take over the CBC's role. The [[CPAC (TV channel)|Cable Public Affairs Channel]], owned by a consortium of Canadian cable companies, took over responsibility for broadcasting the [[House of Commons of Canada]] proceedings in 1992.\n\n== Hours of operation ==\n\n{| align=center\n|+Live Coverage (Eastern Time)\n!Day\n!Time Period\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Monday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:55&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Tuesday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:55&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Wednesday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Thursday\n|1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 6 p.m.; 7:55&nbsp;p.m. to 10:30&nbsp;p.m.\n|---- bgcolor=#999900\n|Friday\n|10:55&nbsp;p.m. to 1 p.m.; 1:55&nbsp;p.m. to 5 p.m.\n|}\n\n== Other uses ==\n\nAt times of special occasions, the network was used to carry coverage of [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) hearings, as happened in the fall of 1981 to license Canada's first [[pay television]] services.\n\nDuring the summer of 1984, [[Pope John Paul II]] toured [[Canada]].

In fact, CBC could have it both ways\", by Bronwyn Drainie, The Globe and Mail, 26 May 1990</ref> This prompted complaints from the cable services and the CBC's privately owned affiliates and the network was rebuked by the CRTC for not having first asked for the authorization from the CRTC. Commission chairman [[Andre Bureau]] commented \"We're not against the CBC using the parliamentary channel for special events if they are authorized to do so by the CRTC, but they should respect the regulations and come to us first.\"<ref>\"CRTC boss expects CBC to follow rules\" by Christopher Hume, ''Toronto Star'', 19 May 1986</ref> The experiment was not repeated.<ref name=drainie/>\n\n== CBC-2 ==\n{{Main|CBC-2}}\nFor a while during the 1980s, CBC suggested that its broadcast day could be expanded into a second CBC network, [[CBC-2]].
