This is a design that allows vehicles to drive on one end and drive off the other.  This means that neither the ship nor any of the vehicles need to turn around at any point. It also means that the cargo hold is one long chamber going through the ship. To enable this to work, the vehicle bay doors must be very near the [[waterline]], so unless these are sealed properly, water may leak through. Even a small amount of water moving about inside can gain [[momentum]] and [[capsize]] a ship, in a way known as the [[free surface effect]].\n* Modifications: In the 1980s the ship was reported to have had several modifications, including the addition of two passenger decks and the widening of cargo decks. This would have made the ship less stable than it was designed to be, particularly as its draught was only 5.9m. Combined with high winds, the tall ship could have been toppled easily.{{Citation needed|reason=side sponsons were added exactly to compensate for the increased height \u2013 furthermore, stability checks were performed by RINA as reported in the document cited above|date=August 2019}}\n* Vehicle movement: Another theory is that the rolling of the ship caused one or more of the vehicles in its hold to break loose and puncture a hole in the side of the ship.\n\n=== Search and rescue ===\n[[File:US Navy 060204-N-0000N-002 Infrared imagery taken from a U.S. Navy P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, assisting in search and rescue operations for survivors of the Egyptian ferry Al Salam Boccaccio 98 in the Red Sea.jpg|thumbnail|An infrared image from a U.S. Navy aircraft showing a rescue vessel alongside a life raft from ''al-Salam Boccaccio 98'']]\nAt 23:58 UTC on 2 February 2006 the air-sea rescue control room at [[RAF Kinloss]] in [[Scotland]] detected an automatic distress signal relayed by satellite from the ship's position. The alert was passed on via France to the Egyptian authorities.<ref>{{cite news |date=3 February 2006 |title=Passenger Ferry Sinks in Red Sea |work=Sky News }}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 2006 some [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] and bodies were seen in the water. At least 314 survivors and around 185 dead bodies were recovered.

Italian Coastal Patrol Unit Ships patrolled for more than 90 hours in severe weather conditions, and eight survivors were rescued by [[Multinational Force and Observers|MFO]] vessels ''Vedetta'' and ''Sentinella''.

The bodies were recovered and buried on land, as [[Islam]] forbids [[burial at sea]]. The ship is now a landmark shipwreck for [[scuba divers]] along with the ''[[SS Thistlegorm]]''.\n*In 1994, the [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']] sank, claiming 852 lives.\n*On 26 September 2002 the [[MV Le Joola|MV ''Le Joola'']], a [[Senegalese]] government-owned ferry, capsized off the coast of [[Gambia]] killing at least 1,863 people.\n*On 17 October 2005, ''Pride of al Salam 95'' also sank in the Red Sea after being struck by the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]]-registered cargo ship ''Jebal Ali''. In that accident, two people were killed and another 40 injured, some possibly during a stampede to leave the sinking ship. After evacuating all the ferry passengers and crew, ''Jebal Ali'' went astern and ''Pride of al Salam 95'' sank in about 3\u00bd minutes.\n\n== Trial of owners ==\nIn July 2008 the owner of ''al-Salam Boccaccio 98'', Mamdouh Ismail, along with his son Amr Ismail and two others were acquitted of wrongdoing in connection with the disaster by an Egyptian court. An earlier parliamentary inquiry blamed Ismail's company for the disaster, saying they had operated the ferry despite serious defects. Also, the recovered data recorder proved that the ferry's owner knew there had been a fire on board but gave orders to continue on instead of returning to port as the captain had requested.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grief And Outrage in Egypt|publisher=CNN|date=31 July 2008|url = http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/2008/07/grief-and-outrage-in-egypt.html}}</ref> Family members of the victims felt the ruling was brought about by corruption as Ismail is a member of Egypt's upper house and is very well connected.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anger at Egyptian ferry verdict|date=27 July 2008|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7527652.stm | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 March 2009, after the initial acquittal was overturned in a hearing presided over by Judge Khaled Badereldin, Mamdouh Ismail was sentenced to seven years in prison.

This is a design that allows vehicles to drive on one end and drive off the other.  This means that neither the ship nor any of the vehicles need to turn around at any point. It also means that the cargo hold is one long chamber going through the ship. To enable this to work, the vehicle bay doors must be very near the [[waterline]], so unless these are sealed properly, water may leak through. Even a small amount of water moving about inside can gain [[momentum]] and [[capsize]] a ship, in a way known as the [[free surface effect]].\n* Modifications: In the 1980s the ship was reported to have had several modifications, including the addition of two passenger decks and the widening of cargo decks. This would have made the ship less stable than it was designed to be, particularly as its draught was only 5.9m. Combined with high winds, the tall ship could have been toppled easily.{{Citation needed|reason=side sponsons were added exactly to compensate for the increased height \u2013 furthermore, stability checks were performed by RINA as reported in the document cited above|date=August 2019}}\n* Vehicle movement: Another theory is that the rolling of the ship caused one or more of the vehicles in its hold to break loose and puncture a hole in the side of the ship.\n\n=== Search and rescue ===\n[[File:US Navy 060204-N-0000N-002 Infrared imagery taken from a U.S. Navy P-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft, assisting in search and rescue operations for survivors of the Egyptian ferry Al Salam Boccaccio 98 in the Red Sea.jpg|thumbnail|An infrared image from a U.S. Navy aircraft showing a rescue vessel alongside a life raft from ''al-Salam Boccaccio 98'']]\nAt 23:58 UTC on 2 February 2006 the air-sea rescue control room at [[RAF Kinloss]] in [[Scotland]] detected an automatic distress signal relayed by satellite from the ship's position. The alert was passed on via France to the Egyptian authorities.<ref>{{cite news |date=3 February 2006 |title=Passenger Ferry Sinks in Red Sea |work=Sky News }}</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 2006 some [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboats]] and bodies were seen in the water. At least 314 survivors and around 185 dead bodies were recovered. [[Reuters]] reported that \"dozens\" of bodies were floating in the Red Sea.<ref>{{cite news|title= Ship with 1,400 sinks in Red Sea|newspaper=CNN|date=3 February 2006|url= http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/03/egypt.ship/index.html}}</ref>\n\nRescue boats and helicopters searched the area, including four Egyptian frigates. Italian Coastal Patrol Unit Ships patrolled for more than 90 hours in severe weather conditions, and eight survivors were rescued by [[Multinational Force and Observers|MFO]] vessels ''Vedetta'' and ''Sentinella''.

The bodies were recovered and buried on land, as [[Islam]] forbids [[burial at sea]]. The ship is now a landmark shipwreck for [[scuba divers]] along with the ''[[SS Thistlegorm]]''.\n*In 1994, the [[MS Estonia|MS ''Estonia'']] sank, claiming 852 lives.\n*On 26 September 2002 the [[MV Le Joola|MV ''Le Joola'']], a [[Senegalese]] government-owned ferry, capsized off the coast of [[Gambia]] killing at least 1,863 people.\n*On 17 October 2005, ''Pride of al Salam 95'' also sank in the Red Sea after being struck by the [[Cyprus|Cypriot]]-registered cargo ship ''Jebal Ali''. In that accident, two people were killed and another 40 injured, some possibly during a stampede to leave the sinking ship. After evacuating all the ferry passengers and crew, ''Jebal Ali'' went astern and ''Pride of al Salam 95'' sank in about 3\u00bd minutes.\n\n== Trial of owners ==\nIn July 2008 the owner of ''al-Salam Boccaccio 98'', Mamdouh Ismail, along with his son Amr Ismail and two others were acquitted of wrongdoing in connection with the disaster by an Egyptian court. An earlier parliamentary inquiry blamed Ismail's company for the disaster, saying they had operated the ferry despite serious defects. Also, the recovered data recorder proved that the ferry's owner knew there had been a fire on board but gave orders to continue on instead of returning to port as the captain had requested.<ref>{{cite news|title=Grief And Outrage in Egypt|publisher=CNN|date=31 July 2008|url = http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/middle.east/blog/2008/07/grief-and-outrage-in-egypt.html}}</ref> Family members of the victims felt the ruling was brought about by corruption as Ismail is a member of Egypt's upper house and is very well connected.<ref>{{cite news|title=Anger at Egyptian ferry verdict|date=27 July 2008|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7527652.stm | work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 March 2009, after the initial acquittal was overturned in a hearing presided over by Judge Khaled Badereldin, Mamdouh Ismail was sentenced to seven years in prison.

Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]]. In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\". Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]]. After a number of such broken promises during the first few years of communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe third post-Home Army organization was ''[[Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Niezawis\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'' (''WiN'':  Freedom and Independence).  Its primary goal was not combat, either. Rather, it was designed to help Home Army soldiers transition from partisan to civilian life; while secrecy was necessary in the light of increasing persecution of Home Army veterans by the communist government.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski\">{{cite book |author=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski |title=Warsaw in Chains |year=1959 |editor= |pages=112\u2013123 |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher=Macmillan Publishing |location=New York |id= |url= |accessdate=|author-link=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski }}</ref> ''WiN'' was, however, in great need of funds, necessary to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and life's savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that \"The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests\" to be dealt with.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]\n\nThe persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland. In the period 1944\u201356, some 2 million people were arrested, over 20,000, including the hero of [[Auschwitz]], [[Witold Pilecki]], were executed in communist prisons, and 6 million Polish citizens (every third adult Pole) were classified as  \"reactionary\" or \"criminal elements\" and subjected to spying by state agencies.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nMost Home Army soldiers were captured by the [[NKVD]] or by Poland's ''[[Urzad Bezpieczenstwa|UB]]'' political police.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.{{sfnp|Peszke|2013|loc=''passim''}}\n \nIn the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000\u2013600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers.\"{{r|Leslie|p=234}} On 1 August 1944, when the [[Warsaw Uprising]] began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.{{r|Leslie|p=234}}\n\n==Relations with other factions==\n\n===Relations with Jews===\n{{see also|Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|The Holocaust in Poland}}\n\nHome Army members' attitudes toward Jews varied widely from unit to unit, and the topic remains controversial.<ref name=\"Radzilowski\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert D.

[However] to the Home Army, the Jews were not a part of 'our nation' and ... action to defend them was not to be taken if it endangered [the Home Army's] other objectives.\" He continues to observe that \"it is probably unrealistic to have expected the Home Army\u2014which was neither as well armed nor as well organized as its propaganda claimed\u2014to have been able to do much to aid the Jews.

Its allegiance was to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], and it constituted the armed wing of what became known as the \"[[Polish Underground State]]\".\n\nEstimates of the Home Army's 1944 strength range between 200,000 and 600,000, the most commonly cited number being 400,000. This last number would make the Home Army not only the largest Polish underground [[resistance movement]] but one of the three largest in Europe during World War II.{{efn|name=a}} The Home Army was disbanded on 19 January 1945, after the Soviet [[Red Army]] had largely cleared [[Polish territory]] of German forces.\n\nThe Home Army [[sabotage]]d German operations such as transports headed for the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] in the Soviet Union.  It also fought several full-scale [[battle]]s against the Germans, particularly in 1943 and in [[Operation Tempest]] in 1944. The Home Army tied down substantial German forces and destroyed much-needed German supplies.\n\nThe most widely known Home Army operation was the 1944 [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The partisans also defended Polish civilians against [[ethnic violence|atrocities]] perpetrated by other military formations.\n\nBecause the Home Army was loyal to the Polish Government-in-Exile, the Soviet Union saw it as an obstacle to [[Communism in Poland]]. Consequently, over the course of the war, conflict grew between the Home Army and Soviet forces. During the Soviet occupation of Poland thousands of former Home Army operatives were deported to [[Gulag]]s and Soviet prisons, while others\u2014including senior commanders like [[Leopold Okulicki]] and [[Emil August Fieldorf]]\u2014were executed.\n\nFollowing the war, the official propaganda line in communist Poland was that the Home Army was an oppressive and reactionary force, at least in the 1950s and 1960s. Following the fall of communism in Eastern Europe the image of the Home Army has been more positive.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jeffrey|last=Blutinger|jstor=10.5703/shofar.29.1.73|title=An Inconvenient Past: Post-Communist Holocaust Memorialization|journal=Shofar|volume=29|issue=1|pages=73\u201394|date=Fall 2010}}</ref>{{sfnp|Zimmerman|2015|p=4}}\n\n==History and operations==\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Band of Polish Home Army (Armia Krajowa).PNG|left|thumb|Armband worn by Home Army soldiers]]\n\nThe Home Army originated in the [[Service for Poland's Victory]] (''S\u0142u\u017cba Zwyci\u0119stwu Polski''), which General [[Micha\u0142 Karaszewicz-Tokarzewski]] set up on 27 September 1939, just as the coordinated [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland (1939)|Soviet invasions of Poland]] neared completion.<ref name=\"MNK\" /> Seven weeks later, on 17 November 1939, on the orders of General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], the Service for Poland's Victory was superseded by the [[Union for Armed Struggle|Armed Resistance]] (''Zwi\u0105zek Walki Zbrojnej''), which in turn, a little over two years later, on 14 February 1942, became the \"Home Army\".<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

The [[Political Consultative Committee]] (''Polityczny Komitet Porozumiewawczy'')  formed in 1940 pursuant to an agreement between several major political parties: the [[Polish Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], [[People's Party (Poland)|People's Party]], [[National Party (Poland)|National Party]] and [[Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy)|Labor Party]]. In 1943 it was renamed to [[Home Political Representation]] (''Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna'') and in 1944 to [[Council of National Unity]] (''Rada Jedno\u015bci Narodowej'').{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nThe Home Army, though in theory subordinate to the civil authorities and to the Government in Exile, often acted somewhat independently, with neither the Home Army's commanders in Poland nor the \"London government\" fully aware of the others' situation.{{r|Leslie|pp=235\u2013236}}\n\nAfter [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany started its invasion of the Soviet Union]] on 22 June 1941, the Soviet Union joined the [[Allies in World War II|Allies]] and signed an [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] on 12 July 1941. This put the Polish Government in a difficult position, since it had previously pursued a policy of \"two enemies\". Though a [[Sikorski\u2013Mayski Agreement|Polish\u2013Soviet agreement]] was signed in August 1941, cooperation continued to be difficult and deteriorated further after 1943 when Nazi Germany publicized the [[Katyn massacre]] of 1940.<ref name=\"Michta 1990\" />\n\nUntil the major rising in 1944, the Home Army concentrated on self-defense (the freeing of prisoners and hostages, defense against German pacification operations) and on attacks against German forces. Home Army units carried out thousands of armed raids and intelligence operations, sabotaged hundreds of railway shipments, and participated in many [[partisan (military)|partisan]] clashes and battles with German police and [[Wehrmacht]] units. The Home Army also assassinated prominent [[Collaboration during World War II|Nazi collaborators]] and [[Gestapo]] officials in retaliation against Nazi terror inflicted on Poland's civilian population; prominent individuals assassinated by the Home Army included [[Igo Sym]] (1941) and [[Franz Kutschera]] (1944).<ref name=\"MNK\" /><ref name=\"Enc.

However, many former Home Army units decided to continue operations. The Soviet Union, and the [[Polish communist|Polish Communist Government]] that it controlled, viewed the underground, still loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], as a force to be extirpated before they could gain complete control of Poland. Future [[Secretary General]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka]], is quoted as saying: \"Soldiers of the AK are a hostile element which must be removed without mercy.\" Another prominent Polish communist, [[Roman Zambrowski]], said that the Home Army had to be \"exterminated.\"<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Home Army structure designed primarily to deal with the Soviet threat had been ''[[NIE (resistance)|NIE]]'', formed in mid-1943. Its aim was not to engage Soviet forces in combat, but to observe them and to gather intelligence while the Polish Government-in-Exile decided how to deal with the Soviets; at that time, the exiled government still believed in the possibility of constructive negotiations with the Soviets. On 7 May 1945 ''NIE'' (\"NO\") was disbande and transformed into an [[Armed Forces Delegation for Poland]] (''Delegatura Si\u0142 Zbrojnych na Kraj''); but this organization lasted only until 8 August 1945, when it was decided to disband it and to stop partisan resistance.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe first Polish communist government, the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]], formed in July 1944, declined to accept jurisdiction over Home Army soldiers, therefore for over a year [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agencies such as the [[NKVD]] took responsibility for disarming the Home Army. By war's end, some 60,000 Home Army soldiers had been arrested, 50,000 of whom were deported to Soviet [[Gulag]]s and prisons; most of these soldiers had been taken captive by the Soviets during, or in the aftermath of, [[Operation Tempest]], when many Home Army units tried to work together with the Soviets in a nationwide uprising against the Germans. Other Home Army veterans were arrested when they approached Polish communist government officials after having been promised [[amnesty]]. After a number of such broken promises during the first few years of communist control, Home Army soldiers stopped trusting the government.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe third post-Home Army organization was ''[[Wolno\u015b\u0107 i Niezawis\u0142o\u015b\u0107]]'' (''WiN'':  Freedom and Independence).  Its primary goal was not combat, either. Rather, it was designed to help Home Army soldiers transition from partisan to civilian life; while secrecy was necessary in the light of increasing persecution of Home Army veterans by the communist government.<ref name=\"Korbo\u0144ski\">{{cite book |author=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski |title=Warsaw in Chains |year=1959 |editor= |pages=112\u2013123 |chapter= | chapterurl = |publisher=Macmillan Publishing |location=New York |id= |url= |accessdate=|author-link=Stefan Korbo\u0144ski }}</ref> ''WiN'' was, however, in great need of funds, necessary to pay for false documents and to provide resources for the partisans, many of whom had lost their homes and life's savings in the war. Viewed as enemies of the state, starved of resources, and with a vocal faction advocating armed resistance against the Soviets and their Polish proxies, ''WiN'' was far from efficient. A major victory for the Soviet [[NKVD]] and the newly created Polish secret police, ''[[Urz\u0105d Bezpiecze\u0144stwa]]'' (''UB''), came in the second half of 1945, when they managed to convince several Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders that they truly wanted to offer [[amnesty]] to Home Army members. Over a few months they gained information about great numbers of Home Army and ''WiN'' people and resources. By the time the (imprisoned) Home Army and ''WiN'' leaders realized their mistake, the organizations had been crippled, with thousands of their members arrested. ''WiN'' was finally disbanded in 1952. By 1947 a colonel of the communist forces declared that \"The terrorist and political underground has ceased to be a threatening force, though there are still men of the forests\" to be dealt with.<ref name=\"Rzecz\"/>{{Better source|reason=not scholarly / not English|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:Krzyz AK 64081946chl.jpg|thumb|[[Armia Krajowa Cross|Home Army Cross]], awarded to Home Army veterans by the [[Polish Government-in-Exile]]]]\n\nThe persecution of the Home Army was only part of the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] repressions in Poland.

Nevertheless, the difficult conditions meant that only infantry forces armed with light weapons could be fielded. Any use of artillery, armor or aircraft was impossible (except for a few instances during the [[Warsaw Uprising]], such as the ''[[Kubu\u015b]]'' [[armored car (military)|armored car]]).<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Even these light-infantry units were as a rule armed with a mixture of weapons of various types, usually in quantities sufficient to arm only a fraction of a unit's soldiers.<ref name=\"Laqueur\"/>{{r|Leslie|p=234}}<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nHome Army arms and equipment came mostly from four sources: arms that had been buried by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|invasion of Poland]]; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\n[[File:Warsaw Uprising by Deczkowki - Wacek Platoon - 15911.jpg|thumb|left|Captured German [[Panther tank]], operated by ''[[Batalion Zo\u015bka]]'' armored platoon commanded by [[Wac\u0142aw Micuta]]]]\nFrom arms caches hidden in 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades.<ref name=\"Korb\"/> However, due to their inadequate preservation, which had had to be improvised in the chaos of the September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that had been buried in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nSometimes arms were purchased on the [[black market]] from German soldiers or their allies, or stolen from German supply depots or transports.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Purchases were made by individual units and sometimes by individual soldiers. As Germany's prospects for victory diminished and the morale in German units dropped, the number of soldiers willing to sell their weapons correspondingly increased and thus made this source more important.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} All such purchases were highly risky, as the [[Gestapo]] was well aware of this black market in arms and tried to check it by setting up sting operations. For the most part this trade was limited to personal weapons, but occasionally light and heavy machine guns could also be purchased. It was much easier to trade with Italian and Hungarian units stationed in Poland, which more willingly sold their arms to the Polish underground as long as they could conceal this trade from the Germans.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\nEfforts to capture weapons from the Germans also proved highly successful. Raids were conducted on trains carrying equipment to the front, as well as on guardhouses and [[gendarmerie]] posts. Sometimes weapons were taken from individual German soldiers accosted in the street. During the Warsaw Uprising, the Home Army even managed to capture several German armored vehicles.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}\n\n[[File:B\u0142yskawica and other insurgent weapons.jpg|thumb|Polish weapons, including (''top'') [[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|''B\u0142yskawica'' (\"Lightning\") submachine gun]], one of very few weapons designed and mass-produced covertly in occupied Europe]]\n[[File:Filipinka sidol\u00f3wka.jpg|thumb|Home Army-made ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' (left) and ''[[Filipinka]]'' (right) [[grenade]]s, [[Museum of the Warsaw Rising]]]]\nArms were clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army in its own secret workshops, and also by Home Army members working in German armaments factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} In this way the Home Army was able to procure [[submachine gun]]s (copies of British [[Sten]]s, indigenous ''[[B\u0142yskawica submachine gun|B\u0142yskawica]]s'' and ''[[KIS (weapon)|KIS]]''), pistols (''[[Vis (weapon)|Vis]]''), flamethrowers, explosive devices, road mines, and ''[[Filipinka]]'' and ''[[Sidol\u00f3wka]]'' [[hand grenade]]s.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/> Hundreds of people were involved in the manufacturing effort.  The Home Army did not produce its own ammunition, but relied on supplies stolen by Polish workers from German-run factories.<ref name=\"Stolarski\"/>\n\nThe final source of supply was Allied [[air drop]]s. This was the only way to obtain more exotic, highly useful equipment such as [[plastic explosives]] and antitank weapons such as the British [[PIAT]]. During the war, 485 air-drop missions from the West (about half of them flown by Polish airmen) delivered some 600 tons of supplies for the Polish resistance.<ref name=\"Peszke 2005\"/> Besides equipment, the planes also parachuted in highly qualified instructors ([[Silent Unseen]]), 316 of whom<ref name=\"Embassy PR 2006\"/> were inserted into Poland during the war.<ref name=\"Korb\"/>\n\nBut the air drops were too little, too late.  Air deliveries from the west were limited by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s refusal to let the planes land on Soviet territory; by the low priority placed by the British on flights to Poland; and by extremely heavy losses sustained by Polish Special Duties Flight personnel.  Especially after Hitler attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941 and the Soviets joined the Western Allies in the war against Germany, Britain and the United States attached more importance to not antagonizing Stalin than they did to the aspirations of the Poles to regain their national sovereignty.{{sfnp|Peszke|2013|loc=''passim''}}\n \nIn the end, despite all the efforts, most Home Army forces had inadequate weaponry. In 1944, when the Home Army was at its peak strength (200,000\u2013600,000, according to various estimates), the Home Army had enough weaponry for only some 32,000 soldiers.\"{{r|Leslie|p=234}} On 1 August 1944, when the [[Warsaw Uprising]] began, only a sixth of Home Army fighters in Warsaw were armed.{{r|Leslie|p=234}}\n\n==Relations with other factions==\n\n===Relations with Jews===\n{{see also|Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|The Holocaust in Poland}}\n\nHome Army members' attitudes toward Jews varied widely from unit to unit, and the topic remains controversial.<ref name=\"Radzilowski\"/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert D.

[However] to the Home Army, the Jews were not a part of 'our nation' and ... action to defend them was not to be taken if it endangered [the Home Army's] other objectives.\" He continues to observe that \"it is probably unrealistic to have expected the Home Army\u2014which was neither as well armed nor as well organized as its propaganda claimed\u2014to have been able to do much to aid the Jews.

an [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[smartphone]] unveiled, produced, released and marketed by [[Samsung Electronics]] as part of the [[Samsung Galaxy S series]]. Unveiled on 24 February 2014 at [[Mobile World Congress]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], it was released on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries as the immediate successor to the [[Galaxy S4]]. As with the S4, the S5 is an evolution of the prior year's model, placing a particular emphasis on an improved build with a textured rear cover and [[IP Code|IP67]] certification for dust and water resistance, a more refined user experience, new security features such as a fingerprint reader and private mode, expanded health features (such as a built-in heart rate monitor), and an updated camera.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 received mostly positive reviews; the phone was praised for its display, hardware, camera, long battery life, and incorporating water resistance while retaining a removable battery and MicroSD slot.<ref>[https://mobilesyrup.com/2014/11/30/the-samsung-galaxy-s5-is-the-best-boring-android-smartphone/]</ref> However, the S5 was criticized for [[Software bloat|bloated software]], the inconsistent [[fingerprint scanner]] featured on the phone, and its plastic design in light of rival smartphones' more premium metal bodies.<ref name=engadget-review/><ref name=guardian-fphacked/><ref name=verge-review/> [[Congratulations (PewDiePie, Roomie and Boyinaband song)|Congratulations]] released on March 31, 2019 by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] YouTuber [[PewDiePie]], featuring Swedish singer/musician Roomie and English musician [[Boyinaband]], was the official ringtone in the Samsung Galaxy S5.\n\nIn August 2015, following the release of its then-latest flagship, the [[Galaxy S6]], Samsung released an updated version called the \"Galaxy S5 Neo\" which has an Exynos 7 Octa (7580) processor clocked at 1.6&nbsp; GHz. It has 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of internal storage and comes with [[Android (operating system)|Android]] [[Android Lollipop|5.0.2 \"Lollipop\"]].\n\n== Release date ==\nThe Galaxy S5 was unveiled on 24 February 2014 as part of the company's presentation at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Samsung Electronics president JK Shin explained that consumers did not want a phone dependent on [[Bleeding edge technology|\"eye-popping\" or \"complex\" technology]], but one with \"beautiful design and performance\", a \"simple, yet powerful camera\", \"faster and seamless connectivity\", and fitness-oriented features.<ref name=cnet-s5unveil>{{cite web|title=Galaxy S5 unveiled with fingerprint sensor, bigger screen|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/galaxy-s5-unveiled-with-fingerprint-sensor-bigger-screen/|website=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nSamsung announced that it would release the S5 on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries\u2014including the [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].<ref name=\"releasedate\">{{cite web| url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/02/24/samsung-galaxy-s5-launching-on-april-11-in-150-countries/ | title=Samsung Galaxy S5 launching on April 11th in 150 countries | work=Engadget |publisher=AOL | date=24 February 2012 | accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> On 18 June 2014, Samsung unveiled an [[LTE-Advanced]] version of the S5, exclusively released in [[South Korea]].

Both Samsung and Verizon confirmed the issue, which affected a limited number of Galaxy S5 devices; Samsung instructed users affected by the bug to contact the company or their carrier to have their phone replaced under warranty.<ref name=tr-camerafailed>{{cite web|title=Samsung confirms Galaxy S5 camera issues|url=http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/verizon-galaxy-s5-camera-issues-leave-owners-sol-1244995|website=TechRadar|publisher=Future Publishing|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=verge-camerafailed>{{cite web|title=Samsung confirms fatal camera flaw on 'limited number' of Galaxy S5 smartphones|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/25/5653192/samsung-confirms-fatal-galaxy-s5-camera-problem|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=24 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications==\n\n===Hardware and design===\n==== Changes ====\n[[File: Samsung Galaxy S5.jpg|thumb|left|Rear of an \"Electric Blue\" Galaxy S5, showing the textured rear, camera, and heart rate sensor]]\nThe design of the S5 evolves upon the design of the S4. It features a rounded, [[polycarbonate]] [[chassis]] carrying a \"modern glam\" look, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover. Unlike past models, the S5's rear cover uses a higher quality soft plastic and is dimpled to improve grip. The S5 is [[IP67]] certified for dust and water resistance. As such, the phone is able to be submerged in water up to {{convert|1|m|ft}} for up to 30 minutes. The S5's [[Micro-USB]] [[USB 3.0|3.0]] port uses a removable cover. The S5 is available in Charcoal Black, Electric Blue, Copper Gold, and Shimmery White color finishes. The S5's screen is a {{Convert|5.1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[1080p]] [[Super AMOLED]] panel, which is slightly larger than that of the S4, and allows for automatic brightness and [[gamut]] adjustments.<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/>\n\n==== Front panel ====\nBelow the screen are three buttons. The physical \"Home\" button in the centre contains a swipe-based [[fingerprint scanner]]. The \"Recent apps\" and \"Back\" buttons are capacitive.

Although praised for an improved appearance and build quality, the design of the S5 was panned for retaining a nearly identical appearance and construction to the S4,{{efn|Actually, the design has noticeable changes. The back cover has no more glossy polycarbonate and has a new dot pattern, similar to the Google Nexus 7-2012.}} and for not using higher quality materials such as metal or a higher-quality plastic. The display of the S5 was praised for having a high quality, not being as oversaturated as previous models, and having a wide range of viewing angles, brightness states, and gamut settings to fine tune its appearance. ''[[TechRadar]]'' also noticed that, despite the high power of its processor, some apps and interface functions suffered from performance issues, indicating that the S5's operating system may not have been completely optimized for its system-on-chip. The S5's interface was praised for having a cleaner appearance than previous iterations\u2014however, it was still criticized for containing [[feature creep|too many unnecessary features and settings.]]<ref name=techradar-review>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S5 review - Samsung goes for evolution over revolution... again.|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s5-1226990/review|work=TechRadar|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=engadget-review>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S5 review: a solid improvement, but don't rush to upgrade|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/11/samsung-galaxy-s5-review/|work=Engadget|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=verge-review>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S5 review - The next big thing is a lot of little things|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/14/5608222/samsung-galaxy-s5-review|work=The Verge|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe S5's camera received mostly positive reviews for the improvements to image quality provided by its Isocell image sensor, but was deemed to still be not as good as its competitors, particularly in the case of low-light images.

an [[Android (operating system)|Android]]-based [[smartphone]] unveiled, produced, released and marketed by [[Samsung Electronics]] as part of the [[Samsung Galaxy S series]]. Unveiled on 24 February 2014 at [[Mobile World Congress]] in [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], it was released on 11 April 2014 in 150 countries as the immediate successor to the [[Galaxy S4]]. As with the S4, the S5 is an evolution of the prior year's model, placing a particular emphasis on an improved build with a textured rear cover and [[IP Code|IP67]] certification for dust and water resistance, a more refined user experience, new security features such as a fingerprint reader and private mode, expanded health features (such as a built-in heart rate monitor), and an updated camera.\n\nThe Galaxy S5 received mostly positive reviews; the phone was praised for its display, hardware, camera, long battery life, and incorporating water resistance while retaining a removable battery and MicroSD slot.<ref>[https://mobilesyrup.com/2014/11/30/the-samsung-galaxy-s5-is-the-best-boring-android-smartphone/]</ref> However, the S5 was criticized for [[Software bloat|bloated software]], the inconsistent [[fingerprint scanner]] featured on the phone, and its plastic design in light of rival smartphones' more premium metal bodies.<ref name=engadget-review/><ref name=guardian-fphacked/><ref name=verge-review/>\n\nIn August 2015, following the release of its then-latest flagship, the [[Galaxy S6]], Samsung released an updated version called the \"Galaxy S5 Neo\" which has an Exynos 7 Octa (7580) processor clocked at 1.6&nbsp; GHz.

It features a rounded, [[polycarbonate]] [[chassis]] carrying a \"modern glam\" look, faux metal trim and a removable rear cover. Unlike past models, the S5's rear cover uses a higher quality soft plastic and is dimpled to improve grip. The S5 is [[IP67]] certified for dust and water resistance. As such, the phone is able to be submerged in water up to {{convert|1|m|ft}} for up to 30 minutes. The S5's [[Micro-USB]] [[USB 3.0|3.0]] port uses a removable cover. The S5 is available in Charcoal Black, Electric Blue, Copper Gold, and Shimmery White color finishes. The S5's screen is a {{Convert|5.1|in|mm|adj=on}} [[1080p]] [[Super AMOLED]] panel, which is slightly larger than that of the S4, and allows for automatic brightness and [[gamut]] adjustments.<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/>\n\n==== Front panel ====\nBelow the screen are three buttons. The physical \"Home\" button in the centre contains a swipe-based [[fingerprint scanner]]. The \"Recent apps\" and \"Back\" buttons are capacitive. In accordance with Android 4.0 human interface guidelines, the S5 no longer uses a \"Menu\" key like its predecessors, although its button layout is still reversed in comparison to other Android devices with the S5's button layout (such as the [[HTC One X]] and [[Galaxy Nexus]], whose \"Back\" buttons are to the left of \"Home\").<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/><ref name=ars-galaxys5announce/><ref name=pcmag-handson/><ref name=\"anandtech-onereview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.anandtech.com/show/6747/htc-one-review | title=The HTC One Review | last=Klug | first=Brian | publisher=AnandTech Inc. | work=AnandTech | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502210403/http://anandtech.com/show/6747/htc-one-review | archivedate=2 May 2013 | url-status=live | date=5 April 2013 | accessdate=5 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==== Camera ====\nThe S5 includes a 16&nbsp;[[megapixel]] rear-facing camera, which offers [[4K resolution|4K (2160p)]] video recording at 30[[framerate|fps]], phase detection [[autofocus]] (which Samsung claims to be able to focus in around 0.3&nbsp;seconds),<ref name=pcworld-phoneofhealth/> real-time [[High-dynamic-range imaging|HDR]] photos and video (of which the latter is available for the first time in a Samsung flagship mobile devie), and an [[image sensor]] with Samsung's \"[[Isocell]]\" technology, which isolates the individual pixels inside the sensor to improve its ability to capture light and reduce crosstalk.

Although praised for an improved appearance and build quality, the design of the S5 was panned for retaining a nearly identical appearance and construction to the S4,{{efn|Actually, the design has noticeable changes. The back cover has no more glossy polycarbonate and has a new dot pattern, similar to the Google Nexus 7-2012.}} and for not using higher quality materials such as metal or a higher-quality plastic. The display of the S5 was praised for having a high quality, not being as oversaturated as previous models, and having a wide range of viewing angles, brightness states, and gamut settings to fine tune its appearance. ''[[TechRadar]]'' also noticed that, despite the high power of its processor, some apps and interface functions suffered from performance issues, indicating that the S5's operating system may not have been completely optimized for its system-on-chip. The S5's interface was praised for having a cleaner appearance than previous iterations\u2014however, it was still criticized for containing [[feature creep|too many unnecessary features and settings.]]<ref name=techradar-review>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S5 review - Samsung goes for evolution over revolution... again.|url=http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s5-1226990/review|work=TechRadar|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=engadget-review>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S5 review: a solid improvement, but don't rush to upgrade|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/11/samsung-galaxy-s5-review/|work=Engadget|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref><ref name=verge-review>{{cite web|title=Samsung Galaxy S5 review - The next big thing is a lot of little things|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/14/5608222/samsung-galaxy-s5-review|work=The Verge|accessdate=20 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe S5's camera received mostly positive reviews for the improvements to image quality provided by its Isocell image sensor, but was deemed to still be not as good as its competitors, particularly in the case of low-light images.

The company is headquartered in [[Toronto]].<ref>\"[http://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=contactus_page&customer_type=Residential Contact Us Mail or Fax]\".

Rogers Sr.|Edward Rogers]], which started the [[CFRB]] radio station in Toronto, which was later acquired by outside interests. The present enterprise dates to 1959, when Rogers' son, [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]], founded [[Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting]]. That company acquired [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] in 1960,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://your.rogers.com/aboutrogers/historyofrogers/overview.asp |title=History of Rogers |publisher=Rogers Communications |access-date=2012-05-31|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202060352/http://your.rogers.com/aboutrogers/historyofrogers/overview.asp|archive-date=2008-02-02}}</ref> and launched [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] in 1961.\n\nThe chief competitor to the company is [[Bell Canada]], which has a similarly extensive portfolio of radio and television media assets, as well as wireless, television distribution, and telephone services, particularly in Eastern and Central Canada; the two companies are often seen as having a [[duopoly]] on communications services in their regions as both companies own a stake of [[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment]]. However, the company also competes nationally with [[Telus]] for wireless services, and primarily indirectly with [[Shaw Communications]] for [[multichannel television in Canada|television service]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1925, Rogers Sr. invented the world's first [[alternating current]] (AC) heater filament cathode for a [[radio tube]], which then enabled radios to be powered by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became a key factor in popularizing [[radio]] reception. In 1931, Rogers Sr. was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. He was working on radar when, on May 6, 1939 he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage. He was 38 years old. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (Ted Rogers). While his business interests were sold, his son later determined to carry on his father's business.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1959, [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.]] and Joel Aldred received funding from [[John Bassett]] to found Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting (BARB).  In 1960, it bought [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] FM, and then in 1961, established [[CFTO]], Toronto's first private television station in 1961.  In 1964, it established [[CFTR]], an AM radio station.  In 1967, it established Rogers Cable TV in partnership with BARB.  In 1971, new [[CRTC]] regulations forced BARB to sell its 50% stake in Rogers Cable.  In 1979, Rogers acquired Canadian Cablesystems, and became listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as a result.  In 1980, Rogers acquired Premier Cablevision becoming the largest cable company in Canada.  In 1986, Rogers Cable was renamed Rogers Communications, and established operational control over [[Rogers Wireless|Cantel]], a wireless telephone company in which Rogers had a stake.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n[[File:Rogers logo old.svg|thumb|left|200px|Rogers logo used from 2000-2015.

The present enterprise dates to 1959, when Rogers' son, [[Edward Samuel Rogers|Ted Rogers]], founded [[Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting]]. That company acquired [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] in 1960,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://your.rogers.com/aboutrogers/historyofrogers/overview.asp |title=History of Rogers |publisher=Rogers Communications |access-date=2012-05-31|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202060352/http://your.rogers.com/aboutrogers/historyofrogers/overview.asp|archive-date=2008-02-02}}</ref> and launched [[CFTO-DT|CFTO]] in 1961.\n\nThe chief competitor to the company is [[Bell Canada]], which has a similarly extensive portfolio of radio and television media assets, as well as wireless, television distribution, and telephone services, particularly in Eastern and Central Canada; the two companies are often seen as having a [[duopoly]] on communications services in their regions as both companies own a stake of [[Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment]]. However, the company also competes nationally with [[Telus]] for wireless services, and primarily indirectly with [[Shaw Communications]] for [[multichannel television in Canada|television service]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1925, Rogers Sr. invented the world's first [[alternating current]] (AC) heater filament cathode for a [[radio tube]], which then enabled radios to be powered by ordinary transformer-coupled household electric current. This was a breakthrough in the technology and became a key factor in popularizing [[radio]] reception. In 1931, Rogers Sr. was awarded an experimental television licence in Canada. He was working on radar when, on May 6, 1939 he died suddenly due to complications of a hemorrhage. He was 38 years old. He left a widow, Velma, and a five-year-old son, Edward (Ted Rogers). While his business interests were sold, his son later determined to carry on his father's business.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn 1959, [[Edward S. Rogers Jr.]] and Joel Aldred received funding from [[John Bassett]] to found Baton Aldred Rogers Broadcasting (BARB).  In 1960, it bought [[CHFI-FM|CHFI]] FM, and then in 1961, established [[CFTO]], Toronto's first private television station in 1961.  In 1964, it established [[CFTR]], an AM radio station.  In 1967, it established Rogers Cable TV in partnership with BARB.  In 1971, new [[CRTC]] regulations forced BARB to sell its 50% stake in Rogers Cable.  In 1979, Rogers acquired Canadian Cablesystems, and became listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange as a result.  In 1980, Rogers acquired Premier Cablevision becoming the largest cable company in Canada.  In 1986, Rogers Cable was renamed Rogers Communications, and established operational control over [[Rogers Wireless|Cantel]], a wireless telephone company in which Rogers had a stake.\n\n===2000s and 2010s===\n[[File:Rogers logo old.svg|thumb|left|200px|Rogers logo used from 2000-2015.
