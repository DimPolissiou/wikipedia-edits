''Op 1 april verloor Alva zijn bril'' is a Dutch proverb, which can be translated as: \"On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses.\" In this case, \"bril\" (\"glasses\" in Dutch) serves as a homonym for Brielle. This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.\n\nIn 1686, [[John Aubrey]] referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day\", the first British reference.<ref name=\"Hoax\" /> On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the [[Tower of London]] to \"see the Lions washed\".<ref name=\"Hoax\" />\n\nAlthough no Biblical scholar or historian is known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the [[Genesis flood narrative]].

The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.<ref name=\"Opie 1967 245\u2013246\" />\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".<ref>{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person.

It is a day when many pranks are played: hoaxes \u2013 sometimes very sophisticated \u2013 are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the \"information\" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1 can be untrue. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of April Fools\u2019 Day|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/359171/origin-of-april-fools-day/|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> However, for some in Poland ''prima aprilis'' ends at noon of April 1, and ''prima aprilis'' jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\nDanes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (''aprilsnar'' in Danish; ''aprillip\u00e4iv\u00e4'' in Finnish; ''aprilsk\u00e4mt'' in Swedish).

This includes attempting to attach a paper fish to the victim's back without being noticed. Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day [[postcard]]s.

In some regions of Hispanic America after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"''Inocente palomita que te dejaste enga\u00f1ar''\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\"; not to be confused with another meaning of ''palomita'', which means \u201cpopcorn\u201d in some dialects).\n\nIn Mexico, the phrase is, \u201c''\u00a1Inocente para siempre!\u201d'' which means \"Innocent forever!\".\n\nIn Argentina, the prankster's says, \u201c''\u00a1Que la inocencia te valga!\u201d'' which roughly translates as advice to not be as gullible as the victim of the prank.

''Op 1 april verloor Alva zijn bril'' is a Dutch proverb, which can be translated as: \"On the first of April, Alva lost his glasses.\" In this case, \"bril\" (\"glasses\" in Dutch) serves as a homonym for Brielle. This theory, however, provides no explanation for the international celebration of April Fools' Day.\n\nIn 1686, [[John Aubrey]] referred to the celebration as \"Fooles holy day\", the first British reference.<ref name=\"Hoax\" /> On April 1, 1698, several people were tricked into going to the [[Tower of London]] to \"see the Lions washed\".<ref name=\"Hoax\" />\n\nAlthough no Biblical scholar or historian is known to have mentioned a relationship, some have expressed the belief that the origins of April Fool's Day may go back to the [[Genesis flood narrative]].

The traditional prank is to ask someone to deliver a sealed message that supposedly requests help of some sort. In fact, the message reads \"Dinna laugh, dinna smile. Hunt the gowk another mile.\" The recipient, upon reading it, will explain he can only help if he first contacts another person, and sends the victim to this next person with an identical message, with the same result.<ref name=\"Opie 1967 245\u2013246\" />\n\nIn England a \"fool\" is known by different names around the country, including a \"noodle\", \"gob\", \"gobby\" or \"noddy\".<ref>{{cite web |website=April Fool's Day | url=http://www.aprilfools-day.com| title=Different names in Different parts of England| date=April 1, 2016 |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn Ireland, it was traditional to entrust the victim with an \"important letter\" to be given to a named person.

It is a day when many pranks are played: hoaxes \u2013 sometimes very sophisticated \u2013 are prepared by people, media (which often cooperate to make the \"information\" more credible) and even public institutions. Serious activities are usually avoided, and generally every word said on April 1 can be untrue. The conviction for this is so strong that the Polish anti-Turkish alliance with [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] signed on April 1, 1683, was backdated to March 31.<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of April Fools\u2019 Day|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/359171/origin-of-april-fools-day/|work=The Express Tribune|accessdate=May 27, 2013}}</ref> However, for some in Poland ''prima aprilis'' ends at noon of April 1, and ''prima aprilis'' jokes after that hour are considered inappropriate and not classy.\n\n=== Nordic countries ===\nDanes, Finns, Icelanders, Norwegians and Swedes celebrate April Fools' Day (''aprilsnar'' in Danish; ''aprillip\u00e4iv\u00e4'' in Finnish; ''aprilsk\u00e4mt'' in Swedish).

Such fish feature is prominently present on many late 19th- to early 20th-century French April Fools' Day [[postcard]]s.

In some regions of Hispanic America after a prank is played, the cry is made, \"''Inocente palomita que te dejaste enga\u00f1ar''\" (\"You innocent little dove that let yourself be fooled!\"; not to be confused with another meaning of ''palomita'', which means \u201cpopcorn\u201d in some dialects).\n\nIn Mexico, the phrase is, \u201c''\u00a1Inocente para siempre!\u201d'' which means \"Innocent forever!\".\n\nIn Argentina, the prankster's says, \u201c''\u00a1Que la inocencia te valga!\u201d'' which roughly translates as advice to not be as gullible as the victim of the prank.

{"title_page": "Biphasic and polyphasic sleep", "text_new": "{{redirect|dead sleep|the 1992 film|Dead Sleep}}\n{{redirect-distinguish|dead sleep|deep sleep}}\n\n'''Biphasic sleep''' (or '''diphasic''', '''bimodal''' or '''bifurcated sleep''') is the practice of [[sleep]]ing during two periods over the course of 24 hours, while '''polyphasic sleep''' refers to sleeping three or more times.<ref name=\"Il99F\" /> Each of these is in contrast to '''monophasic sleep''', which is one period of sleep within 24 hours. '''''Segmented sleep''''' and '''''divided sleep''''' may refer to polyphasic or biphasic sleep, but may also refer to '''interrupted sleep''', where the sleep has one or several shorter periods of wakefulness. A common form of biphasic sleep is the Everyman 1 schedule, which usually contains one six hour block of \"core sleep\" and one 20 minute nap. Common forms of polyphasic sleep are the Everyman 2 schedule; which is composed of a 4.5 hour block of core sleep with two 20 minute naps\u2014and the Everyman 3 schedule; which is composed of a 3 hour block of core sleep and three 20 minute naps.\n\nThe term ''polyphasic sleep'' was first used in the early 20th century by psychologist J. S. Szymanski, who observed daily fluctuations in activity patterns (see [[Why We Nap: Evolution, Chronobiology, and Functions of Polyphasic and Ultrashort Sleep|Stampi 1992]]). \nIt is primarily used in the modern day by people that experiment with biphasic and polyphasic schedules to achieve more time awake each day. Sleep schedules which provide the required amount of [[Slow-wave sleep|SWS]] cycles, and [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]], cycles are reported to be sustainable once adapted to, even though adaptation can be uncomfortable and difficult depending on the schedule. Adaptation takes about 4-8 weeks for most schedules. Many people do not sustain these sleep schedules for very long as doing so tends to conflict with professional and personal relationships, although the schedules have not been proven to be unhealthy. More physiologically demanding polyphasic schedules such as the Uberman schedule and the Dymaxion schedule<ref>https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/polyphasic</ref>, which eliminate all cycles except for REM cycles from the sleep schedule, have not been proven to be  remotely sustainable at all.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://polyphasic.net/schedules/uberman/ |title = Uberman Sleep Schedule}}</ref>\n\n==Organization factors and example schedules==\nPeople who sleep on biphasic or polyphasic schedules adhere to strict guidelines as to allow their bodies to adjust to and sustain the schedule. These include but are not limited to,\n*Elimination of blue light 2 hours before core sleep and 30 minutes before 20 minute naps\n*Elimination of food 2 hours before core sleep and 1 hour before 20 minute naps\n*Sleeping and waking up at the same times every day\n*Placing core sleeps and naps at specific circadian-sensitive times of the day, or else use artificial lighting to engineer circadian perception to the desired result\n*Age restrictions on sleep schedule hours: <16 years of age = <7.5 hours. 16-17 years of age = <6.3 hours. 18-21 years of age = <5 hours. 21+ years of age = <4 hours.\n===Segmented Schedule===\n*Biphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Easy\n*Total time asleep: 7 hours\n*Quotient: Two core sleeps: both 3.5 hours\n*Ideal sleep setup: One core sleep from 21:30 to 01:00, the other from 04:00 to 07:30\n===Siesta Schedule===\n*Biphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Easy\n*Total time asleep: 6 hours 30 minutes\n*Quotient: One 5 hour core sleep and one 90 minute core sleep\n*Ideal sleep setup: 5 hour core sleep from 23:00 to 04:00, 90 minute core sleep from 13:00 to 14:30\n===Everyman 1===\n*Biphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Easy\n*Total time asleep: 6 hours 20 minutes\n*Quotient: One 6 hour core sleep and one 20 minute nap\n*Ideal sleep setup: 6 hour core sleep from 23:00 to 05:00, 20 minute nap from 13:00 to 13:20\n===Everyman 2===\n*Polyphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Moderate\n*Total time asleep: 5 hours 10 minutes\n*Quotient: One 4.5 hour core sleep and two 20 minute naps\n*Ideal sleep setup: 4.5 hour core sleep from 23:00 to 03:30, 20 minute nap from 08:00 to 08:20, 20 minute nap from 14:30 to 14:50\n===Everyman 3===\n*Polyphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Hard\n*Total time asleep: 4 hours\n*Quotient: One 3 hour core and three 20 minute naps\n*Ideal sleep setup: 3 hour core sleep from 21:00 to 00:00, 20 minute nap from 04:10 to 04:30, 20 minute nap from 08:10 to 08:30, 20 minute nap from 14:40 to 15:00\n\n==Health==\n===Sleep Spindles, K Complexes, Sleep Pressure, and Repartitioning===\nSleep schedules which do not include NREM1 and NREM2 are plausibly healthy. NREM1 is a merely transitory phase where alpha waves in the brain disappear and theta waves appear. NREM2 includes of activity sleep spindles and K complexes, but these are mostly included in SWS. Non-SWS containing polyphasic sleep schedules (Uberman, Dymaxion, etc.) are unhealthy for this reason. It is unknown whether or not NREM2 is a necessary stage of sleep or if when removing such a stage, the sleep spindle and K complex activity moves over into the SWS cycles. \n\n[[Sleep onset|Sleep Onset]] REM is what happens when a person has been awake for a certain amount of time contradictory to how their circadian rhythm expects it to be, and when they fall asleep they enter REM sleep rather than light sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dinges |first1=David F |title=Differential effects of prior wakefulness and circadian phase on nap sleep |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |date=1 September 1986 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=224\u2013227 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(86)90170-7 |pmid=2427317 }}</ref> As a result of having been awake or not awake in various increments of time relative to the circadian clock of an individual, one will experience and consider what is referred to as \"sleep pressure\". The entire process of adapting to a bi/polyphasic sleep schedule is that of repartitioning the way the brain interacts with sleep cycles through temporary sleep deprivation and usage of sleep pressure. When adaptation is reached, one is no longer sleep deprived.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mattressnerd.com/polyphasic-sleep/adaptation/optimizing-your-sleep/ |title = Optimizing Your Sleep}}</ref>\n\n===Campbell and Murphy===\nIn their 2006 paper \"The Nature of Spontaneous Sleep Across Adulthood\",<ref name=\"fHlSx\" /> Campbell and Murphy studied sleep timing and quality in young, middle-aged, and older adults. They found that, in [[Free-running sleep|free-running]] conditions, the average duration of major nighttime sleep was significantly longer in young adults than in the other groups. The paper states further:\n{{quote|Whether such patterns are simply a response to the relatively static experimental conditions, or whether they more accurately reflect the natural organization of the human sleep/wake system, compared with that which is exhibited in daily life, is open to debate. However, the comparative literature strongly suggests that shorter, polyphasically-placed sleep is the rule, rather than the exception, across the entire animal kingdom (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Tobler, 1989). There is little reason to believe that the human sleep/wake system would evolve in a fundamentally different manner. That people often do not exhibit such sleep organization in daily life merely suggests that humans have the capacity (often with the aid of stimulants such as caffeine or increased physical activity) to overcome the propensity for sleep when it is desirable, or is required, to do so.}}\n\n===Piotr Wo\u017aniak's Criticism of the Uberman schedule===\n[[Piotr Wo\u017aniak (researcher)|Piotr Wo\u017aniak]] considers the theory behind severe reduction of total sleep time by way of short naps unsound, arguing that there is no brain control mechanism that would make it possible to adapt to the \"multiple naps\" system. Wo\u017aniak expresses concern that the ways in which the polyphasic sleepers' attempt to limit total sleep time, restrict time spent in the various stages of the sleep cycle, and disrupt their circadian rhythms, will eventually cause them to suffer the same negative effects as those with other forms of [[sleep deprivation]] and [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]. Wo\u017aniak further claims to have scanned the blogs of polyphasic sleepers and found that they have to choose an \"engaging activity\" again and again just to stay awake and that polyphasic sleep does not improve one's learning ability or creativity.<ref name=\"supermemo\" /> However, Wo\u017aniak only studied the Uberman schedule and his work was done in 2006: The Everyman schedules were invented in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/ | title=Everyman Sleep Schedule}}</ref> Experimentation on the Everyman schedules has not shown any evidence of post-adaptation sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm sleep disorder. There has not been experimentation on various arrangements of polyphasic schedules that contain more than 4 hours of total sleep such as Tri-core or Dual-core schedules, although it would be deductively reasonable that they exhibit the same efficacy and safety.\n\n==Accounts in different entities==\n===U.S. military===\nThe [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] has studied fatigue countermeasures. An Air Force report states:\n{{quote|Each individual nap should be long enough to provide at least 45 continuous minutes of sleep, although longer naps (2 hours) are better. In general, the shorter each individual nap is, the more frequent the naps should be (the objective remains to acquire a daily total of 8 hours of sleep).<ref name=\"3jOv0\" />}}\n\n===Canadian Marine pilots===\nSimilarly, the Canadian Marine pilots in their trainer's handbook report that:\n{{quote|Research on napping shows that 10- to 20-minute naps at regular intervals during the day can help relieve some of the sleep deprivation and thus maintain ... performance for several days. However, researchers caution that levels of performance achieved using ultrashort sleep (short naps) to temporarily replace normal sleep are always well below that achieved when fully rested.<ref name=\"a2qSf\" />}}\n\n===NASA===\n[[NASA]], in cooperation with the [[National Space Biomedical Research Institute]], has funded research on napping. Despite NASA recommendations that [[astronaut]]s sleep eight hours a day when in space, they usually have trouble sleeping eight hours at a stretch, so the agency needs to know about the optimal length, timing and effect of naps. Professor [[David F. Dinges|David Dinges]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] led research in a laboratory setting on sleep schedules which combined various amounts of \"anchor sleep\", ranging from about four to eight hours in length, with no nap or daily naps of up to 2.5 hours. Longer naps were found to be better, with some cognitive functions benefiting more from napping than others. Vigilance and basic alertness benefited the least while [[working memory]] benefited greatly. Naps in the individual subjects' biological daytime worked well, but naps in their nighttime were followed by much greater [[sleep inertia]] lasting up to an hour.<ref name=\"M3dI0\" />\n\n===Italian Air Force===\nThe [[Italian Air Force]] (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) also conducted experiments for their pilots. In schedules involving night shifts and fragmentation of duty periods through the entire day, a sort of polyphasic sleeping schedule was studied. Subjects were to perform two hours of activity followed by four hours of rest (sleep allowed), this was repeated four times throughout the 24-hour day. Subjects adopted a schedule of sleeping only during the final three rest periods in linearly increasing duration.  The AMI published findings that \"total sleep time was substantially reduced as compared to the usual 7\u20138 hour monophasic nocturnal sleep\" while \"maintaining good levels of vigilance as shown by the virtual absence of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] microsleeps.\" EEG [[microsleep]]s are measurable and usually unnoticeable bursts of sleep in the brain while a subject appears to be awake. Nocturnal sleepers who sleep poorly may be heavily bombarded with microsleeps during waking hours, limiting focus and attention.<ref name=\"AdS66\" />\n\n===Buckminster Fuller===\nIn order to gain more time awake in the day, [[Buckminster Fuller]] reportedly advocated a regimen consisting of 30-minute naps every six hours. The short article about Fuller's nap schedule in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1943, which also refers to such a schedule as \"intermittent sleeping\", says that he maintained it for two years, and further notes \"he had to quit because his schedule conflicted with that of his business associates, who insisted on sleeping like other men.\"<ref name=\"wSR3N\" />\n\n===Claudio Stampi===\n[[Claudio Stampi]], as a result of his interest in long-distance solo boat racing, has studied the systematic timing of short naps as a means of ensuring optimal performance in situations where extreme sleep deprivation is inevitable, but he does not advocate ultrashort napping as a lifestyle.<ref name=\"grG5z\" /> ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'' ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]) has reported on Stampi's 49-day experiment where a young man napped for a total of three hours per day. It purportedly shows that all stages of sleep were included.<ref name=\"MwYd0\" /> Stampi has written about his research in his book ''[[Why We Nap: Evolution, Chronobiology, and Functions of Polyphasic and Ultrashort Sleep]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"0ikrG\" /> In 1989 he published results of a field study in the journal ''Work & Stress'', concluding that \"polyphasic sleep strategies improve prolonged sustained performance\" under continuous work situations.<ref name=\"UdEbN\" /> In addition, other long-distance solo sailors have documented their techniques for maximizing wake time on the open seas. One account documents the process by which a solo sailor broke his sleep into between 6 and 7 naps per day. The naps would not be placed equiphasically, instead occurring more densely during night hours.<ref name=\"TFTuI\" />\n\n==Siesta sleep==\n{{Further information|Siesta}}\nOne classic cultural example of a biphasic sleep pattern is the practice of [[siesta]], which is a [[nap]] taken in the early afternoon, often after the midday [[meal]]. Such a period of sleep is a common tradition in some countries, particularly those where the weather is warm. The siesta is historically common throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and [[Southern Europe]]. It is the traditional daytime sleep of [[China]],<ref name=\"CzuK2\" /> [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Italy]],<ref name=\"cTn8A\" /> [[Spain]] and, through Spanish influence, the [[Philippines]] and many [[Hispanic America]]n countries. Benefits include boost in cognitive function and stress reduction.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Interrupted sleep==\n'''Interrupted sleep''' is a primarily biphasic sleep pattern where two periods of nighttime sleep are punctuated by a period of wakefulness. This is what is called in scheduling terms the \"segmented schedule\". Along with a nap in the day, it has been argued that this is the natural pattern of human sleep in long winter nights.<ref name=\"pmid10607034\" /><ref name=\"bbc2012\" /> A case has been made that maintaining such a sleep pattern may be important in regulating stress.<ref name=\"bbc2012\" />\n\n===Historical norm ===\nHistorian [[A. Roger Ekirch]]<ref name=\"Ekirch2001\" /><ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" /> has argued that before the [[Industrial Revolution]], interrupted sleep was dominant in [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He draws evidence from more than 500 references to a segmented sleeping pattern in documents from the ancient, medieval, and modern world.<ref name=\"bbc2012\" /> Other historians, such as Craig Koslofsky,<ref name=\"mHP95\" /> have endorsed Ekirch's analysis.\n\nAccording to Ekirch's argument, adults typically slept in two distinct phases, bridged by an intervening period of wakefulness of approximately one hour.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" /> This time was used to pray<ref name=\"acacoc-1908\" /> and reflect,<ref name=\"IriqL\" /> and to interpret [[dream]]s, which were more vivid at that hour than upon waking in the morning. This was also a favorite time for scholars and poets to write uninterrupted, whereas still others visited neighbors, engaged in sexual activity, or committed petty crime.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" />{{rp|311\u2013323}}\n\nThe human [[circadian rhythm]] regulates the human sleep-wake cycle of wakefulness during the day and sleep at night. Ekirch suggests that it is due to the modern use of [[electric lighting]] that most modern humans do not practice interrupted sleep, which is a concern for some writers.<ref name=\"iq9Xt\" /> Superimposed on this basic rhythm is a secondary one of light sleep in the early afternoon.\n\nThe brain exhibits high levels of the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]] [[prolactin]] during the period of nighttime wakefulness, which may contribute to the feeling of peace that many people associate with it.<ref name=\"Randall2012\" />\n\nThe modern assumption that consolidated sleep with no awakenings is the normal and correct way for human adults to sleep, may lead people to consult their doctors fearing they have maintenance [[insomnia]] or other [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=\"bbc2012\" /> If Ekirch's hypothesis is correct, their concerns might best be addressed by reassurance that their sleep conforms to historically natural sleep patterns.<ref name=\"Q0ELE\" />\n\nEkirch has found that the two periods of night sleep were called \"first sleep\" (occasionally \"dead sleep\") and \"second sleep\" (or \"morning sleep\") in medieval [[England]]. He found that first and second sleep were also the terms in the [[Romance languages]], as well as in the language of the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] of [[Nigeria]]. In French, the common term was ''premier sommeil'' or ''premier somme''; in Italian, ''primo sonno''; in Latin, ''primo somno'' or ''concubia nocte''.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" />{{rp|301\u2013302}} He found no common word in English for the period of wakefulness between, apart from paraphrases such as ''first waking'' or ''when one wakes from his first sleep'' and the generic ''watch'' in its old meaning of being awake. In [[old French]] an equivalent generic term is ''[[wikt:dorveille|dorveille]]'', a [[portmanteau]] of the French words ''dormir'' (to sleep) and ''veiller'' (to be awake).\n\nBecause members of modern industrialised societies, with later evening hours facilitated by electric lighting, mostly do not practice interrupted sleep, Ekirch suggests that they may have misinterpreted and mistranslated references to it in literature. Common modern interpretations of the term ''first sleep'' are \"beauty sleep\" and \"early slumber\". A reference to first sleep in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was translated as \"first sleep\" in the seventeenth century, but, if Ekirch's hypothesis is correct, was universally mistranslated in the twentieth.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" />{{rp|303}}\n\nIn his 1992 study \"In short photoperiods, human sleep is biphasic\", [[Thomas Wehr]] had seven healthy men confined to a room for fourteen hours of darkness daily for a month. At first the participants slept for about eleven hours, presumably making up for their [[sleep debt]]. After this the subjects began to sleep much as people in pre-industrial times were claimed to have done. They would sleep for about four hours, wake up for two to three hours, then go back to bed for another four hours. They also took about two hours to fall asleep.<ref name=\"pmid10607034\" />\n\nAnother example of polyphasic sleep is found in patients with [[irregular sleep-wake syndrome]], a [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]] which usually is caused by neurological abnormality, head injury or [[dementia]].<ref name=\"48jry\" /> Much more common examples are the sleep of human infants, elders, and of many animals.<ref name=\"j0crZ\" /> It is common in many animals, and is believed to be the ancestral sleep state for mammals, although [[simian]]s tend to sleep monophasically.<ref name=\"8FDZB\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[REM rebound]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"pmid10607034\">{{cite journal |last=Wehr |first=T.

'''''Segmented sleep''''' and '''''divided sleep''''' may refer to polyphasic or biphasic sleep, but may also refer to '''interrupted sleep''', where the sleep has one or several shorter periods of wakefulness. A common form of biphasic sleep is the Everyman 1 schedule, which usually contains one six hour block of \"core sleep\" and one 20 minute nap. Common forms of polyphasic sleep are the Everyman 2 schedule; which is composed of a 4.5 hour block of core sleep with two 20 minute naps\u2014and the Everyman 3 schedule; which is composed of a 3 hour block of core sleep and three 20 minute naps.\n\nThe term ''polyphasic sleep'' was first used in the early 20th century by psychologist J. S. Szymanski, who observed daily fluctuations in activity patterns (see [[Why We Nap: Evolution, Chronobiology, and Functions of Polyphasic and Ultrashort Sleep|Stampi 1992]]). \nIt is primarily used in the modern day by people that experiment with biphasic and polyphasic schedules to achieve more time awake each day. Sleep schedules which provide the required amount of [[Slow-wave sleep|SWS]] cycles, and [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM]], cycles are reported to be sustainable once adapted to, even though adaptation can be uncomfortable and difficult depending on the schedule. Adaptation takes about 4-8 weeks for most schedules. Many people do not sustain these sleep schedules for very long as doing so tends to conflict with professional and personal relationships, although the schedules have not been proven to be unhealthy. More physiologically demanding polyphasic schedules such as the Uberman schedule and the Dymaxion schedule<ref>https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/articles/polyphasic</ref>, which eliminate all cycles except for REM cycles from the sleep schedule, have not been proven to be  remotely sustainable at all.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://polyphasic.net/schedules/uberman/ |title = Uberman Sleep Schedule}}</ref>\n\n==Organization factors and example schedules==\nPeople who sleep on biphasic or polyphasic schedules adhere to strict guidelines as to allow their bodies to adjust to and sustain the schedule. These include but are not limited to,\n*Elimination of blue light 2 hours before core sleep and 30 minutes before 20 minute naps\n*Elimination of food 2 hours before core sleep and 1 hour before 20 minute naps\n*Sleeping and waking up at the same times every day\n*Placing core sleeps and naps at specific circadian-sensitive times of the day, or else use artificial lighting to engineer circadian perception to the desired result\n*Age restrictions on sleep schedule hours: <16 years of age = <7.5 hours. 16-17 years of age = <6.3 hours. 18-21 years of age = <5 hours. 21+ years of age = <4 hours.\n===Segmented Schedule===\n*Biphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Easy\n*Total time asleep: 7 hours\n*Quotient: Two core sleeps: both 3.5 hours\n*Ideal sleep setup: One core sleep from 21:30 to 01:00, the other from 04:00 to 07:30\n===Siesta Schedule===\n*Biphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Easy\n*Total time asleep: 6 hours 30 minutes\n*Quotient: One 5 hour core sleep and one 90 minute core sleep\n*Ideal sleep setup: 5 hour core sleep from 23:00 to 04:00, 90 minute core sleep from 13:00 to 14:30\n===Everyman 1===\n*Biphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Easy\n*Total time asleep: 6 hours 20 minutes\n*Quotient: One 6 hour core sleep and one 20 minute nap\n*Ideal sleep setup: 6 hour core sleep from 23:00 to 05:00, 20 minute nap from 13:00 to 13:20\n===Everyman 2===\n*Polyphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Moderate\n*Total time asleep: 5 hours 10 minutes\n*Quotient: One 4.5 hour core sleep and two 20 minute naps\n*Ideal sleep setup: 4.5 hour core sleep from 23:00 to 03:30, 20 minute nap from 08:00 to 08:20, 20 minute nap from 14:30 to 14:50\n===Everyman 3===\n*Polyphasic\n*Adaptation difficulty: Hard\n*Total time asleep: 4 hours\n*Quotient: One 3 hour core and three 20 minute naps\n*Ideal sleep setup: 3 hour core sleep from 21:00 to 00:00, 20 minute nap from 04:10 to 04:30, 20 minute nap from 08:10 to 08:30, 20 minute nap from 14:40 to 15:00\n\n==Health==\n===Sleep Spindles, K Complexes, Sleep Pressure, and Repartitioning===\nSleep schedules which do not include NREM1 and NREM2 are plausibly healthy. NREM1 is a merely transitory phase where alpha waves in the brain disappear and theta waves appear. NREM2 includes of activity sleep spindles and K complexes, but these are mostly included in SWS. Non-SWS containing polyphasic sleep schedules (Uberman, Dymaxion, etc.) are unhealthy for this reason. It is unknown whether or not NREM2 is a necessary stage of sleep or if when removing such a stage, the sleep spindle and K complex activity moves over into the SWS cycles. \n\n[[Sleep onset|Sleep Onset]] REM is what happens when a person has been awake for a certain amount of time contradictory to how their circadian rhythm expects it to be, and when they fall asleep they enter REM sleep rather than light sleep.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dinges |first1=David F |title=Differential effects of prior wakefulness and circadian phase on nap sleep |journal=Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology |date=1 September 1986 |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=224\u2013227 |doi=10.1016/0013-4694(86)90170-7 |pmid=2427317 }}</ref> As a result of having been awake or not awake in various increments of time relative to the circadian clock of an individual, one will experience and consider what is referred to as \"sleep pressure\". The entire process of adapting to a bi/polyphasic sleep schedule is that of repartitioning the way the brain interacts with sleep cycles through temporary sleep deprivation and usage of sleep pressure. When adaptation is reached, one is no longer sleep deprived.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.mattressnerd.com/polyphasic-sleep/adaptation/optimizing-your-sleep/ |title = Optimizing Your Sleep}}</ref>\n\n===Campbell and Murphy===\nIn their 2006 paper \"The Nature of Spontaneous Sleep Across Adulthood\",<ref name=\"fHlSx\" /> Campbell and Murphy studied sleep timing and quality in young, middle-aged, and older adults. They found that, in [[Free-running sleep|free-running]] conditions, the average duration of major nighttime sleep was significantly longer in young adults than in the other groups. The paper states further:\n{{quote|Whether such patterns are simply a response to the relatively static experimental conditions, or whether they more accurately reflect the natural organization of the human sleep/wake system, compared with that which is exhibited in daily life, is open to debate. However, the comparative literature strongly suggests that shorter, polyphasically-placed sleep is the rule, rather than the exception, across the entire animal kingdom (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Tobler, 1989). There is little reason to believe that the human sleep/wake system would evolve in a fundamentally different manner. That people often do not exhibit such sleep organization in daily life merely suggests that humans have the capacity (often with the aid of stimulants such as caffeine or increased physical activity) to overcome the propensity for sleep when it is desirable, or is required, to do so.}}\n\n===Piotr Wo\u017aniak's Criticism of the Uberman schedule===\n[[Piotr Wo\u017aniak (researcher)|Piotr Wo\u017aniak]] considers the theory behind severe reduction of total sleep time by way of short naps unsound, arguing that there is no brain control mechanism that would make it possible to adapt to the \"multiple naps\" system. Wo\u017aniak expresses concern that the ways in which the polyphasic sleepers' attempt to limit total sleep time, restrict time spent in the various stages of the sleep cycle, and disrupt their circadian rhythms, will eventually cause them to suffer the same negative effects as those with other forms of [[sleep deprivation]] and [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]]. Wo\u017aniak further claims to have scanned the blogs of polyphasic sleepers and found that they have to choose an \"engaging activity\" again and again just to stay awake and that polyphasic sleep does not improve one's learning ability or creativity.<ref name=\"supermemo\" /> However, Wo\u017aniak only studied the Uberman schedule and his work was done in 2006: The Everyman schedules were invented in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://polyphasic.net/schedules/everyman/ | title=Everyman Sleep Schedule}}</ref> Experimentation on the Everyman schedules has not shown any evidence of post-adaptation sleep deprivation or circadian rhythm sleep disorder. There has not been experimentation on various arrangements of polyphasic schedules that contain more than 4 hours of total sleep such as Tri-core or Dual-core schedules, although it would be deductively reasonable that they exhibit the same efficacy and safety.\n\n==Accounts in different entities==\n===U.S. military===\nThe [[United States armed forces|U.S. military]] has studied fatigue countermeasures. An Air Force report states:\n{{quote|Each individual nap should be long enough to provide at least 45 continuous minutes of sleep, although longer naps (2 hours) are better. In general, the shorter each individual nap is, the more frequent the naps should be (the objective remains to acquire a daily total of 8 hours of sleep).<ref name=\"3jOv0\" />}}\n\n===Canadian Marine pilots===\nSimilarly, the Canadian Marine pilots in their trainer's handbook report that:\n{{quote|Under extreme circumstances where sleep cannot be achieved continuously, research on napping shows that 10- to 20-minute naps at regular intervals during the day can help relieve some of the sleep deprivation and thus maintain ... performance for several days. However, researchers caution that levels of performance achieved using ultrashort sleep (short naps) to temporarily replace normal sleep are always well below that achieved when fully rested.<ref name=\"a2qSf\" />}}\n\n===NASA===\n[[NASA]], in cooperation with the [[National Space Biomedical Research Institute]], has funded research on napping. Despite NASA recommendations that [[astronaut]]s sleep eight hours a day when in space, they usually have trouble sleeping eight hours at a stretch, so the agency needs to know about the optimal length, timing and effect of naps. Professor [[David F. Dinges|David Dinges]] of the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine]] led research in a laboratory setting on sleep schedules which combined various amounts of \"anchor sleep\", ranging from about four to eight hours in length, with no nap or daily naps of up to 2.5 hours. Longer naps were found to be better, with some cognitive functions benefiting more from napping than others. Vigilance and basic alertness benefited the least while [[working memory]] benefited greatly. Naps in the individual subjects' biological daytime worked well, but naps in their nighttime were followed by much greater [[sleep inertia]] lasting up to an hour.<ref name=\"M3dI0\" />\n\n===Italian Air Force===\nThe [[Italian Air Force]] (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) also conducted experiments for their pilots. In schedules involving night shifts and fragmentation of duty periods through the entire day, a sort of polyphasic sleeping schedule was studied. Subjects were to perform two hours of activity followed by four hours of rest (sleep allowed), this was repeated four times throughout the 24-hour day. Subjects adopted a schedule of sleeping only during the final three rest periods in linearly increasing duration.  The AMI published findings that \"total sleep time was substantially reduced as compared to the usual 7\u20138 hour monophasic nocturnal sleep\" while \"maintaining good levels of vigilance as shown by the virtual absence of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] microsleeps.\" EEG [[microsleep]]s are measurable and usually unnoticeable bursts of sleep in the brain while a subject appears to be awake. Nocturnal sleepers who sleep poorly may be heavily bombarded with microsleeps during waking hours, limiting focus and attention.<ref name=\"AdS66\" />\n\n===Buckminster Fuller===\nIn order to gain more time awake in the day, [[Buckminster Fuller]] reportedly advocated a regimen consisting of 30-minute naps every six hours. The short article about Fuller's nap schedule in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' in 1943, which also refers to such a schedule as \"intermittent sleeping\", says that he maintained it for two years, and further notes \"he had to quit because his schedule conflicted with that of his business associates, who insisted on sleeping like other men.\"<ref name=\"wSR3N\" />\n\n===Claudio Stampi===\n[[Claudio Stampi]], as a result of his interest in long-distance solo boat racing, has studied the systematic timing of short naps as a means of ensuring optimal performance in situations where extreme sleep deprivation is inevitable, but he does not advocate ultrashort napping as a lifestyle.<ref name=\"grG5z\" /> ''[[Scientific American Frontiers]]'' ([[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]) has reported on Stampi's 49-day experiment where a young man napped for a total of three hours per day. It purportedly shows that all stages of sleep were included.<ref name=\"MwYd0\" /> Stampi has written about his research in his book ''[[Why We Nap: Evolution, Chronobiology, and Functions of Polyphasic and Ultrashort Sleep]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"0ikrG\" /> In 1989 he published results of a field study in the journal ''Work & Stress'', concluding that \"polyphasic sleep strategies improve prolonged sustained performance\" under continuous work situations.<ref name=\"UdEbN\" /> In addition, other long-distance solo sailors have documented their techniques for maximizing wake time on the open seas. One account documents the process by which a solo sailor broke his sleep into between 6 and 7 naps per day. The naps would not be placed equiphasically, instead occurring more densely during night hours.<ref name=\"TFTuI\" />\n==Siesta sleep==\n{{Further information|Siesta}}\nOne classic cultural example of a biphasic sleep pattern is the practice of [[siesta]], which is a [[nap]] taken in the early afternoon, often after the midday [[meal]]. Such a period of sleep is a common tradition in some countries, particularly those where the weather is warm. The siesta is historically common throughout the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] and [[Southern Europe]]. It is the traditional daytime sleep of [[China]],<ref name=\"CzuK2\" /> [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Italy]],<ref name=\"cTn8A\" /> [[Spain]] and, through Spanish influence, the [[Philippines]] and many [[Hispanic America]]n countries. Benefits include boost in cognitive function and stress reduction.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Interrupted sleep==\n'''Interrupted sleep''' is a primarily biphasic sleep pattern where two periods of nighttime sleep are punctuated by a period of wakefulness. This is what is called in scheduling terms the \"segmented schedule\". Along with a nap in the day, it has been argued that this is the natural pattern of human sleep in long winter nights.<ref name=\"pmid10607034\" /><ref name=\"bbc2012\" /> A case has been made that maintaining such a sleep pattern may be important in regulating stress.<ref name=\"bbc2012\" />\n\n===Historical norm ===\nHistorian [[A. Roger Ekirch]]<ref name=\"Ekirch2001\" /><ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" /> has argued that before the [[Industrial Revolution]], interrupted sleep was dominant in [[Western culture|Western civilization]]. He draws evidence from more than 500 references to a segmented sleeping pattern in documents from the ancient, medieval, and modern world.<ref name=\"bbc2012\" /> Other historians, such as Craig Koslofsky,<ref name=\"mHP95\" /> have endorsed Ekirch's analysis.\n\nAccording to Ekirch's argument, adults typically slept in two distinct phases, bridged by an intervening period of wakefulness of approximately one hour.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" /> This time was used to pray<ref name=\"acacoc-1908\" /> and reflect,<ref name=\"IriqL\" /> and to interpret [[dream]]s, which were more vivid at that hour than upon waking in the morning. This was also a favorite time for scholars and poets to write uninterrupted, whereas still others visited neighbors, engaged in sexual activity, or committed petty crime.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" />{{rp|311\u2013323}}\n\nThe human [[circadian rhythm]] regulates the human sleep-wake cycle of wakefulness during the day and sleep at night. Ekirch suggests that it is due to the modern use of [[electric lighting]] that most modern humans do not practice interrupted sleep, which is a concern for some writers.<ref name=\"iq9Xt\" /> Superimposed on this basic rhythm is a secondary one of light sleep in the early afternoon.\n\nThe brain exhibits high levels of the [[pituitary]] [[hormone]] [[prolactin]] during the period of nighttime wakefulness, which may contribute to the feeling of peace that many people associate with it.<ref name=\"Randall2012\" />\n\nThe modern assumption that consolidated sleep with no awakenings is the normal and correct way for human adults to sleep, may lead people to consult their doctors fearing they have maintenance [[insomnia]] or other [[sleep disorder]]s.<ref name=\"bbc2012\" /> If Ekirch's hypothesis is correct, their concerns might best be addressed by reassurance that their sleep conforms to historically natural sleep patterns.<ref name=\"Q0ELE\" />\n\nEkirch has found that the two periods of night sleep were called \"first sleep\" (occasionally \"dead sleep\") and \"second sleep\" (or \"morning sleep\") in medieval [[England]]. He found that first and second sleep were also the terms in the [[Romance languages]], as well as in the language of the [[Tiv people|Tiv]] of [[Nigeria]]. In French, the common term was ''premier sommeil'' or ''premier somme''; in Italian, ''primo sonno''; in Latin, ''primo somno'' or ''concubia nocte''.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" />{{rp|301\u2013302}} He found no common word in English for the period of wakefulness between, apart from paraphrases such as ''first waking'' or ''when one wakes from his first sleep'' and the generic ''watch'' in its old meaning of being awake. In [[old French]] an equivalent generic term is ''[[wikt:dorveille|dorveille]]'', a [[portmanteau]] of the French words ''dormir'' (to sleep) and ''veiller'' (to be awake).\n\nBecause members of modern industrialised societies, with later evening hours facilitated by electric lighting, mostly do not practice interrupted sleep, Ekirch suggests that they may have misinterpreted and mistranslated references to it in literature. Common modern interpretations of the term ''first sleep'' are \"beauty sleep\" and \"early slumber\". A reference to first sleep in the ''[[Odyssey]]'' was translated as \"first sleep\" in the seventeenth century, but, if Ekirch's hypothesis is correct, was universally mistranslated in the twentieth.<ref name=\"Ekirch2005\" />{{rp|303}}\n\nIn his 1992 study \"In short photoperiods, human sleep is biphasic\", [[Thomas Wehr]] had seven healthy men confined to a room for fourteen hours of darkness daily for a month. At first the participants slept for about eleven hours, presumably making up for their [[sleep debt]]. After this the subjects began to sleep much as people in pre-industrial times were claimed to have done. They would sleep for about four hours, wake up for two to three hours, then go back to bed for another four hours. They also took about two hours to fall asleep.<ref name=\"pmid10607034\" />\n\nAnother example of polyphasic sleep is found in patients with [[irregular sleep-wake syndrome]], a [[circadian rhythm sleep disorder]] which usually is caused by neurological abnormality, head injury or [[dementia]].<ref name=\"48jry\" /> Much more common examples are the sleep of human infants, elders, and of many animals.<ref name=\"j0crZ\" /> It is common in many animals, and is believed to be the ancestral sleep state for mammals, although [[simian]]s tend to sleep monophasically.<ref name=\"8FDZB\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[REM rebound]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"pmid10607034\">{{cite journal |last=Wehr |first=T.

The first securities market in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was established in 1866 under the name of \"Dersaadet Securities Exchange\" following the [[Crimean War]]. Dersaadet Exchange also created a medium for European investors who were seeking higher returns in the vast Ottoman markets. Following the proclamation of the [[Turkish Republic]], a new law was enacted in 1929 to reorganize the fledgling capital markets under the new name of \"Istanbul Securities and Foreign Exchange Bourse\". \n{{Economy of Turkey}}\nSoon, the Bourse became very active and contributed substantially to the funding requirements of new enterprises across the country. However, its success was clouded by a string of events, including the [[Great Depression]] of 1929 and the impending [[World War II]] abroad which had taken their toll in the just developing business world in Turkey. During the industrial drive of the subsequent decades, there was a continuous increase in the number and size of joint stock companies, which began to open up their equity to the public. Those mature shares faced a strong and growing demand from mostly individual investors and some institutional investors.\n\nThe early phase of the 1980s saw a marked improvement in the Turkish capital markets, both in regard to the legislative framework and the institutions required to set the stage for sound capital movements. In 1981, the \"Capital Market Law\" was enacted. The next year, the main regulatory body responsible for the supervision and regulation of the Turkish securities market, the [[Capital Markets Board of Turkey|Capital Markets Board]] based in [[Ankara]], was established. A new decree was issued in October 1983 foreseeing the setting up of securities exchanges in the country. In October 1984, the \"Regulations for the Establishment and Functions of Securities Exchanges\" was published in the Official Gazette. The regulations concerning operational procedures were approved in the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|parliament]] and the Istanbul Stock Exchange was formally inaugurated at the end of 1985.\n\n==Memberships of ISE==\nThe ISE is a full member of\n*[[World Federation of Exchanges]] (WFE),\n*[[Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges]] (FEAS),\n*[[International Securities Services Association]] (ISSA),\n*[[International Capital Market Association]] (ICMA),\n*[[European Capital Markets Institute]] (ECMI),\n*[[World Economic Forum]] (WEF),\n*[[Federation of European Securities Exchanges]] (FESE) \n* [[Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative|Sustainable Stock Exchanges (SSE) initiative]]  and\n\nAn affiliate member of\n*[[International Organization of Securities Commissions]] (IOSCO).\n\n==ISE and arts==\nThere is a magnificent, four-meter high marble statue of the \"Bull and Bear\", in front of the ISE building\u2019s protocol entrance. Created by one of Turkey\u2019s foremost sculptors, [[Mehmet Aksoy]], the statue symbolizes the behavior of the world\u2019s stock markets, an aggressive bull poised to attack the surrendering bear. Another group of statues, sculptured by [[\u015eermin G\u00fcner]], made in the honor of all existing and deceased brokers, represents brokers engaged in executing orders and is placed at the main entrance. \n\nThe Istanbul Stock Exchange makes contributions to the arts by organizing exhibitions and concerts as well as sponsoring important artistic events in Istanbul.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Companies listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange]]\n* [[Economy of Turkey]]\n* [[List of stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of European stock exchanges]]\n* [[List of Mideast stock exchanges]]\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Turkey}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.borsaistanbul.com/ Official website]\n\n{{Turkey topics}}\n{{Istanbul Stock Exchange companies}}\n{{World Federation of Exchanges}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Financial services companies of Turkey]]\n[[Category:2013 establishments in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Economy of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Stock exchanges in Europe]]\n[[Category:Stock exchanges in the Middle East]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Istanbul]]\n[[Category:Financial services companies established in 2013]]\n[[Category:Derivatives (finance)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox exchange\n|name       = Borsa \u0130stanbul\n|logo       = [[File:Borsa_Istanbul_Logo.svg|150px]]\n|type       = [[Stock exchange]]\n|city       = [[Sar\u0131yer]], [[Istanbul]]\n|country    = Turkey\n|foundation =  1866 (as Dersaadet Securities Exchange) <br> {{Start date|1985|12|26}} (as \u0130MKB) <br> April 5, 2013\n|key_people = Himmet Karada\u011f (Chairman), [[Osman Sara\u00e7]] (CEO)\n|currency   = [[Turkish Lira]]\n|listings   = 411 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isyatirim.com.tr/en-us/analysis/stocks/Pages/default.aspx|title=Stocks|author=|date=|website=www.isyatirim.com}}</ref>\n|mcap       =  $220.620 [[10^9|billion]] (2014)<ref>[http://www.imkb.gov.tr/Data/Consolidated.aspx imkb.gov.tr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612084239/http://www.imkb.gov.tr/Data/Consolidated.aspx |date=June 12, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/istanbul-exchange-names-finance-professor-as-chairman-ahead-of-ipo-80474|title=Istanbul exchange names finance professor as chairman ahead of IPO|author=|date=|website=H\u00fcrriyet Daily News}}</ref>\n|volume     = $1.292&nbsp;[[10^12|trillion]](2012)  \n|indexes    = BIST 30<br />BIST 50<br />BIST 100\n|homepage   = {{URL|http://www.borsaistanbul.com/en/|borsaistanbul.com}}\n}}\n{{Economy of Turkey}}\nThe '''Borsa \u0130stanbul''' (abbreviated as '''BIST''') is the sole exchange entity of [[Turkey]] combining the former Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE) ({{lang-tr|\u0130stanbul Menkul K\u0131ymetler Borsas\u0131, IMKB}}),  the Istanbul Gold Exchange ({{lang-tr|\u0130stanbul Alt\u0131n Borsas\u0131, \u0130AB}}) and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey ({{lang-tr|Vadeli \u0130\u015flem Opsiyon Borsas\u0131, VOB}}) under one umbrella.

Together these institutions have a combined enrollment of more than 70,000 students annually, creating both economic and social effects.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Leon County}}\nOriginally part of [[Escambia County, Florida|Escambia]] and later [[Gadsden County, Florida|Gadsden County]], Leon County was created in 1824.<ref>{{cite book|title=Publications of the Florida Historical Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZQ-AAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA32|year=1908|publisher=Florida Historical Society.|page=32}}</ref> It was named after [[Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n]], the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[List of explorers|explorer]] who was the first [[Europe]]an to reach Florida.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9V1IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA185|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=185}}</ref>\n\nThe United States finally acquired this territory in the nineteenth century. In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces. No Union soldiers set foot in Leon County until the [[Reconstruction Era]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|702|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|667|sqmi}} are land and {{convert|35|sqmi}} (5.0%) are water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Unlike much of Florida, most of Leon County has rolling hills, part of north Florida's [[Red Hills Region]].

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County.

Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

In the 1830s, it attempted to conduct [[Indian Removal]] of the [[Seminole]] and [[Creek people]]s, who had migrated south to escape European-American encroachment in Georgia and Alabama. After many Seminole were forcibly removed from the area or moved south to the Everglades during the [[Seminole Wars]], planters developed cotton plantations based on enslaved labor.\n\nBy the 1850s and 1860s, Leon County had become part of the \"cotton kingdom\" of the Deep South. It ranked fifth of all [[Florida]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] counties in the production of cotton from the 20 major plantations. Uniquely among Confederate capitals east of the [[Mississippi River]], in the [[American Civil War]] Tallahassee was never captured by Union forces.

According to an article written in Africology: The Journal of Pan African Studies, The library was built on the campus of Florida A&M University because the city refused the donation based on the fact that it would have to serve the black citizens.  \"The facility boasted modern amenities such as electricity, indoor plumbing and water supplied by the city. In later years, the Library served as an art gallery, religious center, and in 1976, became the founding home of the Black Archives Research Center and Museum. By functioning both as a repository for archival records and a museum for historical regalia, the center continues to render academic support to educational institutions, civic, political, religious and Museum.

On November 17, 1978, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\n\nThe Carnegie Library of Tallahassee which only served the black community became the only free public library in the city until 1955.  According to the Leon County Public Library's website, the American Association of University Women formed the Friends of the Library organization in 1954.  The formation of the Friends of the Library was in direct response to the fact that \"Tallahassee was the only state capital in the United States not offering free public library service.\" <ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\">Leon County. (2002-2016). Library History. Retrieved April 09, 2018, from Leon County Florida Government: http://cms.leoncountyfl.gov/Library/LibraryInformation/Library-History</ref>  One year later, the library was established in May by legislative action and was developed by citizens and civic groups.  In 1956 the first Leon County free public library opened on March 21.  The first building used to house the library was The Columns, one of the  oldest remaining antebellum homes in the Leon County area located at Park Avenue and Adams street (the building today is home of the James Madison Institute).\n\nIn order to expand library services the Junior League of Tallahassee donated a bookmobile to the library. The vehicle was later donated to the Leon County Sheriff's Office to be used as a paddy wagon for its Road Prison.\nIn 1962 the library moved to the old Elks Club building at 127 North Monroe Street. Public transit in the city of Tallahassee was desegregated by 1958, yet it would several more years before the public library system would experience integration.\n\nIn the early 70's Jefferson and Wakulla counties joined the Leon County Public Library System, forming the Leon, Jefferson, and Wakulla County Public Library System. According to the library's web site, \"Leon County provided administrative and other services to the two smaller counties, while each supported the direct costs of their library services and their share of Leon's administrative costs.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  In 1975 the system started a branch library in the Bond community, a predominantly black community on the city's Southside. Wakulla County left the library cooperative in 1975 to start its own library system and in 1978 the main library moved to a location in Tallahassee's Northwood Mall.  Jefferson County left the library cooperative in 1980 and the library reverted to the Leon County Public Library.  In 1989 \"ground breaking was held on March 4 for a new $8.5 million main library facility with 88,000 feet of space. The site was next door to the library's original home, The Columns, which had been moved in 1971 to 100 N. Duval.\"<ref name=\"cms.leoncountyfl.gov\"/>  The new library had its grand opening in 1991 and was renamed in 1993 in honor of former Governor LeRoy Collins.\n\n==Points of interest==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Alfred B.

{"title_page": "Economic history of Canada", "text_new": "{{Economy of Canada}}\n[[Canadian history|Canadian historians]] until the 1980s tended to focus on economic history, including labour history.  In part this is because Canada has had far fewer political  or military conflicts than other societies.  This was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominant.  Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as [[Harold Innis]], [[Donald Creighton]] and [[Arthur R. M. Lower]]. \nScholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States, but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada.  The heavily [[Marxism|Marxist]] influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  A focus on [[Social class|class]], [[urban area|urban]] areas, and [[industry]] fails to address Canada's rural and resource-based economy. Similarly, the [[monetarist]] school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border.\n\nThe study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on [[economic geography]], and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the [[staples thesis]].  This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of [[natural resource]]s.  This approach has since also become used outside of Canada, such as Australia and many developing nations.\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the [[First Nations]] of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network.  Furs, tools, decorative items, and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres, mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region.\n\nThe early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the [[staples thesis]] which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe. Studies show that Canada's economy is growing very well.\n\n==Atlantic fisheries==\n\nThe earliest European settlements in Canada were the [[fisheries]] of the East Coast, especially the [[Grand Banks]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].  Boats from France, Portugal, Spain, and Great Britain would traverse the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]], fish for a summer and then return laden with fish.  The trade was originally dominated by fishers from southern Europe.  In [[Catholic]] countries, demand for fish was much greater.  It was from the northern nations of Britain and France that the first settlers came, however.   Spain, Portugal and the south of France had abundant supplies of salt because in the warm climates it was a simple matter to evaporate [[seawater]]. They would thus bring barrels of salt with them to the fishing grounds, salt the fish aboard ship, and return to Europe never having touched land. In the colder and wetter climate of the British Isles and northern France, salt was in scarce supply.  To preserve the fish, they were dried by hanging them on large fish racks on the coast of Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]].  These drying stations were active for months of the year, and eventually permanent settlements grew up around them.  These small settlements totalled only a few thousand people, but they were many of the first European arrivals in North America<ref>Joseph Gough, ''Managing Canada's Fisheries: From Early Days to the Year 2000'' (2007)</ref>\n\n==Pacific fisheries==\n\nPrior to European contact, First Nations people on the Pacific Coast would frequently trade salmon with [[Plains Indians|First Nations people of the Canadian Prairies]].<ref>N.D. Jarvis, \"Curing and Canning of Fishery Products: A History,\" ''Marine Fisheries Review'' 50.4 (September 1998): 180-185.</ref> Shortly after European settlements had begun appearing in [[British Columbia]] in the mid 19th century, the first salmon canneries had begun appearing alongside them, the first being a salmon cannery in the [[Fraser River|Fraser river]] in 1867. The next forty years saw the salmon industry gradually become an increasingly lucrative trade in the pacific. Places such as the Fraser river and the [[Skeena River|Skeena river]] saw a sharp rise in immigration and the development of the fishing industry. With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] came an increased demand for fishing industries of British Columbia to help relieve the war effort.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943)</ref> The ten year average for total cases of canned salmon in British Columbia from 1910 to 1942 was 1.6 million, while the Second World War's average alone was more than 2 million, with a peak of 2.25 million in 1942.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943): 75.</ref>\n\n==Mercantilism and corporatism==\n{{main|Mercantilism}}\nCanada's economic development in colonial times was based on the economic policy of  [[mercantilism]]. This economic idea sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in [[New France]] through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] created in 1627, by the King of France, [[Louis XIII]] and the Communaut\u00e9 des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.\n\n==Staples thesis==\n{{main|Staples thesis}}\n[[Harold Innis]] (1894\u20131952), based in the history department at the University of Toronto, and [[William Archibald Mackintosh]] (1895\u20131970), based in the economics department at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] developed the [[Staples thesis]]. They argued that the Canadian Economy (beyond the level of subsistence farming) was primarily based on exports of a series of staples\u2014fish, fur, timber, wheat\u2014that shipped to Britain and the British Empire. Industrialization came much later. The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east\u2013west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple [[Commodity|commodities]]: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.  Innis, Influenced by the American historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] added a sociological dimension:  different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in [[Atlantic Canada]] was [[cod|cod fishing]]. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was [[wheat]]. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In [[Central Canada]], the main staple was fur, and the [[fur trade]] dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.<ref>Trevor J.

Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1020-e.html \"Staples Theory\"] in ''Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan'', from [[Library and Archives Canada]]</ref>  Historians continue to use elements of the Innis model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province's economic structure exemplifies the \"core-periphery\" structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.<ref>Thomas A.

In Europe, hats from [[beaver]] pelts had become especially fashionable and valuable, and the forests of North America were home to many of the creatures.\n\nThis trade closely involved the Native peoples who would hunt the beavers and other animals and then sell their pelts to Europeans in exchange for guns, [[textiles]], and luxury items like mirrors and [[bead]]s.  Those who traded with the Native were the ''[[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageur]]s'', woodsmen who travelled the length of North America to bring pelts to the ports of [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].<ref>Carolyn Podruchny, ''Making the Voyageur World: Travelers and Traders in the North American Fur Trade'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French dominated the trade through the [[New France]], the [[Ohio Valley]], and west into what would be [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]].  In an attempt to break the French monopoly the English began trading through [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] built an elaborate network of trading posts and forts.\n\nThere was fierce rivalry between the French and English and their respective Native allies.  Even when the two nations were at peace fierce fighting would occur in the interior.\n\nThe great disadvantage of the fur trade for the Canadas was that it did not encourage settlement.  The fur trade only needed a few highly skilled workers.  Also, the fur trade required more tonnage of goods to be shipped to North America than going the other way.  This meant that there was no excess space on the westward voyage and passage costs were high.  Unlike the United States where agriculture had become the primary industry, requiring a large labour force the population of what would be Canada remained very low.\n\nThis was a great benefit to the British in their struggles with the French.  Over the course of the eighteenth century, the French possessions were gradually seized by the British until, in 1759, all of [[New France]] was conquered.  The continued dependence on trade with Europe, also meant that the northern colonies were far more reluctant to join the [[American Revolution]], and Canada thus remained loyal to the British crown.{{Dubious|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Population history==\n{{main|Population of Canada by year}}\nThe population has grown steadily from a few thousand in the 1660s, to one million in the 1820s, 10 million in the 1920s, and 30 million in 2001.

Timber for the domestic market had long been a small industry in the colonies, but it was changes in Europe in the early nineteenth century that created a large export market.  Great Britain had exhausted its supplies of quality timber by the start of the eighteenth century.  The great [[oak]]s that had built the [[Royal Navy]] were all but gone.  The lack of very large trees that could supply great masts was especially problematic as they were a necessity for both its war and merchant shipping.   A thriving timber importing business had thus developed between Britain and the [[Baltic region]].  This trade was very unpopular for both economic and strategic reasons.<ref>Tim Ball, \"Timber!\", ''Beaver'', April 987, Vol. 67#2 pp 45\u201356</ref>\n\nFor much of the eighteenth century, Britain had encouraged the timber trade with the [[New England]] colonies. The American stands of timber were primarily located along the small, but easily navigable rivers of New York and [[Massachusetts]]. These were fairly quickly exhausted. Even without the American Revolution new sources would have been needed by the start of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Aboutement de bois equarri Quebec 1872.jpg|left|thumb|Butting square timber, Quebec City, QC, 1872.]]\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the Continental blockade cut off, or at least reduced the Baltic trade so the British looked northwards to the colonies that had remained loyal and were still available. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] system.  Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of [[New Brunswick]] were cut and transported to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand and the trade moved to the [[St. Lawrence River]] where logs were shipped to [[Quebec City]] before being sent on to Europe.  This area also proved insufficient and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the [[Ottawa River]] system, which, by 1845, provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business.  In one summer, 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone, and it became by far [[British North America]]'s most important commodity.  it was from the money made in timber that the [[Bank of Montreal]] was founded in 1817.<ref>Graeme Wynn, ''Timber Colony: A Historical Geography of Early Nineteenth Century New Brunswick'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe cutting of the timber was done by small groups of men in isolated camps.  For most of the nineteenth century, the most common product was square timber, which was a log that had been cut into a square block in the forest before being shipped.  The timber was transported from the hinterlands to the major markets by assembling it into a raft and floating it downstream.  Because of the narrower and more turbulent waters that one would encounter on the Ottawa River system, smaller rafts, known as \"cribs,\" were employed.  On the St. Lawrence, however, very large rafts, some up a third of a mile in length would be employed.   The most common type of tree harvested was [[Eastern white pine|white pine]], mostly because it floated well.  [[Oak]], which does not float, was in high demand but was much harder to transport and oak timbers needed to be carefully integrated into the raft if they were to be carried to market.\n\n[[File:Timber on the Ottawa River.jpg|right|thumb|Timber booms on the [[Ottawa River]], Canada, 1872.]]\n\nIn 1842, the British preferential tariffs were lifted; however, the transatlantic trade still remained a profitable one.  Demand in Britain remained high, especially for [[Railroad tie|railway ties]].  Improved ships and new technologies, especially the steam engine, allowed the trade to continue to prosper.  After the middle of the century the trade in timber began to decline, being replaced by trade in cut [[lumber]] and the [[pulp and paper]] industry.\n\nOne of the most important side effects of the timber trade was immigration to [[British North America]].  Timber is a very bulky and not a particularly valuable cargo.  For every ship full of British manufactured goods, dozens would be needed to carry the same value of timber.  There was no cargo coming from the British Isles to Canada that could take up as much room on the return voyage.  Exporting [[salt]] filled a few ships, and some vessels were even filled with [[brick]]s, but many timber ships made the westward voyage filled with ballast. The population of Canada was small and the lack of wealth in the area made it an unattractive market.\n\nThere was, however, one cargo that the ship-owners did not have to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely populated New World: people.  Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this unused capacity.  Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the preferential tariff in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap.  Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nIn later decades after the repeal of the tariff and the increase of competition, the quality and safety of the ships improved markedly. Since the travellers would bring along their own food and bedding the trade was an extremely easy one to operate. All that was required was a few advertisements, generally in Irish [[newspapers]], and the installation of bunks along the side of the hold. An average timber ship could thus carry about 200 passengers. Even with only a fraction of the hundreds of timber ships carrying passengers, this created an unprecedented influx of new inhabitants.  By comparison, it has been calculated that the trade between [[New France]] and Europe only included an average sixty-six immigrants per year over the lifetime of that colony.\n\nThe timber trade did not only bring immigrants to British North America, it also played a very important role in keeping them there as well.  While many of those disembarking from the timber ships would head south to the United States, many others would stay in British North America.  In large part, this was because of the employment that could be found in the timber trade.  At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the [[Gatineau]] region alone.  This when it had been only a few years before that the population of Montreal was only ten thousand. Similar situations could be found in the other centres of the timber trade.\n\n===Historiography===\nHistorian Robert Gillis, has emphasized the strong interest of lumber men in long-term conservation of the natural resources they were harvesting. However he points out that most historians present a much more negative interpretation:\n:The prevailing attitude in Canadian historiography towards the lumber man is a mixture of maudlin romanticism and harsh, vitriolic condemnation.  Along with most other businessmen the lumber operator is pictured as a crass, yet colourful, grasping individualist dedicated to the proposition of ''laissez faire''. This approach, which might be called the 'robber baron' interpretation of the forest industry, was first adopted by A.R.M. Lower in ''The North American Assault on the Canadian Forest'' (1938). Lower stresses the instability and transitory nature of lumbering, condemns its wastefulness, praises the early efforts at conservation and by calling the lumber men 'buccaneers.'<ref>Robert Peter Gillis, \"The Ottawa lumber barons and the conservation movement 1880\u20131914.\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 9#1 (1974): 14\u201330.</ref>\n\n==Upper Canada==\n\nThe timber industry also created large peripheral industries, the most important of these being agriculture. Unlike the fur trade, the timber trade saw large numbers of men in one location for a substantial period of time.  The lumber camps, and the lumber towns needed to be supplied with food and other provisions.  In the early years of the trade, much of the food, mostly barrels of pork, was shipped from the United States.  Mostly coming from around the Cleveland area, shipping costs were high, creating a market for locally produced goods.  As the loggers pushed ever westwards, farmers followed to take advantage of this [[captive market]]. Some of these farms failed after the loggers moved on, but many found new markets and became permanent settlements.  This process formed the basis of many communities in what is now Ontario.<ref>Douglas McCalla, ''Planting the Province: The Economic History of Upper Canada, 1784\u20131870'' (1993)</ref>\n\nTo encourage the settlement of the best land in the region, the government created the Canada Company.  It was given much of the land in Western Ontario and Southwestern Ontario and tasked with selling it off to immigrants.  It was successful in this, but it also became deeply unpopular for its monopolization of the land.  This was an important trigger of the 1837 rebellions.\n\n==Capitalism and finance==\n\n[[Capitalism]], which would become the dominant philosophy for Canadian economic development, evolved from the economic activity of the colonial business elite. One of the most important manifestations of this ideology was the creation of an indigenous financial system. One of Canada's first banks, the [[Canada Banking Company]] was founded in Montreal in 1792. This was followed by others including the [[Bank of Montreal]], in 1817, the [[Bank of New Brunswick]] in 1820 and the [[Bank of Upper Canada]] in 1821. By 1886, 38 banks had been chartered. The pace of this financial activity was marked by the newly formed Government of Canada with the passing of the Bank Act in 1871. Insurance companies, including, [[Sun Life]], 1865, Mutual Life, 1870, [[Confederation Life]], 1871 and London Life, 1874, were also founded during these years. Markets for the exchange of investments came to Canada as well, with the establishment of the [[Montreal Stock Exchange]] in 1832, the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] in 1861 and the [[Winnipeg Commodity Exchange]] in 1904. The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] by the Parliament of Britain in 1846, terminated colonial trading preferences and marked the symbolic end of mercantilism in Canada while ushering in the new era of capitalism.<ref>R. Thomas. Naylor, '' The History of Canadian Business: 1897\u20131914. Vol. 1, The Banks and Finance Capital'' (1975)</ref>\n\n==Canals==\n[[File:Engraving of Rideau Canal locks.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Rideau Canal]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with [[Parliament Hill]] and the old \"Union Station\" visible in the background.]]\nTo aid settlement and the timber trade, the nineteenth century saw a spree of [[canal]] building projects across the region.  Canals could not only bypass rapids and falls, but they could connect previously unlinked parts of the river system.  They also made transport of goods far easier and safer.  Canals were created for the timber trade, the transport of wheat, and also for military reasons.\n\nThe construction of the Rideau Canal was one of the first projects in Upper Canada to employ thousands of laborers. It was under the control of the  British military. The British officers and the contractors they hired both looked at the workers as  instruments of production required to facilitate the most economic completion of the project. Because of the shortage of jobs, labourers had little choice but to endure difficult and often dangerous working and living conditions. The response of workers to these harsh conditions was militant but sporadic. They tended to act against individual property owners and contractors in order to obtain the immediate necessities for survival. More concerted activity was discouraged in large part by the military which posted soldiers along the line of the canal to suppress dissent and ensure a cheap supply of labour.<ref>William N.T. Wylie, \"Poverty, Distress, and Disease: Labour and the Construction of the Rideau Canal, 1826\u201332,\" '' Labour/Le Travail,'' Spring19 83, Vol. 11, pp 7\u201329</ref>\n\nCanals such as the [[Rideau Canal]], the [[Welland Canal]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] were massive engineering projects, and huge expenditures.  The government of [[Upper Canada]] was bankrupted by these projects, and this was an important factor in the merging of [[Upper Canada]] with the still solvent [[Lower Canada]] into one colony in 1840.<ref>John N. Jackson, ''The Welland Canals and Their Communities: Engineering, Industrial, and Urban Transformation'' (1998)</ref>\n\n==Railways==\n[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] freight eastbound over the Stoney Creek Bridge, [[British Columbia]].]]\nSee [[Grand Trunk Railway of Canada]]\n\nThe national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together. Second, it wanted to maximize trade within Canada and minimize trade with the United States to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853. Lines to Portland in Maine (which was ice-free), Michigan and Chicago, were subsequently opened. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world.\n\nThe [[Intercolonial Railway]], finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario, tying them to the new Confederation.<ref>Jay Underwood, ''Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway'' (2005)</ref> Entrepreneurs in Montreal sought direct lines into the U.S. and shunned connections with the Maritimes, with a goal of competing with American railroad lines heading west to the Pacific. [[Joseph Howe]], [[Charles Tupper]], and other Nova Scotia leaders used the rhetoric of a \"civilizing mission\" centered on their British heritage, because Atlantic-centered railway projects promised to make Halifax the eastern terminus of an intercolonial railway system tied to London. [[Leonard Tilley]], New Brunswick's most ardent railway promoter, championed the cause of \"economic progress\", stressing that Atlantic Canadians needed to pursue the most cost-effective transportation connections possible if they wanted to expand their influence beyond local markets. Advocating an intercolonial connection to Canada, and a western extension into larger American markets in Maine and beyond, New Brunswick entrepreneurs promoted ties to the United States first, connections with Halifax second, and routes into central Canada last.  Thus metropolitan rivalries between Montreal, Halifax, and Saint John led Canada to build more railway lines per capita than any other industrializing nation, even though it lacked capital resources, and had too little freight and passenger traffic to allow the systems to turn a profit.<ref>A.A. den Otter, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (1997)</ref>\n\nSaint John was cut off by the Confederation promise of an Intercolonial Railway.  E B Chandler, of New Brunswick's north shore, saw to it that the rail line went from ice-bound Montreal along the St. Lawrence and down the North Shore of New Brunswick bringing New Brunswick no benefit except at Moncton. From there the distance to Halifax and Saint John were about equal. So even though Saint John was half as far from Montreal as Halifax, the new federal policy helped Halifax outpace Saint John as the winter port for Canada. When the St. Lawrence opened in the 1950s, yet another Federal government policy killed the port of Saint John. Eventually a rail line was built from Saint John through Maine USA to Montreal. However, Montreal businessmen preferred Portland USA even though the Saint John River Valley, with no rail line, was a shorter route from Quebec. So Canadian Prairie wheat was shipped four months of the year through the port of Portland, Maine, USA. Saint John has dwindled from being the fifth-largest city in Canada at Confederation to the fourth largest city in Atlantic Canada now and 32nd largest city in Canada.\n\nDen Otter (1997) challenges popular assumptions that Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans in the race for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west.  The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand Trunk's expansion into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce, and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century.<ref>Den Otten, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America''  (1997); Bill Waiser, ''Saskatchewan: A New History'' (2005) p. 63</ref> The [[Canadian Pacific]], paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada, and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with [[James J. Hill]]'s American railways, and opened even more connections to the south. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.\n\nTwo additional transcontinental lines were built to the west coast\u2014three in all\u2014but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive. One after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. In 1923 the government merged the Grand Trunk, [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], Canadian Northern and National Transcontinental lines into the new [[Canadian National Railways]] system. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the U.S., and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to domestic manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.<ref>M. L. Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada to the Year 1885\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 5 (1932), pp. 43\u201360; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136530 in JSTOR]; Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada Part II: From 1885 to 1931\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 7 (1934), pp. 61\u2013107; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136554 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Confederation==\n\nThe repeal of the British [[Corn Laws]] and of preferential treatment for the British colonies led many in British North America to realize that the motherland could no longer be counted on economically. In 1854, the Canadian colonies signed [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] with the United States to try to ensure access to the American market. This treaty was cancelled in 1866, however, leaving the colonies once again adrift.\n\nThe railways were also an important factor. The [[Province of Canada]] had again nearly bankrupted itself by promising unwise subsidies to railway companies. The Maritime colonies wanted a railroad, but as disunited as they were, building one would be all but impossible.\n\nBoth the Maritime colonies and the Province of Canada desired access to the large and unexploited western hinterland. They hoped that if these areas were developed they would become a market for their manufactured goods, and provide exports for the eastern ports.\n\nFor these reasons and others, the colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and the two Canadas agreed to merge into one [[Dominion]] in 1867. While in name it was a [[confederation]], the new constitution, the [[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]] outlined a strongly centralized federation. The federal government had control of most of the taxation power, and was responsible for the largest expenditures, railroads, canals and the military. The provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over what at the time seemed merely local or minor matters such as health care and education. The pledge to build the [[Intercolonial Railway of Canada]] linking the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario was finally realized in the 1870s.\n\nIn 1871, British Columbia, which was nearing bankruptcy due to railway construction agreed to join the union in exchange for a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railroad]]. [[Prince Edward Island]] joined in 1873 when the national government provided $800,000 for buying out the landlords who held large blocks of island land. All private holdings over 1,000 acres were sold to the province.<ref>Rusty Bittermann and Margaret McCallum, \"Upholding the Land Legislation of a 'Communistic and Socialist Assembly': The Benefits of Confederation for Prince Edward Island,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (March 2006) 87#1 pp 1\u201328</ref>\n\n{{See also|Canadian Confederation}}\n\n==The National Policy==\n{{Main|National Policy}}\nThe first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] of the new nation was [[John A. Macdonald]], and he outlined what would be Canada's economic program for decades.  This would be the [[National Policy]] a system of protective tariffs that would encourage the development of Canadian manufacturing.  This would be combined with great railway building projects such as the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to link the east with the west and the [[Intercolonial Railway]] to link central Canada with Atlantic Canada.<ref>Vernon C. Fowke,  \"National Policy and Western Development in North America\" ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 461\u2013479 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2114691 in JSTOR]</ref> Other plans for the National Policy were the promotion of Canadian Identity and the population of western Canada.\n\nCanada had traditionally been committed to free trade and had only had one experiment with a protective tariff with the [[Cayley-Galt Tariff]] of 1858. This policy has long been controversial as it is seen to have favoured [[Central Canada]] at the expense of the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian West|West]].\n\n==Post-Confederation slump==\n\nIn the years after Confederation, the once-buoyant BNA economy soured, an event some blamed on union or government railway policy, but was more likely caused by the [[Long Depression]] that was affecting the entire world.  Demand for Canadian resources slumped, and protectionist policies in the United States and Europe hurt Canada's trade.<ref>P. B.  Waite, ''Canada, 1874\u20131896'' (1971)</ref>\n\nThere was little immigration to Canada during this period.  Despite efforts to settle the west including the [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871, few immigrants were willing to settle on Canada's colder and drier prairies when open land was still plentiful in the United States.  In the thirty years after Confederation, Canada experienced a net out flow of migrants, as a large number of Canadians relocated to the United States.\n\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the economies of the Canadian Maritimes were the most industrialized, and prosperous in British North America.  The 1850s and 1860s were especially prosperous.  By the start of the twentieth century, however, they were far poorer than the rest of the country, and remain so to this day.  It has been said that the provinces never emerged from the post-Confederation slump.  See [[Maritimes#Economy|Economy of the Maritimes]] for a full discussion of this issue.\n\n==Boom years==\n[[Image:PostcardToCanadaForInvestmentInCanada1907.jpg|thumb|right|Investors from the United Kingdom and the United States helped fuel the country's economic growth (from a postcard sent in 1907).]]\nThe economy of the rest of the country improved dramatically after 1896, and from that year until 1914, Canada had the world's fastest-growing economy.<ref>R. C. Brown and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896\u20131921 A Nation Transformed'' (1974)</ref>  The west was settled, the population grew quickly, so that by 1900, Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] could predict that the twentieth century would be Canada's century as the nineteenth was the United States's.<ref>{{cite web|author=SMC-MCS, gazette@uottawa.ca |url=https://www.uottawa.ca/services/markcom/gazette/000602/000602-art04-e.shtml |title=A prediction that belonged to the 20th century |publisher=Uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>\nThe cause of this boom is debated.  Whether the settlement of the west was a cause or effect of the boom is one of the most important issues.  Globally the economy was improving with the end of the Long Depression.  The last semi-humid farmland in the United States was exhausted, leaving Canada with the best unexploited farm land in North America.  Technological changes from the steel plow to [[combine harvester]]s played an important role, but perhaps the most important development was the practice of [[dry farming]] that allowed farmers to profitably grow wheat on the semi-arid southern prairies.\n\nThe most noted expansion was in western Canada, but at the same time Central Canada was undergoing a period of significant [[industrialization]].\n\nWhile western and central Canada boomed during the pre-World War I years the economies of the three Maritime provinces grew far more slowly.  There is also much debate over the cause of this, but its consequence was a growing disaffection with Confederation in the east, manifested by the [[Maritime Rights]] movement.\n\n==Farming==\n\n===Ontario===\nIn Ontario farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896.  The major changes involved \"mechanization of technology and a shift toward output of high-grade consumer oriented products\", such as milk, eggs and vegetables for the fast-growing urban markets.<ref>D. A. Lawr, \"The Development of Ontario Farming, 1870\u20131914: Patterns of Growth and Change,\" ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1972, Vol. 64 Issue 3, pp 239\u2013251</ref> It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops. Introduced in the 1890s, acceptance was slow until 1943\u201352, when farmers in the southwestern counties expanded production.<ref>Ian A. McKay, \"A Note on Ontario Agriculture: The Development of Soybeans, 1893\u20131952,\" ''Ontario History,'' June 1983, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 175\u2013186</ref> Farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques.  Their demands led to farm magazine and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which morphed into the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] in Guelph in 1874.<ref>John Carter, \"The Education of the Ontario Farmer,\" ''Ontario History,'' May 2004, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp 62\u201384</ref>\n\n===Prairies===\n[[Image:Palliser's Triangle map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The Prairie provinces, highlighting Palliser's Triangle]]\nWheat was the golden crop that built the economy of the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and filled outbound trains headed for ports to carry the grain to Europe. The tall grain elevator alongside the railway tracks became a crucial element of the Prairie grain trade after 1890. It boosted \"King Wheat\" to regional dominance by integrating the region's economy with the rest of Canada. Used to efficiently load grain into railroad cars, grain elevators came to be clustered in \"lines\" and their ownership tended to concentrate in the hands of increasingly fewer companies, many controlled by Americans. The main commercial entities involved in the trade were the Canadian Pacific Railway and the powerful grain syndicates. Dramatic changes in the grain trade took place in the 1940s, notably the amalgamation of grain elevator companies.<ref>John Everitt, \"The Line Elevator in Alberta\". ''Alberta History'' [Canada] 1992 40(4): 16\u201322; 1993 41(1): 20\u201326.</ref>\n\nNorrie argues that the necessity of using dry farming techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year. Tenants often preferred the safety of sharecropping to the hazards (and higher returns) of cash rental, and showed an interest in [[crop insurance]]. Because farmers were averse to risk, grain production was less than it might have been.<ref>Kenneth Norrie, \"Dry Farming and the Economics of Risk Bearing: The Canadian Prairies, 1870\u20131930\", ''Agricultural History'', Winter 1977, Vol. 51 Issue 1, pp. 134\u2013148</ref>\n\nRecklessness, greed, and overoptimism played a part in the early-20th-century financial crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the [[Palliser Triangle]], a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments. British money managers were driven by a complex set of global economic forces including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created a false sense of security and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too much credit had been extended.<ref>John Feldberg, and Warren M. Elofson, \"Financing The Palliser Triangle, 1908\u20131913\". ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 1998 18(3): 257\u2013268. 0275\u20137664</ref>\n\n==The First World War and the Roaring Twenties==\n\nCanada played an extraordinarily large role in the [[World War I|First World War]] relative to the size of its population.  It sent over hundreds of thousands of troops, and was also the granary and arms producer for the allied side.  This led to a further boom on the prairies as wheat prices skyrocketed.  The rest of the country, even the Maritimes, benefited from an increase in manufacturing.<ref name=\"Robert Bothwell 1987\">Robert Bothwell,  Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada 1900\u20131945'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe immediate post-war years saw a short, but severe, recession as the economy readjusted to the end of wartime production.  By 1921, the Canadian economy was back on its feet and rapidly expanding.  In the 1920s, there was an unprecedented increase in the standard of living as items that had been luxury goods such as radios, automobiles, and electric  lights\u2014not to mention flush toilets\u2014became common place across the nation.  The boom lasted until 1929.\n\n==The Great Depression==\n{{Main|The Great Depression in Canada}}\n[[File:ReliefWorkHighway.jpg|right|thumb|Road construction at Kimberly-Wasa, British Columbia. The federal government established Relief Projects in 1933 during the height of the Great Depression for unemployed married men of British descent]]\nCanada was hard hit by the [[Great Depression]].  When the American economy began to collapse in the late 1920s the close economic links and the central banking system meant that the malaise quickly spread across the border.  The world demand fell for wheat, lumber and mining products; prices fell, profits plunged, and unemployment soared.\n\nIn May 1930, US raised the tariff with the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]]. Canada retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of U.S. exports to Canada.<ref>Richard N. Kottman,  \"Herbert Hoover and the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study\", ''Journal of American History'' (1975), 62#3 pp 609\u2013635, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>McDonald, Judith; O'Brien, Anthony Patrick; Callahan, Colleen \"Trade Wars: Canada's Reaction to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff\", ''Journal of Economic History'' (1997), 57#4 pp 802\u2013826,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951161 in JSTOR]</ref>  Following Britain's lead, Canada then forged closer economic links with the [[British Empire]] via the [[British Empire Economic Conference]] of 1932.\n\nBy 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance.  Wages fell as did prices; debts did not fall and they became more burdensome.  [[Gross National Expenditure]] had declined 42% from the 1929 levels.  In some areas, the decline was far worse.  In the rural areas of the prairies two thirds of the population were on relief.  Population growth contracted markedly as immigration slowed, and birth rates fell as people postponed marriage and family life until they were more secure.  Crime rates increased, and a new class of unemployed vagrants appeared.<ref>Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression: 1929\u20131939'' (1990) is a popular acoount</ref>\n\nLike the United States, Canada remained in depression far longer, not passing 1929 levels until 1939, with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].  There was no national recovery program similar to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].\n\n==The Second World War and the boom years==\n\nThe turn around brought about by the command economy imposed at the beginning of the Second World War was immense.  Unemployment virtually disappeared by 1940 as soldiers were recruited and factories turned to war production.  Canada was in the unusual situation of helping Britain financially, through a program similar to the American [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>C. P.  Stacey, ''Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada, 1939\u20131945'' (1970)</ref>\n\nIn the twenty-five years after the war, there was an immense expansion in the Canadian economy.  Unemployment remained low and the end of wartime production was quickly turned over to making consumer goods.  Canada, along with many other developed nations, firmly established itself as a [[welfare state]] with publicly funded [[health care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and other programs.<ref>Robert  Bothwell, Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada since 1945'' (2d. ed. 1989)</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the Canadian economy became much more closely integrated with the American one as tariff barriers fell and trade agreements like the [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]] and the \"Hyde Park Declaration\" were signed.\n\n==Recent years==\n\n===Recession===\nCanada experienced economic [[recession]] in the early 1980s and again in the [[Late 1980s recession|early 1990s]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |title=Ecolnomic Concepts: Recession |access-date=20 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325185942/http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |archive-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This led to massive government [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s, high unemployment, and general disaffection.  The poor economy helped lead to the overwhelming rejection of the\n[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]], and the fall of other governments such as [[Bob Rae]]'s [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].  The poor economy may have increased support for sovereignty in [[Quebec]], an option that was just barely rejected in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].\n\nA brief recovery in 1994 was followed by an economic slump in 1995\u20131996. Since that date, the Canadian economy has improved markedly, in step with the boom in the United States. In the mid-1990s, [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Johnson|title=Thinking Government: Public Sector Management in Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcL80sSautgC&pg=PA374|year=2006|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-779-9|page=374}}</ref> Once referred to as a fiscal basket-case {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, Canada has become a model of fiscal stability as the government has posted surpluses every fiscal year from 1996 to the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 recession]].\n\nThe [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] brought on in the United States by the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] beginning in 2000, hurt the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] but has affected Canada only mildly.

Medicare is also a relevant factor in the decisions of employers to locate businesses in Canada (where government pays most of employees' healthcare costs) as opposed to the United States (where employers more directly pay many healthcare costs).\n\n===Poverty===\n[[Poverty in Canada]] remains a prevalent issue within some segments of society.

In part this is because Canada has had far fewer political  or military conflicts than other societies.  This was especially true in the first half of the twentieth century when economic history was overwhelmingly dominant.  Many of the most prominent English Canadian historians from this period were economic historians, such as [[Harold Innis]], [[Donald Creighton]] and [[Arthur R. M. Lower]]. \nScholars of Canadian history were heirs to the traditions that developed in Europe and the United States, but frameworks that worked well elsewhere often failed in Canada.  The heavily [[Marxism|Marxist]] influenced economic history that dominates Europe has little relevance to most of Canadian history.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  A focus on [[Social class|class]], [[urban area|urban]] areas, and [[industry]] fails to address Canada's rural and resource-based economy. Similarly, the [[monetarist]] school that is dominant in the United States also has been difficult to transfer north of the border.\n\nThe study of economic history in Canada became highly focused on [[economic geography]], and for many years the dominant school of thought has been the [[staples thesis]].  This school of thought bases the study of the Canadian economy on the study of [[natural resource]]s.  This approach has since also become used outside of Canada, such as Australia and many developing nations.\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the [[First Nations]] of what would become Canada had a large and vibrant trade network.  Furs, tools, decorative items, and other goods were often transported thousands of kilometres, mostly by canoe throughout the many rivers and lakes of the region.\n\nThe early European history of the Canadian economy is usually studied through the [[staples thesis]] which argues the Canadian economy developed through the exploitation of a series of staples that would be exported to Europe. Studies show that Canada's economy is growing very well.\n\n==Atlantic fisheries==\n\nThe earliest European settlements in Canada were the [[fisheries]] of the East Coast, especially the [[Grand Banks]] off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].  Boats from France, Portugal, Spain, and Great Britain would traverse the [[Atlantic (ocean)|Atlantic]], fish for a summer and then return laden with fish.  The trade was originally dominated by fishers from southern Europe.  In [[Catholic]] countries, demand for fish was much greater.  It was from the northern nations of Britain and France that the first settlers came, however.   Spain, Portugal and the south of France had abundant supplies of salt because in the warm climates it was a simple matter to evaporate [[seawater]]. They would thus bring barrels of salt with them to the fishing grounds, salt the fish aboard ship, and return to Europe never having touched land. In the colder and wetter climate of the British Isles and northern France, salt was in scarce supply.  To preserve the fish, they were dried by hanging them on large fish racks on the coast of Newfoundland and [[Nova Scotia]].  These drying stations were active for months of the year, and eventually permanent settlements grew up around them.  These small settlements totalled only a few thousand people, but they were many of the first European arrivals in North America<ref>Joseph Gough, ''Managing Canada's Fisheries: From Early Days to the Year 2000'' (2007)</ref>\n\n==Pacific fisheries==\n\nPrior to European contact, First Nations people on the Pacific Coast would frequently trade salmon with [[Plains Indians|First Nations people of the Canadian Prairies]].<ref>N.D. Jarvis, \"Curing and Canning of Fishery Products: A History,\" ''Marine Fisheries Review'' 50.4 (September 1998): 180-185.</ref> Shortly after European settlements had begun appearing in [[British Columbia]] in the mid 19th century, the first salmon canneries had begun appearing alongside them, the first being a salmon cannery in the [[Fraser River|Fraser river]] in 1867. The next forty years saw the salmon industry gradually become an increasingly lucrative trade in the pacific. Places such as the Fraser river and the [[Skeena River|Skeena river]] saw a sharp rise in immigration and the development of the fishing industry. With the outbreak of the [[World War II|Second World War]] came an increased demand for fishing industries of British Columbia to help relieve the war effort.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943)</ref> The ten year average for total cases of canned salmon in British Columbia from 1910 to 1942 was 1.6 million, while the Second World War's average alone was more than 2 million, with a peak of 2.25 million in 1942.<ref>Pacific Fisherman 1943 Yearbook (Seattle: Consolidated Pub. Co., 1943): 75.</ref>\n\n==Mercantilism and corporatism==\n{{main|Mercantilism}}\nCanada's economic development in colonial times was based on the economic policy of  [[mercantilism]]. This economic idea sought to derive the maximum material benefit from the colony, for the homeland, with a minimum of imperial investment in the colony itself. The ideology was embodied in [[New France]] through the establishment under Royal Charter of a number of corporate trading monopolies including La Compagnie des Marchands, which operated from 1613 to 1621 and the Compagnie de Montmorency, from that date until 1627. It was in turn replaced by La [[Compagnie des Cent-Associ\u00e9s]] created in 1627, by the King of France, [[Louis XIII]] and the Communaut\u00e9 des habitants in 1643. These were the first corporations to operate in what is now Canada.\n\n==Staples thesis==\n{{main|Staples thesis}}\n[[Harold Innis]] (1894\u20131952), based in the history department at the University of Toronto, and [[William Archibald Mackintosh]] (1895\u20131970), based in the economics department at [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] developed the [[Staples thesis]]. They argued that the Canadian Economy (beyond the level of subsistence farming) was primarily based on exports of a series of staples\u2014fish, fur, timber, wheat\u2014that shipped to Britain and the British Empire. Industrialization came much later. The thesis explains Canadian economic development as a lateral, east\u2013west conception of trade. Innis argued that Canada developed as it did because of the nature of its staple [[Commodity|commodities]]: raw materials, such as fish, fur, lumber, agricultural products and minerals. This trading link cemented Canada's cultural links to Britain. The search for and exploitation of these staples led to the creation of institutions that defined the political culture of the nation and its regions.  Innis, Influenced by the American historian [[Frederick Jackson Turner]] added a sociological dimension:  different staples led to the emergence of regional economies (and societies) within Canada. For instance, the staple commodity in [[Atlantic Canada]] was [[cod|cod fishing]]. This industry was very decentralized, but also very co-operative. In western Canada the central staple was [[wheat]]. Wheat farming was a very independent venture, which led to a history of distrust of government and corporations in that part of the country. (Also important, however, were the shocks caused by volatility in the market for wheat and by the weather itself on the growing season.) In [[Central Canada]], the main staple was fur, and the [[fur trade]] dominated the economy for many years. This fur trade was controlled by large firms, such as the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and thus produced the much more centralized, business-oriented society that today characterizes Montreal and Toronto.<ref>Trevor J. Barnes, \"Industrial geography, institutional economics and Innis.\" in Trevor Barnes, Meric S Gertler  eds., ''The new industrial geography: Regions, regulation and institutions'' (1999): 1\u201322.</ref>\n\n===Core-periphery model===\n\nInnis depicted the relationship between regions of Canada as one of \"heartland\" to \"hinterland\": [[Core-periphery|The periphery]], or hinterland, is dominated by the core, or heartland. Because the heartland was dependent upon the search for and accumulation of staples (which were located in the hinterland) to perpetuate the economy, it sought to gain economic and political power by exploiting the hinterland.<ref>[http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1020-e.html \"Staples Theory\"] in ''Old Messengers, New Media: The Legacy of Innis and McLuhan'', from [[Library and Archives Canada]]</ref>  Historians continue to use elements of the Innis model, applying it for example to British Columbia. That province's economic structure exemplifies the \"core-periphery\" structure of intra-regional relationships. The core is metropolitan Vancouver, with its concentration of corporate management and transportation functions and manufacturing growth. It dominates an underdeveloped periphery that depends on production and export of staple commodities.<ref>Thomas A. Hutton, \"The Innisian core-periphery revisited: Vancouver's changing relationships with British Columbia's staple economy.\" ''BC Studies: The British Columbian Quarterly'' 113 (1997): 69\u2013100.

In Europe, hats from [[beaver]] pelts had become especially fashionable and valuable, and the forests of North America were home to many of the creatures.\n\nThis trade closely involved the Native peoples who would hunt the beavers and other animals and then sell their pelts to Europeans in exchange for guns, [[textiles]], and luxury items like mirrors and [[bead]]s.  Those who traded with the Native were the ''[[Coureur des bois#Voyageurs|voyageur]]s'', woodsmen who travelled the length of North America to bring pelts to the ports of [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]].<ref>Carolyn Podruchny, ''Making the Voyageur World: Travelers and Traders in the North American Fur Trade'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe French dominated the trade through the [[New France]], the [[Ohio Valley]], and west into what would be [[Manitoba]] and [[Saskatchewan]].  In an attempt to break the French monopoly the English began trading through [[Hudson Bay]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] built an elaborate network of trading posts and forts.\n\nThere was fierce rivalry between the French and English and their respective Native allies.  Even when the two nations were at peace fierce fighting would occur in the interior.\n\nThe great disadvantage of the fur trade for the Canadas was that it did not encourage settlement.  The fur trade only needed a few highly skilled workers.  Also, the fur trade required more tonnage of goods to be shipped to North America than going the other way.  This meant that there was no excess space on the westward voyage and passage costs were high.  Unlike the United States where agriculture had become the primary industry, requiring a large labour force the population of what would be Canada remained very low.\n\nThis was a great benefit to the British in their struggles with the French.  Over the course of the eighteenth century, the French possessions were gradually seized by the British until, in 1759, all of [[New France]] was conquered.  The continued dependence on trade with Europe, also meant that the northern colonies were far more reluctant to join the [[American Revolution]], and Canada thus remained loyal to the British crown.{{Dubious|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Population history==\n{{main|Population of Canada by year}}\nThe population has grown steadily from a few thousand in the 1660s, to one million in the 1820s, 10 million in the 1920s, and 30 million in 2001.

Timber for the domestic market had long been a small industry in the colonies, but it was changes in Europe in the early nineteenth century that created a large export market.  Great Britain had exhausted its supplies of quality timber by the start of the eighteenth century.  The great [[oak]]s that had built the [[Royal Navy]] were all but gone.  The lack of very large trees that could supply great masts was especially problematic as they were a necessity for both its war and merchant shipping.   A thriving timber importing business had thus developed between Britain and the [[Baltic region]].  This trade was very unpopular for both economic and strategic reasons.<ref>Tim Ball, \"Timber!\", ''Beaver'', April 987, Vol. 67#2 pp 45\u201356</ref>\n\nFor much of the eighteenth century, Britain had encouraged the timber trade with the [[New England]] colonies. The American stands of timber were primarily located along the small, but easily navigable rivers of New York and [[Massachusetts]]. These were fairly quickly exhausted. Even without the American Revolution new sources would have been needed by the start of the nineteenth century.\n\n[[File:Aboutement de bois equarri Quebec 1872.jpg|left|thumb|Butting square timber, Quebec City, QC, 1872.]]\n\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the Continental blockade cut off, or at least reduced the Baltic trade so the British looked northwards to the colonies that had remained loyal and were still available. The industry became concentrated in three main regions. The first to be exploited was the [[Saint John River (New Brunswick)|Saint John River]] system.  Trees in the still almost deserted hinterland of [[New Brunswick]] were cut and transported to [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] where they were shipped to England. This area soon could not keep up with demand and the trade moved to the [[St. Lawrence River]] where logs were shipped to [[Quebec City]] before being sent on to Europe.  This area also proved insufficient and the trade expanded westward, most notably to the [[Ottawa River]] system, which, by 1845, provided three quarters of the timber shipped from Quebec City. The timber trade became a massive business.  In one summer, 1200 ships were loaded with timber at Quebec City alone, and it became by far [[British North America]]'s most important commodity.  it was from the money made in timber that the [[Bank of Montreal]] was founded in 1817.<ref>Graeme Wynn, ''Timber Colony: A Historical Geography of Early Nineteenth Century New Brunswick'' (2002)</ref>\n\nThe cutting of the timber was done by small groups of men in isolated camps.  For most of the nineteenth century, the most common product was square timber, which was a log that had been cut into a square block in the forest before being shipped.  The timber was transported from the hinterlands to the major markets by assembling it into a raft and floating it downstream.  Because of the narrower and more turbulent waters that one would encounter on the Ottawa River system, smaller rafts, known as \"cribs,\" were employed.  On the St. Lawrence, however, very large rafts, some up a third of a mile in length would be employed.   The most common type of tree harvested was [[Eastern white pine|white pine]], mostly because it floated well.  [[Oak]], which does not float, was in high demand but was much harder to transport and oak timbers needed to be carefully integrated into the raft if they were to be carried to market.\n\n[[File:Timber on the Ottawa River.jpg|right|thumb|Timber booms on the [[Ottawa River]], Canada, 1872.]]\n\nIn 1842, the British preferential tariffs were lifted; however, the transatlantic trade still remained a profitable one.  Demand in Britain remained high, especially for [[Railroad tie|railway ties]].  Improved ships and new technologies, especially the steam engine, allowed the trade to continue to prosper.  After the middle of the century the trade in timber began to decline, being replaced by trade in cut [[lumber]] and the [[pulp and paper]] industry.\n\nOne of the most important side effects of the timber trade was immigration to [[British North America]].  Timber is a very bulky and not a particularly valuable cargo.  For every ship full of British manufactured goods, dozens would be needed to carry the same value of timber.  There was no cargo coming from the British Isles to Canada that could take up as much room on the return voyage.  Exporting [[salt]] filled a few ships, and some vessels were even filled with [[brick]]s, but many timber ships made the westward voyage filled with ballast. The population of Canada was small and the lack of wealth in the area made it an unattractive market.\n\nThere was, however, one cargo that the ship-owners did not have to worry about finding a market for in the sparsely populated New World: people.  Many of the timber ships turned to carrying immigrants for the return voyage from the British Isles to fill this unused capacity.  Timber ships would unload their cargo and sell passage to those desiring to emigrate. During the early nineteenth century, with the preferential tariff in full effect, the timber ships were among the oldest and most dilapidated in the British merchant fleet, and travelling as a passenger upon them was extremely unpleasant and dangerous. It was, however, very cheap.  Since timber exports would peak at the same time as conflicts in Europe, such as the [[Napoleonic Wars]], a great mass of refugees sought this cheap passage across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]].\n\nIn later decades after the repeal of the tariff and the increase of competition, the quality and safety of the ships improved markedly. Since the travellers would bring along their own food and bedding the trade was an extremely easy one to operate. All that was required was a few advertisements, generally in Irish [[newspapers]], and the installation of bunks along the side of the hold. An average timber ship could thus carry about 200 passengers. Even with only a fraction of the hundreds of timber ships carrying passengers, this created an unprecedented influx of new inhabitants.  By comparison, it has been calculated that the trade between [[New France]] and Europe only included an average sixty-six immigrants per year over the lifetime of that colony.\n\nThe timber trade did not only bring immigrants to British North America, it also played a very important role in keeping them there as well.  While many of those disembarking from the timber ships would head south to the United States, many others would stay in British North America.  In large part, this was because of the employment that could be found in the timber trade.  At the peak of the trade in the 1840s, 15,000 Irish loggers were employed in the [[Gatineau]] region alone.  This when it had been only a few years before that the population of Montreal was only ten thousand. Similar situations could be found in the other centres of the timber trade.\n\n===Historiography===\nHistorian Robert Gillis, has emphasized the strong interest of lumber men in long-term conservation of the natural resources they were harvesting. However he points out that most historians present a much more negative interpretation:\n:The prevailing attitude in Canadian historiography towards the lumber man is a mixture of maudlin romanticism and harsh, vitriolic condemnation.  Along with most other businessmen the lumber operator is pictured as a crass, yet colourful, grasping individualist dedicated to the proposition of ''laissez faire''. This approach, which might be called the 'robber baron' interpretation of the forest industry, was first adopted by A.R.M. Lower in ''The North American Assault on the Canadian Forest'' (1938). Lower stresses the instability and transitory nature of lumbering, condemns its wastefulness, praises the early efforts at conservation and by calling the lumber men 'buccaneers.'<ref>Robert Peter Gillis, \"The Ottawa lumber barons and the conservation movement 1880\u20131914.\" ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 9#1 (1974): 14\u201330.</ref>\n\n==Upper Canada==\n\nThe timber industry also created large peripheral industries, the most important of these being agriculture. Unlike the fur trade, the timber trade saw large numbers of men in one location for a substantial period of time.  The lumber camps, and the lumber towns needed to be supplied with food and other provisions.  In the early years of the trade, much of the food, mostly barrels of pork, was shipped from the United States.  Mostly coming from around the Cleveland area, shipping costs were high, creating a market for locally produced goods.  As the loggers pushed ever westwards, farmers followed to take advantage of this [[captive market]]. Some of these farms failed after the loggers moved on, but many found new markets and became permanent settlements.  This process formed the basis of many communities in what is now Ontario.<ref>Douglas McCalla, ''Planting the Province: The Economic History of Upper Canada, 1784\u20131870'' (1993)</ref>\n\nTo encourage the settlement of the best land in the region, the government created the Canada Company.  It was given much of the land in Western Ontario and Southwestern Ontario and tasked with selling it off to immigrants.  It was successful in this, but it also became deeply unpopular for its monopolization of the land.  This was an important trigger of the 1837 rebellions.\n\n==Capitalism and finance==\n\n[[Capitalism]], which would become the dominant philosophy for Canadian economic development, evolved from the economic activity of the colonial business elite. One of the most important manifestations of this ideology was the creation of an indigenous financial system. One of Canada's first banks, the [[Canada Banking Company]] was founded in Montreal in 1792. This was followed by others including the [[Bank of Montreal]], in 1817, the [[Bank of New Brunswick]] in 1820 and the [[Bank of Upper Canada]] in 1821. By 1886, 38 banks had been chartered. The pace of this financial activity was marked by the newly formed Government of Canada with the passing of the Bank Act in 1871. Insurance companies, including, [[Sun Life]], 1865, Mutual Life, 1870, [[Confederation Life]], 1871 and London Life, 1874, were also founded during these years. Markets for the exchange of investments came to Canada as well, with the establishment of the [[Montreal Stock Exchange]] in 1832, the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] in 1861 and the [[Winnipeg Commodity Exchange]] in 1904. The repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] by the Parliament of Britain in 1846, terminated colonial trading preferences and marked the symbolic end of mercantilism in Canada while ushering in the new era of capitalism.<ref>R. Thomas. Naylor, '' The History of Canadian Business: 1897\u20131914. Vol. 1, The Banks and Finance Capital'' (1975)</ref>\n\n==Canals==\n[[File:Engraving of Rideau Canal locks.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Rideau Canal]] in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, with [[Parliament Hill]] and the old \"Union Station\" visible in the background.]]\nTo aid settlement and the timber trade, the nineteenth century saw a spree of [[canal]] building projects across the region.  Canals could not only bypass rapids and falls, but they could connect previously unlinked parts of the river system.  They also made transport of goods far easier and safer.  Canals were created for the timber trade, the transport of wheat, and also for military reasons.\n\nThe construction of the Rideau Canal was one of the first projects in Upper Canada to employ thousands of laborers. It was under the control of the  British military. The British officers and the contractors they hired both looked at the workers as  instruments of production required to facilitate the most economic completion of the project. Because of the shortage of jobs, labourers had little choice but to endure difficult and often dangerous working and living conditions. The response of workers to these harsh conditions was militant but sporadic. They tended to act against individual property owners and contractors in order to obtain the immediate necessities for survival. More concerted activity was discouraged in large part by the military which posted soldiers along the line of the canal to suppress dissent and ensure a cheap supply of labour.<ref>William N.T. Wylie, \"Poverty, Distress, and Disease: Labour and the Construction of the Rideau Canal, 1826\u201332,\" '' Labour/Le Travail,'' Spring19 83, Vol. 11, pp 7\u201329</ref>\n\nCanals such as the [[Rideau Canal]], the [[Welland Canal]], the [[Trent\u2013Severn Waterway]] were massive engineering projects, and huge expenditures.  The government of [[Upper Canada]] was bankrupted by these projects, and this was an important factor in the merging of [[Upper Canada]] with the still solvent [[Lower Canada]] into one colony in 1840.<ref>John N. Jackson, ''The Welland Canals and Their Communities: Engineering, Industrial, and Urban Transformation'' (1998)</ref>\n\n==Railways==\n[[File:Eastbound over SCB.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] freight eastbound over the Stoney Creek Bridge, [[British Columbia]].]]\nSee [[Grand Trunk Railway of Canada]]\n\nThe national government strongly supported railway construction for political goals. First, it wanted to knit the far-flung provinces together. Second, it wanted to maximize trade within Canada and minimize trade with the United States to avoid becoming an economic satellite. The Grand Trunk Railway of Canada linked Toronto and Montreal in 1853. Lines to Portland in Maine (which was ice-free), Michigan and Chicago, were subsequently opened. By 1870 it was the longest railway in the world.\n\nThe [[Intercolonial Railway]], finished in 1876, linked the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario, tying them to the new Confederation.<ref>Jay Underwood, ''Built for War: Canada's Intercolonial Railway'' (2005)</ref> Entrepreneurs in Montreal sought direct lines into the U.S. and shunned connections with the Maritimes, with a goal of competing with American railroad lines heading west to the Pacific. [[Joseph Howe]], [[Charles Tupper]], and other Nova Scotia leaders used the rhetoric of a \"civilizing mission\" centered on their British heritage, because Atlantic-centered railway projects promised to make Halifax the eastern terminus of an intercolonial railway system tied to London. [[Leonard Tilley]], New Brunswick's most ardent railway promoter, championed the cause of \"economic progress\", stressing that Atlantic Canadians needed to pursue the most cost-effective transportation connections possible if they wanted to expand their influence beyond local markets. Advocating an intercolonial connection to Canada, and a western extension into larger American markets in Maine and beyond, New Brunswick entrepreneurs promoted ties to the United States first, connections with Halifax second, and routes into central Canada last.  Thus metropolitan rivalries between Montreal, Halifax, and Saint John led Canada to build more railway lines per capita than any other industrializing nation, even though it lacked capital resources, and had too little freight and passenger traffic to allow the systems to turn a profit.<ref>A.A. den Otter, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America'' (1997)</ref>\n\nSaint John was cut off by the Confederation promise of an Intercolonial Railway.  E B Chandler, of New Brunswick's north shore, saw to it that the rail line went from ice-bound Montreal along the St. Lawrence and down the North Shore of New Brunswick bringing New Brunswick no benefit except at Moncton. From there the distance to Halifax and Saint John were about equal. So even though Saint John was half as far from Montreal as Halifax, the new federal policy helped Halifax outpace Saint John as the winter port for Canada. When the St. Lawrence opened in the 1950s, yet another Federal government policy killed the port of Saint John. Eventually a rail line was built from Saint John through Maine USA to Montreal. However, Montreal businessmen preferred Portland USA even though the Saint John River Valley, with no rail line, was a shorter route from Quebec. So Canadian Prairie wheat was shipped four months of the year through the port of Portland, Maine, USA. Saint John has dwindled from being the fifth-largest city in Canada at Confederation to the fourth largest city in Atlantic Canada now and 32nd largest city in Canada.\n\nDen Otter (1997) challenges popular assumptions that Canada built transcontinental railways because it feared the annexationist schemes of aggressive Americans. Instead Canada overbuilt railroads because it hoped to compete with, even overtake Americans in the race for continental riches. It downplayed the more realistic Maritimes-based London-oriented connections and turned to utopian prospects for the farmlands and minerals of the west.  The result was closer ties between north and south, symbolized by the Grand Trunk's expansion into the American Midwest. These economic links promoted trade, commerce, and the flow of ideas between the two countries, integrating Canada into a North American economy and culture by 1880. About 700,000 Canadians migrated to the U.S. in the late 19th century.<ref>Den Otten, ''The Philosophy of Railways: The Transcontinental Railway Idea in British North America''  (1997); Bill Waiser, ''Saskatchewan: A New History'' (2005) p. 63</ref> The [[Canadian Pacific]], paralleling the American border, opened a vital link to British Canada, and stimulated settlement of the Prairies. The CP was affiliated with [[James J. Hill]]'s American railways, and opened even more connections to the south. The connections were two-way, as thousands of American moved to the Prairies after their own frontier had closed.\n\nTwo additional transcontinental lines were built to the west coast\u2014three in all\u2014but that was far more than the traffic would bear, making the system simply too expensive. One after another, the federal government was forced to take over the lines and cover their deficits. In 1923 the government merged the Grand Trunk, [[Grand Trunk Pacific]], Canadian Northern and National Transcontinental lines into the new [[Canadian National Railways]] system. Since most of the equipment was imported from Britain or the U.S., and most of the products carried were from farms, mines or forests, there was little stimulation to domestic manufacturing. On the other hand, the railways were essential to the growth of the wheat regions in the Prairies, and to the expansion of coal mining, lumbering, and paper making. Improvements to the St. Lawrence waterway system continued apace, and many short lines were built to river ports.<ref>M. L. Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada to the Year 1885\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 5 (1932), pp. 43\u201360; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136530 in JSTOR]; Bladen, \"Construction of Railways in Canada Part II: From 1885 to 1931\", ''Contributions to Canadian Economics'' Vol. 7 (1934), pp. 61\u2013107; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/136554 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Confederation==\n\nThe repeal of the British [[Corn Laws]] and of preferential treatment for the British colonies led many in British North America to realize that the motherland could no longer be counted on economically. In 1854, the Canadian colonies signed [[Canadian\u2013American Reciprocity Treaty]] with the United States to try to ensure access to the American market. This treaty was cancelled in 1866, however, leaving the colonies once again adrift.\n\nThe railways were also an important factor. The [[Province of Canada]] had again nearly bankrupted itself by promising unwise subsidies to railway companies. The Maritime colonies wanted a railroad, but as disunited as they were, building one would be all but impossible.\n\nBoth the Maritime colonies and the Province of Canada desired access to the large and unexploited western hinterland. They hoped that if these areas were developed they would become a market for their manufactured goods, and provide exports for the eastern ports.\n\nFor these reasons and others, the colonies of [[Nova Scotia]], [[New Brunswick]] and the two Canadas agreed to merge into one [[Dominion]] in 1867. While in name it was a [[confederation]], the new constitution, the [[British North America Act, 1867|British North America Act]] outlined a strongly centralized federation. The federal government had control of most of the taxation power, and was responsible for the largest expenditures, railroads, canals and the military. The provinces were given exclusive jurisdiction over what at the time seemed merely local or minor matters such as health care and education. The pledge to build the [[Intercolonial Railway of Canada]] linking the Maritimes to Quebec and Ontario was finally realized in the 1870s.\n\nIn 1871, British Columbia, which was nearing bankruptcy due to railway construction agreed to join the union in exchange for a [[Canadian Pacific Railway|transcontinental railroad]]. [[Prince Edward Island]] joined in 1873 when the national government provided $800,000 for buying out the landlords who held large blocks of island land. All private holdings over 1,000 acres were sold to the province.<ref>Rusty Bittermann and Margaret McCallum, \"Upholding the Land Legislation of a 'Communistic and Socialist Assembly': The Benefits of Confederation for Prince Edward Island,\" ''Canadian Historical Review,'' (March 2006) 87#1 pp 1\u201328</ref>\n\n{{See also|Canadian Confederation}}\n\n==The National Policy==\n{{Main|National Policy}}\nThe first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] of the new nation was [[John A. Macdonald]], and he outlined what would be Canada's economic program for decades.  This would be the [[National Policy]] a system of protective tariffs that would encourage the development of Canadian manufacturing.  This would be combined with great railway building projects such as the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] to link the east with the west and the [[Intercolonial Railway]] to link central Canada with Atlantic Canada.<ref>Vernon C. Fowke,  \"National Policy and Western Development in North America\" ''Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 16, No. 4 (Dec., 1956), pp. 461\u2013479 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2114691 in JSTOR]</ref> Other plans for the National Policy were the promotion of Canadian Identity and the population of western Canada.\n\nCanada had traditionally been committed to free trade and had only had one experiment with a protective tariff with the [[Cayley-Galt Tariff]] of 1858. This policy has long been controversial as it is seen to have favoured [[Central Canada]] at the expense of the [[Canadian Maritimes|Maritimes]] and the [[Canadian West|West]].\n\n==Post-Confederation slump==\n\nIn the years after Confederation, the once-buoyant BNA economy soured, an event some blamed on union or government railway policy, but was more likely caused by the [[Long Depression]] that was affecting the entire world.  Demand for Canadian resources slumped, and protectionist policies in the United States and Europe hurt Canada's trade.<ref>P. B.  Waite, ''Canada, 1874\u20131896'' (1971)</ref>\n\nThere was little immigration to Canada during this period.  Despite efforts to settle the west including the [[Dominion Lands Act]] of 1871, few immigrants were willing to settle on Canada's colder and drier prairies when open land was still plentiful in the United States.  In the thirty years after Confederation, Canada experienced a net out flow of migrants, as a large number of Canadians relocated to the United States.\n\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century, the economies of the Canadian Maritimes were the most industrialized, and prosperous in British North America.  The 1850s and 1860s were especially prosperous.  By the start of the twentieth century, however, they were far poorer than the rest of the country, and remain so to this day.  It has been said that the provinces never emerged from the post-Confederation slump.  See [[Maritimes#Economy|Economy of the Maritimes]] for a full discussion of this issue.\n\n==Boom years==\n[[Image:PostcardToCanadaForInvestmentInCanada1907.jpg|thumb|right|Investors from the United Kingdom and the United States helped fuel the country's economic growth (from a postcard sent in 1907).]]\nThe economy of the rest of the country improved dramatically after 1896, and from that year until 1914, Canada had the world's fastest-growing economy.<ref>R. C. Brown and Ramsay Cook, ''Canada, 1896\u20131921 A Nation Transformed'' (1974)</ref>  The west was settled, the population grew quickly, so that by 1900, Prime Minister [[Wilfrid Laurier]] could predict that the twentieth century would be Canada's century as the nineteenth was the United States's.<ref>{{cite web|author=SMC-MCS, gazette@uottawa.ca |url=https://www.uottawa.ca/services/markcom/gazette/000602/000602-art04-e.shtml |title=A prediction that belonged to the 20th century |publisher=Uottawa.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-04-14}}</ref>\nThe cause of this boom is debated.  Whether the settlement of the west was a cause or effect of the boom is one of the most important issues.  Globally the economy was improving with the end of the Long Depression.  The last semi-humid farmland in the United States was exhausted, leaving Canada with the best unexploited farm land in North America.  Technological changes from the steel plow to [[combine harvester]]s played an important role, but perhaps the most important development was the practice of [[dry farming]] that allowed farmers to profitably grow wheat on the semi-arid southern prairies.\n\nThe most noted expansion was in western Canada, but at the same time Central Canada was undergoing a period of significant [[industrialization]].\n\nWhile western and central Canada boomed during the pre-World War I years the economies of the three Maritime provinces grew far more slowly.  There is also much debate over the cause of this, but its consequence was a growing disaffection with Confederation in the east, manifested by the [[Maritime Rights]] movement.\n\n==Farming==\n\n===Ontario===\nIn Ontario farming was generally quite profitable, especially after 1896.  The major changes involved \"mechanization of technology and a shift toward output of high-grade consumer oriented products\", such as milk, eggs and vegetables for the fast-growing urban markets.<ref>D. A. Lawr, \"The Development of Ontario Farming, 1870\u20131914: Patterns of Growth and Change,\" ''Ontario History,'' Sept 1972, Vol. 64 Issue 3, pp 239\u2013251</ref> It took farmers a half century to appreciate the value of high-protein soybean crops. Introduced in the 1890s, acceptance was slow until 1943\u201352, when farmers in the southwestern counties expanded production.<ref>Ian A. McKay, \"A Note on Ontario Agriculture: The Development of Soybeans, 1893\u20131952,\" ''Ontario History,'' June 1983, Vol. 75 Issue 2, pp 175\u2013186</ref> Farmers increasingly demanded more information on the best farming techniques.  Their demands led to farm magazine and agricultural fairs. In 1868 the assembly created an agricultural museum, which morphed into the [[Ontario Agricultural College]] in Guelph in 1874.<ref>John Carter, \"The Education of the Ontario Farmer,\" ''Ontario History,'' May 2004, Vol. 96 Issue 1, pp 62\u201384</ref>\n\n===Prairies===\n[[Image:Palliser's Triangle map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The Prairie provinces, highlighting Palliser's Triangle]]\nWheat was the golden crop that built the economy of the Prairie provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta and filled outbound trains headed for ports to carry the grain to Europe. The tall grain elevator alongside the railway tracks became a crucial element of the Prairie grain trade after 1890. It boosted \"King Wheat\" to regional dominance by integrating the region's economy with the rest of Canada. Used to efficiently load grain into railroad cars, grain elevators came to be clustered in \"lines\" and their ownership tended to concentrate in the hands of increasingly fewer companies, many controlled by Americans. The main commercial entities involved in the trade were the Canadian Pacific Railway and the powerful grain syndicates. Dramatic changes in the grain trade took place in the 1940s, notably the amalgamation of grain elevator companies.<ref>John Everitt, \"The Line Elevator in Alberta\". ''Alberta History'' [Canada] 1992 40(4): 16\u201322; 1993 41(1): 20\u201326.</ref>\n\nNorrie argues that the necessity of using dry farming techniques created special risks and the farmers responded by using summer fallow rather than the risky but more productive use of substitute crops or the planting of wheat every year. Tenants often preferred the safety of sharecropping to the hazards (and higher returns) of cash rental, and showed an interest in [[crop insurance]]. Because farmers were averse to risk, grain production was less than it might have been.<ref>Kenneth Norrie, \"Dry Farming and the Economics of Risk Bearing: The Canadian Prairies, 1870\u20131930\", ''Agricultural History'', Winter 1977, Vol. 51 Issue 1, pp. 134\u2013148</ref>\n\nRecklessness, greed, and overoptimism played a part in the early-20th-century financial crisis on the Canadian wheat frontier. Beginning in 1916, the [[Palliser Triangle]], a semiarid region in Alberta and Saskatchewan, suffered a decade of dry years and crop failures that culminated in financial ruin for many of the region's wheat farmers. Overconfidence on the part of farmers, financiers, the Canadian Pacific, and the Canadian government led to land investments and development in the Palliser on an unprecedented and dangerous scale. A large share of this expansion was funded by mortgage and loan companies in Britain eager to make overseas investments. British money managers were driven by a complex set of global economic forces including a decline in British investment opportunities, excess capital, and massive investment expansion on the Canadian frontier. Reduced grain production in Europe and increased grain production in the Prairie Provinces also encouraged the export of capital from London. The mythical image of the Palliser as an abundant region, coupled with a growing confidence in technology, created a false sense of security and stability. Between 1908 and 1913 British firms lent vast sums to Canadian farmers to plant their wheat crops; only when the drought began in 1916 did it become clear that far too much credit had been extended.<ref>John Feldberg, and Warren M. Elofson, \"Financing The Palliser Triangle, 1908\u20131913\". ''Great Plains Quarterly'' 1998 18(3): 257\u2013268. 0275\u20137664</ref>\n\n==The First World War and the Roaring Twenties==\n\nCanada played an extraordinarily large role in the [[World War I|First World War]] relative to its size.  It sent over hundreds of thousands of troops, and was also the granary and arms producer for the allied side.  This led to a further boom on the prairies as wheat prices skyrocketed.  The rest of the country, even the Maritimes, benefited from an increase in manufacturing.<ref name=\"Robert Bothwell 1987\">Robert Bothwell,  Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada 1900\u20131945'' (1987)</ref>\n\nThe immediate post-war years saw a short, but severe, recession as the economy readjusted to the end of wartime production.  By 1921, the Canadian economy was back on its feet and rapidly expanding.  In the 1920s, there was an unprecedented increase in the standard of living as items that had been luxury goods such as radios, automobiles, and electric  lights\u2014not to mention flush toilets\u2014became common place across the nation.  The boom lasted until 1929.\n\n==The Great Depression==\n{{Main|The Great Depression in Canada}}\n[[File:ReliefWorkHighway.jpg|right|thumb|Road construction at Kimberly-Wasa, British Columbia. The federal government established Relief Projects in 1933 during the height of the Great Depression for unemployed married men of British descent]]\nCanada was hard hit by the [[Great Depression]].  When the American economy began to collapse in the late 1920s the close economic links and the central banking system meant that the malaise quickly spread across the border.  The world demand fell for wheat, lumber and mining products; prices fell, profits plunged, and unemployment soared.\n\nIn May 1930, US raised the tariff with the [[Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act]]. Canada retaliated by imposing new tariffs on 16 products that accounted altogether for around 30% of U.S. exports to Canada.<ref>Richard N. Kottman,  \"Herbert Hoover and the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff: Canada, A Case Study\", ''Journal of American History'' (1975), 62#3 pp 609\u2013635, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2936217 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>McDonald, Judith; O'Brien, Anthony Patrick; Callahan, Colleen \"Trade Wars: Canada's Reaction to the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff\", ''Journal of Economic History'' (1997), 57#4 pp 802\u2013826,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2951161 in JSTOR]</ref>  Following Britain's lead, Canada then forged closer economic links with the [[British Empire]] via the [[British Empire Economic Conference]] of 1932.\n\nBy 1933, 30% of the labour force was out of work, and one fifth of the population became dependent on government assistance.  Wages fell as did prices; debts did not fall and they became more burdensome.  [[Gross National Expenditure]] had declined 42% from the 1929 levels.  In some areas, the decline was far worse.  In the rural areas of the prairies two thirds of the population were on relief.  Population growth contracted markedly as immigration slowed, and birth rates fell as people postponed marriage and family life until they were more secure.  Crime rates increased, and a new class of unemployed vagrants appeared.<ref>Pierre Berton, ''The Great Depression: 1929\u20131939'' (1990) is a popular acoount</ref>\n\nLike the United States, Canada remained in depression far longer, not passing 1929 levels until 1939, with the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].  There was no national recovery program similar to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].\n\n==The Second World War and the boom years==\n\nThe turn around brought about by the command economy imposed at the beginning of the Second World War was immense.  Unemployment virtually disappeared by 1940 as soldiers were recruited and factories turned to war production.  Canada was in the unusual situation of helping Britain financially, through a program similar to the American [[Lend-Lease]].<ref>C. P.  Stacey, ''Arms, Men and Governments: The War Policies of Canada, 1939\u20131945'' (1970)</ref>\n\nIn the twenty-five years after the war, there was an immense expansion in the Canadian economy.  Unemployment remained low and the end of wartime production was quickly turned over to making consumer goods.  Canada, along with many other developed nations, firmly established itself as a [[welfare state]] with publicly funded [[health care]], the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and other programs.<ref>Robert  Bothwell, Ian Drummond, and John English, ''Canada since 1945'' (2d. ed. 1989)</ref>\n\nDuring this period, the Canadian economy became much more closely integrated with the American one as tariff barriers fell and trade agreements like the [[Canada-United States Automotive Agreement]] and the \"Hyde Park Declaration\" were signed.\n\n==Recent years==\n\n===Recession===\nCanada experienced economic [[recession]] in the early 1980s and again in the [[Late 1980s recession|early 1990s]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |title=Ecolnomic Concepts: Recession |access-date=20 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325185942/http://www.canadianeconomy.gc.ca/english/economy/recession.html |archive-date=25 March 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This led to massive government [[Government budget deficit|deficit]]s, high unemployment, and general disaffection.  The poor economy helped lead to the overwhelming rejection of the\n[[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]] in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]], and the fall of other governments such as [[Bob Rae]]'s [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].  The poor economy may have increased support for sovereignty in [[Quebec]], an option that was just barely rejected in the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].\n\nA brief recovery in 1994 was followed by an economic slump in 1995\u20131996. Since that date, the Canadian economy has improved markedly, in step with the boom in the United States. In the mid-1990s, [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s Liberal government began to post annual budgetary surpluses, and steadily paid down the national debt.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Johnson|title=Thinking Government: Public Sector Management in Canada |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TcL80sSautgC&pg=PA374|year=2006|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-1-55111-779-9|page=374}}</ref> Once referred to as a fiscal basket-case {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, Canada has become a model of fiscal stability as the government has posted surpluses every fiscal year from 1996 to the [[Late-2000s recession|2008 recession]].\n\nThe [[Early 2000s recession|recession]] brought on in the United States by the collapse of the [[dot-com bubble]] beginning in 2000, hurt the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] but has affected Canada only mildly.
