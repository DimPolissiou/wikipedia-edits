This includes the Conference of States party to the Kampala Convention in [[Harare|Harare, Zimbabwe]], occurring in 2017, resulting in the Harare Plan of Action\u2014 a guiding document for Convention implementation.

In this light, emphasis on active engagement, interaction, and inclusion of IDP communities in the drafting, revision, and implementation of Convention policies has been put in place by legislation and frameworks enacted by several states that have ratified the Convention recently. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\nSpecial populations face and continue to face many unique problems related to their status and condition. <ref name=\":7\" /> Scholarly studies and articles have concluded that women and children experience unique forms of hardship in the context of regional, national, and supranational conflict.

Many countries with large IDP populations, including Sudan, have not yet arrived at ratifying the Convention and/or implementing similar legislation and policy. <ref>United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, (2019, June 20). ''Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2018.'' UNHCR. https://www.unhcr.org/5d08d7ee7.pdf</ref>\n\nLately, increased attention has been given to the issue of IDPs across the African continent. Official African Union conferences and workshops related to the Kampala Convention have taken place since 2016. This includes the Conference of States party to the Kampala Convention in [[Harare|Harare, Zimbabwe]], occurring in 2017, resulting in the Harare Plan of Action\u2014 a guiding document for Convention implementation. Furthermore, in 2018 the AU adopted a \u201cmodel law\u201d on the Convention, a document accessible by States and to be used in the drafting and formalization of domestic legislation and policies related to the Convention and its goals.<ref name=\":9\" />\n\n2019 was designated by the African Union as the \u2018Year of Refugees, Returnees, and Internally Displaced Persons\u2019\u2014 with many states in recent years ratifying and becoming closer to ratifying the Convention and/or adopting similar domestic policies, and/or creating separate bodies to coordinate responses promoted by the Convention. <ref name=\":9\" /> It has also been further included and implicated in many important policy frameworks for the African continent, including the Migration Policy Framework for 2018-2030, and the [[Agenda 2063]] framework produced by the AU in 2015. <ref>African Union, (2018, May).

United Nations. https://www.un.org/en/africa/osaa/pdf/au/agenda2063-framework.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Criticism, debate ====\nAlthough ratification of the Convention has occurred in most African Union states, questions related to the larger and more pivotal enforcement execution processes have been raised\u2014 including in nations such as Nigeria, in which over one million IDPs reside. <ref name=\":14\">Akpoghome, T.

In this light, emphasis on active engagement, interaction, and inclusion of IDP communities in the drafting, revision, and implementation of Convention policies has been put in place by legislation and frameworks enacted by several states that have ratified the Convention recently. <ref name=\":9\" />\n\nSpecial populations face and continue to face many unique problems related to their status and condition. <ref name=\":7\" /> Scholarly studies and articles have concluded that women and children experience unique forms of hardship in the context of regional, national, and supranational conflict. Critics of the Kampala Convention and the African Union's action in this respect have pointed to restrictions and constraints in the field of equal protection under the Convention, especially considering a gendered view of this situation. <ref name=\":6\" /> The Norwegian Refugee Council has also echoed these sentiments\u2014 adding that full consideration and analytic and developmental measures should be taken by the States to ensure the women and girls benefit from the Convention, especially in the fields of housing and property ownership. <ref name=\":15\">Norwegian Refugee Council, (n.d.)

Human, and drummer Bloody Sunday. Prior to Evvy (Pedder's) 1996 induction into the fold, the band had resided under the moniker 'Candy Killers'. The name 'Lollipop Lust Kill' was derived partly from a desire by the original members to incorporate a sugar-coated, tongue-in-cheek feel to the band's name, with the 'lust kill' portion inspired randomly from a description of serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' as a 'lust killer' read aloud one evening by Pedder to the rest of the band. Lollipop Lust Kill was born. Bloody Sunday would be replaced by R. Cynic prior to the release of ''Motel Murder Madness'' with the departed drummer's brother Killer K. joining the band on keyboards during this time.\n\nThe band played their first show at the popular Toledo, Ohio haunt Frankies with a band named Toilet, which included future keyboardist Killer K. on guitar. They would continue to play in and around Toledo establishing a rabid and loyal fan base colloquially known as 'The Lollipop Guild'.\n\nIn 1998, Lollipop Lust Kill were finalists in Toledo WBUZ radio's \"Buzz Band Showdown\" earning them a spot on WBUZ's second local artist CD and opening a radio showcase concert, Buzzfest '98, with another Toledo-based band, Sugar Buzz. Performers included just-signed Kid Rock, Sevendust, Candlebox, [[Caroline's Spine]], Fuel and Stabbing Westward.\n\nIn 2000, Lollipop Lust Kill self-released their full-length debut, ''[[Motel Murder Madness]]'', which catapulted them into the top ten of [[MP3.com]]. Their major label debut, ''[[My So Called Knife]]'', was produced by [[Sylvia Massy]] and recorded in her haunted studio in [[Weed, California]]. Massy is known for her work with [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[System of a Down]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. The album featured a heavy rock re-make of [[Depeche Mode]]'s song \"[[Personal Jesus]]\". It was released by [[Artemis Records]] in June 2002, but the album was met with lukewarm sales.\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[My So Called Knife]]'' (a word-play on the show ''[[My So-Called Life]]''), drummer R. Cynic and guitarist Dr. Distorto changed their stage names to Knits and Pill respectively.\n\nIn March 2004, guitarist DeadGreg and bassist D. human announced their departure from the band, citing personal reasons. Keyboardist Killer K. would follow suit a few weeks later. The band auditioned several potential replacement bassists before settling on Jay Jay and guitarist Brian Tilse, formerly of Rob Halford's outfit Fight. The reformed band attempted to write and record a follow-up to ''My So Called Knife'' for several months, before deciding to call it quits in June 2004. Jay Jay and Tilse proceeded to start the band Glass Pipe Suicide with Knits, and they recorded some demos which were made available for free online before disbanding sometime in 2005.\n\nLLK played their final show at the popular Toledo venue Headliners on June 4, 2004. The original six members (those that comprised the band during the release of ''Motel Murder Madness'') reunited for this farewell show to the accolades of several hundred friends and fans from around the country. Perhaps in a fitting final tribute, vocalist Evvy Pedder invited the audience onto the stage to participate in the traditional closing song \"Balls Out\" 'lollipop style'. In the mayhem that ensued, a portion of the stage collapsed: a fitting testament to the violent imagery forwarded by the band made manifest.\n\nGuitarist Pill and vocalist Evvy Pedder attempted to resurrect the band with new members over the next several months, but to no avail.\n\nThe future of Lollipop Lust Kill remains in doubt.

Human, and drummer Bloody Sunday. Prior to Evvy (Pedder's) 1996 induction into the fold, the band had resided under the moniker 'Candy Killers'. The name 'Lollipop Lust Kill' was derived partly from a desire by the original members to incorporate a sugar-coated, tongue-in-cheek feel to the band's name, with the 'lust kill' portion inspired randomly from a description of serial killer [[John Wayne Gacy]] in the ''Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' as a 'lust killer' read aloud one evening by Pedder to the rest of the band. Lollipop Lust Kill was born. Bloody Sunday would be replaced by R. Cynic prior to the release of ''Motel Murder Madness'' with the departed drummer's brother Killer K. joining the band on keyboards during this time.\n\nThe band played their first show at the popular Toledo, Ohio haunt Frankies with a band named Toilet, which included future keyboardist Killer K. on guitar. They would continue to play in and around Toledo establishing a rabid and loyal fan base colloquially known as 'The Lollipop Guild'.\n\nIn 1998, Lollipop Lust Kill were finalists in Toledo WBUZ radio's \"Buzz Band Showdown\" earning them a spot on WBUZ's second local artist CD and opening a radio showcase concert, Buzzfest '98, with another Toledo-based band, Sugar Buzz. Performers included just-signed Kid Rock, Sevendust, Candlebox, Caroline's Spine, Fuel and Stabbing Westward.\n\nIn 2000, Lollipop Lust Kill self-released their full-length debut, ''[[Motel Murder Madness]]'', which catapulted them into the top ten of [[MP3.com]]. Their major label debut, ''[[My So Called Knife]]'', was produced by [[Sylvia Massy]] and recorded in her haunted studio in [[Weed, California]]. Massy is known for her work with [[Tool (band)|Tool]], [[System of a Down]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. The album featured a heavy rock re-make of [[Depeche Mode]]'s song \"[[Personal Jesus]]\". It was released by [[Artemis Records]] in June 2002, but the album was met with lukewarm sales.\n\nPrior to the release of ''[[My So Called Knife]]'' (a word-play on the show ''[[My So-Called Life]]''), drummer R. Cynic and guitarist Dr. Distorto changed their stage names to Knits and Pill respectively.\n\nIn March 2004, guitarist DeadGreg and bassist D. human announced their departure from the band, citing personal reasons. Keyboardist Killer K. would follow suit a few weeks later. The band auditioned several potential replacement bassists before settling on Jay Jay and guitarist Brian Tilse, formerly of Rob Halford's outfit Fight. The reformed band attempted to write and record a follow-up to ''My So Called Knife'' for several months, before deciding to call it quits in June 2004. Jay Jay and Tilse proceeded to start the band Glass Pipe Suicide with Knits, and they recorded some demos which were made available for free online before disbanding sometime in 2005.\n\nLLK played their final show at the popular Toledo venue Headliners on June 4, 2004. The original six members (those that comprised the band during the release of ''Motel Murder Madness'') reunited for this farewell show to the accolades of several hundred friends and fans from around the country. Perhaps in a fitting final tribute, vocalist Evvy Pedder invited the audience onto the stage to participate in the traditional closing song \"Balls Out\" 'lollipop style'. In the mayhem that ensued, a portion of the stage collapsed: a fitting testament to the violent imagery forwarded by the band made manifest.\n\nGuitarist Pill and vocalist Evvy Pedder attempted to resurrect the band with new members over the next several months, but to no avail.\n\nThe future of Lollipop Lust Kill remains in doubt. Pedder, the only remaining member, still harbors aspirations to bring their particular style of murderous musical mayhem to the masses as a solo artist. He did cut a few songs with [[Meegs]] from [[Coal Chamber]] under the project name Glass Pi\u00f1ata, but has not released anything since.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\nNotably, LLK toured with [[Coal Chamber]], [[American Head Charge]], [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]], [[Motograter]], [[Dog Fashion Disco]] and [[Kittie]].\n\nThree members (DeadGreg, Pill, and Knits) agreed to start a new band, called They Thought We Were Strangers, and played together for the first time since the farewell show in 2004.

Tascam is credited as the inventor of the [[Portastudio]], the first cassette-based [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] home studio recorders.  Tascam also introduced the  first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync designed for recording musicians.  Tascam also manufactured [[reel-to-reel]] tape machines and audio mixers for home recordists from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tascam-16Track.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The TASCAM 85 16B analog tape recorder can record 16 tracks of audio on 1-inch (2.54cm) tape.]]\n[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early home multitrack recorder, four tracks on \u00bc inch tape]]\n\nTascam started out as a research and development group to research how to use TEAC's recording technology in musician and recording studio products.  The group was called TASC ('''T'''EAC '''A'''udio '''S'''ystems '''C'''orp).  The founders included Mr. K. Tani, one of the founders of TEAC-Japan and Dr. Abe, a senior TEAC-Japan engineer.  In 1971 TASCAM (TASC '''AM'''erica Corp.) was founded to distribute TASC products in the U.S.  It also conducted additional market research in the US for the Japanese parent company. The company's first headquarters was at 5440 McConnell Avenue, [[Los Angeles]], CA 90066.  In 1974 it moved its headquarters to 7733 Telegraph Road, Montebello, California.\n\nTascam's first products were TEAC brand multitrack recorders.  In 1972 it introduced the first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync:\n\n* The A3340 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A2340 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A3340S 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n* The A2340S 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n\nIn 1973 they introduced the first Tascam-branded products:\n\n* M-10 modular 12x4x2 mixer\n* Series 70H-X MTR\n* Series 70H-8 MTR\n\nOn March 4, 1973 TEAC merged the Tascam Corporation into TEAC Corporation of America (TCA).

Tascam is credited as the inventor of the [[Portastudio]], the first cassette-based [[Multitrack recording|multi-track]] home studio recorders.  Tascam also introduced the  first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync designed for recording musicians.  Tascam also manufactured [[reel-to-reel]] tape machines and audio mixers for home recordists from the early 1970s through the mid-1990s.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tascam-16Track.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The TASCAM 85 16B analog tape recorder can record 16 tracks of audio on 1-inch (2.54cm) tape.]]\n[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early home multitrack recorder, four tracks on \u00bc inch tape]]\n\nTascam started out as a research and development group to research how to use TEAC's recording technology in musician and recording studio products.  The group was called TASC ('''T'''EAC '''A'''udio '''S'''ystems '''C'''orp).  The founders included Mr. K. Tani, one of the founders of TEAC-Japan and Dr. Abe, a senior TEAC-Japan engineer.  In 1971 TASCAM (TASC '''AM'''erica Corp.) was founded to distribute TASC products in the U.S.  It also conducted additional market research in the US for the Japanese parent company. The company's first headquarters was at 5440 McConnell Avenue, [[Los Angeles]], CA 90066.  In 1974 it moved its headquarters to 7733 Telegraph Road, Montebello, California.\n\nTascam's first products were TEAC brand multitrack recorders.  In 1972 it introduced the first low-cost mass-produced multitrack recorders with Simul-Sync:\n\n* The A3340 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A2340 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds w/ manual direction toggle lever\n* The A3340S 4-track recorder with 10.5\" tape reels, 7\u00bd and 15 ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n* The A2340S 4-track recorder with 7\" tape reels, 3\u00be and 7\u00bd ips speeds, the 's' designation indicating improved w/ solenoid control\n\nIn 1973 they introduced the first Tascam-branded products:\n\n* M-10 modular 12x4x2 mixer\n* Series 70H-X MTR\n* Series 70H-8 MTR\n\nOn March 4, 1973 TEAC merged the Tascam Corporation into TEAC Corporation of America (TCA). TEAC-Japan retains the exclusive worldwide rights to the TASCAM brand name for their professional audio related products.<ref name=\"TASCAM Forums &gt; History of TASCAM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tascamforums.com/threads/history-of-tascam.2132/ |title=A Little Tascam History Lesson |publisher=TASCAM Forums |date= |accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013 [[Gibson|Gibson Brands Inc.]] bought a majority stake in [[TEAC Corporation]], the parent company of TASCAM.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/29/gibson-teac-purchase-idUST9N0BZ01Q20130329|title=Gibson Guitar to buy TEAC, add|first=Reuters|last=Editorial|website=reuters.com}}</ref> In October 2017, TASCAM partnered with Philly punk band the Dead Milkmen and philanthropic record label The Giving Groove to sponsor a remix contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicconnection.com/tascam-giving-groove-milkmen-contest/|title=TASCAM Partners With The Giving Groove, Dead Milkmen for Contest|website=www.musicconnection.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>\n\n==Notable and industry-recognized products==\n\n===[[Portastudio]] and pocketstudio===\n\n* 144 -

He first rose to prominence with the publication of ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' (1967), a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of the lives and experiences of its members.\n\nIn 1970, he wrote an unconventional magazine feature titled \"[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]\" for ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]'' which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with [[counterculture]] credibility. It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of [[New Journalism]] which he called \"Gonzo,\" which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative.\n\nThompson remains best known for ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1971), a book first serialized in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] movement. It was adapted on film twice: loosely in ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' starring [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson in 1980, and directly in 1998 by director [[Terry Gilliam]] in a [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|film]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Benicio del Toro]].  The ''[[Doonesbury]]'' cartoon character Duke \u2013 who was modeled after Thompson \u2013 pens an essay about \"my shoplifting conviction\" titled \"Fear and Loathing at Macy's Menswear\", a reference to Thompson's book.\n\nPolitically minded, Thompson ran unsuccessfully for [[sheriff]] of [[Pitkin County, Colorado]] in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket. He became well known for his dislike of [[Richard Nixon]], who he claimed represented \"that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Hunter S Thompson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4283349.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 21, 2005}}</ref> He covered Nixon's [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 reelection campaign]] for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.\n\nThompson's output notably declined from the mid-1970s, as he struggled with the consequences of fame, and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized. He was also known for his lifelong use of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and illegal narcotics, his love of [[firearm]]s, and his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] contempt for [[authoritarianism]]. He often remarked: \"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.\"\n\nThompson committed suicide at the age of 67, following a series of health problems. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired out of a cannon in a ceremony funded by his friend [[Johnny Depp]] and attended by friends including then-Senator [[John Kerry]] and [[Jack Nicholson]]. [[Hari Kunzru]] wrote that \"the true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist&nbsp;... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n20/hari-kunzru/the-first-person-steroid-enhanced |title=Hari Kunzru reviews 'The Rum Diary' by Hunter S.

While there, he published his first magazine feature (in the nationally distributed [[Rogue (magazine)|''Rogue'']] magazine) on the [[artisan]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture of Big Sur.\n\nDuring this period Thompson wrote two novels, ''[[Prince Jellyfish]]'' and [[The Rum Diary (novel)|''The Rum Diary'']], and submitted many [[short story|short stories]] to publishers \u2013 with little success.

From his hotel room in Chicago, Thompson watched the clashes between police and protesters, which he wrote had a great effect on his political views.

Thompson (Candidate for Sheriff)\". Despite the publicity, Thompson narrowly lost the election. While carrying the city of Aspen, he garnered only 44% of the county-wide vote in what had become a two-way race. The Republican candidate agreed to withdraw a few days before the election in order to consolidate the anti-Thompson votes, in return for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] withdrawing their candidate for county commissioner. Thompson later remarked that the ''Rolling Stone'' article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters.<ref>Hunter S. Thompson (2003), ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'', Simon & Schuster, p. 95.</ref>\n\n===Birth of Gonzo===\n{{Main|Gonzo journalism}}\nAlso in 1970, Thompson wrote an article entitled ''[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]'' for the short-lived [[new journalism]] magazine ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]''. For that article, editor [[Warren Hinckle]] paired Thompson with illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]], who drew [[expressionism|expressionist]] illustrations with lipstick and eyeliner. Thompson and Steadman collaborated regularly after that. Although it was not widely read, the article was the first to use the techniques of [[Gonzo journalism]], a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic [[First-person narrative|first-person]] subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook.\n\nThe first use of the word \"Gonzo\" to describe Thompson's work is credited to the journalist [[Bill Cardoso]]. Cardoso first met Thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the [[New Hampshire primary#1968|1968 New Hampshire primary]]. In 1970, Cardoso (who was then the editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]] Sunday Magazine'') wrote to Thompson praising the ''Kentucky Derby'' piece as a breakthrough: \"This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling.\" According to Steadman, Thompson took to the word right away and said, \"Okay, that's what I do. Gonzo.\"<ref name=cardoso-obit>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Bill Cardoso, 68, Editor Who Coined 'Gonzo', Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/national/16cardoso.html?_r=1&ei=5088&en=c7b5fe5f62a5d95e&ex=1300165200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 16, 2006}}</ref> Thompson's first published use of the word appears in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'': \"Free Enterprise. The [[American Dream]]. [[Horatio Alger]] gone mad on drugs in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]]. Do it ''now'': pure Gonzo journalism.\"\n\n===''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''===\n{{Main|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas}}\nThe book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for \"[[Strange Rumblings in Aztlan]]\", an expos\u00e9 for ''Rolling Stone'' on the 1970 killing of the [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] television journalist [[Rub\u00e9n Salazar]]. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] during the [[Chicano Moratorium|National Chicano Moratorium March]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. One of Thompson's sources for the story was [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to write a 250-word photograph caption on the [[Mint 400]] motorcycle race held there.\n\nWhat was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to ''Sports Illustrated'' a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, \"aggressively rejected.\" ''Rolling Stone'' publisher [[Jann Wenner]] was said to have liked \"the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication&nbsp;\u2014 which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it\", Thompson later wrote.<ref>{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=1979 | title= The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time | edition=1st | publisher=[[Summit Books]] | isbn=0-671-40046-0 | pages = 105\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of ''Rolling Stone'' as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named [[Raoul Duke]] on a trip to Las Vegas with [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]], his \"300-pound [[Samoans|Samoan]] attorney\", to cover a [[Prohibition (drugs)|narcotics officers]]' convention and the \"fabulous Mint 400\". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as \"my attorney\") become sidetracked by a search for the [[American Dream]], with \"two bags of [[cannabis (drug)|grass]], seventy-five pellets of [[mescaline]], five sheets of high-powered [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|blotter acid]], a salt shaker half full of [[cocaine]], and a whole galaxy of multi-colored [[Amphetamine|uppers]], [[Barbiturates|downers]], [[Methamphetamine|screamers]], [[Nitrous Oxide|laughers]]&nbsp;... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw [[Diethyl ether|ether]], and two dozen [[amyl nitrite|amyls]].\"\n\nComing to terms with the failure of the 1960s [[counterculture|countercultural movement]] is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as \"by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Crawford|title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/books/thompson-1972-vegar.html|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 23, 1972}}</ref> \"The Vegas Book\", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.\n\n===''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72''===\n{{Main| Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72}}\nBeginning in late 1971 Thompson wrote extensively for ''Rolling Stone'' on the [[U.S. presidential election|election campaigns]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator [[George McGovern]]. The articles were soon combined and published as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''. As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling the \"campaign trail\", focusing largely on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s primaries. Nixon, as the Republican incumbent, performed little campaign work, while McGovern competed with rival candidates [[Edmund Muskie]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Thompson was an early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read ''Rolling Stone''.\n\nThompson went on to become a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson described him in ''Rolling Stone'' as a man who \"could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time\", and said \"his casket [should] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [He] was an evil man\u2014evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the [[Devil]] can understand it.\"<ref>Thompson, Hunter S.

While ''The Washington Post'' was lamenting Nixon's \"lonely and depressed\" state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that '[i]f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [Nixon's] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.'<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Hunter S. |title=Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson |year=2011 |page=337}}</ref> There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.\n\n==Later years==\nThompson's journalistic work began to seriously suffer after his trip to Africa to cover \"[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]\"\u2014the world heavyweight boxing match between [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]\u2014in 1974. He missed the match while intoxicated at his hotel, and did not submit a story to the magazine. As Wenner put it to the film critic [[Roger Ebert]] in the 2008 documentary ''Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson'', \"After Africa he just couldn't write. He couldn't piece it together\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S.

Thompson arrived in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] just as [[Fall of Saigon|South Vietnam was collapsing]] and as other journalists were leaving the country. Again, Wenner pulled the plug on the project. The incidents strained Thompson's relationship with Wenner and ''Rolling Stone.''\n\nFrom the late 1970s on, most of Thompson's literary output appeared as a four-volume series of books entitled ''[[The Gonzo Papers]]''. Beginning with ''The Great Shark Hunt'' in 1979 and ending with ''[[Better Than Sex (book)|Better Than Sex]]'' in 1994, the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pre-gonzo period, along with almost all of his ''Rolling Stone'' pieces.\n\nStarting in about 1980, Thompson became more reclusive. Aside from paid appearances, he largely retreated to his compound in Woody Creek, rejecting projects and assignments or failing to complete them. Despite a lack of new material, Wenner kept Thompson on the ''Rolling Stone'' [[Masthead (American publishing)|masthead]] as chief of the \"National Affairs Desk\", a position he would hold until his death.\n\nIn 1980, Thompson divorced wife Sandra Conklin. The same year marked the release of ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'', a loose film adaptation based on Thompson's early 1970s work, starring [[Bill Murray]] as the writer. Murray eventually became one of Thompson's trusted friends. Later that year Thompson relocated to [[Hawaii]] to research and write, ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', a Gonzo-style account of the 1980 [[Honolulu Marathon]]. Extensively illustrated by [[Ralph Steadman]], the piece first appeared in ''Running'' in 1981 as \"The Charge of the Weird Brigade\" and was later excerpted in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1983.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gonzo.org/books/cl/ |title=The Great Thompson Hunt&nbsp;\u2014 Books&nbsp;\u2014 The Curse of Lono |publisher=Gonzo.org |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he covered the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of Grenada]] but didn't write or discuss the experiences until the publication of ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'' in 2003. Later that year, at the behest of [[Terry McDonell]], he wrote \"A Dog Took My Place\", an expos\u00e9 for ''Rolling Stone'' of the scandalous [[Roxanne Pulitzer]] divorce case and what he called the \"[[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] lifestyle\". The story included dubious insinuations of [[bestiality]] but was widely considered to be a return by Thompson to his proper form. In 1985 Thompson accepted an advance to write about \"couples pornography\" for ''Playboy''. As part of his research, he spent evenings at the [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] [[striptease club]] in San Francisco. The experience evolved into an as-yet-unpublished novel tentatively entitled ''The Night Manager''.\n\n[[File:Hst-by-rsexton-longbeach-5-1989-2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hunter S.

Rather than traveling the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections, Thompson monitored the proceedings on cable television; ''Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie'', his account of the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential]] campaign, is composed of reactive faxes to ''Rolling Stone''. In 1994, the magazine published \"He Was a Crook,\" a \"scathing\" obituary of Richard Nixon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/|title=He Was a Crook|first=Hunter S.|last=Thompson|date=June 17, 1994|website=The Atlantic}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' published Thompson's final magazine feature \"The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004\", a brief account of the 2004 presidential election in which he compared the outcome of the ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' court case to the [[Reichstag fire]] and formally endorsed [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], a longtime friend, for president.\n\n===''Fear and Loathing'' redux===\nThompson's work gained renewed attention with the release of the film ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''. New editions of the book were published, introducing Thompson's work to a new generation of readers. The same year, an early novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was published, as were the two volumes of collected letters.\n\nThompson's next, and penultimate, collection, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child In the Final Days of the American Century]]'', was widely publicized as Thompson's first memoir. Published in 2003, it combined new material (including reminiscences of the O'Farrell Theater), selected newspaper and digital clippings, and other older works.\n\nThompson finished his journalism career in the same way it had begun: Writing about sports. From 2000 until his death in 2005, he wrote a weekly column for [[ESPN]].com's [[Page 2]] entitled \"Hey, Rube.\" In 2004 [[Simon & Schuster]] collected some of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid-2004 as ''[[Hey Rube (book)|Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness]]''.\n\nThompson married assistant Anita Bejmuk on April 23, 2003.\n\n==Death==\nAt 5:42&nbsp;p.m. on February 20, 2005, Thompson died from a [[suicide|self-inflicted]] gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his \"fortified compound\" in [[Woody Creek, Colorado]]. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the ''Aspen Daily News'', Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter.

He was also upset over his advancing age and chronic medical problems, including a hip replacement; he would frequently mutter \"This kid is getting old.\" ''Rolling Stone'' published what Doug Brinkley described as a [[suicide note]] written by Thompson to his wife, titled \"Football Season Is Over\".

The plans for the monument were initially drawn by Thompson and Steadman, and were shown as part of an ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' program on the [[BBC]] titled ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood|Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision]]'' (1978). It is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2004 [[Criterion Collection]] DVD release of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', and labeled as ''Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood''.\n\nAccording to his widow, Anita, the $3 million funeral was funded by actor [[Johnny Depp]], who was a close friend of Thompson. Depp told the ''[[Associated Press]]'', \"All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.\"<ref name=\"editorandpublisher1\"/> An estimated 280 people attended, including [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] John Kerry<ref name=\"Brooks\">Patricia Brooks, Jonathan Brooks, ''Laid to Rest in California: A Guide to the Cemeteries and Grave SItes of the Rich and Famous'' (2006), p. 321.</ref> and [[George McGovern]];<ref name=\"Brooks\"/> ''[[60 Minutes]]'' correspondents [[Ed Bradley]] and [[Charlie Rose]]; actors [[Jack Nicholson]], [[John Cusack]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Sean Penn]], and [[Josh Hartnett]]; musicians [[Lyle Lovett]], [[John Oates]] and [[David Amram]], and artist and long-time friend [[Ralph Steadman]].\n\n==Legacy==\n===Writing style===\n{{Main|Gonzo journalism}}\nThompson is often credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style are considered to be a major part of the [[New Journalism]] literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the [[first person narrative|first person]], while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color \"the story\" he was trying to follow.\n\nDespite him having personally described his work as \"Gonzo\", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in ''[[Playboy]]'' addressed the issue himself, saying \"Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter.\" [[Tom Wolfe]] would later describe Thompson's style as \"...&nbsp;part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric.\"<ref name=\"wolfetom\">{{cite news|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=As Gonzo in Life as in His Work|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222142331/http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325 |archivedate=February 22, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 22, 2005}}</ref> Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, \"While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a [[fly in the ointment]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780345396358.html |title=Better Than Sex by Hunter S. Thompson \u2013 Trade Paperback |publisher=Random House |date=August 22, 1995 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of Thompson's most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine. Along with [[Joe Eszterhas]] and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from [[Howlin' Wolf]] to [[Lou Reed]]. Armed with early [[fax]] machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.\n\nRobert Love, Thompson's editor of 23 years at ''Rolling Stone'', wrote that \"the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred, and we didn't always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous. But if there were living, identifiable humans in a scene, we took certain steps&nbsp;... Hunter was a close friend of many prominent Democrats, veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered, so when in doubt, we'd call the press secretary. 'People will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or Washington,' he once said, and he was right.\"\n\nDiscerning the line between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work presented a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work \"one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world\", and \"for the first-timer&nbsp;... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. You knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and [[caliber]], and there was no faking it.\"<ref name=\"love-cjr\">Love, Robert.

Fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor.\n\nIn the late sixties, Thompson acquired the [[Honorary degree|title of]] \"Doctor\" from the [[Universal Life Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universallifechurchministers.org/hunter-thompson/|title=Hunter Thompson|publisher=Universal Life Church|access-date=25 March 2018|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cohen, Rich|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/books/review/17COHENRE.html?pagewanted=print&position=|title=''Gonzo Nights''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 17, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hunter S.

Thompson bibliography}}\n\n===Books===\nThompson wrote a number of books, publishing from 1966 to the end of his life. His best-known works include ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs]]'', ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', and ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]''.\n\n===Articles===\nAs a journalist over the course of decades, Thompson published numerous articles in various [[Periodical literature|periodicals]]. He wrote for many publications, including ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''[[The San Juan Star]]'', and ''[[Playboy]]''. He was also guest editor for a single edition of ''The Aspen Daily News''. A collection of 100 of his columns from ''The San Francisco Examiner'' was published in 1988 as ''[[Generation of Swine|Gonzo Papers, Vol. 2: Generation of Swine: Tales of Shame and Degradation in the '80s]]''. A collection of his articles for ''Rolling Stone'' was released in 2011 as ''[[Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone|Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The book was edited by the magazine's co-founder and publisher, Jann S. Wenner, who also provided an introduction to the collection.\n\n===Letters===\nThompson wrote many letters, which were his primary means of personal communication. He made [[carbon copy|carbon copies]] of all his letters, usually typed, a habit begun in his teenage years.\n\n''The Fear and Loathing Letters'' is a three-volume collection of selections from Thompson's correspondence, edited by the historian [[Douglas Brinkley]]. The first volume, ''The Proud Highway'' was published in 1997, and contains letters from 1955 to 1967. ''[[Fear and Loathing in America]]'' was published in 2000 and contains letters dating from 1968 to 1976. A third volume, titled ''The Mutineer: Rants, Ravings, and Missives from the Mountaintop 1977\u20132005'' was edited by Douglas Brinkley and published by Simon & Schuster in 2005. As of March 2019, it has yet to be sold to the public. It contains a special introduction by Johnny Depp.\n\n===Illustrations===\nAccompanying the eccentric and colorful writing of Hunter Thompson, illustrations by British artist [[Ralph Steadman]] offer visual representations of the Gonzo style. Steadman and Thompson developed a close friendship, and often traveled together. Though his illustrations occur in most of Thompson's books, they are conspicuously featured in full-page color in Thompson's ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', set in Hawaii.\n\n===Photography===\nThompson was an avid amateur photographer throughout his life and his photos have been exhibited since his death at art galleries in the United States and United Kingdom. In late 2006, AMMO Books published a limited-edition 224-page collection of Thompson photos called ''Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson'', with an introduction by Johnny Depp. Thompson's snapshots were a combination of the subjects he was covering, stylized self-portraits, and artistic [[still life]] photos. The ''[[London Observer]]'' called the photos \"astonishingly good\" and noted that \"Thompson's pictures remind us, brilliantly in every sense, of very real people, real colours.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=Hunter gets captured by the frame|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/04/photography.features|newspaper=The Observer|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Feature films===\nThe film ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' (1980) depicts heavily fictionalized attempts by Thompson to cover the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 U.S. presidential election]]. It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson and [[Peter Boyle]] as Thompson's attorney [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], referred to in the movie as Carl Lazlo, Esq.\n\n[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|The 1998 film adaptation]] of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' was directed by [[Monty Python]] veteran [[Terry Gilliam]] and starred [[Johnny Depp]] (who moved into Thompson's basement to \"study\" Thompson's persona before assuming his role in the film) as [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]]. The film has achieved something of a [[cult film|cult following]].\n\nIn the 2001 film ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'', Thompson is briefly portrayed by actor Lee Cummings.\n\n[[The Rum Diary (film)|The film adaptation]] of Thompson's novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was released in October 2011, also starring Johnny Depp as the main character, Paul Kemp. The novel's premise was inspired by Thompson's own experiences in Puerto Rico. The film was written and directed by [[Bruce Robinson]].\n\nAt a press junket for ''The Rum Diary'' shortly before the film's release, Depp said that he would like to adapt ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', \"[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]\", and ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' for the big screen: \"I'd just keep playing Hunter.

It can be found on disc 2 of [[The Criterion Collection]] edition of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.\n\nThe [[Mitchell brothers]], owners of the O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, made a documentary about Thompson in 1988 called ''Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die''.\n\n[[Wayne Ewing]] created three documentaries about Thompson. The film ''[[Breakfast with Hunter]]'' (2003) was directed and edited by Ewing. It documents Thompson's work on the movie ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', his arrest for [[drunk driving]], and his subsequent fight with the court system. ''When I Die'' (2005) is a video chronicle of making Thompson's final farewell wishes a reality, and documents the send-off itself. ''Free Lisl: Fear and Loathing in Denver'' (2006) chronicles Thompson's efforts in helping to free Lisl Auman, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the shooting of a police officer, a crime she didn't commit. All three films are only available online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hunterthompsonfilms.com/ |title=Hunter Thompson Films |publisher=Hunter Thompson Films |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105063358/http://www.hunterthompsonfilms.com/ |archive-date=November 5, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manifestation.tv/ |title=Manifestation.tv |publisher=Manifestation.tv |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827071356/http://www.manifestation.tv/ |archive-date=August 27, 2005 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> (2004) Thompson gives director Adamm Liley insight into the nature of the American Dream over drinks at the Woody Creek Tavern.\n\n''[[Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride: Hunter S. Thompson on Film]]'' (2006) was directed by [[Tom Thurman]], written by Tom Marksbury, and produced by the [[Starz Entertainment Group]]. The original documentary features interviews with Thompson's inner circle of family and friends, but the thrust of the film focuses on the manner in which his life often overlapped with numerous Hollywood celebrities who became his close friends, such as Johnny Depp, [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Sean Penn]], [[John Cusack]], Thompson's wife Anita, son Juan, former Senators [[George McGovern]] and [[Gary Hart]], writers [[Tom Wolfe]] and [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]], actors [[Gary Busey]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and the illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]] among others.\n\n''Blasted!!! The Gonzo Patriots of Hunter S. Thompson'' (2006), produced, directed, photographed and edited by Blue Kraning, is a documentary about the scores of fans who volunteered their privately owned artillery to fire the ashes of the late author, Hunter S. Thompson. ''Blasted!!!'' premiered at the 2006 Starz Denver International Film Festival, part of a tribute series to Hunter S. Thompson held at the Denver Press Club.\n\nIn 2008, [[Academy Award]]-winning documentarian [[Alex Gibney]] (''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'', ''[[Taxi to the Dark Side]]'') wrote and directed a documentary on Thompson, titled ''[[Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The film premiered on January 20, 2008, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Gibney uses intimate, never-before-seen home videos, interviews with friends, enemies and lovers, and clips from films adapted from Thompson's material to document his turbulent life.\n\n===Theater===\nLou Stein's adaptation of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' was performed at the Battersea Theatre. Stein persuades London's ''Time Out'' magazine to put Thompson up for a fortnight, in exchange for him writing a cover story to publicize the play. Thompson doesn't write the story, but does rampage around London on ''Time Out'' 's expense account. The play was revived for the Vault Fringe Festival in 2014.\n\n''GONZO: A Brutal Chrysalis'' is a one-man show about Thompson written by Paul Addis, who also played the author. Set in the writing den of Thompson's Woody Creek home, the show portrays his life between 1968 and 1971. James Cartee began playing the role soon after Addis's arrest in 2009, and again after Addis's death in 2012.\n\n===Awards, accolades and tributes===\n* Thompson was named a [[Kentucky colonel]] by the Governor of [[Kentucky]] in a December 1996 tribute ceremony where he also received keys to the city of Louisville.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitehead, Ron|title=''Hunter S.

The first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar to that of [[Ralph Steadman]], and later strips featured various [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequiturs]] (with Duke variously transforming into a monster, melting, shrinking to the size of an empty drinking glass, or people around him turning into animals) which seemed to mirror some of the effects of hallucinogenic drugs described in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.\n* General Hunter Gathers in the [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' is a tribute to Thompson and derives his physical appearance from him.\n* Dale Gribble in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] animated series ''[[King of the Hill]]'' is a tribute to Thompson and derives his physical appearance from him.\n*In the Cameron Crowe film \"Almost Famous\", based on Crowe's experiences writing for Rolling Stone magazine while on the road with the fictional band \"Stillwater\", the writer is on the phone with an actor portraying Jaan Wenner.

He first rose to prominence with the publication of ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' (1967), a book for which he spent a year living and riding with the [[Hells Angels]] motorcycle gang in order to write a first-hand account of the lives and experiences of its members.\n\nIn 1970, he wrote an unconventional magazine feature titled \"[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]\" for ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]'' which both raised his profile and established him as a writer with [[counterculture]] credibility. It also set him on a path to establishing his own sub-genre of [[New Journalism]] which he called \"Gonzo,\" which was essentially an ongoing experiment in which the writer becomes a central figure and even a participant in the events of the narrative.\n\nThompson remains best known for ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' (1971), a book first serialized in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in which he grapples with the implications of what he considered the failure of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]] movement. It was adapted on film twice: loosely in ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' starring [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson in 1980, and directly in 1998 by director [[Terry Gilliam]] in a [[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|film]] starring [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Benicio del Toro]].  The ''[[Doonesbury]]'' cartoon character Duke \u2013 who was modeled after Thompson \u2013 pens an essay about \"my shoplifting conviction\" titled \"Fear and Loathing at Macy's Menswear\", a reference to Thompson's book.\n\nPolitically minded, Thompson ran unsuccessfully for [[sheriff]] of [[Pitkin County, Colorado]] in 1970 on the Freak Power ticket. He became well known for his dislike of [[Richard Nixon]], who he claimed represented \"that dark, venal, and incurably violent side of the American character\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Hunter S Thompson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4283349.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 21, 2005}}</ref> He covered Nixon's [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 reelection campaign]] for Rolling Stone and later collected the stories in book form as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.\n\nThompson's output notably declined from the mid-1970s, as he struggled with the consequences of fame, and he complained that he could no longer merely report on events as he was too easily recognized. He was also known for his lifelong use of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and illegal narcotics, his love of [[firearm]]s, and his [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] contempt for [[authoritarianism]]. He often remarked: \"I hate to advocate drugs, alcohol, violence, or insanity to anyone, but they've always worked for me.\"\n\nThompson committed suicide at the age of 67, following a series of health problems. In accordance with his wishes, his ashes were fired out of a cannon in a ceremony funded by his friend [[Johnny Depp]] and attended by friends including then-Senator [[John Kerry]] and [[Jack Nicholson]]. [[Hari Kunzru]] wrote that \"the true voice of Thompson is revealed to be that of American moralist&nbsp;... one who often makes himself ugly to expose the ugliness he sees around him.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n20/hari-kunzru/the-first-person-steroid-enhanced |title=Hari Kunzru reviews 'The Rum Diary' by Hunter S.

Thompson (Candidate for Sheriff)\". Despite the publicity, Thompson narrowly lost the election. While carrying the city of Aspen, he garnered only 44% of the county-wide vote in what had become a two-way race. The Republican candidate agreed to withdraw a few days before the election in order to consolidate the anti-Thompson votes, in return for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] withdrawing their candidate for county commissioner. Thompson later remarked that the ''Rolling Stone'' article mobilized his opposition far more than his supporters.<ref>Hunter S. Thompson (2003), ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'', Simon & Schuster, p. 95.</ref>\n\n===Birth of Gonzo===\n{{Main|Gonzo journalism}}\nAlso in 1970, Thompson wrote an article entitled ''[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]'' for the short-lived [[new journalism]] magazine ''[[Scanlan's Monthly]]''. For that article, editor [[Warren Hinckle]] paired Thompson with illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]], who drew [[expressionism|expressionist]] illustrations with lipstick and eyeliner. Thompson and Steadman collaborated regularly after that. Although it was not widely read, the article was the first to use the techniques of [[Gonzo journalism]], a style Thompson would later employ in almost every literary endeavor. The manic [[First-person narrative|first-person]] subjectivity of the story was reportedly the result of sheer desperation; he was facing a looming deadline and started sending the magazine pages ripped out of his notebook.\n\nThe first use of the word \"Gonzo\" to describe Thompson's work is credited to the journalist [[Bill Cardoso]]. Cardoso first met Thompson on a bus full of journalists covering the [[New Hampshire primary#1968|1968 New Hampshire primary]]. In 1970, Cardoso (who was then the editor of ''[[The Boston Globe]] Sunday Magazine'') wrote to Thompson praising the ''Kentucky Derby'' piece as a breakthrough: \"This is it, this is pure Gonzo. If this is a start, keep rolling.\" According to Steadman, Thompson took to the word right away and said, \"Okay, that's what I do. Gonzo.\"<ref name=cardoso-obit>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Douglas|title=Bill Cardoso, 68, Editor Who Coined 'Gonzo', Is Dead|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/16/national/16cardoso.html?_r=1&ei=5088&en=c7b5fe5f62a5d95e&ex=1300165200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=print|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 16, 2006}}</ref> Thompson's first published use of the word appears in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'': \"Free Enterprise.

Do it ''now'': pure Gonzo journalism.\"\n\n===''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''===\n{{Main|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas}}\nThe book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for \"[[Strange Rumblings in Aztlan]]\", an expos\u00e9 for ''Rolling Stone'' on the 1970 killing of the [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] television journalist [[Rub\u00e9n Salazar]]. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] during the [[Chicano Moratorium|National Chicano Moratorium March]] against the [[Vietnam War]]. One of Thompson's sources for the story was [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' to write a 250-word photograph caption on the [[Mint 400]] motorcycle race held there.\n\nWhat was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to ''Sports Illustrated'' a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, \"aggressively rejected.\" ''Rolling Stone'' publisher [[Jann Wenner]] was said to have liked \"the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication&nbsp;\u2014 which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it\", Thompson later wrote.<ref>{{cite book | last=Thompson | first=Hunter | year=1979 | title= The Great Shark Hunt: Strange Tales from a Strange Time | edition=1st | publisher=[[Summit Books]] | isbn=0-671-40046-0 | pages = 105\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of ''Rolling Stone'' as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named [[Raoul Duke]] on a trip to Las Vegas with [[Oscar Zeta Acosta|Dr. Gonzo]], his \"300-pound [[Samoans|Samoan]] attorney\", to cover a [[Prohibition (drugs)|narcotics officers]]' convention and the \"fabulous Mint 400\". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as \"my attorney\") become sidetracked by a search for the [[American Dream]], with \"two bags of [[cannabis (drug)|grass]], seventy-five pellets of [[mescaline]], five sheets of high-powered [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|blotter acid]], a salt shaker half full of [[cocaine]], and a whole galaxy of multi-colored [[Amphetamine|uppers]], [[Barbiturates|downers]], [[Methamphetamine|screamers]], [[Nitrous Oxide|laughers]]&nbsp;... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw [[Diethyl ether|ether]], and two dozen [[amyl nitrite|amyls]].\"\n\nComing to terms with the failure of the 1960s [[counterculture|countercultural movement]] is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as \"by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope\".<ref>{{cite news|last=Woods|first=Crawford|title=Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/07/23/books/thompson-1972-vegar.html|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 23, 1972}}</ref> \"The Vegas Book\", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public.\n\n===''Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72''===\n{{Main| Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72}}\nBeginning in late 1971 Thompson wrote extensively for ''Rolling Stone'' on the [[U.S. presidential election|election campaigns]] of President [[Richard Nixon]] and his unsuccessful opponent, Senator [[George McGovern]]. The articles were soon combined and published as ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''. As the title suggests, Thompson spent nearly all of his time traveling the \"campaign trail\", focusing largely on the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s primaries. Nixon, as the Republican incumbent, performed little campaign work, while McGovern competed with rival candidates [[Edmund Muskie]] and [[Hubert Humphrey]]. Thompson was an early supporter of McGovern and wrote unflattering coverage of the rival campaigns in the increasingly widely read ''Rolling Stone''.\n\nThompson went on to become a fierce critic of Nixon, both during and after his presidency. After Nixon's death in 1994, Thompson described him in ''Rolling Stone'' as a man who \"could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time\", and said \"his casket [should] have been launched into one of those open-sewage canals that empty into the ocean just south of Los Angeles. He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [He] was an evil man\u2014evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the [[Devil]] can understand it.\"<ref>Thompson, Hunter S.

While ''The Washington Post'' was lamenting Nixon's \"lonely and depressed\" state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that '[i]f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [Nixon's] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island right now, in the belly of a hammerhead shark.'<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Hunter S. |title=Fear and Loathing at Rolling Stone: The Essential Writings of Hunter S. Thompson |year=2011 |page=337}}</ref> There was however one passion shared by Thompson and Nixon: a love of football, discussed in ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72]]''.\n\n==Later years==\nThompson's journalistic work began to seriously suffer after his trip to Africa to cover \"[[The Rumble in the Jungle]]\"\u2014the world heavyweight boxing match between [[George Foreman]] and [[Muhammad Ali]]\u2014in 1974. He missed the match while intoxicated at his hotel, and did not submit a story to the magazine. As Wenner put it to the film critic [[Roger Ebert]] in the 2008 documentary ''Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson'', \"After Africa he just couldn't write. He couldn't piece it together\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S.

Thompson arrived in [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] just as [[Fall of Saigon|South Vietnam was collapsing]] and as other journalists were leaving the country. Again, Wenner pulled the plug on the project. The incidents strained Thompson's relationship with Wenner and ''Rolling Stone.''\n\nFrom the late 1970s on, most of Thompson's literary output appeared as a four-volume series of books entitled ''[[The Gonzo Papers]]''. Beginning with ''The Great Shark Hunt'' in 1979 and ending with ''[[Better Than Sex (book)|Better Than Sex]]'' in 1994, the series is largely a collection of rare newspaper and magazine pieces from the pre-gonzo period, along with almost all of his ''Rolling Stone'' pieces.\n\nStarting in about 1980, Thompson became more reclusive. Aside from paid appearances, he largely retreated to his compound in Woody Creek, rejecting projects and assignments or failing to complete them. Despite a lack of new material, Wenner kept Thompson on the ''Rolling Stone'' [[Masthead (American publishing)|masthead]] as chief of the \"National Affairs Desk\", a position he would hold until his death.\n\nIn 1980, Thompson divorced wife Sandra Conklin. The same year marked the release of ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'', a loose film adaptation based on Thompson's early 1970s work, starring [[Bill Murray]] as the writer. Murray eventually became one of Thompson's trusted friends. Later that year Thompson relocated to [[Hawaii]] to research and write, ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', a Gonzo-style account of the 1980 [[Honolulu Marathon]]. Extensively illustrated by [[Ralph Steadman]], the piece first appeared in ''Running'' in 1981 as \"The Charge of the Weird Brigade\" and was later excerpted in ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1983.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gonzo.org/books/cl/ |title=The Great Thompson Hunt&nbsp;\u2014 Books&nbsp;\u2014 The Curse of Lono |publisher=Gonzo.org |date= |accessdate=July 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, he covered the [[Invasion of Grenada|U.S. invasion of Grenada]] but didn't write or discuss the experiences until the publication of ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear]]'' in 2003. Later that year, at the behest of [[Terry McDonell]], he wrote \"A Dog Took My Place\", an expos\u00e9 for ''Rolling Stone'' of the scandalous [[Roxanne Pulitzer]] divorce case and what he called the \"[[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]] lifestyle\". The story included dubious insinuations of [[bestiality]] but was widely considered to be a return by Thompson to his proper form. In 1985 Thompson accepted an advance to write about \"couples pornography\" for ''Playboy''. As part of his research, he spent evenings at the [[Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre]] [[striptease club]] in San Francisco. The experience evolved into an as-yet-unpublished novel tentatively entitled ''The Night Manager''.\n\n[[File:Hst-by-rsexton-longbeach-5-1989-2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hunter S.

Rather than traveling the campaign trail as he had done in previous presidential elections, Thompson monitored the proceedings on cable television; ''Better Than Sex: Confessions of a Political Junkie'', his account of the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential]] campaign, is composed of reactive faxes to ''Rolling Stone''. In 1994, the magazine published \"He Was a Crook,\" a \"scathing\" obituary of Richard Nixon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1994/07/he-was-a-crook/308699/|title=He Was a Crook|first=Hunter S.|last=Thompson|date=June 17, 1994|website=The Atlantic}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2004, ''Rolling Stone'' published Thompson's final magazine feature \"The Fun-Hogs in the Passing Lane: Fear and Loathing, Campaign 2004\", a brief account of the 2004 presidential election in which he compared the outcome of the ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'' court case to the [[Reichstag fire]] and formally endorsed [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]], a longtime friend, for president.\n\n===''Fear and Loathing'' redux===\nThompson's work gained renewed attention with the release of the film ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''. New editions of the book were published, introducing Thompson's work to a new generation of readers. The same year, an early novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was published, as were the two volumes of collected letters.\n\nThompson's next, and penultimate, collection, ''[[Kingdom of Fear (book)|Kingdom of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of a Star-Crossed Child In the Final Days of the American Century]]'', was widely publicized as Thompson's first memoir. Published in 2003, it combined new material (including reminiscences of the O'Farrell Theater), selected newspaper and digital clippings, and other older works.\n\nThompson finished his journalism career in the same way it had begun: Writing about sports. From 2000 until his death in 2005, he wrote a weekly column for [[ESPN]].com's [[Page 2]] entitled \"Hey, Rube.\" In 2004 [[Simon & Schuster]] collected some of the columns from the first few years and released it in mid-2004 as ''[[Hey Rube (book)|Hey Rube: Blood Sport, the Bush Doctrine, and the Downward Spiral of Dumbness]]''.\n\nThompson married assistant Anita Bejmuk on April 23, 2003.\n\n==Death==\nAt 5:42&nbsp;p.m. on February 20, 2005, Thompson died from a [[suicide|self-inflicted]] gunshot wound to the head at Owl Farm, his \"fortified compound\" in [[Woody Creek, Colorado]]. His son Juan, daughter-in-law Jennifer, and grandson were visiting for the weekend. His wife Anita, who was at the Aspen Club, was on the phone with him as he cocked the gun. According to the ''Aspen Daily News'', Thompson asked her to come home to help him write his ESPN column, then set the receiver on the counter. Anita said she mistook the cocking of the gun for the sound of his typewriter keys and hung up as he fired. Will and Jennifer were in the next room when they heard the gunshot, but mistook the sound for a book falling and did not check on Thompson immediately. Juan Thompson found his father's body. According to the police report and Anita's cell phone records,<ref>{{cite web|title=Combined Records Department\u2014Law Incident Table|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/citizen-thompson|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=March 2, 2005}}</ref> he called the sheriff's office half an hour later, then walked outside and fired three shotgun blasts into the air to \"mark the passing of his father\".

He was also upset over his advancing age and chronic medical problems, including a hip replacement; he would frequently mutter \"This kid is getting old.\" ''Rolling Stone'' published what Doug Brinkley described as a [[suicide note]] written by Thompson to his wife, titled \"Football Season Is Over\". It read:\n\n{{quote|No More Games. No More Bombs. No More Walking. No More Fun. No More Swimming. 67. That is 17 years past 50. 17 more than I needed or wanted. Boring. I am always bitchy.

The plans for the monument were initially drawn by Thompson and Steadman, and were shown as part of an ''[[Omnibus (UK TV series)|Omnibus]]'' program on the [[BBC]] titled ''[[Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood|Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision]]'' (1978). It is included as a special feature on the second disc of the 2004 [[Criterion Collection]] DVD release of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', and labeled as ''Fear and Loathing on the Road to Hollywood''.\n\nAccording to his widow, Anita, the $3 million funeral was funded by actor [[Johnny Depp]], who was a close friend of Thompson. Depp told the ''[[Associated Press]]'', \"All I'm doing is trying to make sure his last wish comes true. I just want to send my pal out the way he wants to go out.\"<ref name=\"editorandpublisher1\"/> An estimated 280 people attended, including [[United States Senate|U.S. Senators]] John Kerry<ref name=\"Brooks\">Patricia Brooks, Jonathan Brooks, ''Laid to Rest in California: A Guide to the Cemeteries and Grave SItes of the Rich and Famous'' (2006), p. 321.</ref> and [[George McGovern]];<ref name=\"Brooks\"/> ''[[60 Minutes]]'' correspondents [[Ed Bradley]] and [[Charlie Rose]]; actors [[Jack Nicholson]], [[John Cusack]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Sean Penn]], and [[Josh Hartnett]]; musicians [[Lyle Lovett]], [[John Oates]] and [[David Amram]], and artist and long-time friend [[Ralph Steadman]].\n\n==Legacy==\n===Writing style===\n{{Main|Gonzo journalism}}\nThompson is often credited as the creator of Gonzo journalism, a style of writing that blurs distinctions between fiction and nonfiction. His work and style are considered to be a major part of the [[New Journalism]] literary movement of the 1960s and 1970s, which attempted to break free from the purely objective style of mainstream reportage of the time. Thompson almost always wrote in the [[first person narrative|first person]], while extensively using his own experiences and emotions to color \"the story\" he was trying to follow.\n\nDespite him having personally described his work as \"Gonzo\", it fell to later observers to articulate what the term actually meant. While Thompson's approach clearly involved injecting himself as a participant in the events of the narrative, it also involved adding invented, metaphoric elements, thus creating, for the uninitiated reader, a seemingly confusing amalgam of facts and fiction notable for the deliberately blurred lines between one and the other. Thompson, in a 1974 interview in ''[[Playboy]]'' addressed the issue himself, saying \"Unlike Tom Wolfe or Gay Talese, I almost never try to reconstruct a story. They're both much better reporters than I am, but then, I don't think of myself as a reporter.\" [[Tom Wolfe]] would later describe Thompson's style as \"...&nbsp;part journalism and part personal memoir admixed with powers of wild invention and wilder rhetoric.\"<ref name=\"wolfetom\">{{cite news|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=As Gonzo in Life as in His Work|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050222142331/http://www.opinionjournal.com/la/?id=110006325 |archivedate=February 22, 2005|accessdate=August 3, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=February 22, 2005}}</ref> Or as one description of the differences between Thompson and Wolfe's styles would elaborate, \"While Tom Wolfe mastered the technique of being a fly on the wall, Thompson mastered the art of being a [[fly in the ointment]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl/9780345396358.html |title=Better Than Sex by Hunter S. Thompson \u2013 Trade Paperback |publisher=Random House |date=August 22, 1995 |accessdate=July 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe majority of Thompson's most popular and acclaimed work appeared within the pages of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine. Along with [[Joe Eszterhas]] and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding the focus of the magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always peppered with a wide array of pop music references ranging from [[Howlin' Wolf]] to [[Lou Reed]]. Armed with early [[fax]] machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.\n\nRobert Love, Thompson's editor of 23 years at ''Rolling Stone'', wrote that \"the dividing line between fact and fancy rarely blurred, and we didn't always use italics or some other typographical device to indicate the lurch into the fabulous. But if there were living, identifiable humans in a scene, we took certain steps&nbsp;... Hunter was a close friend of many prominent Democrats, veterans of the ten or more presidential campaigns he covered, so when in doubt, we'd call the press secretary. 'People will believe almost any twisted kind of story about politicians or Washington,' he once said, and he was right.\"\n\nDiscerning the line between the fact and the fiction of Thompson's work presented a practical problem for editors and fact-checkers of his work. Love called fact-checking Thompson's work \"one of the sketchiest occupations ever created in the publishing world\", and \"for the first-timer&nbsp;... a trip through a journalistic fun house, where you didn't know what was real and what wasn't. You knew you had better learn enough about the subject at hand to know when the riff began and reality ended. Hunter was a stickler for numbers, for details like gross weight and model numbers, for lyrics and [[caliber]], and there was no faking it.\"<ref name=\"love-cjr\">Love, Robert.

Fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor.\n\nIn the late sixties, Thompson acquired the [[Honorary degree|title of]] \"Doctor\" from the [[Universal Life Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universallifechurchministers.org/hunter-thompson/|title=Hunter Thompson|publisher=Universal Life Church|access-date=25 March 2018|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nA number of critics have commented that as he grew older the line that distinguished Thompson from his literary self became increasingly blurred.<ref>{{cite news|author=Cohen, Rich|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/17/books/review/17COHENRE.html?pagewanted=print&position=|title=''Gonzo Nights''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 17, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hunter S.

Steadman and Thompson developed a close friendship, and often traveled together. Though his illustrations occur in most of Thompson's books, they are conspicuously featured in full-page color in Thompson's ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', set in Hawaii.\n\n===Photography===\nThompson was an avid amateur photographer throughout his life and his photos have been exhibited since his death at art galleries in the United States and United Kingdom. In late 2006, AMMO Books published a limited-edition 224-page collection of Thompson photos called ''Gonzo: Photographs by Hunter S. Thompson'', with an introduction by Johnny Depp. Thompson's snapshots were a combination of the subjects he was covering, stylized self-portraits, and artistic [[still life]] photos. The ''[[London Observer]]'' called the photos \"astonishingly good\" and noted that \"Thompson's pictures remind us, brilliantly in every sense, of very real people, real colours.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Ferguson|first=Euan|title=Hunter gets captured by the frame|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/feb/04/photography.features|newspaper=The Observer|accessdate=August 3, 2012|date=February 3, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Feature films===\nThe film ''[[Where the Buffalo Roam]]'' (1980) depicts heavily fictionalized attempts by Thompson to cover the [[Super Bowl]] and the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 U.S. presidential election]]. It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Thompson and [[Peter Boyle]] as Thompson's attorney [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], referred to in the movie as Carl Lazlo, Esq.\n\n[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|The 1998 film adaptation]] of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' was directed by [[Monty Python]] veteran [[Terry Gilliam]] and starred [[Johnny Depp]] (who moved into Thompson's basement to \"study\" Thompson's persona before assuming his role in the film) as [[Raoul Duke]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] as [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]]. The film has achieved something of a [[cult film|cult following]].\n\nIn the 2001 film ''[[Ali (film)|Ali]]'', Thompson is briefly portrayed by actor Lee Cummings.\n\n[[The Rum Diary (film)|The film adaptation]] of Thompson's novel ''[[The Rum Diary (novel)|The Rum Diary]]'' was released in October 2011, also starring Johnny Depp as the main character, Paul Kemp. The novel's premise was inspired by Thompson's own experiences in Puerto Rico. The film was written and directed by [[Bruce Robinson]].\n\nAt a press junket for ''The Rum Diary'' shortly before the film's release, Depp said that he would like to adapt ''[[The Curse of Lono]]'', \"[[The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved]]\", and ''[[Hell's Angels: The Strange and Terrible Saga of the Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs|Hell's Angels]]'' for the big screen: \"I'd just keep playing Hunter. There's a great comfort in it for me, because I get a great visit with my old friend who I miss dearly.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=mryan |url=http://www.movieline.com/2011/10/johnny-depp-bruce-robinson-and-co-exalt-hunter-s-thompson-while-talking-the-rum-diary.php |title=Johnny Depp, Bruce Robinson, and Co.

It can be found on disc 2 of [[The Criterion Collection]] edition of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.\n\nThe [[Mitchell brothers]], owners of the O'Farrell Theatre in San Francisco, made a documentary about Thompson in 1988 called ''Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die''.\n\n[[Wayne Ewing]] created three documentaries about Thompson. The film ''[[Breakfast with Hunter]]'' (2003) was directed and edited by Ewing. It documents Thompson's work on the movie ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'', his arrest for [[drunk driving]], and his subsequent fight with the court system. ''When I Die'' (2005) is a video chronicle of making Thompson's final farewell wishes a reality, and documents the send-off itself. ''Free Lisl: Fear and Loathing in Denver'' (2006) chronicles Thompson's efforts in helping to free Lisl Auman, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the shooting of a police officer, a crime she didn't commit. All three films are only available online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hunterthompsonfilms.com/ |title=Hunter Thompson Films |publisher=Hunter Thompson Films |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105063358/http://www.hunterthompsonfilms.com/ |archive-date=November 5, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn ''Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manifestation.tv/ |title=Manifestation.tv |publisher=Manifestation.tv |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050827071356/http://www.manifestation.tv/ |archive-date=August 27, 2005 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> (2004) Thompson gives director Adamm Liley insight into the nature of the American Dream over drinks at the Woody Creek Tavern.\n\n''[[Buy the Ticket, Take the Ride: Hunter S. Thompson on Film]]'' (2006) was directed by [[Tom Thurman]], written by Tom Marksbury, and produced by the [[Starz Entertainment Group]]. The original documentary features interviews with Thompson's inner circle of family and friends, but the thrust of the film focuses on the manner in which his life often overlapped with numerous Hollywood celebrities who became his close friends, such as Johnny Depp, [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Bill Murray]], [[Sean Penn]], [[John Cusack]], Thompson's wife Anita, son Juan, former Senators [[George McGovern]] and [[Gary Hart]], writers [[Tom Wolfe]] and [[William F. Buckley, Jr.|William F. Buckley]], actors [[Gary Busey]] and [[Harry Dean Stanton]], and the illustrator [[Ralph Steadman]] among others.\n\n''Blasted!!! The Gonzo Patriots of Hunter S. Thompson'' (2006), produced, directed, photographed and edited by Blue Kraning, is a documentary about the scores of fans who volunteered their privately owned artillery to fire the ashes of the late author, Hunter S. Thompson. ''Blasted!!!'' premiered at the 2006 Starz Denver International Film Festival, part of a tribute series to Hunter S. Thompson held at the Denver Press Club.\n\nIn 2008, [[Academy Award]]-winning documentarian [[Alex Gibney]] (''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'', ''[[Taxi to the Dark Side]]'') wrote and directed a documentary on Thompson, titled ''[[Gonzo: The Life and Work of Dr. Hunter S. Thompson]]''. The film premiered on January 20, 2008, at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. Gibney uses intimate, never-before-seen home videos, interviews with friends, enemies and lovers, and clips from films adapted from Thompson's material to document his turbulent life.\n\n===Theater===\nLou Stein's adaptation of ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' was performed at the Battersea Theatre. Stein persuades London's ''Time Out'' magazine to put Thompson up for a fortnight, in exchange for him writing a cover story to publicize the play. Thompson doesn't write the story, but does rampage around London on ''Time Out'' 's expense account. The play was revived for the Vault Fringe Festival in 2014.\n\n''GONZO: A Brutal Chrysalis'' is a one-man show about Thompson written by Paul Addis, who also played the author. Set in the writing den of Thompson's Woody Creek home, the show portrays his life between 1968 and 1971. James Cartee began playing the role soon after Addis's arrest in 2009, and again after Addis's death in 2012.\n\n===Awards, accolades and tributes===\n* Thompson was named a [[Kentucky colonel]] by the Governor of [[Kentucky]] in a December 1996 tribute ceremony where he also received keys to the city of Louisville.<ref>{{cite web|author=Whitehead, Ron|title=''Hunter S.

Between March 7, 2005 (roughly two weeks after Thompson's suicide) and March 12, 2005, ''Doonesbury'' ran a tribute to Hunter, with Uncle Duke lamenting the death of the man he called his \"inspiration\". The first of these strips featured a panel with artwork similar to that of [[Ralph Steadman]], and later strips featured various [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non-sequiturs]] (with Duke variously transforming into a monster, melting, shrinking to the size of an empty drinking glass, or people around him turning into animals) which seemed to mirror some of the effects of hallucinogenic drugs described in ''Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas''.\n* General Hunter Gathers in the [[Adult Swim]] animated series ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' is a tribute to Thompson and derives his physical appearance from him.\n* Dale Gribble in the [[Fox]] animated series ''[[King of the Hill]]'' is a tribute to Thompson and derives his physical appearance from him.\n*In the Cameron Crowe film \"Almost Famous\", based on Crowe's experiences writing for Rolling Stone magazine while on the road with the fictional band \"Stillwater\", the writer is on the phone with an actor portraying Jaan Wenner.  Wenner tells the young journalist that he \"is not there to join the party, we already have one Hunter Thompson\" after the young writer amassed large hotel and traveling expenses and is overheard to be sharing his room with several young women.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q219780|n=no|b=no|v=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|wikt=no|s=no}}\n* {{cite journal| url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/619/the-art-of-journalism-no-1-hunter-s-thompson| title=Hunter S.

There are four films in the franchise-\u2013''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' (2010), ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'' (2013), ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'' (2015), and ''[[Insidious: The Last Key]]'' (2018)--which have grossed a total of $539{{nbsp}}million worldwide on a combined budget of $26.5{{nbsp}}million.\n\nThe first two films were directed by Wan, the third by Whannell, who also served as the screenwriter for all four films. [[Adam Robitel]] directed the fourth installment. [[FilmDistrict]] released the first and second films, while [[Focus Features]] and [[Universal Pictures]] handled the third and fourth, respectively.\n\nThe first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an [[astral plane]], are continuously haunted by demons of a hellish realm known as ''the Further'' until they take from the family what they want most: life. The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic who helped the family; this time she comes to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead, and the fourth follows her when her own family becomes haunted. All plots are depicted as case files of [[demonologist]]s.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Insidious'' (2010)===\n{{main article|Insidious (film)}}\n\n''Insidious'' was directed by [[James Wan|Wan]], written by [[Leigh Whannell|Whannell]], and starred [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]] and [[Barbara Hershey]].

A sequel, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'', was released on September 13, 2013, with Wan returning as director and Whannell returning as screenwriter. The film's success led to it being used as inspiration for a maze in Universal's 2013 [[Halloween Horror Nights]].\n\n===''Insidious: Chapter 2'' (2013)===\n{{main article|Insidious: Chapter 2}}\n\n''Insidious: Chapter 2'' was also directed by Wan and written by Whannell.

I haven't really thought about it yet. But for the purposes of this interview, I'll say that I'd like to explore the time between this film and the first film. That whole area there where Elise has rediscovered her gift, I think you could have a lot of adventures before she arrives. So I think there is a lot of room there.

[[Adam Robitel]] directed the fourth installment. [[FilmDistrict]] released the first and second films, while [[Focus Features]] and [[Universal Pictures]] handled the third and fourth, respectively.\n\nThe first two films center on a couple who, after their son mysteriously enters a comatose state and becomes a vessel for ghosts in an [[astral plane]], are continuously haunted by demons of a hellish realm known as ''the Further'' until they take from the family what they want most: life. The third film, a prequel, focuses on the same psychic who helped the family; this time she comes to the aid of a young girl who calls out to the dead, and the fourth follows her when her own family becomes haunted. All plots are depicted as case files of [[demonologist]]s.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Insidious'' (2010)===\n{{main article|Insidious (film)}}\n\n''Insidious'' was directed by [[James Wan|Wan]], written by [[Leigh Whannell|Whannell]], and starred [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]] and [[Barbara Hershey]].

A sequel, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 2]]'', was released on September 13, 2013, with Wan returning as director and Whannell returning as screenwriter.

Air is allowed into the room through a gap under the door (typically about one half-inch high).

Commonly it is exhausted out the roof of the building. However, in some cases, such as with highly infections microorganisms in [[biosafety level 4]] rooms, the air must first be mechanically filtered or disinfected by ultraviolet irradiation or chemical means before being released to the surrounding outdoor environment. In the case of nuclear facilities the air is monitored for the presence of radioactive isotopes and usually filtered before being exhausted through a tall exhaust duct to be released higher in the air away from occupied spaces.\n\n==Monitoring and guidelines==\nIn 2003, the CDC published guidelines on infection control, which included recommendations regarding negative pressure isolation rooms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/environmental/background/air.html|title=Guidelines for Environmental Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities|last=CDC|first=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=2003|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref>. Still absent from the CDC are recommendations of acute negative pressure isolation room monitoring. This has led to hospitals developing their own policies, such as the Cleveland Clinic. Commonly used methods for acute monitoring include the smoke or tissue test and periodic (noncontinuous) or continuous electronic pressure monitoring.\n\n====== Smoke/tissue test ======\nUses smoke or tissue paper to assess room pressurization. A capsule of smoke or a tissue is placed near the bottom of the door, if the smoke or tissue is pulled under the door, the room is negatively pressurized. The advantages of this test are that it is cost efficient and easily performed by hospital staff. The disadvantages are that it is not a continuous test and that it doesn't measure magnitude. Without a measure for magnitude, isolation rooms may be under or over pressurized, even though the smoke/tissue test is positive. A 1994 CDC recommendation stated TB isolation rooms should be checked daily for negative pressure while being used for TB isolation. If these rooms are not being used for patients who have suspected or confirmed TB but potentially could be used for such patients, the negative pressure in the rooms should be checked monthly .\n\n====== Continuous electronic pressure monitoring ======\nUses an electronic device with a pressure port in the isolation room and an isolation port in the corridor to continuously monitor the pressure differential between the spaces. The advantages of this type of monitoring are that the test is continuous and an alarm will alert staff to undesirable pressure changes. The disadvantages of this monitoring are that pressure ports can become contaminated with particulates which can lead to inaccuracy and false alarms, the devices are expensive to purchase and install, and staff must be trained to use and calibrate these devices because he pressure differentials used to achieve the low negative pressure necessitate the use of very sensitive mechanical devices, electronic devices, or pressure gauges to ensure accurate measurements .\n\n==See also==\n* [[Positive_pressure|Positive room pressure]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Medical hygiene]]\n[[Category:Infectious diseases]]\n[[Category:Pressure]]\n[[Category:Negative concepts]]\n", "text_old": "[[File: Negative Air Pressure.png|thumb|300px|The internal air is forced out so that negative air pressure is created pulling air passively into the system from other inlets.]]\n[[File:Beth-El Industries Isolation chamber inside view.jpg|thumb|Inside view of a negative pressure isolation chamber for patients with contagious diseases.]]\n'''Negative room pressure''' is an [[Isolation (health care)|isolation]] technique used in [[hospital]]s and medical centers to prevent cross-contamination from room to room.<ref name=\"camil\">[http://www.filterair.info/articles/article.cfm/ArticleID/BC9AA829-30F8-4406-8FEE4A1E17574D6B/Page/1 Negative Room Pressure to Prevent Cross-Contamination], Clean Air Solutions, Camil Farr, {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310214345/http://www.filterair.info/articles/article.cfm/ArticleID/BC9AA829-30F8-4406-8FEE4A1E17574D6B/Page/1 |date=2016-03-10 }}Retrieved 2010-03-10.</ref><ref>[http://www.engr.psu.edu/AE/iec/abe/control/isolation.asp Isolation Rooms & Pressurization Control] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304130200/http://www.engr.psu.edu/AE/iec/abe/control/isolation.asp |date=2010-03-04 }}, Penn State Department of Architectural Engineering, \u00a9 2008 The Pennsylvania State University.
