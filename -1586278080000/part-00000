A non-rigid airship that uses heated air instead of a light gas (such as helium) as a lifting medium is called a [[thermal airship|hot-air airship]] (sometimes there are [[batten]]s near the bow, which assist with higher forces there from a mooring attachment or from the greater aerodynamic pressures there).\n\nVolume changes of the lifting gas due to temperature changes or to changes of altitude are compensated for by pumping air into internal [[ballonet]]s (air bags) to maintain the overpressure. Without sufficient overpressure, the blimp loses its ability to be steered and is slowed due to increased drag and distortion. The propeller [[air stream]] can be used to inflate the ballonets and so the hull. In some models, such as the [[Skyship 600]], differential ballonet inflation can provide a measure of [[Flight dynamics|pitch trim]] control.\n\nThe engines driving the propellers are usually directly attached to the gondola, and in some models are partly steerable.\n\nBlimps are the most commonly built airships because they are relatively easy to build and easy to transport once deflated. However, because of their unstable hull, their size is limited. A blimp with too long a hull [[Hogging and sagging|may kink in the middle]] when the overpressure is insufficient or when maneuvered too fast (this has also happened with semi-rigid airships with weak keels). This led to the development of [[semi-rigid airship|semi-rigid]]s and [[rigid airship]]s.\n\nModern blimps are launched somewhat heavier than air (overweight), in contrast to historic blimps. The missing lift is provided by lifting the nose and using engine power, or by angling the engine thrust. Some types also use steerable propellers or [[ducted fan]]s. Operating in a state heavier than air avoids the need to dump [[buoyancy compensator (aviation)|ballast]] at lift-off and also avoids the need to lose costly helium lifting gas on landing (most of the [[Zeppelin]]s achieved lift with very inexpensive hydrogen, which could be vented without concern to decrease altitude).\n<!-- maybe hot-air and remote controlled unmanned blimps could be expanded here? -->\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Blank ship in Flight.JPG|thumb|right|upright|A modern blimp from [[Airship Management Services]] showing a strengthened nose, ducted fans attached to the gondola under the hull, and cable-braced fins at the tail]]\n\nThe origin of the word \"blimp\" has been the subject of some confusion.

In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months.

The master plan of the CDA was characterized by mixed land-use with more than 25% of the total land area for residential purposes and more than 32% for software industries. Along with residential and software industries, the CDA includes Indian School of Business, University of Hyderabad, the Indian Institute of Information Technology, a sports complex and a golf course.

In 1898, the British introduced coffee to the [[East Godavari]] district in [[Pamuluru]] before it spread to Araku in the early 19th century. After independence, the [[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]] took up coffee plantations in the valley and by 1956, the [[Coffee Board of India]] appointed Girijan Cooperative Corporation (GCC) for its promotion through local tribal farmers. In a significant development, the Naidu Government and [[SpiceJet]], the third largest airline in the country by number of domestic passengers carried, came forward to serve the organic brew of Araku to its passengers. SpiceJet air hostesses would make special announcements about the brand and its significance, and about the coffee plantations in Araku Valley. To increase visits to tourist places located around Araku Valley, a scheme of scratch cards was introduced. Cards would be given to every passenger and two passengers, with their families, would receive free accommodation in Araku Valley and the tourism department would pay to the airline towards promotion of Araku Coffee for three months. The brand became so popular and exotic that Naidu gifted them to Korean and Russian delegates during their visits and the coffee was marketed in all the international investor meetings organized by the state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/Naidu-markets-Araku-coffee-at-womens-meet/articleshow/51893052.cms|title=Naidu markets Araku coffee at women's meet|date=19 April 2016 |work=The Times of India|language=en|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yovizag.com/araku-coffee-exotic-brand/|title=Coffee From Araku - Our Very Own Exotic Brand |date=27 May 2017|website=Yo Vizag|language=en-US|access-date=16 March 2020}}</ref> Naidu once said that Araku Valley\u2019s tribal coffee is competing with Columbian and Sumatran coffee in the international market.
