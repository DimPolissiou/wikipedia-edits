The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

Between 50 and 100 [[mercenaries]] of various nationalities were initially present,{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=384}} but over the course of 1961 the Katangese government increased recruitment efforts.

Approximately 5,000 troops were earmarked for the operation, which focused on a northward offensive from Lubudi. At the same time, they were to recapture the town of [[Manono, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Manono]], secure the area south of it, and launch attacks on [[Kabalo]] from [[Kalemie|Albertville]] to the east and [[Kongolo, Tanganyika|Kongolo]] to the north.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}} The Katangese Gendarmerie subsequently launched operations Banquise, Mambo, and Lotus against the BALUBAKAT rebels.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=47\u201349}} In March the army seized Manono.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}\n\nThe Gendarmerie then shifted their focus to Kabalo, where they chiefly intended to secure the railway.{{sfn|Higgins|1980|p=417}} The town was garrisoned by two companies of an Ethiopian battalion serving with ONUC.{{sfn|Lefever|Joshua|1966|p=P-16}}{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} On 7 April a Katangese plane carrying 30 mercenaries landed to secure the airstrip in the town but they were promptly arrested by the ONUC troops.{{sfn|Puren|Pottinger|1986|p=30}} Katangese forces moving by land attacked ONUC soldiers and fought with BALUBAKAT partisans.

Such efforts largely failed.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=50}}\n\nAfter being pressured by the United States and United Nations, Belgium removed many of its forces from the region from August to September 1961. However, many officers remained, without official Belgian support, or became mercenaries. To support these efforts, Belgium organized hundreds of Europeans to fight with Katanga. At the same time the United Nations attempted to suppress foreign support to the Gendarmerie; 338 mercenaries and 443 political advisers were expelled from the region by August. That same month, war veterans were first [[Military awards and decorations|honored]]. Dead soldiers were also remembered in ceremonies at the [[Sts.

Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963.

Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities.

The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes led by Schramme were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes.

The forces were formed upon the secession of Katanga from the [[Republic of the Congo]] with help from [[Belgian army|Belgian soldiers]] and former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]''. Belgian troops also provided much of the early training for the Gendarmerie, which was mainly composed of Katangese but largely led by Belgians and later European mercenaries. \n\nThroughout the existence of the State of Katanga, the gendarmes sporadically fought various tribes and the [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC). In February 1961 the Gendarmerie initiated a series of operations aimed at suppressing anti-secessionist rebels of the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) in North Katanga. The campaign was largely successful, but the fighting led to atrocities and gendarmes were halted by forces of the [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) during the [[Battle of Kabalo]] in April 1961. ONUC then initiated efforts to remove foreign mercenaries from the Gendarmerie, and launched [[Operation Rum Punch]] to arrest them in August 1961. They came into conflict with ONUC three times after, in [[Operation Morthor]] (September 1961), [[Operation UNOKAT]] (December 1961), and [[Operation Grandslam]] (December 1962). Operation Grandslam marked the end of the Katangese secession in January 1963. \n\nAfter the secession, many gendarmes returned to a civilian live or were integrated with the ANC. However, around 8,000 refused to, and many kept their arms and roamed  [[North Rhodesia]], Angola and Katanga. Many crossed the Congo border into Angola, where Portuguese colonial authorities assisted and trained them. They were involved in several mutinies and attempted invasions of the Congo, most notably the [[Stanleyville mutinies]] in 1966 and 1967. \n\nAfter 1967, around 2,500 gendarmes were present in Angola, where they were reorganized as the [[Congolese National Liberation Front]] (FLNC) and fought in the [[Angolan War of Independence]] on the side of the Portuguese government against the [[Movimento Popular de Liberta\u00e7\u00e3o de Angola]] (MPLA) and [[Uni\u00e3o Nacional para a Independ\u00eancia Total de Angola]] (UNITA). When the war ended in 1975, they fought in the [[Angolan Civil War]] against the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA).  The FLNC was involved in [[Shaba I]] and [[Shaba II|II]], attempted invasions of Katanga. Split into factions after the war, the [[Katangese Tigers|Tigres]] emerged and played a decisive role in the [[First Congo War]]. There has since been little gendarme presence, but they have emerged as a symbol of secessionist thinking\n\n== Origins ==\n\n=== Background ===\n{{Main|Congo Crisis}}\n[[File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kongo_1961_map_en.png|left|thumb|Map of the Congo with the State of Katanga in green]]\nThe [[Belgian Congo]] was established from the [[Congo Free State]] in 1908.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wdl.org/en/item/11900/|title=Belgian Congo|last=|first=|date=1920|website=World Digital Library|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> [[Belgium]] held control of the colony until it gained independence as the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] on June 30, 1960.

At a press conference, Adoula accepted Tshombe's proposition and announced that what remained of the Katangese Gendarmerie would be integrated into the ANC.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} Total statistics on Katangese Gendarmerie and mercenary casualties from Operation Grandslam are unknown. Following the operation the UN was able to confirm that Portuguese Angola, South Africa, and Northern Rhodesia had assisted the Katangese in arming their air force.{{sfn|Dorn|2016|p=32}}\n\n=== Exile, return, and the Simba rebellion ===\n{{Further|Simba rebellion}}\nAfter the defeat of the State of Katanga, plans to disarm or integrate the gendarmes were made. On 8 February 1963, General Muk\u00e9 and several of his officers pledged their allegiance to President Kasa-Vubu.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=63}} However, of the estimated 14,000\u201317,000 gendarmes, only 3,500 registered for integration, and only around 2,000\u20133,000 became part of the ANC. Those who integrated suffered threats and violence, and were given lower ranks. An estimated 7,000 returned to civilian life, and a further 8,000 escaped disarmament. Of the 8,000, some found work in security, and thousands of others were reported to be roaming \"in the bush in South Katanga\". Many could not return to their homes, and were considered outcasts. Further United Nations efforts at reconciliation were ended as the United Nations focused on withdrawing its own forces from the region in December 1963. The ANC began raiding pro-secession communities, as gendarmes continued to roam North Rhodesia, Angola and Katanga.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nThroughout 1963 gendarmes steadily crossed into Angola. Portuguese colonial authorities, eager to assist the anticommunist Katangese, organised them in \"refugee\" camps. By 1964, two of the four camps had become dedicated training facilities. Mercenaries traveled from Katanga to Angola via Rhodesia to relay messages between Tshombe, the gendarmes, and the mercenaries, with logistical support from [[Southern Rhodesia]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=67}} Around April, Tshombe appeared to have remobilised his forces.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=68}} Immediately after becoming Prime Minister in July, he ordered the exiled Katangese to return to the Congo and mobilised some of those that had been in hiding so that they could suppress the [[Kwilu rebellion|Kwilu]] and [[Simba rebellion|Simba rebels]].{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=69}} They were used successfully against both insurgencies, and, following Tshombe's ousting from power, they retained significant political distance from Mobutu's regime. Relations between the two parties quickly worsened, culminating in [[Stanleyville mutinies|a bloody mutiny]] in July 1966.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|p=75}}\n\nA March 1967 trial of Tshombe ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' criminalized the actions of the gendarmes retrospectively. After the trial, the gendarmes were referred to as 'mercenaries' by Congolese press. A [[Stanleyville mutinies#Second mutiny|second wave of mutinies]] broke out on July 5, 1967 in [[Bukavu]] and Kisangani (formerly Stanleyville), after Tshombe's plane was hijacked and he was detained in [[Algiers]]. The mutinies were led by European mercenaries. An estimated 600 former gendarmes led by Schramme were present in Kisangani during the mutiny. Under pressure from the ANC, Schramme was forced to evacuate the city with 300 mercenaries and a few thousand gendarmes. They reached Bukavu, and a secessionist state was declared.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}<ref>{{Cite news|last=Tanner|first=Henry|url=|title=Congo: The Revolt That Failed|date=July 23, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> A plan was proposed by the [[International Red Cross]] to evacuate 950 gendarmes and around 650 of their dependents to [[Zambia]]. Schramme and Mobutu objected, and the plan did not go forward. Tough the ANC continued fighting, around 900 gendarmes gave up their arms and crossed into Rwanda. At the end of the mutinies, the gendarmes agreed to a cease-fire proposed by [[Diallo Telli]] under which they could gain amnesty by returning to the Congo. The mercenaries were expelled from Africa and returned to Europe.{{sfn|Kennes|Larmer|2016|pp=77\u201378}}{{Sfn|Arnold|1999|p=15}}\n\nA brief rebellion was executed by [[Bob Denard]] from November 1 to 5, 1967. Called \"Operation Luciver\", ex-gendarmes  crossed from Angola to Katanga and occupied Kisenge and Mutshatsha before being defeated by the ANC.
