Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Agrium]] and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\nPrior to [[History of Canada|colonization]], the area around what is now Fort Saskatchewan was a gathering place and home to a variety of different [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous]] nations, including the [[Cree|Cree (N\u00e9hinaw)]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Nakota]] nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskatchewanrecord.com/news/local-news/here-is-a-sneak-peek|title=Here is a sneak peek|last=January 31|first=Arthur Green Published on:|last2=January 31|first2=2019 {{!}} Last Updated:|date=2019-01-31|website=Fort Saskatchewan Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=Est|first3=2019 4:20 Pm}}</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the region commonly traveled the North Saskatchewan River by [[Canoe]].

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed both male and female offenders.  \n\nThe jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.

{"title_page": "Music of China", "text_new": "{{Short description|Cultural musical history}}{{Music of China}}\n\n'''Music of China''' refers to the music of the [[Chinese people]], which may be the music of the [[Han Chinese]] as well as other [[Ethnic groups in China|ethnic minorities]] within [[mainland China]]. It also includes music produced by people of Chinese origin in some territories outside mainland China using [[traditional Chinese instruments]] or in the [[Chinese language]]. It covers a highly diverse range of music from the traditional to the modern.\n\nDifferent types of music have been recorded in historical Chinese documents from the early periods of [[History of China|Chinese civilization]] which, together with archaeological artifacts discovered, provided evidence of a well-developed musical culture as early as the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1122 BC \u2013 256 BC). These further developed into various forms of music through succeeding dynasties, producing the rich heritage of music that is part of the Chinese cultural landscape today. Chinese music continues to evolve in the modern times, and more contemporary forms of music have also emerged. \n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Chinese music}}\n[[File:Shanghai Museum 2006 17-15.jpg|thumb|Lively musicians playing a bamboo flute and a plucked instrument, [[Chinese ceramics|Chinese ceramic]] statues from the [[Eastern Han]] period (25\u2013220 AD), [[Shanghai Museum]]]]\nAccording to legends, the founder of music in Chinese mythology was [[Ling Lun]] who, at the request of the [[Yellow Emperor]]  to create a system of music, made bamboo pipes tuned to the sounds of birds including the phoenix.  A [[Sh\u00ed-\u00e8r-l\u01dc|twelve-tone musical system]] was created based on the pitches of the bamboo pipes, the first of these pipes produced the \"yellow bell\" (\u9ec3\u9418) pitch, and a set of tuned bells were then created from the pipes.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/culturecustomsof00davi_0 |url-access=registration |title=Culture and Customs of Taiwan |author1=Gary Marvin Davison |author2=Barbara E.

The answer was that it only mattered that the ruler loved his subjects.\n\nIn ancient China the social status of musicians was much lower than that of painters, though music was seen as central to the harmony and longevity of the state. Almost every emperor took folk songs seriously, sending officers to collect songs to record the popular culture. One of the Confucianist Classics, The [[Classic of Poetry]], contained many folk songs dating from 800 BC to about 400 BC.\n\n===Qin to Qing dynasty===\n{{See also|Musicians in Ming China}}\n[[File:Paintings on north wall of Xu Xianxiu Tomb.jpg|thumb|260px|left|A mural from the tomb of Xu Xianxiu in [[Taiyuan]], [[Shanxi]] province, dated 571 AD during the [[Northern Qi Dynasty]], showing male court musicians playing stringed instruments, either the ''[[liuqin]]'' or ''[[pipa]]'', and a woman playing a ''[[konghou]]'' (harp)]]\n\nThe [[Music Bureau|Imperial Music Bureau]], first established in the [[Qin dynasty]] (221\u2013207 BC), was greatly expanded under the emperor [[Emperor Wu of Han|Han Wudi]] (140\u201387 BC) and charged with supervising court music and military music and determining what folk music would be officially recognized.

The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the [[Guqin|qin]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907AD), though the qin is known to have been played since before the Han dynasty. This is based on the conjecture that because the recorded examples of Chinese music are ceremonial, and the ceremonies in which they were employed are thought to have existed \"perhaps more than one thousand years before Christ\",{{sfn|Van Aalst|1884|loc=}}{{Page needed|date=October 2013}} the musical compositions themselves were performed, even in 1000 BC, in precisely the manner prescribed by the sources that were written down in the seventh century AD.

A wide variety of these instruments, such as [[guzheng]] and [[Dizi (instrument)|dizi]] are indigenous, although many popular traditional musical instruments were introduced from Central Asia, such as the [[erhu]] and [[pipa]].\n\nThe presence of European music in China appeared as early as 1601 when the Jesuit priest [[Matteo Ricci]] presented a [[Harpsichord]] to the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] imperial court, and trained four eunuchs to play it.<ref name=\"Jones\">Jones.

A number of Chinese musicians returned from studying abroad to perform Western [[classical music]], composing work hits on Western musical notation system. The [[Kuomintang]] tried to sponsor modern music adoptions via the [[Shanghai Conservatory of Music]] despite the ongoing political crisis. Twentieth-century cultural philosophers like [[Xiao Youmei]], [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Feng Zikai]] and Wang Guangqi wanted to see Chinese music adopted to the best standard possible. There were many different opinions regarding the best standard.<ref name=\"Jones\"/>\n\n[[Symphony orchestra]]s were formed in most major cities and performed to a wide audience in the concert halls and on [[radio]]. Many of the performers added [[jazz]] influences to traditional music, adding [[xylophone]]s, [[saxophone]]s and [[violin]]s, among other instruments. [[L\u00fc Wencheng]], Qui Hechou, [[Yin Zizhong]] and [[He Dasha]] were among the most notable performers and composers of this period.\n\nIn [[Shanghai]], a popular genre of music called ''[[shidaiqu]]'' emerged in the 1920s. ''Shidaiqu'' is a fusion of Chinese and Western popular music, and [[Li Jinhui]] is considered to be founder of the genre. Popular singers in this genre in the 1930s and 1940s included [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Yao Lee]].\n\nAfter the 1942 [[Yan'an Forum]] on Literature and Art, a large-scale campaign was launched in the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] controlled areas to adapt folk music to create revolutionary songs to educate the largely illiterate rural population on party goals. Musical forms considered superstitious or anti-revolutionary were repressed, and [[harmony|harmonies]] and bass lines were added to traditional songs. One example is [[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]], a folksong from northern [[Shaanxi]] which was adapted into a nationalist hymn. Of particular note is the composer, [[Xian Xinghai]], who was active during this period, and composed the [[Yellow River Cantata]] which is the most well-known of all of his works.\n\n=== 1949\u20131990s ===\n\nThe golden age of [[shidaiqu]] and the [[Seven great singing stars]] would come to an end when the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] denounced [[C-pop|Chinese popular music]] as [[Yellow Music|yellow music]] ([[pornography]]).<ref name= \"Broughton\">Broughton, Simon.

In 1949 the [[Kuomintang]] relocated to Taiwan, and the [[People's Republic of China]] was established. [[Guoyue|Revolutionary songs]] would become heavily promoted by the state. The [[Maoist]]s, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], pushed revolutionary music as the only acceptable genre; because of propaganda, this genre largely overshadowed all others and came almost to define mainland Chinese music. This is still, in some ways, an ongoing process, but some scholars and musicians (Chinese and otherwise) are trying to revive old music.\n\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], a new fast tempo [[Northwest Wind]] (xibeifeng, \u897f\u5317\u98a8) style was launched by protesters to counter the government. The music would progress into [[Chinese rock]], which remained popular in the 1990s. However, music in China is very much state-owned as the TV, media, and major concert halls are all controlled by the Communist party. The government mainly chose not to support Chinese rock by limiting its exposure and airtime. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}As a result, the genre never reached the mainstream in its entirety.\n\n=== 2000s\u2013present ===\n\nAnnual events such as the [[Midi Modern Music Festival]] in [[Beijing]] attracts tens of thousands of visitors. There was also the \"Snow Mountain Music Festival\" in [[Yunnan province]] 2002.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nToday, rock music is centered on almost exclusively in Beijing and Shanghai, and has very limited influence over Chinese society. [[Wuhan]] and [[Sichuan]] are sometimes considered pockets of rock music culture as well. It points to a significant cultural, political and social difference that exist between China, the West, or even different parts within China. While rock has existed in China for decades, the milestone that put the genre on the international map is when [[Cui Jian]] played with [[The Rolling Stones]] in 2003, at the age of 42. China has also become a destination of major Western rock and pop artists; many foreign acts have toured in China and performed in multiple concerts in recent decades, including [[Beyonce]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Avril Lavigne]], [[Linkin Park]] and [[Talib Kweli]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sisario|first=Ben|title=For All the Rock in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/arts/music/25sisa.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=2007-11-25}}</ref>\n\nMainland China has a high [[Copyright infringement|piracy]] rate along with issues of [[Intellectual property|intellectual properties]].<ref>BuildingIPvalue. \"[http://www.buildingipvalue.com/06AP/314_317.htm BuildingIPvalue].\" ''Recent developments in intellectual property.''

The [[Chinese musicology|scale]] is [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. [[Chinese flutes|Bamboo pipes]] and [[Guqin|qin]] are among the oldest known [[musical instrument]]s from [[China]]; instruments are traditionally divided into categories based on their material of composition: animal skins, gourd, bamboo, wood, silk, earth/clay, metal, and stone. [[Chinese orchestra]]s traditionally consist of [[String instrument|bowed strings]], [[woodwind]]s, [[Plucked string instrument|plucked strings]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].\n[[File:\u4e8c\u6cc9\u6620\u6708.ogg|right|thumb|The Moon reflecting in Erquan Pool, a masterpiece written for erhu by the blind composer Abing.]]\n[[File:Guqin-Zuiyu_Changwan.ogg|right|thumb|Zuiyu Changwan (The Evening Song of the Drunken Fisherman) for qin from the Tianwen Ge Qinpu (1876).]]\n:'''Instruments'''\n::* Woodwind\n:::[[dizi (instrument)|dizi]], [[xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[suona]], [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[paixiao]], [[guan (instrument)|guan]], [[hulusi]], [[bawu]], [[xun (instrument)|xun]]\n::* Percussion\n:::[[paigu]], [[gong]], [[bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bianzhong]], [[fangxiang]], [[paiban]], [[bianqing]]\n::* Bowed strings\n:::[[erhu]], [[zhonghu]], [[dahu (instrument)|dahu]], [[banhu]], [[jinghu (instrument)|jinghu]], [[gaohu]], [[gehu]], [[yehu]], [[cizhonghu]], [[diyingehu]], [[leiqin]]\n::* Plucked and struck strings\n:::[[guqin]], [[sanxian]], [[yueqin]], [[yangqin]], [[guzheng]], [[ruan]], [[konghou]], [[liuqin]], [[pipa]], [[Zhu (string instrument)|zhu]]\n\n[[File:ConcertGroupPano.jpg|thumb|none|530px|Re-enactment of a traditional music performance at [[Hubei Provincial Museum]] in Wuhan.]]\nChinese vocal music has traditionally been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in [[falsetto]] and is usually solo rather than [[choral]]. All traditional Chinese music is [[melodic]] rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from sung poems and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an [[erhu]] or [[dizi (instrument)|dizi]] are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the [[pipa]] and [[guzheng|zheng]] music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The [[guqin|qin]] is perhaps the most revered instrument in China, even though very few people know what it is or seen and heard one being played. The [[Guzheng|zheng]], a form of [[zither]], is most popular in [[Henan]], [[Chaozhou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] areas, and [[Shandong]]. The [[pipa]], a kind of [[lute]], believed to have been introduced from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in [[Shanghai]] and surrounding areas.\n\n=== Music of the Han culture ===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nPeople of the Han ethnic group make up about 92% of the population of China. Han people's music consists of [[heterophony|heterophonic music]], in which the musicians play versions of a single melodic line. [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]] accompanies most music, dance, talks, and opera. Han Folk Music had many aspects to it regarding its meaning, feelings, and tonality. This genre of music, in a sense, is similar to the Chinese language. This relationship is made by tones, sliding from higher tones to lower tones, or lower to higher tones, or a combination of both. These similarities mean that the instrument is a very important part in mastering technique with both left and right hands (left hand is used to create tonality on the string, right hand is for plucking or strumming the string), particularly for [http://www.philmultic.com/English/Chinese_music.html the classical (literati) tradition]. Sometimes, singing can be put into the music to create a harmony or a melody accompanying the instrument. Han Chinese Folk's feelings are displayed in its poetry-like feeling to it with slow soothing tempos that express feelings that connect with the audience or whoever is playing the piece. Han folk music uses silences that alter its meaning, creating a sound similar to poetry.\n\n[[File:Beijing opera06.jpg|thumb|200px|Performers in Peking Opera.]]\n\n=== Chinese opera ===\n{{main|Chinese opera}}\n[[Chinese opera]] has been a popular form of entertainment for many centuries, from the [[Nanxi (Chinese opera)|Nanxi]] of [[Song dynasty]] to the [[Peking opera]] of today. The music is often guttural with high-pitched vocals, usually accompanied by [[suona]], [[jinghu (instrument)|jinghu]], other kinds of [[string instrument]]s, and percussion. Other types of [[opera]] include [[Bangzi (disambiguation)|clapper opera]], [[Pingju]], [[Cantonese opera]], [[puppet opera]], [[Kunqu]], [[Sichuan opera]], [[Qinqiang]], [[Nuo opera|ritual masked opera]] and [[Huangmei xi]].\n\n=== Folk music ===\n{{Further|Shijing|Yuefu|List of Chinese folk songs}}\nAccording to current archaeological discoveries, [[Culture of China|Chinese]] [[folk music]] dates back 7000 years. Not only in form but also in artistic conception, China has been the home of a colorful culture of folk music. Largely based on the [[pentatonic scale]], Chinese folk music is different from western traditional music, paying more attention to the form expression as well.\n\nHan traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of [[oboe]] called a [[suona]] and percussive ensembles called ''[[chuigushou]]''. Ensembles consisting of [[mouth organ]]s ([[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]]), shawms ([[suona]]), [[flute]]s ([[dizi (instrument)|dizi]]) and percussion instruments (especially [[yunluo]] [[gong]]s) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of [[Beijing]], [[Xi'an]], [[Wutai shan]] and [[Tianjin]]. [[Xi'an guyue|Xi'an drum music]], consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[Chinese flute|pipes]], an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western [[free reed]] instruments, such as the [[accordion]]. Parades led by Western-type [[brass band]]s are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.\n\nIn southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken woman. Further south, in [[Shantou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] areas, and [[Chaozhou]], [[erxian]] and [[Guzheng|zheng]] ensembles are popular.\n\n[[Sizhu]] ensembles use [[flute]]s and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in [[Nanjing]] and [[Hangzhou]], as well as elsewhere along the southern [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.\n\n[[Jiangnan Sizhu]] (silk and bamboo music from [[Jiangnan]]) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in [[Shanghai]]; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin.\n\n[[Guangdong music (genre)|Guangdong Music]] or [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese Music]] is instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories and myths, maybe legends.\n\n== Regional music ==\n[[File:Miao musicians.jpg|thumb|[[Miao people|Miao]] musicians playing free-reed instruments in [[Guizhou]]]]\n\nChina has many ethnic groups besides the [[Han Chinese|Han]], who reside in various regions around the nation. These include [[Tibet]]ans, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], [[Manchu]]s, [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], [[Dai people|Dai]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], [[Naxi people|Naxi]], [[Hmong people|Miao]], [[Wa people|Wa]], [[Yi people|Yi]], and [[Lisu people|Lisu]].\n\n=== Guangxi ===\n{{main|Music of southern China#Guangxi}}\n[[Guangxi]] is a region of [[China]], the [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]]. Its most famous performer of Guangxi is the legendary [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] folksinger, \u5218\u4e09\u59d0 (Pinyin:li\u00fa s\u0101n ji\u011b) or Third Sister Liu, born in Guangxi during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) and who was the subject of the 1961 film, [[Liu Sanjie]] which introduced Guangxi's culture to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/haiwang.yuan/China/tales/liusanjie_b.htm|title=Liu Sanjie - A Fearless Folk Song Singer|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nZhuang folk songs and Han Chinese music are a similar style, and are mostly in the pentatonic scale. The lyrics have an obvious antithesis format. They frequently contain symbols and metaphors, and common themes include life experiences as well as allusions to classical Chinese stories.\n\nThe Jing or [[Gin people]] (ethnic Vietnamese) are one of the smallest populations of ethnic and the only coastal fishery ethnic minority of China. They are known for their instrument called ''[[duxianqin]]'' (lit. \"single string zither\"), a [[string instrument]] with only one string, said to date back to the 8th century.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{main|Music of Hong Kong}}\nThe music of Hong Kong notably includes the [[Cantonese]] Chinese pop music known as [[cantopop]].\n\n=== Hua'er ===\n''[[Hua'er]]'' is a form of traditional a cappella singing that is popular in the mountainous [[Northwest China|northwestern Chinese]] provinces such as [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and [[Qinghai]].\n\n=== Inner Mongolia ===\nMongolian folk songs have a \"long tune\" and a \"short tune\". The Mongolians have a variety of stringed instruments such as [[morin khuur]] or horsehead fiddle. It is named because of its [[headstock]] carving of a horse used as decoration on the pillar.\n\n=== Korean ===\nThere are [[Koreans in China|Korean]] communities scattered across northeast China. Chinese Korean music and North/South Korea music are basically the same. The main instruments are the long drum and the Gayageum. The Gayageum is similar to the ancient Chinese zither, which was smaller than the modern zither. The playing methods are different also.\n\n=== Kuaiban ===\n''[[Kuaiban]]'' (\u5feb\u677f) is a type of rhythmic talking and singing which is often performed with percussive instruments such as a clapper called ''[[paiban]]''. The center of the ''kuaiban'' tradition is [[Shandong]] province. ''Kuaiban'' bears some resemblance to rap and other forms of rhythmic music found in other cultures.\n\n=== Northeast China ===\n{{main|Music of Northeast China}}\n\n[[Northeast China]] is a region inhabited by ethnic groups like the [[Manchu]]. The most prominent folk instrument is the octagonal drum, while the [[youyouzha]] [[lullaby]] is also well-known.\n\n=== Sichuan ===\n{{main|Music of Sichuan}}\n\n[[Sichuan]] is a province in southwest China. Its capital city, [[Chengdu]], is home to the only musical higher education institution in the region, the [[Sichuan Conservatory of Music]]. The province has a long history of [[Sichuan opera]].\n\n=== Tibet ===\n[[File:3MonksDomthok.JPG|thumb|Monks playing [[Tibetan horn]]s]]\n{{main|Music of Tibet}}\nMusic forms an integral part of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. While [[chanting]] remains perhaps the best known form of Tibetan Buddhist music, complex and lively forms are also widespread. Monks use music to recite various [[sacred text]]s and to celebrate a variety of festivals during the year. The most specialized form of chanting is called yang, which is without metrical timing and is dominated by resonant drums and sustained, low syllables. Other forms of chanting are unique to [[Tantra]] as well as the four main monastic schools: [[Gelugpa]], [[Kagyupa]], [[Nyingmapa]] and [[Sakyapa]]. Of these schools, Gelugpa is considered a more restrained, classical form, while Nyingmapa is widely described as romantic and dramatic. Gelugpa is perhaps the most popular.\n\nSecular Tibetan music survived the Cultural Revolution more intact than spiritual music, especially due to the [[Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts]], which was founded by the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] shortly after his exile. TIPA originally specialized in the [[opera]]tic [[lhamo]] form, which has since been modernized with the addition of Western and other influences. Other secular genres include [[nangma]] and [[Toeshey|toshe]], which are often linked and are accompanied by a variety of instruments designed for highly rhythmic [[dance music]]. Nangma [[karaoke]] is popular in modern [[Lhasa]]. A classical form called [[gar (music)|gar]] is very popular, and is distinguished by ornate, elegant and ceremonial music honoring dignitaries or other respected persons.\n\nTibetan [[folk music]] includes [[a cappella]] [[lu (music)|lu]] songs, which are distinctively high in pitch with glottal vibrations, as well as now rare epic bards who sing the tales of [[Gesar]], Tibet's most popular hero.\n\nTibetan music has influenced the pioneering compositions of [[Philip Glass]] and, most influentially, [[Henry Eichheim]]. Later artists made [[New-age music|new-age]] fusions by pioneers [[Henry Wolff]] and [[Nancy Hennings]]. These two collaborated on ''[[Tibetan Bells (album)|Tibetan Bells]]'', perhaps the first fusion of New Age and Tibetan influences, in 1971. Glass' ''[[Kundun]]'' [[soundtrack]] proved influential in the 1990s, while the popularity of Western-adapted Buddhism (exemplified by [[Richard Gere]], [[Yungchen Lhamo]], [[Steve Tibbetts]], [[Choying Drolma]], [[Lama Karta]] and [[Kitaro]] and [[Nawang Khechong]]) helped further popularize Tibetan music.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1980s, a relaxation of governmental rules allowed a form of Tibetan pop music to emerge in Tibet proper. Direct references to native religion is still forbidden,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} but commonly understood metaphors are widespread. Pure [[Tibetan pop]] is heavily influenced by light Chinese rock, and includes best-sellers like [[Jampa Tsering]] and [[Yatong]]. Politically and socially aware songs are rare in this form of pop, but commonplace in a second type of Tibetan pop. Nangma karaoke bars appeared in 1998 and are common in Lhasa, in spite of threats from the Chinese government.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Xinjiang ===\n[[File:Uyghur Meshrep.jpg|thumb|Uyghur Meshrep musicians in Yarkand.]]\n{{main|Music of Xinjiang}}\n\n[[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] is dominated by [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people related to other Turkic groups from [[Central Asia]]. The Uyghurs' best-known musical form is the [[Muqam|On Ikki Muqam]], a complex suite of twelve sections related to [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] and [[Tajikistan|Tajik]] forms. These complex symphonies vary wildly between suites in the same muqam, and are built on a seven-note scale. Instruments typically include dap (a drum), [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[fiddle]]s and [[lute]]s; performers have some space for personal embellishments, especially in the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. The most important performer is [[Turdi Akhun]], who recorded most of the muqams in the 1950s.\n\n=== Yunnan ===\n[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nakhi]] musicians]]\n{{main|Music of Yunnan}}\n\n[[Yunnan]] is an ethnically diverse area in southwest China. Perhaps best known from the province is the [[lusheng]], a type of [[mouth organ]], used by the [[Miao people]] of [[Guizhou]] for pentatonic [[antiphonal]] courting songs.\n\nThe [[Hani people|Hani]] of [[Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Honghe]] Prefecture are known for a unique kind of choral, micro-tonal rice-transplanting songs.\n\nThe [[Nakhi]] of [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] play a type of song and dance suite called [[baisha xiyue]], which was supposedly brought by [[Kublai Khan]] in 1253. Nakhi ''[[Dongjing (music)|Dongjing]]'' is a type of music related to southern Chinese forms, and is popular today.\n\nThe Dai ethnic musical styles are similar to those of South Asia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Some typical Dai instruments are the hulusi and the elephant-foot drum.\n\n== Modern changes ==\nIn the early 20th century after the end of [[Imperial China]], there were major changes to traditional Chinese music as part of the [[New Culture Movement]].  Much of what Westerners and even Chinese now consider to be music in the traditional Chinese style can be dated to this period and is in fact less than 100 years old.  The modernization of Chinese music involved the adoption of some aspects of Western forms and values, such as the use of Western [[Music school#Conservatoire|conservatory]] system of teaching, and changes to the instruments and their tuning, the composition, the orchestration of music, the notation system and performance style.  Some forms of Chinese music however remained traditional and are little changed.\n\n=== National music ===\n{{main|Guoyue}}\n\nThe term ''guoyue'', or national music, became popular in the early 20th century and was used loosely to include all music written for Chinese instruments in response to a particular nationalistic consciousness.<ref name=\"frederick lau\">{{cite book |title=Music in China |last=Lau |first=Frederick |pages= 30\u201334 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0195301243 }}</ref>  The term however may have a slightly different meaning when used by different Chinese communities. It was originally used only to refer to the music of the Han Chinese; it later began to include music of various ethnic minorities in China. In the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan, ''Guoyue'' emphasized music of the mainland China over the Taiwanese local traditions. In mainland China a new term ''minyue'' (\u6c11\u4e50, short for ''minzu yinyue'' or \"people's music\") was coined post-1949 in place of ''guoyue'' to encompass all compositions and genres for traditional instruments.  In other Chinese communities, it may also be referred to as ''huayue'' (for example in Singapore) or ''zhongyue'' (in Hong Kong).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QDeniyscslkC&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Globalization of Language and Culture in Asia: The Impact of Globalization Processes on Language |page=21 |editor= Viniti Vaish |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |year= 2010 |isbn=978-1847061836 }}</ref>\n[[File:Chinesemusicians.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese musicians at a restaurant in Shanghai]]\n\n===Chinese orchestra===\n{{main|Chinese orchestra}}\n\nThere was a tradition of massed instruments in the ritual court music form known as ''[[yayue]]'' since the [[Zhou Dynasty]].   This music may be played by a handful of musicians, or there may be more than 200 for example during the [[Song Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=02rFSecPhEsC&pg=PA261#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |editor= Don Michael Randel |pages=261\u2013262 |publisher=Harvard University Press |edition=4th |year= 2003 |isbn=978-0674011632 }}</ref>  During the Tang Dynasty there were also large-scale presentations of banquet music called ''yanyue'' ({{zh|t=\u71d5\u6a02|labels=no}}) in the court. The Tang imperial court may have up to ten different orchestras, each performing a different kind of music.  It also had a large outdoor band of nearly 1,400 performers.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyVgZMAiUoC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Cultural History of the Chinese Language |author= Sharron Gu |page=24 |publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn= 9780786488278 |date=2011-12-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern [[Chinese orchestra]] however was created in the 20th century modeled on Western [[symphony orchestra]] using Chinese instruments.  In the traditional ''yanyue'', a single [[Homophony|dominant melodic line]] was favored, but the new music and arrangements of traditional melodies created for this modern orchestra is more [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] in nature.\n\n===Instruments and tuning\nMany traditional instruments underwent changes in the early to mid 20th century which has a profound effect on the performance and sound of Chinese music, and a western [[equal temperament]] is now used to tune most traditional instruments, which to modern ears seem less harsh and more harmonious but which also robs the instruments of their [[Chinese musicology|traditional voices]]. To ears now used to hearing modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings can sound out of tune and discordant.\n\nIn order to accommodate Western system, changes were made to the instruments, for example in the ''[[pipa]]'' the number of frets was increased to 24, based on the 12 tone equal temperament scale, with all the intervals being semitones.\n\nThere is also a need to [[concert pitch|standardize the tuning]] when the instruments are played in an orchestra, which in turn may also affect how the instrument is made.  For example, traditionally ''[[Dizi (instrument)|dizi]]'' is made by using a solid piece of bamboo which made it impossible to change the fundamental tuning once the bamboo is cut. This issue was resolved in the 1920s by the insertion of a copper joint to connect two pieces of shorter bamboo, which allows the length of the bamboo to be modified so that minute adjustment to its fundamental pitch can be made.<ref name=\"paradigm\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GxCF5Q3BvYgC&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Lau |first=Frederick|title=Beyond the May Fourth Paradigm: In Search of Chinese Modernity |editor= Kai-wing Chow |publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2008 |pages=212\u2013215 |isbn=978-0739111222 }}</ref> The [[Xindi (instrument)|Xindi]], \"new flute\", is a 1930s redesign of the Chinese flute incorporating western influences on the basis of equal temperament.\n\nIn order to achieve a greater vi\nbrancy and loudness with instruments (not to mention longevity), many string instruments are no longer strung with silk but with steel or nylon. For example, metal strings began to be used in place of the traditional silk ones in the 1950s for ''pipa'', resulting in a change in the sound of the ''pipa'' which became brighter and stronger.<ref name=\"danwei\">[http://www.danwei.com/the-pipa-how-a-barbarian-lute-became-a-national-symbol/ The pipa: How a barbarian lute became a national symbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613213913/http://www.danwei.com/the-pipa-how-a-barbarian-lute-became-a-national-symbol/ |date=2011-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Chinese musical notation}}\nBefore the 20th century Chinese used the [[gongche]] notation system, in modern times the [[Numbered musical notation|Jianpu]] system is common.  Western [[staff notation]] however is also used.\n\n===Performance===\nIn common with the music traditions of other Asian cultures, such as Persia and India, one strand of traditional Chinese music consists of a repertoire of traditional melodies, together known as [[qupai]], in which [[tempo]] and [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] vary according to the mood of the instrumentalist, the audience, and their reaction to what is being played, the same melody can be used to serve many different roles be it merry, melancholic or martial (this can be glimpsed in the love theme of the [[Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto]] where the same melody at different points in the lover's story reflects elation, turbulence and dejection). Many modern performers now play pieces by following a [[Sheet music|score]] in a standard way rather than in the changeable [[Human self-reflection|reflective]] individual way of tradition, this can at times lead to the feeling that a performance has been rushed.\n\n==Modern popular music==\n\n=== Pop music ===\n{{main|C-pop|cantopop|mandopop}}\nChinese popular<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/cpoptop|title=Cpop World top Chart}}</ref> music found its beginnings in the ''[[shidaiqu]]'' genre.

However, for a time the government still have a censorious attitude toward pop music; for example, Hong Kong's icon [[Anita Mui]] was banned from returning to the mainland concert stage after performing the song \"Bad Girl\" during the 1990s in China as punishment for what the Chinese government called her rebellious attitude.<ref name=\"Baranovitch\">Baranovitch, Nimrod.

Although Chinese perform rap in different dialects and languages, most Chinese hip hop artists perform in China's most popular language: Mandarin.\n\nCantonese rap is also very diverse in cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.\n\n==Rock and heavy metal==\n{{main|Chinese rock}}\nThe [[Peking All-Stars]] were a rock band formed in Beijing in 1979, by foreigners then resident in the Chinese capital.\n\nThe widely acknowledged forefather of Chinese rock is [[Cui Jian]].<ref name=\"Gunde\" /> In the late 1980s he played the first Chinese rock song called: \"[[Nothing To My Name]]\" (\"Yi wu suo you\"). It was the first time an [[electric guitar]] was used in China.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He became the most famous performer of the time, and by 1988 he performed at a concert broadcast worldwide in conjunction with the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Summer Olympic Games]].<ref name=\"Gunde\" /> His socially critical lyrics earned him the anger of the government and many of his concerts were banned or cancelled. After the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], he played with a red blindfold around his head as an action against the government.\n\nFollowing, two bands became famous [[Hei Bao (band)|Hei Bao]] (Black Panther) and [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]]. Both started during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hei Bao is an old-school rock band whose first CD, ''Hei Bao'' used the popular English song (\"Don't Break My Heart\"). [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]] was the first Chinese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. Its first CD \"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty\" combines elements of traditional [[Chinese opera]] and old school heavy metal. The album was a major breakthrough releasing around 1991/1992.\n\nAround 1994\u201396: the first [[thrash metal]] band, Chao Zai ([[Overload (Chinese rock band)|Overload]]), was formed. They released three CDs, the last one in cooperation with pop singer [[Gao Qi (musician)|Gao Chi]] of the split-up band [[The Breathing]]. At the same time the first [[nu metal]] bands were formed and inspired by Western bands such as [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]] or [[Linkin Park]]. China would have their own with [[Yaksa (band)|Yaksa]], [[Niuqu De Jiqi (band)|Twisted Machine]], [[AK-47 (band)|AK-47]], [[Overheal Tank]].\n\n[[Black metal]] is becoming a prominent scene in mainland China, particularly [[central China]].\n\n=== Punk rock and post-punk ===\n[[Punk rock]] first emerged in China in the early 1990s as records from Western punk and [[post-punk]] bands were imported into mainland China for the first time. One of the earliest and most renowned punk-influenced Chinese artists was [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] whose debut album ''Garbage Dump'' was released in 1994.\n\nFormed in Nanjing in 1997, post-punk group [[P.K. 14]] are regarded as the most important band in the development of Chinese experimental rock music. The band moved to Beijing in 2001 and released their first album 'Upstairs, Turn Left' the same year. P.K. 14's singer-songwriter Yang Haisong (\u6768\u6d77\u5d27) has also produced many of the Chinese indie music scene's most celebrated albums (including [[Carsick Cars]]' 2007 eponymous debut album), working with independent record labels such as [[Maybe Mars]] and [[Modern Sky]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maybemars.com/artists/p-k-14/|title=P.K.14 \u2013 Maybe Mars}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/05/25/yang-haisong-feature/|title=Yang Haisong Is Producing a New Generation of Underground Chinese Rock|date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the early 2000s, Chinese indie music has grown considerably, with homegrown bands such as Carsick Cars, Birdstriking, Re-TROS, [[Brain Failure]], Demerit, Tookoo, AV Okubo, [[Hang on the Box]] and [[Genjing Records|Fanzui Xiangfa]] all embarking on international tours.\n\n==Western classical music==\nWhereas orchestras organised by, run solely by and nearly always exclusive to the expatriate community in China are recorded from the early days of the International Settlement in Shanghai (i.e. 1850s) and a Russian orchestra was in operation in Harbin from the early 20th century,<ref name=\"History of the Harbin Orchestra\">[http://www.jtdf.net/home.php?mod=space&uid=145&do=blog&id=82], additional text.</ref> the beginnings of a unique classical music tradition in China lie with the first foreign trained Chinese conductor, [[Zheng Zhisheng]] AKA (romanized) [[Yin Zizhong]].

The former provided the driving force and often the life force that kept a tradition alive through the Mao years, especially in his adopted city of Beijing, and the latter has been instrumental in maintaining a high standard of symphonic music, as well as working hard for the popularization of the tradition further into the fabric of Chinese culture, across his long career, which continues to the present. At the same time as this tradition has continued, new generations have sought to bring classical music in China along another path, away from the strict professionalism of the elite trained Li and Cao (who were both at the Russian conservatory in the 1950s) and towards a less nationalistic, but arguably more encompassing attitude towards the tradition. Most influential in this new movement has been the young Shanghai conductor [[Long Yu]].\n\n== Patriotic / revolutionary music ==\n[[File:PRCNationalanthemmusic.png|thumb|right|200px|A typical PRC national song album branded to be sold outside of mainland China.

The first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the [[Guqin|qin]] during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907AD), though the qin is known to have been played since before the Han dynasty. This is based on the conjecture that because the recorded examples of Chinese music are ceremonial, and the ceremonies in which they were employed are thought to have existed \"perhaps more than one thousand years before Christ\",{{sfn|Van Aalst|1884|loc=}}{{Page needed|date=October 2013}} the musical compositions themselves were performed, even in 1000 BC, in precisely the manner prescribed by the sources that were written down in the seventh century AD.

A number of Chinese musicians returned from studying abroad to perform Western [[classical music]], composing work hits on Western musical notation system. The [[Kuomintang]] tried to sponsor modern music adoptions via the [[Shanghai Conservatory of Music]] despite the ongoing political crisis. Twentieth-century cultural philosophers like [[Xiao Youmei]], [[Cai Yuanpei]], [[Feng Zikai]] and Wang Guangqi wanted to see Chinese music adopted to the best standard possible. There were many different opinions regarding the best standard.<ref name=\"Jones\"/>\n\n[[Symphony orchestra]]s were formed in most major cities and performed to a wide audience in the concert halls and on [[radio]]. Many of the performers added [[jazz]] influences to traditional music, adding [[xylophone]]s, [[saxophone]]s and [[violin]]s, among other instruments. [[L\u00fc Wencheng]], Qui Hechou, [[Yin Zizhong]] and [[He Dasha]] were among the most notable performers and composers of this period.\n\nIn [[Shanghai]], a popular genre of music called ''[[shidaiqu]]'' emerged in the 1920s. ''Shidaiqu'' is a fusion of Chinese and Western popular music, and [[Li Jinhui]] is considered to be founder of the genre. Popular singers in this genre in the 1930s and 1940s included [[Zhou Xuan]], [[Li Xianglan]] and [[Yao Lee]].\n\nAfter the 1942 [[Yan'an Forum]] on Literature and Art, a large-scale campaign was launched in the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] controlled areas to adapt folk music to create revolutionary songs to educate the largely illiterate rural population on party goals. Musical forms considered superstitious or anti-revolutionary were repressed, and [[harmony|harmonies]] and bass lines were added to traditional songs. One example is [[The East Is Red (song)|The East Is Red]], a folksong from northern [[Shaanxi]] which was adapted into a nationalist hymn. Of particular note is the composer, [[Xian Xinghai]], who was active during this period, and composed the [[Yellow River Cantata]] which is the most well-known of all of his works.\n\n=== 1949\u20131990s ===\n\nThe golden age of [[shidaiqu]] and the [[Seven great singing stars]] would come to an end when the [[Communist Party of China|Communist party]] denounced [[C-pop|Chinese popular music]] as [[Yellow Music|yellow music]] ([[pornography]]).<ref name= \"Broughton\">Broughton, Simon.

In 1949 the [[Kuomintang]] relocated to Taiwan, and the [[People's Republic of China]] was established. [[Guoyue|Revolutionary songs]] would become heavily promoted by the state. The [[Maoist]]s, during the [[Cultural Revolution]], pushed revolutionary music as the only acceptable genre; because of propaganda, this genre largely overshadowed all others and came almost to define mainland Chinese music. This is still, in some ways, an ongoing process, but some scholars and musicians (Chinese and otherwise) are trying to revive old music.\n\nAfter the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], a new fast tempo [[Northwest Wind]] (xibeifeng, \u897f\u5317\u98a8) style was launched by protesters to counter the government. The music would progress into [[Chinese rock]], which remained popular in the 1990s. However, music in China is very much state-owned as the TV, media, and major concert halls are all controlled by the Communist party. The government mainly chose not to support Chinese rock by limiting its exposure and airtime. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}As a result, the genre never reached the mainstream in its entirety.\n\n=== 2000s\u2013present ===\n\nAnnual events such as the [[Midi Modern Music Festival]] in [[Beijing]] attracts tens of thousands of visitors.

[[Wuhan]] and [[Sichuan]] are sometimes considered pockets of rock music culture as well. It points to a significant cultural, political and social difference that exist between China, the West, or even different parts within China. While rock has existed in China for decades, the milestone that put the genre on the international map is when [[Cui Jian]] played with [[The Rolling Stones]] in 2003, at the age of 42.

The [[Chinese musicology|scale]] is [[pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. [[Chinese flutes|Bamboo pipes]] and [[Guqin|qin]] are among the oldest known [[musical instrument]]s from [[China]]; instruments are traditionally divided into categories based on their material of composition: animal skins, gourd, bamboo, wood, silk, earth/clay, metal, and stone. [[Chinese orchestra]]s traditionally consist of [[String instrument|bowed strings]], [[woodwind]]s, [[Plucked string instrument|plucked strings]] and [[Percussion instrument|percussion]].\n[[File:\u4e8c\u6cc9\u6620\u6708.ogg|right|thumb|The Moon reflecting in Erquan Pool, a masterpiece written for erhu by the blind composer Abing.]]\n[[File:Guqin-Zuiyu_Changwan.ogg|right|thumb|Zuiyu Changwan (The Evening Song of the Drunken Fisherman) for qin from the Tianwen Ge Qinpu (1876).]]\n:'''Instruments'''\n::* Woodwind\n:::[[dizi (instrument)|dizi]], [[xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[suona]], [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[paixiao]], [[guan (instrument)|guan]], [[hulusi]], [[bawu]], [[xun (instrument)|xun]]\n::* Percussion\n:::[[paigu]], [[gong]], [[bell (instrument)|bells]], [[cymbal]]s, [[bianzhong]], [[fangxiang]], [[paiban]], [[bianqing]]\n::* Bowed strings\n:::[[erhu]], [[zhonghu]], [[dahu (instrument)|dahu]], [[banhu]], [[jinghu (instrument)|jinghu]], [[gaohu]], [[gehu]], [[yehu]], [[cizhonghu]], [[diyingehu]], [[leiqin]]\n::* Plucked and struck strings\n:::[[guqin]], [[sanxian]], [[yueqin]], [[yangqin]], [[guzheng]], [[ruan]], [[konghou]], [[liuqin]], [[pipa]], [[Zhu (string instrument)|zhu]]\n\n[[File:ConcertGroupPano.jpg|thumb|none|530px|Re-enactment of a traditional music performance at [[Hubei Provincial Museum]] in Wuhan.]]\nChinese vocal music has traditionally been sung in a thin, non resonant voice or in [[falsetto]] and is usually solo rather than [[choral]]. All traditional Chinese music is [[melodic]] rather than harmonic. Chinese vocal music probably developed from sung poems and verses with music. Instrumental pieces played on an [[erhu]] or [[dizi (instrument)|dizi]] are popular, and are often available outside of China, but the [[pipa]] and [[guzheng|zheng]] music, which are more traditional, are more popular in China itself. The [[guqin|qin]] is perhaps the most revered instrument in China, even though very few people know what it is or seen and heard one being played. The [[Guzheng|zheng]], a form of [[zither]], is most popular in [[Henan]], [[Chaozhou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] areas, and [[Shandong]]. The [[pipa]], a kind of [[lute]], believed to have been introduced from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] area during the 6th century and adapted to suit Chinese tastes, is most popular in [[Shanghai]] and surrounding areas.\n\n=== Music of the Han culture ===\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\nPeople of the Han ethnic group make up about 92% of the population of China. Han people's music consists of [[heterophony|heterophonic music]], in which the musicians play versions of a single melodic line. [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]] accompanies most music, dance, talks, and opera. Han Folk Music had many aspects to it regarding its meaning, feelings, and tonality. This genre of music, in a sense, is similar to the Chinese language. This relationship is made by tones, sliding from higher tones to lower tones, or lower to higher tones, or a combination of both. These similarities mean that the instrument is a very important part in mastering technique with both left and right hands (left hand is used to create tonality on the string, right hand is for plucking or strumming the string), particularly for [http://www.philmultic.com/English/Chinese_music.html the classical (literati) tradition]. Sometimes, singing can be put into the music to create a harmony or a melody accompanying the instrument. Han Chinese Folk's feelings are displayed in its poetry-like feeling to it with slow soothing tempos that express feelings that connect with the audience or whoever is playing the piece. Han folk music uses silences that alter its meaning, creating a sound similar to poetry.\n\n[[File:Beijing opera06.jpg|thumb|200px|Performers in Peking Opera.]]\n\n=== Chinese opera ===\n{{main|Chinese opera}}\n[[Chinese opera]] has been a popular form of entertainment for many centuries, from the [[Nanxi (Chinese opera)|Nanxi]] of [[Song dynasty]] to the [[Peking opera]] of today. The music is often guttural with high-pitched vocals, usually accompanied by [[suona]], [[jinghu (instrument)|jinghu]], other kinds of [[string instrument]]s, and percussion. Other types of [[opera]] include [[Bangzi (disambiguation)|clapper opera]], [[Pingju]], [[Cantonese opera]], [[puppet opera]], [[Kunqu]], [[Sichuan opera]], [[Qinqiang]], [[Nuo opera|ritual masked opera]] and [[Huangmei xi]].\n\n=== Folk music ===\n{{Further|Shijing|Yuefu|List of Chinese folk songs}}\nAccording to current archaeological discoveries, [[Culture of China|Chinese]] [[folk music]] dates back 7000 years. Not only in form but also in artistic conception, China has been the home of a colorful culture of folk music. Largely based on the [[pentatonic scale]], Chinese folk music is different from western traditional music, paying more attention to the form expression as well.\n\nHan traditional weddings and funerals usually include a form of [[oboe]] called a [[suona]] and percussive ensembles called ''[[chuigushou]]''. Ensembles consisting of [[mouth organ]]s ([[Sheng (instrument)|sheng]]), shawms ([[suona]]), [[flute]]s ([[dizi (instrument)|dizi]]) and percussion instruments (especially [[yunluo]] [[gong]]s) are popular in northern villages; their music is descended from the imperial temple music of [[Beijing]], [[Xi'an]], [[Wutai shan]] and [[Tianjin]]. [[Xi'an guyue|Xi'an drum music]], consisting of wind and percussive instruments, is popular around Xi'an, and has received some commercial popularity outside of China. Another important instrument is the [[sheng (instrument)|sheng]], [[Chinese flute|pipes]], an ancient instrument that is ancestor of all Western [[free reed]] instruments, such as the [[accordion]]. Parades led by Western-type [[brass band]]s are common, often competing in volume with a shawm/chuigushou band.\n\nIn southern [[Fujian]] and [[Taiwan]], Nanyin or [[Nanguan music|Nanguan]] is a genre of traditional ballads. They are sung by a woman accompanied by a [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]] and a [[pipa]], as well as other traditional instruments. The music is generally sorrowful and typically deals with a love-stricken woman. Further south, in [[Shantou]], [[Hakka people|Hakka]] areas, and [[Chaozhou]], [[erxian]] and [[Guzheng|zheng]] ensembles are popular.\n\n[[Sizhu]] ensembles use [[flute]]s and bowed or plucked string instruments to make harmonious and melodious music that has become popular in the West among some listeners. These are popular in [[Nanjing]] and [[Hangzhou]], as well as elsewhere along the southern [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] area. Sizhu has been secularized in cities but remains spiritual in rural areas.\n\n[[Jiangnan Sizhu]] (silk and bamboo music from [[Jiangnan]]) is a style of instrumental music, often played by amateur musicians in tea houses in [[Shanghai]]; it has become widely known outside of its place of origin.\n\n[[Guangdong music (genre)|Guangdong Music]] or [[Guangdong music (genre)|Cantonese Music]] is instrumental music from [[Guangzhou]] and surrounding areas. It is based on Yueju (Cantonese Opera) music, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Many pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time. This music tells stories and myths, maybe legends.\n\n== Regional music ==\n[[File:Miao musicians.jpg|thumb|[[Miao people|Miao]] musicians playing free-reed instruments in [[Guizhou]]]]\n\nChina has many ethnic groups besides the [[Han Chinese|Han]], who reside in various regions around the nation. These include [[Tibet]]ans, [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], [[Manchu]]s, [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]], [[Dai people|Dai]], [[Mongols|Mongolians]], [[Naxi people|Naxi]], [[Hmong people|Miao]], [[Wa people|Wa]], [[Yi people|Yi]], and [[Lisu people|Lisu]].\n\n=== Guangxi ===\n{{main|Music of southern China#Guangxi}}\n[[Guangxi]] is a region of [[China]], the [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]]. Its most famous performer of Guangxi is the legendary [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] folksinger, \u5218\u4e09\u59d0 (Pinyin:li\u00fa s\u0101n ji\u011b) or Third Sister Liu, born in Guangxi during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) and who was the subject of the 1961 film, [[Liu Sanjie]] which introduced Guangxi's culture to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.wku.edu/haiwang.yuan/China/tales/liusanjie_b.htm|title=Liu Sanjie - A Fearless Folk Song Singer|accessdate=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nZhuang folk songs and Han Chinese music are a similar style, and are mostly in the pentatonic scale. The lyrics have an obvious antithesis format. They frequently contain symbols and metaphors, and common themes include life experiences as well as allusions to classical Chinese stories.\n\nThe Jing or [[Gin people]] (ethnic Vietnamese) are one of the smallest populations of ethnic and the only coastal fishery ethnic minority of China. They are known for their instrument called ''[[duxianqin]]'' (lit. \"single string zither\"), a [[string instrument]] with only one string, said to date back to the 8th century.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\n{{main|Music of Hong Kong}}\nThe music of Hong Kong notably includes the [[Cantonese]] Chinese pop music known as [[cantopop]].\n\n=== Hua'er ===\n''[[Hua'er]]'' is a form of traditional a cappella singing that is popular in the mountainous [[Northwest China|northwestern Chinese]] provinces such as [[Gansu]], [[Ningxia]], and [[Qinghai]].\n\n=== Inner Mongolia ===\nMongolian folk songs have a \"long tune\" and a \"short tune\". The Mongolians have a variety of stringed instruments such as [[morin khuur]] or horsehead fiddle. It is named because of its [[headstock]] carving of a horse used as decoration on the pillar.\n\n=== Korean ===\nThere are [[Koreans in China|Korean]] communities scattered across northeast China. Chinese Korean music and North/South Korea music are basically the same. The main instruments are the long drum and the Gayageum. The Gayageum is similar to the ancient Chinese zither, which was smaller than the modern zither. The playing methods are different also.\n\n=== Kuaiban ===\n''[[Kuaiban]]'' (\u5feb\u677f) is a type of rhythmic talking and singing which is often performed with percussive instruments such as a clapper called ''[[paiban]]''. The center of the ''kuaiban'' tradition is [[Shandong]] province. ''Kuaiban'' bears some resemblance to rap and other forms of rhythmic music found in other cultures.\n\n=== Northeast China ===\n{{main|Music of Northeast China}}\n\n[[Northeast China]] is a region inhabited by ethnic groups like the [[Manchu]]. The most prominent folk instrument is the octagonal drum, while the [[youyouzha]] [[lullaby]] is also well-known.\n\n=== Sichuan ===\n{{main|Music of Sichuan}}\n\n[[Sichuan]] is a province in southwest China. Its capital city, [[Chengdu]], is home to the only musical higher education institution in the region, the [[Sichuan Conservatory of Music]]. The province has a long history of [[Sichuan opera]].\n\n=== Tibet ===\n[[File:3MonksDomthok.JPG|thumb|Monks playing [[Tibetan horn]]s]]\n{{main|Music of Tibet}}\nMusic forms an integral part of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. While [[chanting]] remains perhaps the best known form of Tibetan Buddhist music, complex and lively forms are also widespread. Monks use music to recite various [[sacred text]]s and to celebrate a variety of festivals during the year. The most specialized form of chanting is called yang, which is without metrical timing and is dominated by resonant drums and sustained, low syllables. Other forms of chanting are unique to [[Tantra]] as well as the four main monastic schools: [[Gelugpa]], [[Kagyupa]], [[Nyingmapa]] and [[Sakyapa]]. Of these schools, Gelugpa is considered a more restrained, classical form, while Nyingmapa is widely described as romantic and dramatic. Gelugpa is perhaps the most popular.\n\nSecular Tibetan music survived the Cultural Revolution more intact than spiritual music, especially due to the [[Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts]], which was founded by the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] shortly after his exile. TIPA originally specialized in the [[opera]]tic [[lhamo]] form, which has since been modernized with the addition of Western and other influences. Other secular genres include [[nangma]] and [[Toeshey|toshe]], which are often linked and are accompanied by a variety of instruments designed for highly rhythmic [[dance music]]. Nangma [[karaoke]] is popular in modern [[Lhasa]]. A classical form called [[gar (music)|gar]] is very popular, and is distinguished by ornate, elegant and ceremonial music honoring dignitaries or other respected persons.\n\nTibetan [[folk music]] includes [[a cappella]] [[lu (music)|lu]] songs, which are distinctively high in pitch with glottal vibrations, as well as now rare epic bards who sing the tales of [[Gesar]], Tibet's most popular hero.\n\nTibetan music has influenced the pioneering compositions of [[Philip Glass]] and, most influentially, [[Henry Eichheim]]. Later artists made [[New-age music|new-age]] fusions by pioneers [[Henry Wolff]] and [[Nancy Hennings]]. These two collaborated on ''[[Tibetan Bells (album)|Tibetan Bells]]'', perhaps the first fusion of New Age and Tibetan influences, in 1971. Glass' ''[[Kundun]]'' [[soundtrack]] proved influential in the 1990s, while the popularity of Western-adapted Buddhism (exemplified by [[Richard Gere]], [[Yungchen Lhamo]], [[Steve Tibbetts]], [[Choying Drolma]], [[Lama Karta]] and [[Kitaro]] and [[Nawang Khechong]]) helped further popularize Tibetan music.\n\nIn the mid- to late 1980s, a relaxation of governmental rules allowed a form of Tibetan pop music to emerge in Tibet proper. Direct references to native religion is still forbidden,{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} but commonly understood metaphors are widespread. Pure [[Tibetan pop]] is heavily influenced by light Chinese rock, and includes best-sellers like [[Jampa Tsering]] and [[Yatong]]. Politically and socially aware songs are rare in this form of pop, but commonplace in a second type of Tibetan pop. Nangma karaoke bars appeared in 1998 and are common in Lhasa, in spite of threats from the Chinese government.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n=== Xinjiang ===\n[[File:Uyghur Meshrep.jpg|thumb|Uyghur Meshrep musicians in Yarkand.]]\n{{main|Music of Xinjiang}}\n\n[[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] is dominated by [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people related to other Turkic groups from [[Central Asia]]. The Uyghurs' best-known musical form is the [[Muqam|On Ikki Muqam]], a complex suite of twelve sections related to [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] and [[Tajikistan|Tajik]] forms. These complex symphonies vary wildly between suites in the same muqam, and are built on a seven-note scale. Instruments typically include dap (a drum), [[hammered dulcimer|dulcimers]], [[fiddle]]s and [[lute]]s; performers have some space for personal embellishments, especially in the [[Percussion instrument|percussion]]. The most important performer is [[Turdi Akhun]], who recorded most of the muqams in the 1950s.\n\n=== Yunnan ===\n[[File:Naxi Musicians I.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nakhi]] musicians]]\n{{main|Music of Yunnan}}\n\n[[Yunnan]] is an ethnically diverse area in southwest China. Perhaps best known from the province is the [[lusheng]], a type of [[mouth organ]], used by the [[Miao people]] of [[Guizhou]] for pentatonic [[antiphonal]] courting songs.\n\nThe [[Hani people|Hani]] of [[Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Honghe]] Prefecture are known for a unique kind of choral, micro-tonal rice-transplanting songs.\n\nThe [[Nakhi]] of [[Lijiang City|Lijiang]] play a type of song and dance suite called [[baisha xiyue]], which was supposedly brought by [[Kublai Khan]] in 1253. Nakhi ''[[Dongjing (music)|Dongjing]]'' is a type of music related to southern Chinese forms, and is popular today.\n\nThe Dai ethnic musical styles are similar to those of South Asia, Myanmar, and Thailand. Some typical Dai instruments are the hulusi and the elephant-foot drum.\n\n== Modern changes ==\nIn the early 20th century after the end of [[Imperial China]], there were major changes to traditional Chinese music as part of the [[New Culture Movement]].  Much of what Westerners and even Chinese now consider to be music in the traditional Chinese style can be dated to this period and is in fact less than 100 years old.  The modernization of Chinese music involved the adoption of some aspects of Western forms and values, such as the use of Western [[Music school#Conservatoire|conservatory]] system of teaching, and changes to the instruments and their tuning, the composition, the orchestration of music, the notation system and performance style.  Some forms of Chinese music however remained traditional and are little changed.\n\n=== National music ===\n{{main|Guoyue}}\n\nThe term ''guoyue'', or national music, became popular in the early 20th century and was used loosely to include all music written for Chinese instruments in response to a particular nationalistic consciousness.<ref name=\"frederick lau\">{{cite book |title=Music in China |last=Lau |first=Frederick |pages= 30\u201334 |publisher= Oxford University Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0195301243 }}</ref>  The term however may have a slightly different meaning when used by different Chinese communities. It was originally used only to refer to the music of the Han Chinese; it later began to include music of various ethnic minorities in China. In the [[Republic of China]] in Taiwan, ''Guoyue'' emphasized music of the mainland China over the Taiwanese local traditions. In mainland China a new term ''minyue'' (\u6c11\u4e50, short for ''minzu yinyue'' or \"people's music\") was coined post-1949 in place of ''guoyue'' to encompass all compositions and genres for traditional instruments.  In other Chinese communities, it may also be referred to as ''huayue'' (for example in Singapore) or ''zhongyue'' (in Hong Kong).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QDeniyscslkC&pg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=Globalization of Language and Culture in Asia: The Impact of Globalization Processes on Language |page=21 |editor= Viniti Vaish |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |year= 2010 |isbn=978-1847061836 }}</ref>\n[[File:Chinesemusicians.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese musicians at a restaurant in Shanghai]]\n\n===Chinese orchestra===\n{{main|Chinese orchestra}}\n\nThere was a tradition of massed instruments in the ritual court music form known as ''[[yayue]]'' since the [[Zhou Dynasty]].   This music may be played by a handful of musicians, or there may be more than 200 for example during the [[Song Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=02rFSecPhEsC&pg=PA261#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The Harvard Dictionary of Music |editor= Don Michael Randel |pages=261\u2013262 |publisher=Harvard University Press |edition=4th |year= 2003 |isbn=978-0674011632 }}</ref>  During the Tang Dynasty there were also large-scale presentations of banquet music called ''yanyue'' ({{zh|t=\u71d5\u6a02|labels=no}}) in the court. The Tang imperial court may have up to ten different orchestras, each performing a different kind of music.  It also had a large outdoor band of nearly 1,400 performers.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyVgZMAiUoC&pg=PA24#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A Cultural History of the Chinese Language |author= Sharron Gu |page=24 |publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn= 9780786488278 |date=2011-12-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe modern [[Chinese orchestra]] however was created in the 20th century modeled on Western [[symphony orchestra]] using Chinese instruments.  In the traditional ''yanyue'', a single [[Homophony|dominant melodic line]] was favored, but the new music and arrangements of traditional melodies created for this modern orchestra is more [[Polyphony|polyphonic]] in nature.\n\n===Instruments and tuning===\nMany traditional instruments underwent changes in the early to mid 20th century which has a profound effect on the performance and sound of Chinese music, and a western [[equal temperament]] is now used to tune most traditional instruments, which to modern ears seem less harsh and more harmonious but which also robs the instruments of their [[Chinese musicology|traditional voices]]. To ears now used to hearing modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings can sound out of tune and discordant.\n\nIn order to accommodate Western system, changes were made to the instruments, for example in the ''[[pipa]]'' the number of frets was increased to 24, based on the 12 tone equal temperament scale, with all the intervals being semitones.\n\nThere is also a need to [[concert pitch|standardize the tuning]] when the instruments are played in an orchestra, which in turn may also affect how the instrument is made.  For example, traditionally ''[[Dizi (instrument)|dizi]]'' is made by using a solid piece of bamboo which made it impossible to change the fundamental tuning once the bamboo is cut. This issue was resolved in the 1920s by the insertion of a copper joint to connect two pieces of shorter bamboo, which allows the length of the bamboo to be modified so that minute adjustment to its fundamental pitch can be made.<ref name=\"paradigm\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=GxCF5Q3BvYgC&pg=PA212&lpg=PA212#v=onepage&q&f=false |last=Lau |first=Frederick|title=Beyond the May Fourth Paradigm: In Search of Chinese Modernity |editor= Kai-wing Chow |publisher= Lexington Books |year= 2008 |pages=212\u2013215 |isbn=978-0739111222 }}</ref> The [[Xindi (instrument)|Xindi]], \"new flute\", is a 1930s redesign of the Chinese flute incorporating western influences on the basis of equal temperament.\n\nIn order to achieve a greater vibrancy and loudness with instruments (not to mention longevity), many string instruments are no longer strung with silk but with steel or nylon. For example, metal strings began to be used in place of the traditional silk ones in the 1950s for ''pipa'', resulting in a change in the sound of the ''pipa'' which became brighter and stronger.<ref name=\"danwei\">[http://www.danwei.com/the-pipa-how-a-barbarian-lute-became-a-national-symbol/ The pipa: How a barbarian lute became a national symbol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613213913/http://www.danwei.com/the-pipa-how-a-barbarian-lute-became-a-national-symbol/ |date=2011-06-13 }}</ref>\n\n===Notation===\n{{main|Chinese musical notation}}\nBefore the 20th century Chinese used the [[gongche]] notation system, in modern times the [[Numbered musical notation|Jianpu]] system is common.  Western [[staff notation]] however is also used.\n\n===Performance===\nIn common with the music traditions of other Asian cultures, such as Persia and India, one strand of traditional Chinese music consists of a repertoire of traditional melodies, together known as [[qupai]], in which [[tempo]] and [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]] vary according to the mood of the instrumentalist, the audience, and their reaction to what is being played, the same melody can be used to serve many different roles be it merry, melancholic or martial (this can be glimpsed in the love theme of the [[Butterfly Lovers' Violin Concerto]] where the same melody at different points in the lover's story reflects elation, turbulence and dejection). Many modern performers now play pieces by following a [[Sheet music|score]] in a standard way rather than in the changeable [[Human self-reflection|reflective]] individual way of tradition, this can at times lead to the feeling that a performance has been rushed.\n\n==Modern popular music==\n\n=== Pop music ===\n{{main|C-pop|cantopop|mandopop}}\nChinese popular<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/cpoptop|title=Cpop World top Chart}}</ref> music found its beginnings in the ''[[shidaiqu]]'' genre. The shidaiqu genre was founded by Li Jinhui in mainland China and was influenced by Western jazz artists like Buck Clayton. After the takeover by the Communist in China, popular music were denounced as [[Yellow Music]], a form of [[pornography]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Broughton, Simon |author2=Ellingham, Mark |author3=Trillo, Richard |year=2000 |title=World Music: The Rough Guide |publisher=Rough Guides Publishing Company |isbn=978-1-85828-636-5 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QzX8THIgRjUC&pg=PA49#v=onepage&q&f=true }}</ref> and record companies of Shanghai such as [[Baak Doi]] in 1952 left China.<ref name=\"Shoesmith\">Shoesmith, Brian.

However, for a time the government still have a censorious attitude toward pop music; for example, Hong Kong's icon [[Anita Mui]] was banned from returning to the mainland concert stage after performing the song \"Bad Girl\" during the 1990s in China as punishment for what the Chinese government called her rebellious attitude.<ref name=\"Baranovitch\">Baranovitch, Nimrod.

Although Chinese perform rap in different dialects and languages, most Chinese hip hop artists perform in China's most popular language: Mandarin.\n\nCantonese rap is also very diverse in cities such as Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Hong Kong.\n\n==Rock and heavy metal==\n{{main|Chinese rock}}\nThe [[Peking All-Stars]] were a rock band formed in Beijing in 1979, by foreigners then resident in the Chinese capital.\n\nThe widely acknowledged forefather of Chinese rock is [[Cui Jian]].<ref name=\"Gunde\" /> In the late 1980s he played the first Chinese rock song called: \"[[Nothing To My Name]]\" (\"Yi wu suo you\"). It was the first time an [[electric guitar]] was used in China.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} He became the most famous performer of the time, and by 1988 he performed at a concert broadcast worldwide in conjunction with the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Summer Olympic Games]].<ref name=\"Gunde\" /> His socially critical lyrics earned him the anger of the government and many of his concerts were banned or cancelled. After the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], he played with a red blindfold around his head as an action against the government.\n\nFollowing, two bands became famous [[Hei Bao (band)|Hei Bao]] (Black Panther) and [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]]. Both started during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Hei Bao is an old-school rock band whose first CD, ''Hei Bao'' used the popular English song (\"Don't Break My Heart\"). [[Tang Dynasty (band)|Tang Dynasty]] was the first Chinese [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band. Its first CD \"A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty\" combines elements of traditional [[Chinese opera]] and old school heavy metal. The album was a major breakthrough releasing around 1991/1992.\n\nAround 1994\u201396: the first [[thrash metal]] band, Chao Zai ([[Overload (Chinese rock band)|Overload]]), was formed. They released three CDs, the last one in cooperation with pop singer [[Gao Qi (musician)|Gao Chi]] of the split-up band [[The Breathing]]. At the same time the first [[nu metal]] bands were formed and inspired by Western bands such as [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]] or [[Linkin Park]]. China would have their own with [[Yaksa (band)|Yaksa]], [[Niuqu De Jiqi (band)|Twisted Machine]], [[AK-47 (band)|AK-47]], [[Overheal Tank]].\n\n[[Black metal]] is becoming a prominent scene in mainland China, particularly [[central China]].\n\n=== Punk rock and post-punk ===\n[[Punk rock]] first emerged in China in the early 1990s as records from Western punk and [[post-punk]] bands were imported into mainland China for the first time. One of the earliest and most renowned punk-influenced Chinese artists was [[He Yong (rock musician)|He Yong]] whose debut album ''Garbage Dump'' was released in 1994.\n\nFormed in Nanjing in 1997, post-punk group [[P.K. 14]] are regarded as the most important band in the development of Chinese experimental rock music. The band moved to Beijing in 2001 and released their first album 'Upstairs, Turn Left' the same year. P.K. 14's singer-songwriter Yang Haisong (\u6768\u6d77\u5d27) has also produced many of the Chinese indie music scene's most celebrated albums (including [[Carsick Cars]]' 2007 eponymous debut album), working with independent record labels such as [[Maybe Mars]] and [[Modern Sky]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maybemars.com/artists/p-k-14/|title=P.K.14 \u2013 Maybe Mars}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/2017/05/25/yang-haisong-feature/|title=Yang Haisong Is Producing a New Generation of Underground Chinese Rock|date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSince the early 2000s, Chinese indie music has grown considerably, with homegrown bands such as Carsick Cars, Birdstriking, Re-TROS, [[Brain Failure]], Demerit, Tookoo, AV Okubo, [[Hang on the Box]] and [[Genjing Records|Fanzui Xiangfa]] all embarking on international tours.\n\n==Western classical music==\nWhereas orchestras organised by, run solely by and nearly always exclusive to the expatriate community in China are recorded from the early days of the International Settlement in Shanghai (i.e. 1850s) and a Russian orchestra was in operation in Harbin from the early 20th century,<ref name=\"History of the Harbin Orchestra\">[http://www.jtdf.net/home.php?mod=space&uid=145&do=blog&id=82], additional text.</ref> the beginnings of a unique classical music tradition in China lie with the first foreign trained Chinese conductor, [[Zheng Zhisheng]] AKA (romanized) [[Yin Zizhong]].

The former provided the driving force and often the life force that kept a tradition alive through the Mao years, especially in his adopted city of Beijing, and the latter has been instrumental in maintaining a high standard of symphonic music, as well as working hard for the popularization of the tradition further into the fabric of Chinese culture, across his long career, which continues to the present. At the same time as this tradition has continued, new generations have sought to bring classical music in China along another path, away from the strict professionalism of the elite trained Li and Cao (who were both at the Russian conservatory in the 1950s) and towards a less nationalistic, but arguably more encompassing attitude towards the tradition. Most influential in this new movement has been the young Shanghai conductor [[Long Yu]].\n\n== Patriotic / revolutionary music ==\n[[File:PRCNationalanthemmusic.png|thumb|right|200px|A typical PRC national song album branded to be sold outside of mainland China.

{"title_page": "University of Ghana Medical Centre", "text_new": "<https://ugmedicalcentre.org>/<big>ABOUT US</big> \n\nThe University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC) is an ultra-modern medical centre offering world-class quaternary level health services in Ghana, West Africa and beyond. It is magnificently nestled on the southern part of the University of Ghana, the Country\u2019s premier university located in Legon, Accra and about ten minutes away from the Kotoka International Airport. The Centre seeks to embody the spirit of hospitality which Ghana is globally acclaimed for and is focused on delivering an excellent and unparalleled patient experience through the deployment of a customer-obsessed approach throughout every facet of its operations.\n\n<big>FOCUS AREAS</big>\n\nService Delivery\n\nOur goal here is to promote favourable healthcare outcomes through innovative, customer-centred, cost-effective and high-quality processes. By keeping healthcare providers and patients motivated, we inch closer to realizing these goals.\n\n<big>Medical Training & Simulation</big>\n\nThe UGMC Medical Training and Simulation Centre is one of the biggest training centres in the Africa and is committed towards showcasing state of the art medical simulation technology  to the next generation of health care practitioners as well as  towards marketing   specific and customized simulation programmes to corporate organizations and entities in Ghana and beyond. \n\n<big>Research</big>\n\nThe Office in collaboration with the University of Ghana will be conducting joint reearch at the Centre. \n\n<big>HISTORY</big> \n\nThe vision of setting up the University of Ghana Medical Centre (UGMC) originated at the inception of the University of Ghana Medical School in 1964 when the University entertained the notion of establishing a \u2018Medical Village\u2019 of excellence on Legon campus for training all categories of health professionals for the country. This vision was kept alive over the years through the allocation of over 400 acres of University land for the Project and also through the establishment of the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR) and the School of Public Health as the initial institutions to be sited on the land in the Master Plan for the Medical Village.\nThe plans for expanding medical education at the University of Ghana to include other health professions gradually took off with the decision to in addition to the University of Ghana Medical School, start a Dental School in 1974, School of Public health in 1994, a School of Allied Health Sciences in 2000, a School of Nursing in 2003, and finally, a School of Pharmacy in 2007. These institutions currently form the College of Health Sciences established by the University Council in January 2000.\nUpon the initiation of a request for a loan from the Government of Ghana by the University of Ghana, the Government of Ghana acquired a loan from Israel for the University of Ghana Medical Centre project. The processes for the establishment of the Centre were commenced by the Education, Finance and Health Ministries and the commercial contract was ultimately signed by the Ministry of Health in November 2012. The actual construction of the Centre was commenced during the tenure of late former Ghanaian President, His Excellency Prof. John Evans Atta Mills in April 2013. Phase I of the UGMC Project, which had the Sheba Medical Centre based in Israel as medical planning consultants to the project was inaugurated by former President of Ghana, His Excellency John Mahama in 2017.\nWhilst awaiting the signing of the commercial agreement to kick-start Phase II of the Project, the Centre began partial operations in 2018 during the tenure of current president, His Excellency Nana Akufo Addo Danquah. Consequently, services commenced in three OPD clinics of the Centre namely the Paediatric, Obstetrics & Gynaecology and Family Medicine units. The  OPD Pharmacy, Laboratory and Ambulance services were also launched whilst Administrative, Human Resource, Finance, Customer Relations, Accounting, Maintenance, I.T. support systems and service protocols were implemented to enable the Centre scale up on the services to be provided toward the end of 2019. In November 2019, one hundred and eighty-one (181) additional staff of which 67% are medical personnel, were recruited and appointed by the Ministry of Health to work at the Centre.\nThe UGMC project is expected to be completed in February 2021.\n\n<big>CURRENT SERVICES (PARTIAL OPERATIONS)</big>\n\n* Bulleted list item\nObstetrics & Gynaecology\n* Bulleted list item\nPediatrics\n* Bulleted list item\nNeonatology\n* Bulleted list item\nCritical Care\n* Bulleted list item\nFamily Medicine\n* Bulleted list item\nGeneral Surgery\n* Bulleted list item\nInternal Medicine\n* Bulleted list item\nEmergency Medicine\n* Bulleted list item\nNeurology (OPD)\n* Bulleted list item\nDiagnostics\n* Bulleted list item\nPharmacy\n* Bulleted list item\nDietetics and Nutrition\n* Bulleted list item\nPhysiotherapy\nAmbulance Services\n* Bulleted list item\nMedical Training & Simulation Programmes\n\n<big>UPCOMING SERVICES (PHASE II)</big>\n\n* Bulleted list item\nDental Clinic\n* Bulleted list item\nGynaecological Clinic and ER\n* Bulleted list item\nPaediatric Clinic\n* Bulleted list item\nPaediatric ICU & Ward\n* Bulleted list item\nPaediatric Surgery Ward\n* Bulleted list item\nPaediatric Emergency\n* Bulleted list item\nPrivate Surgical Ward\n* Bulleted list item\nPrivate Labour and Delivery\n* Bulleted list item\nIVF\n* Bulleted list item\nENT\n* Bulleted list item\nUrology\n* Bulleted list item\nOncology\n* Bulleted list item\nNeurology\n* Bulleted list item\nNeurosurgery\n* Bulleted list item\nNeurosurgey ICU\n* Bulleted list item\nCardiology\n* Bulleted list item\nOphthalmology\n* Bulleted list item\nDialysis Unit\n* Bulleted list item\nOrthopaedics Ward\n\n<big>Diagnostics</big>\n* Bulleted list item\nMRI\n* Bulleted list item\nAngiography\n\n\n\n<big>-April 2020-</big><www.https://ugmedicalcentre.org>\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox hospital|name=University of Ghana Medical Centre|location=University of Ghana|region=Greater Accra|country=Ghana|affiliation=University of Ghana|emergency=yes|beds=650|website=https://ugmc.ug.edu.gh/}}\n\nThe '''University of Ghana Medical Centre''' is a quaternary medical and research centre located on the campus of the [[University of Ghana]] in [[Accra]], Ghana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/University-of-Ghana-Medical-Center-to-open-on-July-18-Government-667926|title=UG Medical Center to begin operations on July 18|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/UG-Medical-Centre-to-begin-operations-Government-656609|title=UG Medical Centre to begin operations \u2013 Government|website=www.ghanaweb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe establishment of the University of Ghana Medical center was conceived by the faculty and administration of the [[University of Ghana]] and initiated under the Late President John Evans Atta-Mills<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/3335-president-mahama-inaugurates-university-of-ghana-medical-centre|title=President Mahama inaugurates University of Ghana Medical Centre - Government of Ghana|website=www.ghana.gov.gh|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-15}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ghana-stub}}\n\n{{coord missing|Ghana}}\n\n[[Category:University of Ghana]]\n[[Category:Hospitals in Ghana]]\n", "name_user": "UNIVERSITY OF GHANA MEDICAL CENTRE", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Ghana_Medical_Centre"}

It is based on the 1958 novel [[Dr. No (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it is the first film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975.\n\nIn the film, [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Julius No|Dr. No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was not the first of Fleming's novels. ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nProduced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of \"secret agent\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No'': the film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]].<ref>{{cite episode |date=2 April 2020 |title=Spies |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gwzj |series=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |series-link=Mark Kermode's Secrets of Cinema |network=BBC |station=BBC Four |series-number=2 |number=3 |time=13:26 |access-date=3 April 2020}}</ref> It also established the iconic \"James Bond\" theme music.

They steal documents related to \"Crab Key\" and \"Doctor No\". In response, [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, instructs agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]].\n\nOn his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car pursuing them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a [[cyanide]] capsule hidden in a cigarette.\n\nAt Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, [[Felix Leiter]], a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.\n\nIn Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he [[wikt:assay|assayed]] the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. Dent subsequently visits Dr. No, who expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond, as well as by visiting him in daylight, and orders him to try again with a [[tarantula]], which is released into Bond's bedroom at night. Bond survives, kills the poisonous spider and sets a trap for Dent, whom he interrogates and kills.\n\nUsing a [[Geiger counter]], Bond detects [[radioactive]] traces in Quarrel's boat where Strangways' mineral samples had been. Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], dressed only in a [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], who is collecting shells. Ryder leads Bond and Quarrel inland to an open swamp contaminated by radiation. After nightfall, they are attacked by the \"dragon\" of Crab Key, which is, in reality, a [[flamethrower]]-equipped tank. In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated and killed, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. He reveals that he is a former member of a Chinese crime [[Tong (organization)|Tong]], from whom he stole ten million dollars, and is now an operative of the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] ('''SP'''ecial '''E'''xecutive for '''C'''ounter-intelligence, '''T'''errorism, '''R'''evenge, and '''E'''xtortion), after being rejected by both the Americans and the Soviets. He plans to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. He tries to recruit Bond into SPECTRE but fails. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.\n\nBond is imprisoned in a holding cell but escapes by crawling through an air vent which is heated and then flooded. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear [[pool reactor]]. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him, as the scientist is unable to climb out due to his metal hands. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a [[Royal Navy]] ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], a British MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Honey Ryder]], A local shell diver, making a living by selling Jamaican seashells to dealers in Miami.\n**Andress' spoken dialogue was dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]<ref name=\"Dr. No 1962 - Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html|title=Dr. No (1962) \u2013 Cast|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>, and her singing voice was dubbed by [[Diana Coupland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm|title=Actress Diana Coupland dies at 74|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=7 June 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref> Both were uncredited.\n* [[Joseph Wiseman]] as [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]], a reclusive member of [[SPECTRE]]\n* [[Jack Lord]] as [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] operative sent to liaise with James Bond while he is in Kingston.\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of the British Secret Service.\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Professor R.J.

Instead, [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] wanted the rights to the novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not want to sell the rights to Broccoli and instead, they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \"too British\" or \"too blatantly sexual\".{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} Eventually the two received authorisation from [[United Artists]] to produce ''Dr. No'', to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films, and [[Eon Productions]], which was to produce them.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.<ref name=\"DNB: A.

They finally signed [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] who had a long background with Broccoli's [[Warwick Films]] as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you [[Taking the piss|take the mickey out]], put the [[tongue-in-cheek|tongue out in the cheek]], it seems to disarm.\"<ref>{{cite video|last=Young|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Young (director)|title=Audio commentary |location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million.

My budget was \u00a314,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's [[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington]], which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display.<ref name=\"The Guardian 17 September 2005\">{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features| date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=10 March 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Writing ===\nBroccoli had originally hired [[Richard Maibaum]] and his friend [[Wolf Mankowitz]] to write ''Dr. No''{{'}}s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=158}} An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\" /> [[Johanna Harwood]] and thriller writer [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script.{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} Terence Young described Harwood as a [[script doctor]] who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.<ref name=comm/> Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she claimed both her screenplays for ''Dr. No'' and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novels closely.<ref>''Johanna Harwood Interview'' ''Movie Classics # 4'' Solo Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nDuring the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; ''Dr. No'' has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n==== James Bond ====\nWhile producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought [[Cary Grant]] for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Johnson Interview|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/1524-RICHARD-JOHNSON-ON-DECLINING-THE-ROLE-OF-JAMES-BOND.html|work=[[Cinema Retro]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was [[Patrick McGoohan]] on the strength of his portrayal of spy [[John Drake (Danger Man)|John Drake]] in the television series ''[[Danger Man]]'': McGoohan turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=Obituary: Patrick McGoohan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/14/television2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2009}}</ref> Another potential Bond included [[David Niven]], who played the character in the 1967 parody ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}}\n\nThere are several [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]] stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted.

It was later reprinted in the United States by [[DC Comics]] as part of its ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |first=Mark |last=Evanier |authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=NewsFromme.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208081002/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html|archivedate=8 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|salign=right|It is because of [Ken Adam] that people believe criminal masterminds operate from the insides of dormant volcanoes and travel between their sumptuously decorated lairs on chrome-plated monorails.

It is based on the 1958 novel [[Dr. No (novel)|of the same name]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. Starring [[Sean Connery]], [[Ursula Andress]], [[Joseph Wiseman]], and [[Jack Lord]], it is the first film in the [[List of James Bond films|''James Bond'' series]], and was adapted by [[Richard Maibaum]], [[Johanna Harwood]], and [[Berkely Mather]]. The film was produced by [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], a partnership that continued until 1975.\n\nIn the film, [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] is sent to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]] to investigate the disappearance of a fellow British agent. The trail leads him to the underground base of [[Julius No|Dr. No]], who is plotting to disrupt an early American space launch from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] with a radio beam weapon. Although it was the first of the Bond books to be made into a film, ''Dr. No'' was not the first of Fleming's novels. ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' was the debut for the character; however, the film makes a few references to threads from earlier books. This film makes reference to later books in the series as well, such as the criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]], which was not introduced until the 1961 novel ''[[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]]''.\n\nProduced on a low budget, ''Dr. No'' was a financial success. While the film received a mixed critical reaction upon release, it has gained a reputation over time as one of the series' best instalments.<!-- DO NOT CHANGE THE SPELLING OF INSTALMENTS - this is an article written in British English and retains the correct spelling --> ''Dr. No'' also launched a genre of \"secret agent\" films that flourished in the 1960s. The film also spawned a [[Dr. No (comics)|comic book adaptation]] and [[Dr. No (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] as part of its promotion and marketing.\n\nMany of the iconic aspects of a typical James Bond film were established in ''Dr. No'': the film begins with an introduction to the character through the [[Gun barrel sequence|view of a gun barrel]] and a highly stylised main title sequence, both of which were created by [[Maurice Binder]]. It also established the iconic \"James Bond\" theme music. [[Production designer]] [[Ken Adam]] established an elaborate visual style that is one of the hallmarks of the film series.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- ATTENTION!

They steal documents related to \"Crab Key\" and \"Doctor No\". In response, [[M (James Bond)|M]], the head of MI6, instructs agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]] to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] by [[Radar jamming and deception|radio jamming]].\n\nOn his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to [[King's House, Jamaica|Government House]]. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car pursuing them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a [[cyanide]] capsule hidden in a cigarette.\n\nAt Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named [[Quarrel (James Bond)|Quarrel]], whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, [[Felix Leiter]], a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.\n\nIn Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he [[wikt:assay|assayed]] the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks. Dent subsequently visits Dr. No, who expresses displeasure at Dent's failure to kill Bond, as well as by visiting him in daylight, and orders him to try again with a [[tarantula]], which is released into Bond's bedroom at night. Bond survives, kills the poisonous spider and sets a trap for Dent, whom he interrogates and kills.\n\nUsing a [[Geiger counter]], Bond detects [[radioactive]] traces in Quarrel's boat where Strangways' mineral samples had been. Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him to Crab Key. There Bond meets the beautiful [[Honey Rider|Honey Ryder]], dressed only in a [[White bikini of Ursula Andress|white bikini]], who is collecting shells. Ryder leads Bond and Quarrel inland to an open swamp contaminated by radiation. After nightfall, they are attacked by the \"dragon\" of Crab Key, which is, in reality, a [[flamethrower]]-equipped tank. In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated and killed, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.\n\nUpon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] metal hands due to radiation exposure. He reveals that he is a former member of a Chinese crime [[Tong (organization)|Tong]], from whom he stole ten million dollars, and is now an operative of the secret organisation  [[SPECTRE]] ('''SP'''ecial '''E'''xecutive for '''C'''ounter-intelligence, '''T'''errorism, '''R'''evenge, and '''E'''xtortion), after being rejected by both the Americans and the Soviets. He plans to disrupt the [[Project Mercury]] space launch from Cape Canaveral with his radio beam. He tries to recruit Bond into SPECTRE but fails. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards.\n\nBond is imprisoned in a holding cell but escapes by crawling through an air vent which is heated and then flooded. Disguising himself as a worker, he finds his way to Dr. No's control centre, which contains a nuclear [[pool reactor]]. As the American rocket lifts off, Bond overloads the reactor and knocks Dr. No into the reactor pool, killing him, as the scientist is unable to climb out due to his metal hands. Bond finds and frees Ryder, and the two escape the island in a boat as the entire lair explodes. After the boat runs out of fuel, they are rescued by Leiter, who arrives on a [[Royal Navy]] ship. As Bond and Ryder kiss, Bond lets go of the ship's tow rope.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col|colwidth=35em}}\n\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], a British MI6 agent, codename 007.\n* [[Ursula Andress]] as [[Honey Ryder]], A local shell diver, making a living by selling Jamaican seashells to dealers in Miami.\n**Andress' spoken dialogue was dubbed by [[Nikki van der Zyl]]<ref name=\"Dr. No 1962 - Cast\">{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/455547/credits.html|title=Dr. No (1962) \u2013 Cast|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=9 June 2011}}</ref>, and her singing voice was dubbed by [[Diana Coupland]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6136408.stm|title=Actress Diana Coupland dies at 74|date=10 November 2006|accessdate=7 June 2011|work=BBC News}}</ref> Both were uncredited.\n* [[Joseph Wiseman]] as [[Julius No|Dr. Julius No]], a reclusive member of [[SPECTRE]]\n* [[Jack Lord]] as [[Felix Leiter]], a [[CIA]] operative sent to liaise with James Bond while he is in Kingston.\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as [[M (James Bond)|M]]: The head of the British Secret Service.\n* [[Anthony Dawson]] as Professor R.J.

Instead, [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli]] wanted the rights to the novels and attempted to buy them from Saltzman. Saltzman did not want to sell the rights to Broccoli and instead, they formed a partnership to make the films. A number of Hollywood film studios did not want to fund the films, finding them \"too British\" or \"too blatantly sexual\".{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} Eventually the two received authorisation from [[United Artists]] to produce ''Dr. No'', to be released in 1962. Saltzman and Broccoli created two companies: [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films, and [[Eon Productions]], which was to produce them.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> The partnership between Broccoli and Saltzman lasted until 1975 when tensions during the filming of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' led to an acrimonious split and Saltzman sold his shares of Danjaq to United Artists.<ref name=\"DNB: A.

They finally signed [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] who had a long background with Broccoli's [[Warwick Films]] as the director. Broccoli and Saltzman felt that Young would be able to make a real impression of James Bond and transfer the essence of the character from book to film. Young imposed many stylistic choices for the character which continued throughout the film series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> Young also decided to inject much humour, as he considered that \"a lot of things in this film, the sex, and violence, and so on if played straight, a) would be objectionable, and b) we're never gonna go past the censors; but the moment you [[Taking the piss|take the mickey out]], put the [[tongue-in-cheek|tongue out in the cheek]], it seems to disarm.\"<ref>{{cite video|last=Young|first=Terence|authorlink=Terence Young (director)|title=Audio commentary |location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |year=1999|medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nThe producers asked United Artists for financing, but the studio would only put up $1 million.

My budget was \u00a314,500. I filled three stages at Pinewood full of sets while they were filming in Jamaica. It wasn't a real aquarium in Dr. No's apartment. It was a disaster to tell you the truth because we had so little money. We decided to use a rear-projection screen and get some stock footage of fish. What we didn't realise was because we didn't have much money the only stock footage they could buy was of goldfish-sized fish, so we had to blow up the size and put a line in the dialogue with Bond talking about the magnification. I didn't see any reason why Dr. No shouldn't have good taste so we mixed contemporary furniture and antiques. We thought it would be fun for him to have some stolen art so we used Goya's [[Portrait of the Duke of Wellington]], which was still missing at the time. I got hold of a slide from the National Gallery - this was on the Friday, shooting began on the Monday - and I painted a Goya over the weekend. It was pretty good so they used it for publicity purposes but, just like the real one, it got stolen while it was on display.<ref name=\"The Guardian 17 September 2005\">{{cite news |last= Dee |first= Johnny |title= Licensed to drill |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/sep/17/culture.features| date= 17 September 2005 |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |location=London| accessdate=10 March 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n=== Writing ===\nBroccoli had originally hired [[Richard Maibaum]] and his friend [[Wolf Mankowitz]] to write ''Dr. No''{{'}}s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=158}} An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Mankowitz left the film, and Maibaum then undertook a second version of the story, more closely in line with the novel. Mankowitz eventually had his name removed from the credits after viewing early rushes, as he feared it would be a disaster.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\" /> [[Johanna Harwood]] and thriller writer [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script.{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} Terence Young described Harwood as a [[script doctor]] who helped put elements more in tune with a British character.<ref name=comm/> Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' special on the making of the film that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects; she claimed both her screenplays for ''Dr. No'' and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novels closely.<ref>''Johanna Harwood Interview'' ''Movie Classics # 4'' Solo Publishing 2012</ref>\n\nDuring the series' decades-long history only a few of the films have remained substantially true to their source material; ''Dr. No'' has many similarities to the novel and follows its basic plot, but there are a few notable omissions. Major elements from the novel that are missing from the film include Bond's fight with a [[giant squid]], and the escape from Dr. No's complex using the dragon-disguised swamp buggy. Elements of the novel that were significantly changed for the film include the use of a (non-venomous) tarantula spider instead of a [[centipede]]; Dr. No's secret complex being disguised as a [[bauxite]] mine instead of a [[guano]] quarry; Dr. No's plot to disrupt [[NASA]] space launches from Cape Canaveral using a radio beam instead of disrupting US missile testing on Turks Island; the method of Dr. No's death by boiling in overheating [[nuclear reactor|reactor]] coolant rather than a burial under a chute of guano, and the introduction of SPECTRE, an organisation absent from the book.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}} Components absent from the novel but added to the film include the introduction of the Bond character in a gambling casino, the introduction of Bond's semi-regular girlfriend Sylvia Trench, a fight scene with an enemy chauffeur, a fight scene to introduce Quarrel, the seduction of Miss Taro, Bond's recurring CIA ally Felix Leiter, Dr. No's partner in crime Professor Dent and Bond's controversial cold-blooded killing of this character.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\nSometimes episodes in the novel retained in the film's altered narrative introduce elements of absurdity into the plot. Bond's \"escape\" from his cell via the air shaft, for instance, originally conceived as a ruse of Dr. No's to test Bond's skill and endurance, becomes an authentic break-out in the film. Features carried over from the novel's obstacle course, however, such as the torrent of water and scalding surface, have no logical justification in the script. Such incongruities recurred in subsequent Bond films.{{sfn|Smith|2002|p=19}}\n\n=== Casting ===\n\n==== James Bond ====\nWhile producers Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought [[Cary Grant]] for the role, they discarded the idea as Grant would be committed to only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who could be part of a series.<ref name=\"Inside Dr. No documentary\"/> [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]] has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave.<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Johnson Interview|url=http://www.cinemaretro.com/index.php?/archives/1524-RICHARD-JOHNSON-ON-DECLINING-THE-ROLE-OF-JAMES-BOND.html|work=[[Cinema Retro]]|accessdate=13 June 2011}}</ref> Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was [[Patrick McGoohan]] on the strength of his portrayal of spy [[John Drake (Danger Man)|John Drake]] in the television series ''[[Danger Man]]'': McGoohan turned down the role.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Dennis|title=Obituary: Patrick McGoohan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/jan/14/television2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 January 2009}}</ref> Another potential Bond included [[David Niven]], who played the character in the 1967 parody ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]''.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=202}}\n\nThere are several [[wikt:apocryphal|apocryphal]] stories as to whom Ian Fleming personally wanted.

While this is untrue, the contest itself did exist, and six finalists were chosen and screen-tested by Broccoli, Saltzman, and Fleming. The winner of the contest was a 28-year-old model named Peter Anthony, who, according to Broccoli, had a [[Gregory Peck]] quality, but proved unable to cope with the role.{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=31}} When Connery was invited to meet Broccoli and Saltzman he appeared scruffy and in unpressed clothes, but Connery \"put on an act and it paid off\" as he acted in the meeting with a macho, devil-may-care attitude.{{Sfn|Bray|2010|p=73}} When he left both Saltzman and Broccoli watched him through the window as he went to his car, both agreeing that he was the right man for Bond.{{Sfn|Bray|2010|p=74}} After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser,<ref name=gayson>{{cite video|last=Gayson|first=Eunice|authorlink=Eunice Gayson|title=Audio commentary|location=Dr. No (Ultimate Edition, 2006) |medium=DVD|year=1999 |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London.

Nodel, was published in the United Kingdom as part of the ''[[Classics Illustrated]]'' anthology series. It was later reprinted in the United States by [[DC Comics]] as part of its ''[[Showcase (comic book)|Showcase]]'' anthology series, in January 1963. This was the first American comic book appearance of James Bond and is noteworthy for being a relatively rare example of a British comic being reprinted in a fairly high-profile American comic. It was also one of the earliest comics to be censored on racial grounds (some skin tones and dialogue were changed for the American market).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html |title=Secrets Behind the Comics |first=Mark |last=Evanier |authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=NewsFromme.com |date=3 December 2006 |accessdate=20 July 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208081002/http://www.newsfromme.com/archives/2006_12_03.html|archivedate=8 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|salign=right|It is because of [Ken Adam] that people believe criminal masterminds operate from the insides of dormant volcanoes and travel between their sumptuously decorated lairs on chrome-plated monorails.
