The program airs 20 hours a week on roughly 200 stations.  Its focus is geopolitics, economics, war, history, hard sciences, literature, private space, whimsy, etc.  Historically, it carried nightly (Mon-Fri) the \"Loftus Report\" featuring the intelligence commentator [[John Loftus (author)|John Loftus]] on current, war-related, open-source intelligence. [[Aaron Klein]], at the time Jerusalem bureau chief for WorldNetDaily, was also a regular and served as a co-host.

The program daily featured reports from journalists who filed with the world's most respected press outlets, and the show was reliably a few days ahead of the news cycle.\n\nWhen John Batchelor occasionally took a break for several evenings, the show was often hosted by [[Jed Babbin]], editor of ''[[Human Events]]'' in Washington, D.C.; sometimes by the former BBC journalist John Terrett, who now works for [[al Jazeera]]; and by [[Larry Kudlow]] of CNBC's ''[[Kudlow & Company]]'' and WABC's ''Larry Kudlow Show''. In 2012, Simon Constable of Dow Jones; Chris Riback, author and researcher, and Francis Rose of Federal News Radio in Washington, D.C., became primary fill-ins.\n\nBatchelor's show featured multiple guests, and shows were preceded by and interspersed with news clips and music. The show focussed on myriad topics, including politics, the [[war on terror]], [[nuclear proliferation]], the UN, African civil wars, [[History of the United States|American history]], [[space exploration]] and even Hollywood scandals. The ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' has an audio archive of ''Batchelor and Alexander'' segments from 2002 and 2003 that deal with Israel and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/AmericasVoices/ba_01.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903153251/http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/AmericasVoices/ba_01.html |archivedate=September 3, 2006 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nTo report on breaking news, Batchelor and his executive producer have travelled domestically to hotspots, and to Azerbaijan, Qatar, Israel, Jordan, [[Kazakhstan]], Uzbekistan, France, Poland and Taiwan.

The Moamorias were the followers of the Moamaria sattra that was primarily Morans (the mainstay of the Ahom militia), the Sonowal Kacharis (gold-washers), [[Chutia people|Chutia]]s (expert archers and matchlockmen), professional castes such as Hiras (potters), Tantis (weavers), Kaibartas and [[Ahom people|Ahom]] nobles and officers.<ref>{{harvcol|Baruah|1993|p=53}}</ref> The rising popularity of Moamorias sattras has siphoned off the power of orthodox Hindu groups and the other powerful Shakti worship sect which supported the Ahom kings. They provided refuge for those seeking to escape the Paik system under which, any abled bodied person who was not a Brahmin or a noble could be used for labour, services or conscripted into the army. The [[Ahom kingdom]] was entering a crisis, as the [[Paik system]] on which the state was based was unable to adapt to the changing economy and the emerging social classes.  The rise of the sattras was one of the reason for the leakage of manpower from the Paik system, and as a result the Ahom kingdom and the sattras came into increasing conflict.  Moamara sattra, with its adherents from the [[Chutia]] and Moran tribes, were followers of the non-conformist Kala-samhati sect that competed against the royalist sattras belonging to other sects.  The Ahom kingdom watched the growth of this sattra with discomfort and heaped insult and repression on the followers of this sattra. The Moamoria Rebellion started during the reign of [[Swargadeo]] [[Lakshmi Singha]] and ended during the reign of Swargadeo [[Kamaleswar Singha]]. It continued up to 36 years, from 1769 to 1805.\n\nIn the course of time, the Moamoria guru compromised with the Ahom rulers and the rebels drew inspiration from magico-religious cult of night worshipers, a mixture of tribal fertility rites and [[Tantrism]].<ref>{{Harvcol|Guha|1991|pp=124\u2013125}}</ref>\n\n===Sattra-Ahom conflict===\n[[Srimanta Sankardeva]] established the [[Mahapuruxiya Dharma]] in the 16th century, a proselytizing religion that opened itself to all including the Muslims and tribesmen.  The religion provided opportunities for social and economic improvements to common tribesmen, and the sattras provided a safe haven from mandatory labor under the [[Paik system]].\n\nThe Ahom rulers saw a threat and Sankardeva himself had to escape to the [[Koch kingdom]] during the reign of Suklenmung to avoid persecution.  A later king, [[Prataap Singha]], demolished the Kalabari and Kuruabahi sattras and his successors followed a similar policy of oppression.  Jayadhwaj Singha reversed this policy and his successors up to Sulikphaa Lora Roja tried to come to terms with the sattras.  This policy was again reversed during the reign of [[Gadadhar Singha]], who began persecuting the sattras.  His son, [[Rudra Singha]] tried to isolate the more liberal&mdash;and thus most threatening to the Ahom state&mdash;of the non-Brahmin sattras by encouraging the Brahmin sattras.  When he realized this policy was not bearing fruit, he initiated a policy to accord state support to saktism, the historical and theological ''bete noire'' of the Mahapuruxiya dharma, to contain further sattra influence.  This led to more persecutions, the most notable under Bor Roja Phuleshwari Kunwonri during the reign of [[Siba Singha]]. This unresolved conflict finally exploded into the Moamoria rebellion in the 18th century that so weakened the Ahom kingdom that it collapsed in the 19th century.\n\n==First phase==\nOn September 15, 1769, Ragh Neog, a leading disciple of the sattra, was flogged by Ahom officials for not supplying the required number of elephants.  By November, the Mataks led by Ragh Neog, Naharkhora Saikia and his two wives Radha and Rukmini, promised the throne to three Ahom princes (Mohanmala, a brother, and two others, nephews of Lakshmi Singha the king) and with their help liberated the territory north of the Burhidihing river.  On November 21, 1769 the rebels occupied the Ahom capital and placed Ramananda, son of Naharkhora, on the throne.  The Ahom king, [[Lakshmi Singha]], was captured and kept a prisoner.  All high officers were executed and three common Mataks became the three great Gohains.  Ragh Neog became the [[Borbarua]], a ''kanri paik'' became the [[Borphukan]] and two common Ahoms became the Gohains at Sadiya and Marangi.\n\nThe rebels, inexperienced in statecraft, failed to usher in a new order.  Instead, they began imitating their erstwhile leaders.  Ragh Neog seized the wives and daughters of many nobles and kept them in his harem.  As some of the rebel officers took on the airs of the old nobility, many rebels were dissatisfied and, led by Govinda Gaoburha, left the capital and reached Sagunmuri.  Taking advantage of this, some of the old nobility killed Ragh on April 14, 1770 with the help of [[Kuranganayani]], an Ahom queen from Manipur, and retook the capital.  In the purge that followed, Ramananda the rebel king, Naharkhora, Radha, Rukmini, Astabhujdev, the Moamara sattradhikar and his son Saptabhuj were all executed.\n\nAfter the capital was recaptured the remaining rebel forces in Sagunmuri under Govinda Gaoburha attempted to overthrow the king again.  This movement too had the signs of a popular uprising.  The main weapons used by the rebels were bamboo staff and clubs, and their slogan was ''praja-oi joroiroa, chekani-oi sopai dhora'' (\"Ye' oppressed subjects, hold your stave close\"), and this uprising was called ''chekani kubua ron'' (\"The war of the staves\").  In one of the engagements, the Borpatrogohain and the Dhekial Phukan were killed, and the Borgohain made a hair breath escape.  The rebels advanced toward Rangpur and they were met at Thowra by the forces of the Burhagohain, the new Borpatrogohain, the Borgohain and a detachment cavalry from the Manipur king.  In this battle the rebels were defeated; Govinda Gaoburha was captured and executed,<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|1993|p=72}}</ref>\n\nSome rebels then retreated deep into jungles and continued guerilla warfare under leaders like Lephera, Parmananda and others.  An initial royalist force under the Na-Phukan and the Deka-Phukan was defeated, but a later force under the Borpatrogohain was able to eliminate Lephera and Parmananda.  Subsequently, the Burhagohain began systematically destroying the villages and along with that the remaining leaders and in a seize many rebels and their families died of starvation.  The remaining people were then separated and settled at different places.  One of the last holdouts, Nomal, was finally captured and executed.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|1993|p=73}}</ref>  This ended the first phase of the Moamoria rebellion.\n\n==Second phase==\nIn April 1783 an armed group of rebels attacked [[Rangpur (Ahom capital)|Rangpur]] and [[Garhgaon]].  The rebels were repulsed and a general massacre of Morans followed that continued for a month and a half.\n[[File:Post Medieval Coin, Rupee from Assam (FindID 469667).jpg|thumb|240px|Silver rupee struck during the rebellion.]]\nIn 1786 Harihar Tanti raised an army of Moamarias and Dafla-Bahatiyas.  A contingent of the rebels freed Pitambar, a grandson of the late Moamara sattradhikar, who was in the custody of Auniati sattra.  The rebels encircled Rangpur and on January 19, 1788 the king [[Gaurinath Singha]] and the inhabitants of the capital fled.  The captured region was locally administered with Harihar Tanti in the north bank of the [[Brahmaputra]], Howha ruling [[Majuli]], Sarbananda ruling the Moran tracts from Bengmara (present-day [[Tinsukia]]).  Bharat was made the king.  Coins were struck regularly in Bharat's and Sarbananda's names.  Purnananda Burhagohain tried to regroup but soon gave up, and established himself in Jorhat, the vanguard of the royalist forces.  Other Ahom nobles camped in Darrang and the king in Nagaon where he had to face dissensions and as a result had to move from Nagaon to Guwahati on June 11, 1792.\n\nThe counterattacks began around 1792, when Bharat repulsed an attack from the Manipuri king.  In 1792 Thomas Welsh of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] came to the aid with 550 well trained and well armed troops.  He occupied Guwahati on November 24, 1792 without any resistance and on March 18, 1794, restored Rangpur to Gaurinath Singha.  After they received the prize money, Thomas Welsh returned to Bengal on May 25, 1794.  Gaurinath Singha died in Jorhat in 1794 and was succeeded by [[Kamaleswar Singha]].  The rebels continued to suffer reverses.\n\n==Third phase==\n\nThe third phase of the rebellion was very important because during this time the Moamoriyas attacked the Ahom Kingdom once again.\n\n==End==\nThis experience and the military display by Thomas Welsh and his troops encouraged the Ahoms to create a standing army of mostly paid Hindustani sepoys to replace the ''paik'' based militia.  Phopai, a rebel was killed in 1796 and Bharat, the rebel king in 1799.  Sadiya fell to the royalists in 1800.  Despite many attempts in 1802 and 1806, Sarbananda held out from Bengmara.  He was finally given the title of Barsenapati, and the Matak territory conceded to him.\n\nThe Moamaria rebellion thus ended with the creation of a near-independent Motak tract ruled by a Barsenapati and the near-end of the [[Paik system]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Citation |last=Baruah |first=S.

Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father's old barn to [[Avian incubation|incubate]]. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local Animal Regulation officer Glen Seifert on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that a private ordnance dictates that all [[domesticated animals|domestic]] geese must have their wings [[pinioning|pinioned]] (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.\n\nThomas decides to use an [[ultralight]] aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry, Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a [[bird sanctuary]] in [[North Carolina]], and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.\n\nAmy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy's aircraft and lands in an isolated forest. While the group goes off to search for the bird, Glen Seifert returns to the Alden farm and confiscates the other geese. The next day, an elaborate plan is staged to free the geese and start their migration to North Carolina.\n\nMaking an emergency landing at [[Niagara Falls Air Reserve Station]] in western  New York on the south shore of Lake Ontario, Amy and Thomas almost get arrested. They become national news, with residents cheering them on and offering the two a place to stay at night at each of their stops.\n\nWhen Thomas and Amy meet an old lady on a vendetta against goose shooting, Amy asks Thomas why he didn't visit her and her mother. Thomas reveals that he and Amy's mother were artists, and that his leaving was the lesser of the two evils compared to the conflict of interests that would arise between them if he'd stayed.\n\nThirty miles before reaching the bird sanctuary, Thomas's aircraft suffers a structural failure and crashes in a cornfield; having suffered a dislocated shoulder he tells Amy to finish the journey by herself. After Amy takes off and begins to head toward the sanctuary, Thomas hitchhikes to the bird sanctuary. While waiting for the geese, Thomas, Susan, David, Barry and many animal enthusiasts stand up to developers who are waiting to start the excavation of the site.\n\nAmy eventually appears with the geese, much to the joy of the townspeople and Amy's family, but to the dismay of the developers. The townspeople and the Aldens celebrate their victory. The following spring, all 16 geese safely return to the Aldens' farm on their own.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Jeff Daniels]] as Thomas Alden\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Amy Alden\n* [[Dana Delany]] as Susan Barnes\n* [[Terry Kinney]] as David Alden\n* [[Holter Graham]] as Barry Stickland\n* [[Jeremy Ratchford]] as Glen Seifert\n* Deborah Verginella as Aliane Alden\n* [[Michael J.

''Fly Away Home'' was released on September 13, 1996, by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\n''Fly Away Home'' dramatizes the actual experiences of [[Bill Lishman]] who, in 1986, started training [[Canada geese]] to follow his ultralight aircraft, and succeeded in leading their migration in 1993 through his program \"Operation Migration.\" The film is also based on the experience of Dr. [[William J.L.

Without Thomas, Susan, or her uncle David knowing, she takes the eggs and keeps them in a dresser in her father's old barn to [[Avian incubation|incubate]]. When the eggs have hatched, she is allowed to keep the goslings as pets. Thomas asks for help from local Animal Regulation officer Glen Seifert on how to care for the geese. Seifert comes over to the Alden house, and explains that the geese have [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on Amy as their mother. He explains that geese learn everything from their parents including migratory routes, but also warns Thomas that a private ordnance dictates that all [[domesticated animals|domestic]] geese must have their wings [[pinioning|pinioned]] (clipped) to render them flightless, which upsets Amy. Thomas throws Seifert off his property, only for Seifert to threaten the Aldens that if the birds start flying, he will have to confiscate them.\n\nThomas decides to use an [[ultralight]] aircraft to teach the birds to fly and show them their migratory routes, but quickly realizes the birds will only follow Amy. Aided by his friend Barry, Thomas teaches Amy how to fly an ultralight aircraft of her own, so she can teach the geese. David mentions knowing someone running a [[bird sanctuary]] in [[North Carolina]], and arranges for the geese to go to the sanctuary. The birds have to arrive before November 1, or the sanctuary will be torn down by developers who plan to turn it into a coastal housing development.\n\nAmy and Thomas practice flying the aircraft, but Igor, the weakest of the geese, who has a limp, accidentally hits the front of Amy's aircraft and lands in an isolated forest.
