Ethel Hallow makes a good first impression on the teachers. Mildred helps Maud, whose glasses were broken in the crash, get to school, but they both crash-land in the pond. They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam. Miss Cackle encourages her to do what she is good at, but she only manages to get 1%, due to filling her paper with drawings instead of answers, as her best subject is art. Miss Cackle's twin sister, Agatha, turns up, and Miss Cackle gives her permission to speak to Miss Hardbroom for an internet article. The students make their potions and Mildred successfully manages to levitate, after taking some of Ethel's pondweed from her dragon potion (due to Ethel having taken all of it), making Ethel wrongly turn into a worm.\n\n''First appearances'': [[Bella Ramsey]] as [[Mildred Hubble]], Meibh Campbell as Maud Spellbody, Jenny Richardson as [[Ethel Hallow]], Miriam Petche as Esmerelda Hallow, Tallulah Milligan as [[Drusilla Paddock]], Dagny Rollins as Felicity Foxglove, [[Clare Higgins]] as Miss Ada Cackle/Agatha Cackle, [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hecate Hardbroom, [[Wendy Craig]] as Miss Bat, [[Shauna Shim]] as Miss Drill, [[Kacey Ainsworth]] as Miss Gullet, [[Zita Sattar]] as Miss Tapioca and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Julie Hubble\n\n''Note'': Episode 1 and 2 aired in a 1 hour episode.\n|LineColor       = 69AFFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n|Title           = Tabby\n|DirectedBy      = Brian Grant\n|WrittenBy       = Emma Reeves\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|18|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cbbc/status/819213818|title=CBBC (@cbbc) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.334\n|ShortSummary    = On their first day, Mildred's phone is confiscated by Miss Hardbroom. The first years are assigned their houses and Maud is made head of the first year. The first years receive their cats and have their first flying lesson. Mildred's cat, Tabby, is scared of flying and Tabby causes her, Maud and Ethel to crash into trees. Miss Hardbroom decides to arrange a flying test for the class and Ethel tells Esmerelda she will help Mildred. When Mildred tries to train Tabby, Ethel offers to help and pours a bit of sardine juice on the broom tail. Ethel and Mildred pass their test, whilst Maud struggles with Midnight, however, Miss Hardbroom reveals Mildred and Maud's cats have been switched and Mildred is told she will be expelled.

Mildred tells Maud and Enid and when Miss Bat falls asleep while covering potions class, Mildred, Maud and Enid sneak off to the magic council to show support for Miss Cackle.

Miss Pentangle is summoned to Miss Cackle's office and admits she has been asked to be headmistress at Cackles as well as Pentangles. Miss Pentangle impresses the first years with her modern chanting and gives Mildred a power boost in order to perform an invisibility spell in potions. Sybil faints in chanting after performing a chant with confidence and Mildred confides in Miss Pentangle over wanting to get Miss Cackle reinstated. Mildred sneaks off to Miss Cackle's office during chanting to see the petition when her classmates say their parents never signed and Miss Pentangle watches Miss Cackle help Sybil with her spells and potions when she becomes emotional after struggling.

The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval. Esmerelda is forced to gain powers from the stone when Sybil has climbed out of the roof and on the verge of falling, which delights Ethel, but the stone dies.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25 <hr />26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 12 <hr />13\n|Title           = All Hallow's Eve\n|AltTitle        = The Big Freeze\n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.414\n|ShortSummary    = (All Hallow's Eve) Esmerelda attempts to give the powers back to the stone, but fails. Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers. The school is saved and later celebrates Halloween.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Series 3 (2019)===\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF36FF |overall=6 |series=6 |title=30 |director=14 |writer=20 |airdate=14 |viewers=10 |country=UK | viewersR=<ref name=\"BARB2\">[https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/ Weekly top programmes on four screens (from Sept 2018)] Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB)</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 27\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = The Wishing Star\n|DirectedBy      = Dirk Campbell\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|7|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2019/01/07|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.279\n|ShortSummary    = Mildred enters the Great Wizard\u2019s broomstick-flying contest to win a Wishing Star so she can wish her Mum magical, but trouble arises when she competes with her new stray dog rather than Tabby.

Ethel Hallow makes a good first impression on the teachers. Mildred helps Maud, whose glasses were broken in the crash, get to school, but they both crash-land in the pond. They tell Miss Hardbroom that Mildred was supposed to attend Pentangle's, but decided that Cackle's is better. Esmerelda Hallow, Ethel's older sister, gives the students a tour and Miss Cackle helps Mildred cope with the effects of a transfer spell. Mildred and Maud sneak off to look at the kittens and Ethel eavesdrops on them discussing how Mildred is not from a magical family. They lose a kitten, but find it in the kitchens. Later, Mildred struggles with the written exam. Miss Cackle encourages her to do what she is good at, but she only manages to get 1%, due to filling her paper with drawings instead of answers, as her best subject is art. Miss Cackle's twin sister, Agatha, turns up, and Miss Cackle gives her permission to speak to Miss Hardbroom for an internet article. The students make their potions and Mildred successfully manages to levitate, after taking some of Ethel's pondweed from her dragon potion (due to Ethel having taken all of it), making Ethel wrongly turn into a worm.\n\n''First appearances'': [[Bella Ramsey]] as [[Mildred Hubble]], Meibh Campbell as Maud Spellbody, Jenny Richardson as [[Ethel Hallow]], Miriam Petche as Esmerelda Hallow, Tallulah Milligan as [[Drusilla Paddock]], Dagny Rollins as Felicity Foxglove, [[Clare Higgins]] as Miss Ada Cackle/Agatha Cackle, [[Raquel Cassidy]] as Miss Hecate Hardbroom, [[Wendy Craig]] as Miss Bat, [[Shauna Shim]] as Miss Drill, [[Kacey Ainsworth]] as Miss Gullet, [[Zita Sattar]] as Miss Tapioca and [[Nicola Stephenson]] as Julie Hubble\n\n''Note'': Episode 1 and 2 aired in a 1 hour episode.\n|LineColor       = 69AFFF\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 3\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n|Title           = Tabby\n|DirectedBy      = Brian Grant\n|WrittenBy       = Emma Reeves\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2017|1|18|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/cbbc/status/819213818|title=CBBC (@cbbc) - Twitter|website=twitter.com}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|fix-attempted=yes|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.334\n|ShortSummary    = On their first day, Mildred's phone is confiscated by Miss Hardbroom.

She later reassures Miss Cackle and Mildred and Maud successfully disenchant Felicity, Miss Mould and Ethel and Ethel is angry with Mildred upon her return to school when she sees Esmerelda leaves with their dad.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 21\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n|Title           = Miss Cackle's Birthday\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Dermot Boyd\n|WrittenBy       = Matt Evans\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|2|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.298\n|ShortSummary    = Maud is acting as director for Miss Cackle's show for her birthday, but Maud is miserable when her best act is not that good. When Sybil, Clarice and Bea practise their broom dance, Ethel has a go at Sybil and Miss Hardbroom shows Miss Cackle a newspaper article about the recent failings at Cackles. Miss Hardbroom magics the second year to the potion lab when they spend their lesson practising for their show and when Maud contemplates resigning as director, Mildred and Enid work on a happiness potion for Maud and when she takes it, Maud turns into a baby, the last time she was happy. Miss Hardbroom cancels potions class when Miss Cackle frets about the mistakes and believes she should quit; she also appoints Ethel as director in place of Maud. When baby Maud causes a mess, Miss Bat takes her when Enid tidies up and Ethel decides that the show will be an instrumentless orchestra instead of individual acts. Enid discovers baby Maud is in the potions lab when she magically transports herself to the pond and everyone walks out from the orchestra. Mildred confesses to Miss Cackle about Maud and when she summons Enid and baby Maud, she changes Maud back. At the show, Ethel's solo ocherstra fails to impress, so Mildred gets Sybil, Clarice and Bea to perform their broom dance, Felicity to dance and she, Maud and Enid perform a sketch as Miss Hardbroom, Miss Cackle and Miss Drill as well as performing the school song.

Mildred eavesdrops outside the staff room, where she overhears Miss Hardbroom telling the staff Miss Cackle has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing at the magic council and the school is being inspected by Miss Doomstone later that day. Mildred tells Maud and Enid and when Miss Bat falls asleep while covering potions class, Mildred, Maud and Enid sneak off to the magic council to show support for Miss Cackle. In the first years potion class, Miss Hardbroom upsets Sybil when she makes a mistake with her colour changing potion, causing her cauldron to explode, so Bea decides to make a personality changing potion for Miss Hardbroom. Mildred, Maud and Enid gain access into the magic council ground and hide as The Great Wizard points out Miss Cackle's failings. Bea gives Miss Hardbroom the potion, which works when Bea suggests the class have fun and Miss Hardbroom makes jokes at Ethel and Felicity. Mrs Hallow blames Miss Cackle for Esmerelda losing her powers while Miss Hardbroom lets the class sing their potion recipes as well as dismissing them early. Mrs Hallow presents a petition for parents asking Miss Cackle to be removed as headmistress and Mildred, Maud and Enid emerge, asking if they can speak in Miss Cackle's defence, which Mildred does. Sybil, Clarice and Bea work on an antidote, but Miss Hardbroom refuses to take it and after being held up, Miss Doomstone arrives to see Miss Hardbroom, but slips on frog gloop. Miss Doomstone is given a personality changing potion as Miss Hardbroom takes the antidote and Miss Doomstone informs everyone she has recommended that the school stays open.

Mildred, Maud and Enid are upset about the prospect of all going to different schools as Maud's parents are visiting Miss Amulet's Academy and Miss Cackle continues to look at the petition. Miss Pentangle is summoned to Miss Cackle's office and admits she has been asked to be headmistress at Cackles as well as Pentangles. Miss Pentangle impresses the first years with her modern chanting and gives Mildred a power boost in order to perform an invisibility spell in potions. Sybil faints in chanting after performing a chant with confidence and Mildred confides in Miss Pentangle over wanting to get Miss Cackle reinstated. Mildred sneaks off to Miss Cackle's office during chanting to see the petition when her classmates say their parents never signed and Miss Pentangle watches Miss Cackle help Sybil with her spells and potions when she becomes emotional after struggling. With Maud and Enid's help, Mildred makes a true author potion when Maud and Enid's signatures are on the petition and when they attempt to show Miss Hardbroom, Mildred burns the scroll as her powers are strong. The Great Wizard arrives at Cackles and Mildred tells him she believes the petition signatures are forged, so using the mists of time, they find out Mrs Hallow forged the signatures. Mrs Hallow is magicked to the school and Ethel is hurt that Mrs Hallow did it out of revenge for Esmerelda and she is sacked from the council while Miss Cackle is reinstated.\n\n''Guest Starring'': Miss Pentangle\n\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 24\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n|Title           = Love at First Sight\n|RTitle          = \n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Claire Miller\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|19|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.277\n|ShortSummary    = On Halloween, Mildred scares Maud and Enid and with Clarice and Bea, Sybil tells them about a ghoul in one of the turrets. The next day, an emotion potion made by Mildred, Maud and Enid ends up in the drinks of all the staff when it was just intended for Miss Bat to help her and Mr Rowan-Webb make up. The potion works on Miss Mould when she begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb and Ethel presents Esmerelda with the school founding stone to help get her powers back. Mildred, Maud, Enid and Felicity realise they have to keep Mr Rowan-Webb away from the teachers and Ethel tells Esmerelda that the founding stone that was returned was a clone made by her. Miss Hardbroom begins to fall for Mr Rowan-Webb when Enid fails to distract her away from him, as does Miss Drill whilst Ethel explains how she cloned the stone, but Esmerelda refuses to take the powers. Miss Bat makes amends with him when the potion begins to work on her and Mr Rowan-Webb falls for himself upon seeing his reflection, so Mildred and Maud get him into a classroom by using his reflection. Esmerelda takes Mildred up on her offer on advice on normal schools, giving Ethel the importunity to put in place a spell to trap Esmerelda in her room with the founding stone. Maud fails to keep the staff away from Mr Rowan-Webb, but Mildred is able to warn Miss Cackle about the situation in time for her to negate the spell. Sybil goes into Ethel's room and is scared to be trapped in and Esmerelda is annoyed that Ethel's kindness towards her is to gain their mum's approval. Esmerelda is forced to gain powers from the stone when Sybil has climbed out of the roof and on the verge of falling, which delights Ethel, but the stone dies.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 25 <hr />26\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 12 <hr />13\n|Title           = All Hallow's Eve\n|AltTitle        = The Big Freeze\n|DirectedBy      = Delyth Thomas\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|3|26|df=y}}\n|Viewers         = 0.414\n|ShortSummary    = (All Hallow's Eve) Esmerelda attempts to give the powers back to the stone, but fails. Miss Cackle allows the pupils to play magical tricks on the staff without fear on Halloween. Esmerelda and Sybil recall a bedtime story from when they were younger about one of their ancestors reigniting her coven's stone, so using the Hallow family tree, Mildred asks for the Hallow responsible for that to come forward and tell them what to do, but they fly away. Miss Hardbroom struggles to get Miss Mould's references from the school she used to teach at while Mildred, Maud, Enid and Ethel try to get the answers out the Hallow ancestors. When they find the Hallow who reignited the stone, the Hallow tells them she just took credit for it. Clarice and Beatrice are convinced the magic in the school has gone haywire and eventually Esmerelda and Sybil are forced to admit that Esmerelda has got her magic back by taking it from the Stone. When Miss Drill notices the school is freezing, Miss Cackle evacuates the school, but she, Miss Hardbroom, Maud, Enid and Felicity are trapped in the potions lab. Mildred returns to the family trees to get answers from the Hallows and the witch who actually reignited the Stone long ago emerges, who turns out to be Mildred's ancestor, Mirabelle Hubble. \n\n(The Big Freeze) Mirabelle explains that she had to sacrifice her magic as well as 12 descendants' magic to save the stone, and Mildred is her 13th descendant, the first magical Hubble for centuries. Mildred is delighted to find out that she is from a witching family after all. Whilst Mildred's mum Julie is in the park, she is told by her miniature self to go to Cackle's. In the potions lab, Felicity is suspended in a block of ice, so Miss Cackle, Maud and Enid give the rest of their magic to Miss Hardbroom to help Mildred, putting them into ice blocks. Mildred is unhappy about leaving the school, but Miss Mould tells her about a coven Mildred could go to, where she could be individual and creative. When Miss Hardbroom gets outside, it turns out that the founding stone is still in the school and the coven Miss Mould knows off is run by Agatha. Miss Mould's plan was to allow Agatha to escape the photograph once the Stone's magic failed. Mildred praises Miss Mould as a teacher before she is frozen herself. Ethel decides to sacrifice her magic to the stone, but she is too late as when she makes a speech, Miss Hardbroom, Esmerelda and Sybil are put into ice blocks, and then she is. Julie Hubble arrives at the school and gets Mildred out of her block; Mildred explains to her mum about their ancestor. Mildred decides to sacrifice her powers to the stone, but although she starts the process, Miss Mould, moved by what Mildred said to her, completes the ritual in her place and reignites the stone, losing her powers. The school is saved and later celebrates Halloween.\n|LineColor       = #00BB00\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Series 3 (2019)===\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#FF36FF |overall=6 |series=6 |title=30 |director=14 |writer=20 |airdate=14 |viewers=10 |country=UK | viewersR=<ref name=\"BARB2\">[https://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/four-screen-dashboard/ Weekly top programmes on four screens (from Sept 2018)] Broadcasters' Audience Research Board (BARB)</ref> |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Worst Witch (2017 TV series)\n|EpisodeNumber   = 27\n|EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n|Title           = The Wishing Star\n|DirectedBy      = Dirk Campbell\n|WrittenBy       = Neil Jones\n|OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|1|7|df=y}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/schedules/p00fzl9r/2019/01/07|title=BBC TV Guide|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>\n|Viewers         = 0.279\n|ShortSummary    = Mildred enters the Great Wizard\u2019s broomstick-flying contest to win a Wishing Star so she can wish her Mum magical, but trouble arises when she competes with her new stray dog rather than Tabby.

An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the first and third [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent [[Texas]] in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and the seventh [[governor of Texas]], the only American to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]], when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as Raven. He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war, he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee]]. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827, Houston was elected as the [[governor of Tennessee]]. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]].\n\nHouston settled in [[Texas]] in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838 but won election to another term in the [[1841 Republic of Texas presidential election|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846, he was elected to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nHouston's senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the [[governor of Texas]]. In this role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of [[Houston]], the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in Rockbridge County, Virginia]]\n\nHouston was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, on March 2, 1793, to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.<ref name=\"williams1318\" /> Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 5</ref> By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville, Tennessee on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.<ref>''Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters'', p. 317. Edited by William B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.</ref>\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.<ref name=\"williams1318\">Williams (1994), pp. 13\u201318</ref> Houston did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]] as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 6</ref> He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At this time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like Nashville were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as Raven.<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 25\u201326</ref> He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 10</ref>\n\n==War of 1812 and aftermath==\nIn 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of the third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded by General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or \"Creek\") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 11\u201314</ref> Houston was wounded badly in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 19\u201320</ref> In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun's death in 1850.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 26\u201329</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 31\u201333</ref> Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 34\u201335</ref> In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and those who favored Adams became known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 45\u201346</ref> Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the [[1828 United States presidential election|1828 presidential election]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 47\u201349</ref>\n\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart possibly because Eliza loved another man.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 49\u201357</ref> In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee.

After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 80\u201382</ref> After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages.\n\n==Texas Revolution==\n[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H.

Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 91\u201392</ref> Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 96\u201397</ref> After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. In 1834, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 113\u2013118</ref> Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 121\u2013124</ref> Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 125\u2013128</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width     =\n| image1    = Sam Houston at San Jacinto.jpg\n| width1    = 200 \n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Detail from ''Houston at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]'' by Henry Arthur McArdle\n| image2    = SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg\n| width2    = 285\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican general [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston.

Polk defeated Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an [[Mandate (politics)|electoral mandate]]. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by Anson Jones, his secretary of state. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the [[annexation of Texas]]. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would be required to keep its public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 285\u2013287</ref> A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas officially became the 28th U.S. state on December 29, 1845. <ref>https://www.tsl.texas.gov/ref/abouttx/annexation/timeline.html</ref>\n\n==U.S. Senator==\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War and aftermath (1846\u20131853)===\n{{see also|Presidency of James K.

After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out in April 1846.

Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\"<ref>Haley (2002), p. 301</ref> He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 302\u2013304</ref> He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories.

The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 321\u2013326</ref> Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.<ref>Cantrell (1993), p. 333</ref> In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 340\u2013341</ref> Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to 21 years.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 330\u2013333</ref> He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 341\u2013342</ref>\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]].

Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]].

In the summer of 1830, Houston married Tiana Rogers (sometimes called Diana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Tiana's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Tiana later remarried.

An important leader of the [[Texas Revolution]], Houston served as the first and third [[President of the Republic of Texas|president]] of the [[Republic of Texas]], and was one of the first two individuals to represent [[Texas]] in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth [[governor of Tennessee]] and the seventh [[governor of Texas]], the only American to be elected governor of two different states in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Rockbridge County, Virginia]], Houston and his family migrated to [[Maryville, Tennessee]], when Houston was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home and spent time with the [[Cherokee]], becoming known as Raven. He served under General [[Andrew Jackson]] in the [[War of 1812]], and after the war, he presided over the [[Indian removal|removal of many Cherokee from Tennessee]]. With the support of Jackson and others, Houston won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies, and in 1827, Houston was elected as the [[governor of Tennessee]]. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and joined his Cherokee friends in [[Arkansas Territory]].\n\nHouston settled in [[Texas]] in 1832. After the [[Battle of Gonzales]], Houston helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the [[Texian Army]]. He led the Texian Army to victory at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won election in the [[1836 Republic of Texas presidential election|1836 Texas presidential election]]. He left office due to term limits in 1838 but won election to another term in the [[1841 Republic of Texas presidential election|1841 Texas presidential election]]. Houston played a key role in the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] by the United States in 1845, and in 1846, he was elected to represent Texas in the [[United States Senate]]. He joined the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and supported President [[James K. Polk]]'s prosecution of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nHouston's senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to extremists from both the North and South. He voted for the [[Compromise of 1850]], which settled many of the territorial issues left over from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. He later voted against the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] because he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] in the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]] and the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. In 1859, Houston won election as the [[governor of Texas]]. In this role, he opposed secession and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the [[Confederate States of America]]. He was forced out of office in 1861 and died in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of [[Houston]], the fourth most populous city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Houstonbirthplacemarker.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sam Houston Birthplace Marker in Rockbridge County, Virginia]]\n\nHouston was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, on March 2, 1793, to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish immigrants who had settled in [[British North America]] in the 1730s.<ref name=\"williams1318\" /> Houston's father was descended from [[Ulster Scots people]]; he could trace his ancestry to [[Sir Hugh de Paduinan]], a [[Normans|Norman]] knight.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 5</ref> By 1793, the elder Samuel Houston owned a large farm and [[slavery in the United States|slaves]] and served as a colonel in the Virginia militia.\n\nHouston's uncle, the Presbyterian Rev. Samuel Houston, was an elected member of the \"lost\" [[State of Franklin]] then in the western frontier of [[North Carolina]], who advocated for the passage of his proposed \"A Declaration of Rights or Form of Government on the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Frankland\" at the convention that was assembled in Greeneville, Tennessee on November 14, 1785. Rev. Houston returned to Rockbridge County, Virginia after the assembled State of Franklin convention rejected his constitutional proposal.<ref>''Dr. J. G. M. Ramsey Autobiography and Letters'', p. 317. Edited by William B. Hesseltine. The University of Tennessee Press.</ref>\n\nHouston had five brothers and three sisters as well as dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area. According to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life.<ref name=\"williams1318\">Williams (1994), pp. 13\u201318</ref> Houston did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by [[Classical antiquity|classical]] authors like [[Virgil]] as well as more recent works by authors such as [[Jedidiah Morse]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nHouston's father was not a good manager and got into debt, in part because of his militia service.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 6</ref> He planned to sell the farm and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Houston's mother followed through on those plans and settled the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of [[Blount County, Tennessee]]. At this time, Tennessee was on the [[American frontier]], and even larger towns like Nashville were vigilant against Native American raids. Houston disliked farming and working in the family store, and at the age of 16, he left his family to live with a [[Cherokee]] tribe led by [[Ahuludegi]] (also spelled Oolooteka).<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 21\u201324</ref> Houston formed a close relationship with Ahuludegi and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as Raven.<ref>Williams (1994), pp. 25\u201326</ref> He returned to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse.<ref>Haley (2002), p. 10</ref>\n\n==War of 1812 and aftermath==\nIn 1812, Houston enlisted in the United States Army, which then was engaged in the [[War of 1812]] against [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the [[39th Infantry Regiment (War of 1812)|39th Infantry Regiment]], [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of the third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded by General [[Andrew Jackson]], who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the [[Muscogee]] (or \"Creek\") tribe in the [[Old Southwest]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 11\u201314</ref> Houston was wounded badly in the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]], the decisive battle in the [[Creek War]]. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman [[John Rhea]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 15\u201317</ref>\n\nIn early 1817, Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the [[Indian removal|removal]] of Cherokee from East Tennessee.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 19\u201320</ref> In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from Secretary of War [[John C. Calhoun]] after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun's death in 1850.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 24\u201325</ref> Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in [[Arkansas Territory]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 26\u201329</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor [[Joseph McMinn]], Houston won election as the solicitor general for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as the adjutant general of the Tennessee militia.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 31\u201333</ref> Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the [[Democratic-Republican Party]], which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the [[1820 United States Census]], and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 34\u201335</ref> In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 38\u201339</ref>\n\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the [[1824 United States presidential election|1824 presidential election]], which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a [[contingent election]], which was won by [[John Quincy Adams]].<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 40\u201341</ref> Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and those who favored Adams became known as [[National Republican Party|National Republicans]]. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 45\u201346</ref> Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living on public domain.

The marriage quickly fell apart possibly because Eliza loved another man.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 49\u201357</ref> In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee.

After Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 80\u201382</ref> After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House [[Andrew Stevenson]] formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages.\n\n==Texas Revolution==\n[[File:General Sam Houston, the hero of San Jacinto.jpg|thumb|General Sam Houston (postcard, circa 1905)]]\n\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends, [[William H.

Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 91\u201392</ref> Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the [[Convention of 1833]], which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 96\u201397</ref> After the convention, Texan leader [[Stephen F. Austin]] petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President [[Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas]]. In 1834, [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]] assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 99\u2013100</ref> In October 1835, the [[Texas Revolution]] broke out with the [[Battle of Gonzales]], a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the [[Consultation (Texas)|Consultation]], a congregation of Texas leaders.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 109\u2013113</ref>\n\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]]. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the [[Texian Army]], though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 113\u2013118</ref> Houston helped organize the [[Convention of 1836]], where the [[Republic of Texas]] [[Texas Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] from Mexico. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from [[William B. Travis]], who commanded Texan forces [[Siege of the Alamo|under siege]] by Santa Anna at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|the Alamo]]. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 121\u2013124</ref> Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 125\u2013128</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width     =\n| image1    = Sam Houston at San Jacinto.jpg\n| width1    = 200 \n| alt1      =\n| caption1  = Detail from ''Houston at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]]'' by Henry Arthur McArdle\n| image2    = SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg\n| width2    = 285\n| alt2      =\n| caption2  = ''Surrender of Santa Anna'' by [[William Henry Huddle]] shows the Mexican general [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston.

Polk defeated Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an [[Mandate (politics)|electoral mandate]]. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by Anson Jones, his secretary of state. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the [[annexation of Texas]]. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would be required to keep its public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 285\u2013287</ref> A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas became a U.S. state in February 1846.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 293\u2013294</ref>\n\n==U.S. Senator==\n\n===Mexican\u2013American War and aftermath (1846\u20131853)===\n{{see also|Presidency of James K.

After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 297\u2013298</ref> After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], acquired the [[Mexican Cession]].

Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the [[Oregon Bill of 1848]], which organized [[Oregon Territory]] as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\"<ref>Haley (2002), p. 301</ref> He criticized both Northern [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 302\u2013304</ref> He supported the [[Compromise of 1850]], a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories.

Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 304\u2013308</ref> Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the [[1852 United States presidential election|1852 presidential election]], but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state.

The act also repealed the [[Missouri Compromise]], an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 321\u2013326</ref> Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party.<ref>Cantrell (1993), p. 333</ref> In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and unionist [[Know Nothing]] movement.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had both emerged as major political movements.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 340\u2013341</ref> Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the [[naturalization]] period for immigrants to 21 years.<ref>Cantrell (1993), pp. 330\u2013333</ref> He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.<ref>Haley (2002), pp. 341\u2013342</ref>\n\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the [[1856 American National Convention|Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention]], but the party nominated former President [[Millard Fillmore]]. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat [[James Buchanan]] won the [[1856 United States presidential election|1856 presidential election]].

In the summer of 1830, Houston married Tiana Rogers (sometimes called Diana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Tiana's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston.
