The document further reveals that \"Ethiopia is one of the most malaria-prone countries in Africa, with rates of morbidity and mortality increasing dramatically (i.e. 3.5-fold) during epidemics\". The same document alleges serious policy failures of the Government of Tedros who was the Minister of Health until 2013.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the&nbsp;ocean.<ref name=ssbsterg>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a-9VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=DuEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5161%2C3581553 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle booster stage to be solid-fuel, reusable vehicle |date=March 15, 1972 |page=3A}}</ref> In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle,<ref name=odsp>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tNhVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=QeEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3326%2C897997|work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=UPI |title=President okays spacecraft plan|date=January 5, 1972 |page=1A}}</ref><ref name=bsspgpa>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2u9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Xe0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=4846%2C1764562 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Big Space Shuttle proposal gets presidential approval |date=January 6, 1972 |page=1}}</ref> and NASA decided on its final design in&nbsp;March.<ref name=ssbsterg/> That&nbsp;August<!-- 1972-->, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test,<ref name=sfgapovr>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=361VAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KeADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6429%2C2842712 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Shuttle's first glide a 'pushover' |date=August 12, 1977 |page=1A}}</ref> where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December&nbsp;29<!--, 1980-->.<ref name=shbgsl>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=965hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=7-EDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6796%2C9180680 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=Associated Press |title=Space Shuttle begins slow journey to launching pad |date=December 29, 1980 |page=2A}}</ref> The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission.

The Space Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a vehicle which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in LEO in the early 1990s. The U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed. As a result, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} to an eastward LEO or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on|abbr=on}} into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|by|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle, and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs.

''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the original specified thrust as 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]].

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (miniseries)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed.

He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

When the differential access becomes integral to institutions, it becomes common practice, making it difficult to rectify. Eventually, this racism dominates public bodies, private corporations, public and private universities, and is reinforced by the actions of conformists and newcomers. Another difficulty in reducing institutionalized racism is that there is no sole, true identifiable perpetrator. When racism is built into the institution, it emerges as the collective action of the population.\n\nProfessor James M. Jones postulates three major types of racism: personally mediated, [[Internalized racism|internalized]], and institutionalized.<ref>Jones, J. M. (1997). ''Prejudice and Racism'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Personally mediated racism includes the specific social attitudes inherent to racially prejudiced action ([[bigotry|bigoted]] differential assumptions about abilities, motives, and the intentions of others according to), [[discrimination]] (the differential actions and behaviours towards others according to their race), [[stereotyping]], commission, and omission (disrespect, suspicion, devaluation, and dehumanization). [[Internalized racism]] is the acceptance, by members of the racially [[stigmatized]] people, of negative perceptions about their own abilities and intrinsic worth, characterized by low [[self-esteem]], and low esteem of others like them. This racism can be manifested through embracing \"whiteness\" (e.g. [[Social stratification|stratification]] by skin colour in non-white communities), self-devaluation (e.g., racial slurs, nicknames, rejection of ancestral culture, etc.), and resignation, helplessness, and hopelessness (e.g., [[dropping out]] of school, [[abstention|failing to vote]], engaging in health-risk practices, etc.).\n\nPersistent negative [[stereotype]]s fuel institutional racism, and influence [[interpersonal relations]]. Racial stereotyping contributes to patterns of [[racial segregation#United States|racial residential segregation]] and [[redlining]], and shape views about crime, crime policy, and welfare policy, especially if the contextual information is stereotype-consistent.<ref>[http://www2.asanet.org/centennial/race_ethnicity_health.pdf Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans.

One example of the difference is public school budgets in the U.S. (including local levies and bonds) and the quality of teachers, which are often correlated with property values: rich neighborhoods are more likely to be more 'white' and to have better teachers and more money for education, even in public schools. [[restrictive covenants|Restrictive housing contracts]] and bank lending policies have also been listed as forms of institutional racism. Other examples sometimes described as institutional racism are [[racial profiling]] by security guards and police, use of stereotyped racial caricatures, the under- and misrepresentation of certain racial groups in the [[mass media]], and race-based barriers to gainful employment and professional advancement. Additionally, differential access to goods, services, and opportunities of society can be included within the term ''institutional racism'', such as unpaved streets and roads, inherited socio-economic disadvantage, and \"standardized\" tests (each ethnic group prepared for it differently; many are poorly prepared).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/article/why-standardized-tests-have-standardized-postracial-ideology#.W7JDamhKjIU|title=Why Standardized Tests Have Standardized Postracial Ideology {{!}} AAUP|website=aaup.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSome [[sociology|sociological]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicpractice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GPP_4FacesOfPower.pdf | title=The Four Faces of Power | last=Healey | first=Richard | last2=Hinson| first2=Sandra}}</ref> investigators distinguish between institutional racism and \"structural racism\" (sometimes called structured [[racialization]]).<ref>[http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/docs/NewSR-brochure-FINAL.pdf Kirwan Institute brochure]</ref> The former focuses upon the norms and practices within an institution, the latter upon the ''interactions'' among institutions, interactions that produce [[racialized]] outcomes against non-white people.<ref name=\"esdc.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|title=Snapshot of racialized Poverty in Canada|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211143715/http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> An important feature of structural racism is that it cannot be reduced to individual [[prejudice]] or to the single function of an institution.\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== In housing and loan ===\n[[File:NOLA16Sep13 Iberville Fence.JPG|thumb|Iberville Housing Projects in New Orleans, Louisiana]]\nInstitutional racism in the housing sector can be seen as early as the 1930s with the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]]. Banks would determine a neighborhood's risk for loan default and [[Redlining|redline]] neighborhoods that were at high risk of default. These neighborhoods tended to be African American neighborhoods, whereas white-middle-class Americans were able to receive housing loans.

Lenders targeted high-interest subprime loans to low-income and minority neighborhoods who might be eligible for fair-interest prime loans.

A settlement with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Dept]] and the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] was the largest in the history of both agencies, topping $33 million in restitution for the practice from New Jersey's largest savings bank. The bank had been accused of steering clear of minority neighborhoods and favoring white suburban borrowers in granting loans and mortgages, finding that of the approximately 1900 mortgages made in 2014 only 25 went to black applicants. The banks' executives denied bias, and the settlement came with adjustments to the banks business practices. This followed other successful efforts by the federal, state and city officials in 2014 to expand lending programs directed at minorities, and in some cases to force banks to pay penalties for patterns of redlining in Providence, R.I.; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, WI.; Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.  The Justice Dept also has more active redlining investigations underway,<ref>Rachel Witkowski (8 May 2015).

''National Mortgage News''.</ref> and officials have stated to reporters that \"redlining is not a thing of the past\". It has evolved into a more politically correct version, where bankers do not talk about denying loans to blacks openly. The justice department officials noted that some banks have quietly institutionalized bias in their operations. They have moved their operations out of minority communities entirely, while others have moved in to fill the void and compete for clients. Such management decisions are not the stated intent, it is left unspoken so that even the bank's other customers are unaware that it is occurring. The effect on minority communities can be profound as home ownership, a prime source of neighborhood stability and economic mobility can affect its vulnerability to blight and disrepair. In the 1960s and 1970s laws were passed banning the practice; its return is far less overt, and while the vast majority of banks operate legally, the practice appears to be more widespread as the investigation revealed a vast disparity in loans approved for blacks vs whites in similar situations.<ref>Long banned, mortgage bias returns as issue, ''New York Times'' article, Saturday, October 1, 2015, pg 1</ref>\n\nStudies in major cities such as Los Angeles and Baltimore show that communities of color have lower levels of access to parks and green space.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolsh|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wilson|first2=John P.|last3=Fehrenbach|first3=Jed|title=Parks and Park Funding in Los Angeles: An Equity Mapping Analysis|url=http://lusk.usc.edu/sites/default/files/working_papers/Wolch.parks_.pdf|website=University of Southern California}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boone|first1=Christopher|last2=Buckley|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Grove|first3=J.

The Justice Dept, following a 20-month investigation based on 33,000 cases over three years, reported that black youths were treated more harshly than whites and that all low-income youths, regardless of race, were deprived of their basic constitutional rights. Youths who encountered law enforcement got little or no chance to challenge detention or get any help from lawyers. With only one public defender assigned to juveniles in a county of one million, that legal aide handled 394 cases in 2014. The investigation was unrelated to the notorious case which roiled St. Louis, beginning before the police shooting of the unarmed black youth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grossman |first=Andrew |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ferguson-police-accused-of-racial-bias-by-federal-investigation-1425411657 |title=Ferguson Police, Courts Accused of Racial Bias by Justice Department Probe |publisher=WSJ |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The failure to grant access to counsel brought to light the practice of an informal process which could let offenders off with a warning or having them enter into diversion programs in lieu of  being charged in court. But to be accepted into the informal process, offenders had to admit to guilt, which runs afoul of the right not to incriminate oneself in criminal proceedings. The investigation following Michael Brown's shooting found an enormous disparity in the way juvenile cases were handled, with blacks being 47% more likely than whites to be put through the formal criminal proceedings. It also found them more likely to be held in detention, and also subsequently sentenced to incarceration once the case was finished. They were also more likely to be detained for violating parole from a previous case.<ref>\"The US finds racial Bias in a court in Missouri\", ''New York Times'' August 1, 2015, Nat'l news</ref>\n\nThe county did not cooperate fully with the Justice Dept and the St. Louis Family Court declined to comment, as did the state court system, of which it is a part.

In most state courts, the public defender's office decides who is poor enough to merit representation; in St. Louis Family Court the judge or court commissioner, sometimes based on different standards, decides who gets access to counsel. Most troubling to the justice official was the continuing use of court officials to recite complicated statutory language about the alleged crimes, then leading the defendants through \"formulaic 'do you understand' and yes/no questions.\" Judges made no effort to find out if the pleas were coerced, whether the child had any criminal intent or especially, did they fully understand the consequences of pleading guilty to the charges. Their competency to take part in their own defense was never established and the legal aide in the cases examined never challenged a probable cause finding, hired an expert witness or challenged hearsay evidence or leading questions and most cases ended with the child pleading guilty. The Civil Rights Division (of  the Justice Dept) began four investigations beginning in 2013 delving into juvenile justice systems in Miss., Tenn., Texas, and Missouri and while settlements were reached it has had to file suit to overcome the disparities in criminal convictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/doj-report-critical-st-louis-county-family-court-32805053 |title=U.S. News &#124; National News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\nCoupled with [[zero-tolerance]] discipline in schools, a \"one size fits all solution\" decried by the [[American Bar Association]], black and Latino youth are more likely to encounter negative contact with law enforcement and accrue violations, which leads to fines and failure to pay, which in turn leads to warrants and/or probation violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/opinion/schoolkids-in-handcuffs.html|title=Schoolkids in Handcuffs|last=The Editorial Board|date=4 November 2015|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> This cycle has been shown to put children, particularly low-income minorities, in the [[school-to-prison pipeline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/what-school-prison-pipeline |title=What is the School-to-Prison Pipeline? &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n====Judicial misconduct====\n{{See also|Judicial misconduct}}\n\nIn 2010, two Washington state supreme court justices, Richard Sanders and James Johnson, were baffled at a court meeting to determine the fate of $25,000 in funding for various boards and commissions. They stated that there was too much African American representation in the prison population because African Americans are known to commit a number crimes and not because of their race. A black lawyer says she was shocked to hear two justices, [[Richard B. Sanders]] and Johnson, refer to a former legal aid lawyer's assertions in a report using the phrase ''poverty pimp''. Shirley Bondon, a state Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) manager who oversaw court programs critical of the legal system, told the justices that she believed there was racial \"bias in the criminal-justice system, from the bottom up.\" The response from Justice Saunders was critical of blacks, stating that he didn't believe the barriers existed, except for poverty because it might restrict the ability to afford an attorney. [[James M. Johnson (judge)|James M. Johnson]], who was noted as the most conservative judge on the court, agreed, noting that African Americans commit them [crimes] against their own communities, to which Bondon objected, requesting a closed-door meeting with the court.

The men were subsequently released based on a pre-trial motion from the defense, claiming that the federal government had no basis for charging them, as no federal law was broken. Arizona officials never initiated criminal proceedings in state court against those responsible for the deportation of workers and their lost wages and other losses. The Justice Department appealed, but in [[United States v. Wheeler (1920)|United States v. Wheeler]], 254 U.S. 281 (1920), Chief Justice [[Edward Douglass White]] wrote for an 8-to-1 majority that the U.S. Constitution did not empower the federal government to enforce the rights of the deportees. Rather it \"necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress, and egress.\" Only in a case of \"state discriminatory action\" would the federal government have a role to play. By this calculated reasoning, the officials situated at the Supreme Court erred in not taking the side that in today's legal lexicon had every right to seek justice and redress, not only for the stolen wages, union busting, false imprisonment and other crimes, but for the inherent right not to be forcibly removed from your home by men with guns and shipped in cattle cars across state lines as many homeowners were. That 8 of the 9 supreme court justices concurred and based on anti-radical speech sentiment at the time (post WWI anti-union and IWW)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/WW1_reds.shtml |title=World War I antiwar movement |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |access-date=2015-10-26}}</ref> leads to the conclusion that the government gave the company cover to remove the workers, many of whom were Mexicans advocating for better pay and working condition, to a place in the next state closer to the border with the admonition ''never to return''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desertexposure.com/200707/200707_wobblies.php|title=Desert Exposure Wobblies July 2007|author=|date=|website=DesertExposure.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref> That few deportees returned and those that contested the deportations lost their cases to have their homes returned to [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]], and that in 1966 Finally, in [[United States v.

Mitchell Palmer]] and others advocated for a peacetime equivalent of the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]], using the Bisbee events as a justification. They stated that the only reason the company representatives and local law enforcement had taken the law into their own hands was that the government lacked the power to suppress radical sentiment directly. If the government was armed with appropriate legislation and the threat of long prison terms, private citizens would not feel the need to act. Writing in 1920, Harvard Professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] mocked that view: \"Doubtless some governmental action was required to protect pacifists and extreme radicals from mob violence, but incarceration for a period of twenty years seems a very queer kind of protection.<ref>Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Freedom of Speech (NY: Harcourt, Brace, and Howe, 1920), 45-46.</ref> That this was considered [[vigilante]] actions by private citizens duly deputized by the local sheriff gives no weight to the racist component directed towards those of Mexican descent in Arizona, New Mexico, and  Texas, who were being systematically forced from their homes in the US beginning in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqmyk|title=Mexican Americans and Repatriation|date=|work=tshaonline.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Lynching of people of Mexican Descent====\n\n{{Main|Porvenir massacre (1918)}}\nVigilante actions against Mexicans in the southwest had been documented from the 1850s to 1930s of men, women and children, many of them American citizens; who were burned, shot, hung, whipped or mutilated due to racist terror. Thousands were killed by white settlers and gold prospectors to drive them off their land or steal their claims using false charges to gin up mob actions. Many of the killings took place in front of hundreds who encouraged mobs to remove the men from jails to lynch them. In Texas the [[Texas Ranger Division|Rangers]] were implicated by archeological digs at the sites of one of the massacres that took place near the U.S. Army razed village of Porvenir near the Mexican border in Marfa, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rimrockpress.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry151216-162435|title=PORVENIR MASSACRE ARCHAEOLOGY MOST REVEALING|last=Justice|first=Glenn|date=2017-04-21|website=Glenn's Texas History Blog|access-date=}}</ref> Many of the state sanctioned killings which occurred in Texas have been removed from public view and recent efforts to increase awareness have been stymied by state commissions on historic places.

She was later over-ruled by the head of the State Historical Commission, who brokered a deal to also erect markers at Anglo ranches that were victims of suspected Mexican [[Villistas]], which may also have been a response to the extrajudicial killings by the Rangers and Ranchers.<ref>\"1919 Ranger Investigation\".

Strikers became targets of [[agent provocateurs]] who infiltrated meetings of \"communist labor\" and anti-war activists. After the Bisbee deportations became exposed in the press, Americans were divided about the treatment of illegal aliens, who were purported communists. Former President Theodore Roosevelt opined in the press that the Bisbee miners \"had it coming, as they were hell-bent on havoc!\" The Dept of Justice went from advocating for persons deprived of rights and liberty by state actors to detaining them under dubious warrants and suspicion of radicalism. The [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] that fueled institutional racism in the 1920s against Russian Jews and other Eastern European immigrants was a backlash to the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia and a [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombing campaign]]  early in 1919 by Italian anarchists advocating the overthrow of the government. The result was the infamous [[Palmer raids]], ostensibly a deportation measure to remove dangerous aliens. In 1919 Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] began a series of raids cooked up to remove radicals and anarchists from the US. Warrants were requested from compliant officials in the [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Dept]], and a number of foreign nationals caught up in the sweeping raids were eventually deported. As only the department of labor had the legal right to deport aliens, they did object to the methods; nevertheless, under [[color of law]], the raids began on November 7, 1919. It was led by a 24-year-old [[J. Edgar Hoover]]  heading a new division of the Justice Department's [[Bureau of Investigation]], called the General Intelligence Division. Armed with responsibility for investigating the programs of radical groups and identifying their members, the raids began with agents of the Bureau of Investigation, together with local police, executing a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the [[Union of Russian Workers]] in 12 cities.\n\nNewspaper accounts reported some were \"badly beaten\" during the arrests. Many later swore they were threatened and beaten during questioning. Government agents cast a wide net, bringing in some American citizens, passers-by who admitted being Russian, some not members of the Russian Workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/toamericanpeople00natiuoft/toamericanpeople00natiuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"To the American people; report upon the illegal practices of the United States Department of justice\"|date=|work=archive.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Others were teachers conducting night school classes in space shared with the targeted radical groups. Arrests far exceeded the number of warrants. Of 650 arrested in New York City, the government managed to deport just 43. Hoover organized the next raids. He successfully persuaded the Department of Labor to ease its insistence on promptly alerting those arrested of their right to an attorney. Instead, Labor issued instructions that its representatives could wait until after the case against the defendant was established, \"in order to protect government interests.\"<ref name=\"proprocedure.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proprocedure.com/labor_history/content8.php|title=Labor History|date=|work=proprocedure.com|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Less openly, Hoover decided to interpret Labor's agreement to act against the Communist Party to include a different organization, the [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]]. Finally, despite the fact that Secretary of Labor [[William B. Wilson]] insisted that more than membership in an organization was required for a warrant, Hoover worked with more compliant Labor officials and overwhelmed Labor staff to get the warrants he wanted. Justice Department officials, including Palmer and Hoover, later claimed ignorance of such details.\n\nThe Justice Department launched a series of raids on January 2, 1920, with follow-up operations over the next few days. Smaller raids extended over the next six weeks. At least 3,000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted \"clear cases of brutality\". Some cases in Boston included torture, where detainees were placed in a 'hot box' above a furnace and given one glass of water and a slice of bread a day and kept there for 50 hours. The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of Ohio were \"publicity gestures\" designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation. In a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Louis Freeland Post]], who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal. Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the [[Immigration Act of 1918]].\nAt a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor Wilson to fire Post, but Secretary Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should \"not let this country see red.\" Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President's \"admonition,\" because Palmer \"was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages.\"<ref name=\"Shogan2013\">{{cite book|last=Shogan|first=Robert|title=The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVmypbQvHwAC&pg=PA62|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-3594-5|pages=62\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=====Other=====\nOn May 28, 1920, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] published its \"Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://debs.indstate.edu/n277t6_1920.pdf | title=Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice | publisher=ACLU | date=May 28, 1920}}</ref> which carefully documented the Justice Department's unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by [[agents provocateurs]], and unlawful incommunicado detention.

Many other minorities also suffered from institutional racism. One example is immigration policies against Chinese. The intensified job competition during the 1870s on the West Coast between Chinese workers and Whites invoked anti-Chinese movement. The first Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed to prohibit Chinese immigrating to the United States, resulting in only 10 Chinese immigrants into the U.S. in 1887.

In 1954 while the [[Bracero program]] was in force, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] used force to repatriate 1 million Mexicans. It was a system of tactical control and cooperation within the U.S. Border Patrol and alongside the Mexican government and was called [[Operation Wetback]]. With the growing diplomatic and security issues surrounding illegal border crossings, the INS increased its raids and apprehensions beginning in the early 1950s leading up to Operation Wetback. Those apprehended were often deported without the opportunity to recover their property in the US or contact family and were stranded without food or employment when they entered Mexico. Deported Mexicans faced extreme conditions and were sometimes left in the desert; 88 deported workers died in 112-degree heat in July 1955. Most were sent by ship to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] or transported by land to southern Mexican cities. During the entirety of the Operation, border recruitment of illegal workers by American growers continued due largely to the inexpensiveness of illegal labor and the desire of growers to avoid the bureaucratic obstacles of the Bracero program; the continuation of illegal immigration despite the efforts of Operation Wetback was largely responsible for the failure of the program.<ref>Kevin Starr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7GvgN0y7yI4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California] (1997) p. 261. {{ISBN|0195118022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the House of Representatives congresspersons [[Hilda Solis]] and [[Luis Gutierrez]] called for an apology from the U.S. Government for the Repatriation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-04-1930s-deportees-cover_x.htm|title=U.S. urged to apologize for 1930s deportations - USATODAY.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> This has not occurred to date.

Authorized at the federal level in 1871, it came about due to reforms of the [[spoils system]] in place since the 1830s, and abuses of the post-Civil War era, when Congress authorized the president to appoint a Civil Service Commission and prescribe regulations for admission to public service. A dis-satisfied office-seeker assassinated President Garfield in 1881 and Congress was motivated to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] in 1883 which firmly established civil service. During reconstruction, this enabled the federal government to provide jobs for newly freed blacks in the south (primarily the Postal Service) where no other employment opportunities existed for them. Since the inception of the merit system in 1881, the numbers of blacks in federal civil service positions rose from 0.057 to 5.6% by 1910.

Following this, cities consulted with their attorneys and as a result, [[Racial integration|Integration]] began. This was replaced in turn by institutional racism, the practice of upholding the letter of the law, but not the spirit, in an effort to prevent minority hires from gaining ground in titles where they were disproportionately underrepresented, such as Police and Fire depts, and in management positions.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Cynthia |last1=Brown |first2=Jack |last2=Maskell |title=Hatch Act Restrictions on Federal Employees' Political Activities in the Digital Age |url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44469.pdf |work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=4 |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Post-integration period====\n\nAround the country in the 1950s, blacks found common cause in challenging [[employment discrimination]], and the colored newspapers took up the cause. Economically, jobs were becoming scarce for minorities during the post-war years as returning servicemen reclaimed the manufacturing and factory base. Civil Service looked to be a reasonable alternative to blacks returning from WWII service overseas and black officers leaving the newly desegregated armed services.  In Los Angeles in the 1950s, the [[NAACP]] fueled an integration campaign in the [[California Eagle]] and petitioned the fire commission to provide more jobs in the LAFD. When the Fire Chief Engineer John Alderson attempted to integrate the department, the resistance to integration created so-called 'Hate Houses' and resulted in the formation of [[The Stentorians]] as a protective force of guardians to protect minority firefighters. New York had previously experienced their own revelations when the [[Vulcan Society]] appeared before the city council and demanded the elimination of 'the black bed' in firehouses for the black firemen. At that hearing in 1944, the NYC council chambers filled with FDNY brass on one side and black firefighters protesting the lack of promotional opportunities and racial harassment on the other.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, integration began and segregation was replaced by institutional racism, which took the form much the same way it did when blacks first got hired before and during WWI. Blacks once appointed to a civil service position were subjected to isolation, ostracism, outright hostility and separate quarters. After 1956, the first black hires to the LAFD after integration unfairly failed to finish academy training. The Vulcan Society in New York mentored many blacks but progress was slow, with hiring not reflected in mirroring the population of the cities served until the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] when the numbers of minority hiring increased. The [[U.S. Department of Labor]] in the 1970s began enforcing racial quotas during the Nixon administration that mandated black hiring, but it was the lawsuits of the 1970s which exploded the imposition of Consent Decrees across the country forcing the diversity of the hard to integrate titles. In 1971 the [[Vulcan Blazers]] of the Baltimore, Maryland fire dept filed a groundbreaking lawsuit that resulted in the appointment of blacks to positions of officers up to assistant chief when the court ruled there had been discrimination in promotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-06/html/CREC-2011-12-06-pt1-PgE2184-3.htm|title=Congressional Record, Volume 157 Issue 186 (Tuesday, December 6, 2011)|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Other minority groups followed their lead and also took to the courts. In 2009 the City of Baltimore paid $4.6 Million to settle a case of discrimination filed by minority policemen alleging discrimination.

W. Bush]] attempted to eliminate [[affirmative action]] during his term of office. He ordered the use of quotas, preferences, set-asides on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin be abolished in hiring. Congress responded with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which only covered the terms for settling cases where discrimination had previously been confirmed. It had been near impossible to prove a case of [[institutional discrimination]] in the courts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/164|title=Patterson v. McLean Credit Union|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/us/excerpts-from-opinions-on-scope-of-rights-act.html|title=Excerpts From Opinions on Scope of Rights Act|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=16 June 1989|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> and many other cases were terminated upon imposition of a [[consent decree]]. While President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s attempt failed, it fueled the rise in 1996 of the [[California Proposition 209]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/california-affirmative-action-ban-proposition-209_n_1274448.html|title=California Affirmative Action Ban, Proposition 209, Challenged in Court|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> a ballot initiative abolishing affirmative action in California universities, to counteract what Institutionalized Racism. [[Affirmative action]] is where members of a minority group get preferential treatment over the majority rather than being treated as equals. This closed down the avenues [[affirmative action]] initiatives had opened for blacks to have race counted as a factor when accounting for different rates of acceptance to Universities and consequently in employment discrimination lawsuits that sought redress from discriminatory hiring. This is where the arguments for redress for past wrongs under the 'catchup provisions' no longer worked in favor of claimants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/03/news/mn-50304|title=Judge Upholds Key Affirmative Action Laws|work=latimes|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Proposition 209 has withstood challenges but in 2013 the California Senate passed Amendment #5 \u2013 which if implemented would have reversed 209 had its main sponsor in the Senate not retracted it before final passage. By 2014 the UCLA Board of Regents came out publicly against 209 after reviewing the loss of minorities in university admissions after 209 was implemented.\n\nThese ballot initiatives spread around the country primarily in [[red states]]. In 2003 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled on affirmative action programs at the [[University of Michigan]] in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' and [[Grutter v. Bollinger]]; the rulings found the affirmative action program was unconstitutional for the way it was applied, but ambiguously said it could continue to use affirmative action. This strengthened the campaign against racial preferences and proponents pressed ahead with more ballot initiatives under the theory that affirmative action programs were no longer needed. The tide against further passage of such discriminatory ballot box institutional racism didn't abate until the 2008 election cycle when efforts by [[Ward Connerly]], the chairman of the [[American Civil Rights Institute]], a national non-profit organization founded to oppose racial and gender preferences,<ref name=\"acri\">{{cite web |title=About the American Civil Rights Institute |url=http://acri.org/about-acri/|work=American Civil Rights Institute |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> failed to get ballot measures passed in 3 states, was rejected by voters in another, and only in Nebraska got passage to add one last state banning affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination. His critics condemned Connerly's reasoning, saying he failed to see the extent of past racism on African Americans and Hispanics; and that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past institutional racism on people of color. Advocates of [[Affirmative Action]] programs denied that these were '[[racial quotas]]' as that was seen as divisive and under [[color of law]], but affirmative action goals fell to this onslaught and subsequent [[reverse discrimination]] lawsuits ended the practice. Connerly, for his part, stated \"I think that in some quarters, many parts of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged ... Because we have developed this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.\"<ref name=\"Attack\">{{cite news |title=Attacking Affirmative Action |date=August 29, 2008 |work=NOW on PBS |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/434/index.html |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> His [[multi-racial]] background caused conservatives to back his cause as he was perceived to be both black and anti-affirmative action.\n\n=== In education ===\n[[Standardized testing]] has also been considered a form of institutional racism, because it is believed to be biased in favor of people from particular socio-cultural backgrounds. Some minorities have consistently tested worse than whites on virtually all standardized tests, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, while others have tested consistently better. The cause of the achievement gaps between black, Hispanic, white and Asian students has yet to be fully elucidated.\n\n==== In higher education ====\nIn the 1960s, students of color started attending colleges and universities in record numbers after the passage of the Civil Rights and Higher Education Acts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/news/preserving-civil-rights-higher-education-act|title=Preserving civil rights in the Higher Education Act|date=2018-04-30|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}</ref> However, the obstacles of integration in predominantly white institutions of higher education led to unforeseen obstacles for faculty and students of color working and studying in such environments. According to a review of educational research, tension and violence followed, one reason being the lack of preparedness of many colleges and universities to teach a diversity of students.<ref name=\"Engberg\">{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Improving Intergroup Relations in Higher Education: A Critical Examination of the Influence of Educational Interventions on Racial Bias|url=|journal=American Educational Research Association|volume=74|issue=4|pages=473\u2013524|doi=10.3102/00346543074004473|last1=Engberg|first1=M.

Board of Education]] was ruled in 1954, actual integration did not completely occur until many years later; the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held multiple hearings on the desegregation of schools, continuously they maintained that [[Brown v.

The underlying issue of minority presence of college campuses occurs. In 2008, the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that while enrollment of minorities and students of color had risen, white enrollment still held the majority on average, accounting for 63 percent of undergraduate college and university students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015/indicator6_24.asp|title=Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Minorities|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While this varies based on the region, state, and elite status, in general the majority of colleges and universities in the United States are predominantly white. According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] there has also been a rise in hate crimes on college campuses; 1250 hate crimes in 2016, up 25 percent from 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/After-2016-Election-Campus/242577|title=After 2016 Election, Campus Hate Crimes Seemed to Jump.

According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] being prepared for college is integral to whether or not a student is successful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OPE/AgenProj/report/theme1a.html|title=ED.gov|website=www2.ed.gov|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While the government offers college preparation programs for minority and low-income students, programs such as [[GEAR UP]] and [[Federal TRIO Programs]] help prepare students for college to better ensure their success and retention,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gearup/index.html|title=Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP)|date=2018-06-08|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> the access to these programs is relatively limited. While programs such as [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have grown since conception, there is still work that needs to be done if more minority students are expected to attend and succeed in a post-secondary institution. Due to availability of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] being subjective based on where geographically a student may be, the benefits are not completely being felt be the targeted communities. However, the positive effects of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have been pretty bolstering\u2014more minorities and low-income individuals are prepared when going to post-secondary institutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rti.org/impact/analysis-support-federal-trio-programs|title=Analysis Support for the Federal TRIO Programs|date=2016-06-10|work=RTI|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nInstitutionalized racism in higher education has received little national attention, even though it is a relevant issue affecting many colleges and universities. Despite efforts to improve the situation on college and university campuses, such as implementing [[affirmative action]] plans, anti-black racism and violence continue to occur.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Smith57/publication/247752199_Assume_the_Position_You_Fit_the_Description_Psychosocial_Experiences_and_Racial_Battle_Fatigue_Among_African_American_Male_College_Students/links/54ef02da0cf2e55866f3daf4/Assume-the-Position-You-Fit-the-Description-Psychosocial-Experiences-and-Racial-Battle-Fatigue-Among-African-American-Male-College-Students.pdf</ref> The effects of this violence extend beyond the incident itself. According to a U.S. study in Baltimore, racism has a correlation with health complications, such as high systolic blood pressure.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/racism-impacts-your-health-84112|title=Racism impacts your health|last=Timothy|first=Roberta K.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>  Likewise, a study held from 1997 to 2003 found that racism led to higher rates of breast cancer.<ref name=\":22\" /> While this extends beyond education, it could illustrate why many minorities and students of color would feel uneasy putting themselves into an environment that could potentially garner more racism.<ref name=\":22\" /> While illustrations of institutional racism on college campuses can be found in newspapers and blogs, there are other places to learn more about these incidents. Aside from the media, one source that can be used to keep up to date on institutional racism in higher education is ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'' (JBHE). This journal aims to provide as much information as possible about anti-black institutional racism. JBHE publishes resources, statistics, and current reports of race-related actions on college and university campuses.<ref name=\":04\" /> For example, JBHE reported on the [[2015 University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon racism incident]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jbhe.com/2015/03/video-shows-university-of-oklahoma-students-singing-racist-song/|title=Video Shows University of Oklahoma Students Singing Racist Song|date=2015-03-09|work=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Other media resources where reports on racial incidents on college campuses can be found is [[Inside Higher Ed]] and [[Southern Poverty Law Center|the Southern Poverty Law Center]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] released a report on crime in schools.

Institutions of higher education were often traditionally known as Predominantly White Institutions (PWI's).<ref>Christopher Brown II, M., & Elon Dancy II, T., 2010</ref> These institutions are now challenged to improve their diversity efforts and create policies that address the root cause of negative racial climates on PWI campuses. It is estimated that by 2010, 40% of high school graduates would be non-white.<ref name=\"rankin\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rankin | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Reason | first2 = R.

Universities and colleges that have identified diversity as one of their priorities should plan how to strategically and in a sensitive manner create a campus climate in which all students, in particular students of color in a PWI, do not have to risk feeling unsafe, discriminated against, marginalized or tokenized to obtain a post-secondary degree.\n\nData has shown that students of color and White students have different perceptions of campus racial climates. In a survey of 433 undergraduate students at one institution found that, in comparison to White students, students of color felt differently about campus policies. White students were more often to describe their campus racial climate as positive, while students of African descent rated it as negative. Findings indicate that students of color experience harassment that is, \"offensive, hostile, or intimidating\" at higher rates than White students, which interferes with their learning. Further, \"students of color perceived the climate as more racist and less accepting than did White students, even though White students recognized racial harassment at similar rates as students of color\".<ref name=\"rankin\" /> In addition, many African American students have a hard time to fit in a white predominant colleges because of the fear of \"becoming white.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tyson|first1=Will|title=Social Segregation by Race at Predominantly White Universities|journal=Southern Sociological Society|date=2001|id={{ProQuest|61748890}}}}</ref>\n\nWhite students also felt more positive about their classroom experience and the way professors presented various viewpoints in the curriculum, about institutional policies as well as recruitment and retention of student of color. Students of African descent and other students of color felt the campus environment was not friendly and that they had been targets of racism. In another study of 5,000 first year students at 93 institutions, White students were more likely to agree with the statement that  \"racial discrimination is no longer a problem\" than students of color.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> White students were also more likely to feel that the campus climate is improving in comparison to students of color. White students felt the campus climate was non-racist, friendly, and respectful while students of color felt that it was racist, hostile, and disrespectful.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> Research has shown that racial diversification in colleges and universities, without intentional education about systemic racism and the history of race in the United States, can lead to creating a racial campus climate that is oppressive towards students of color.  There needs to be, \"intentional education interventions related to the changing racial composition of college students [which] would likely influence how the climate of an environment changes\".<ref name=\"rankin\" />\n\nIf institutional racism is to be addressed in institutes of higher education, different types of interventions need to be created, in particular, interventions created specifically for the academy. Rankin and Reason's research concluded that for intervention to be effective, faculty would need to be used as socializing agents on campus, in particular, because intellectual and behavioral norms on most campuses are set by faculty and, these norms have a heavy impact on campus climate.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> An example of students trying to change racial campus climate is the Being Black at the University of Michigan [[#BBUM]] moment. The Black Student Union is organizing and collaborating with organizations to bring attention to the racial climate at the [[University of Michigan]] and how it is affecting all students.<ref>Vega, T.

One example of this is required coursework through the departments of African/African-American Studies, Xicano studies, Asian-American studies, Arab American studies, and Native American studies alongside the History department. Research has shown that curricular diversity is positively associated with intergroup attitudes, decreased racial prejudice and intergroup understanding, and attitudes toward campus diversity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | year = 2004 | title = Chang, 2002, Springer, Palmer, Terenzini, Pascarella, & Nora, 1996, as cited in Denson, N., & Chang, M.

Newly acquired freedom founded a growth in African American participation in politics. This period of increased African American participation, from 1867 to 1877, is known as [[Reconstruction Era|Radical Reconstruction]] or [[Black Reconstruction]].  Despite the increase in African American participation in politics, Radical Reconstruction is not mentioned as an example of how black politics strive to be. There are very distinct viewpoints concerning this time period.  \nSome believed that corruption had run rampart in the South with the introduction of newly freed slaves into legislation and a great deal of attention was given to the negativity that surrounded the introduction of black faces into government. The Reconstruction of South Carolina particularly was under scrutiny as the legislatures were predominantly black. The happenings in the South Carolina legislature were described negatively and seen as pro- black and significantly focused on issues that only pertained to blacks. Attention was solely focused on the misgivings occurring within legislature such as, \"unethical appropriation of state funds by members of the legislature\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company Inc.|location=United States of America}}</ref> and other unethical and illegal acts committed by both black and white legislatures in South Carolina.  Another set of issues brought up was the multitude of expensive decorative items and embellishments that were purchased for the refurbishment of the State House.  White legislatures were generally left out of the criticisms, despite their own contributions, and were referred to as victims of corruption due to the influence of black people.\nOthers believed that Black Reconstruction was not to blame for all corruption in legislation.  This faction of people saw the constructive debates and conversations that flowed within the southern legislations.  They were also more receptive to the positive aspects and characteristics of black legislatures that were displayed during their time in office.\nDespite the amount of eager participants, this period eventually led to a decline in black participation in politics.  The backlash of those against increase of black participation in politics effectively began to cause the number of participants to stop and then decline.  Today, despite past involvement, black participation in politics is low.  Black participation is not a common occurrence in comparison to overall participation and is often celebrated when a black candidate or politician does particularly well in their political endeavors.  This decline is attributed to a white counterattack of the Black Reconstruction movement.  Many methods were used to dissuade blacks from taking office.  One of the most prominent was violence.  An example of that would be the Ku Klux Klan, a secretive group whose members all believed in white supremacy.  The lynching, beatings, and intimidation of black people helped to hasten the decline of black participation in politics. Coercion was also another method used to dissuade black participation in politics, particularly voting.  Threats of loss jobs and refusal of medical care are some of the coercion methods employed.  Coercion did not play as big of a role as direct physical violence however it did serve to further hinder the growth of black participation in politics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company, INC|location=New York|oclc=53860}}</ref>  These methods helped to forge a political system that has a scarce amount of minorities in office.\n\n==== Representation ====\nBlack representation in Congress had been scarce with less than eight Blacks in Congress per Congressional periods since the [[41st Congress|end of the Civil War]] up until the [[91st Congress|Nixon era]] when there were 11 Black representatives (ten in the House and one in the Senate).

This led to an emphasis on the acquisition of Aboriginal lands in exchange for the putative benefits of European society and their associated Christian religions. British control of Canada (the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]) began when they exercised jurisdiction over the first nations and it was by Royal Proclamation that the first piece of legislation the British government passed over First Nations citizens assumed control of their lives. It gave recognition to the Indians tribes as First Nations living under Crown protection.\n\nIt was after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|treaty of Paris In 1763]], whereby France ceded all claims in present-day Canada to Britain, that King George III of Great Britain issued this Royal Proclamation specifying how the Indigenous in the [[Monarchy of Canada|crown]] colony were to be treated. It is the most significant pieces of legislation regarding the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]'s relationship with Aboriginal people. This Royal Proclamation recognized Indian owned lands and reserved to them all use as their hunting grounds. It also established the process by which the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]] could purchase their lands, and also laid out basic principles to guide the Crown when making treaties with the First Nations. The Proclamation made Indian lands transferred by treaty to be Crown property, and stated that indigenous title is a collective or communal rather than a private right so that individuals have no claim to lands where they lived and hunted long before the British came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cidh.org/countryrep/Indigenous-Lands09/Chap.V-VI.htm|title=Indigenous and Tribal People's Rights Over Their Ancestral Lands and Natural Resources|author=|date=|website=cidh.org|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Indian Acts===\n\nIn 1867, the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act]] made [[Indian Reserve (1763)|land reserved for Indians]] a [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]  responsibility.

Despite the evident detriment to the M\u00e9tis, speculation was rampant and done in collusion with the distribution of scrip.  While this does not necessarily preclude a malicious intent by the federal government to consciously 'cheat' the M\u00e9tis, it illustrates their apathy towards the welfare of the M\u00e9tis, their long-term interests, and the recognition of their Aboriginal title.  But the point of the policy was to settle land in the North-West with agriculturalists, not keep a land reserve for the M\u00e9tis.

Indigenous people could gain the right to vote and become Canadian citizens, \"persons\" under the law, by voluntarily assimilating into European/Canadian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Act_to_encourage_the_gradual_Civilization_of_the_Indian_Tribes_in_this_Province,_and_to_amend_the_Laws_respecting_Indians|title=An Act to encourage the gradual Civilization of the Indian Tribes in this Province, and to amend the Laws respecting Indians|via=Wikisource}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_07030|title=Bill : an act to encourage the gradual civiliza... - cover - Early Canadiana Online|author=Canadiana|date=|work=canadiana.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> \nIt was hoped that indigenous peoples would renounce their native heritage and culture and embrace the 'benefits' of civilized society. Indeed, from the 1920s to the 1940s some Natives did give up their status in order to receive the right to go to school, vote or to drink. However, voluntary enfranchisement proved a failure when few natives took advantage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://signatoryindian.tripod.com/routingusedtoenslavethesovereignindigenouspeoples/id10.html|title=2. 1857 - Gradual civilization of the Indian tribes- Enfranchisement Scheme|work=signatoryindian.tripod.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref>\nIn 1920 a law was passed to authorize enfranchisement without consent, and many Aboriginal peoples were involuntarily enfranchised. Natives automatically lost their Indian status under this policy and also if they became professionals such as doctors or ministers, or even if they obtained university degrees, and with it, their right to reside on the reserves.\n\nThe enfranchisement requirements particularly discriminated against Native women, specifying in Section 12 (1)(b) of the Indian Act that an Indian status woman marrying a non Indian man would lose her status as an Indian, as would her children. In contrast non Indian women marrying Indian men would gain Indian status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-31|title=Bill C-31 (Historical)|date=|work=openparliament.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n[[Duncan Campbell Scott]], the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, neatly expressed the sentiment of the day in 1920:\n\"Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question and no Indian Department\"\nThis aspect of enfranchisement was addressed by passage of Bill C-31 in 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca/bill_c-31/|title=Bill C-31|website=indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca}}</ref> where the discriminatory clauses of the Indian Act was removed, and Canada officially gave up the goal of enfranchising Natives.\n\n===Residential schools===\n\nWith the goal of civilizing and Christianizing Aboriginal populations, a system of 'industrial schools' was developed in the 19th century which combined academic studies with \"more practical matters\" and schools for Natives began to appear in the 1840s. From 1879 on these schools were modelled after the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle Indian School]] in Pennsylvania, whose motto was \"[[Kill the Indian, Save the Man|Kill the Indian in him and save the man]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waynekspear.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/residential-schools.gif|title=Image of students|author=|date=|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> It was felt that the most effective weapon for \"killing the Indian\" in them, was to remove children from their Native supports and so Native children were taken away from their homes, their parent, their families, friends and communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/indian-residential-school-truth-and-reconciliation-c|title=Indian Residential School Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|work=Cultural Survival|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\nThe 1876 Indian Act gave the federal government responsibility for Native education and by 1910 residential schools dominated the Native education policy. The government provided funding to religious groups such as the Catholic, Anglican, United Church and Presbyterian churches to undertake Native education. By 1920, attendance by natives was made compulsory and there were 74 residential schools operating nationwide. Following the ideas of [[Clifford Sifton|Sifton]] and others like him, the academic goals of these schools were \"dumbed down\". As [[Duncan Campbell Scott]] stated at the time, they didn't want students that were \"made too smart for the Indian villages\":<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielnpaul.com/IndianResidentialSchools.html|title=Indian Residential Schools - Cultural Genocide|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\"To this end the curriculum in residential schools has been simplified and the practical instruction given is such as may be immediately of use to the pupil when he returns to the reserve after leaving school.\"\n\nThe funding the government provided was generally insufficient and often the schools ran themselves as \"self-sufficient businesses\", where 'student workers' were removed from class to do the laundry, heat the building or perform farm work. Dormitories were often poorly heated and overcrowded, and the food was less than adequately nutritious. A 1907 report, commissioned by [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs]], found that in 15 prairie schools there was a death rate of 24%.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\">{{cite web|url=http://waynekspear.com/2010/03/10/indian-residential-schools-2/|title=Indian Residential Schools|work=Wayne K. Spear - Writer|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Indeed, a deputy superintendent general of Indian Affairs at the time commented:\n\"It is quite within the mark to say that fifty percent of the children who passed through these schools did not benefit from the education which they had received therein.\"\nWhile the death rate did decline in later years, death would remain a part of the residential school tradition. The author of that report to the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|BNA]], [[Peter Bryce|Dr. P.H. Bryce]], was later removed and in 1922 published a pamphlet<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofnationalc00brycuoft#page/n5/mode/2up|title=The story of a national crime : being an appeal for justice to the Indians of Canada; the wards of the nation, our allies in the Revolutionary War, our brothers-in-arms in the Great War|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> that came close to calling the governments indifference to the conditions of the Indians in the schools 'manslaughter'.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\"/>\n\nThe worst aspect of Canada's residential schools, and that which anthropologists [[John Steckley|Steckley]] and Cummins said \"might readily qualify as the single-worst thing that Europeans did to Natives in Canada\" was the endemic abuses;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/steckley-john/signed|title=Steckley John, Signed|date=12 July 1981|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> emotional, physical and sexual, for which they are now known. Punishments were often brutal and cruel, sometimes even life-threatening or life-ending.

Criminal and civil suits against the government and the churches began in the late 1980s and shortly thereafter the last residential school closed. By 2002 the number of lawsuits had passed 10,000. In the 1990s, beginning with the United Church, the churches that ran the residential schools began to issue formal apologies. And in 1998 the Canadian government issued the Statement of [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Reconciliation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|title=TRC|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082611/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and committed $350 million in support of a community-based healing strategy to address the healing needs of individuals, families and communities arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. The money was used to launch the Aboriginal Healing Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca|title=Announcements - Aboriginal Healing Foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n<!-- ===Conclusion===\n\nThe overt institutional racism of the past has clearly had a profoundly devastating and lasting effect on visible minorities and Aboriginal communities throughout Canada. European cultural norms have imposed themselves on Native populations in Canada, and Aboriginal communities continue to struggle with foreign systems of governance, of justice, of education, and of livelihood. Visible Minorities struggle with education, employment and negative contact with the legal system across Canada.\n\nPerhaps most palpable is the dysfunction and familial devastation caused by residential schools. Hutchins states;<ref name=\"tolerance.cz\"/> \"Many of those who attended residential schools have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from such symptoms as panic attacks, insomnia, and uncontrollable or unexplainable anger. Many also suffer from alcohol or drug abuse, sexual inadequacy or addiction, the inability to form intimate relationships, and eating disorders. Three generations of Native parents lost out on learning important parenting skills usually passed on from parent to child in caring and nurturing home environments, and the abuse suffered by students of residential schools has begun a distressing cycle of abuse within many Native communities.\" The lasting legacy of residential schools is but only one facet of the problem.<ref>Canada's Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was 'Cultural Genocide,' Report Finds\". NY Times. 2 June 2015. Retrieved 2 June 2015</ref>\n\nThe hutchins report continues; \"Aboriginal children continue to struggle with mainstream education in Canada. For some Indian students, English remains a second language, and many lack parents with sufficient education themselves to support them. Moreover, education in Canada is premised on a written tradition, quite different from the oral tradition of Native communities. For others, it is simply that they are ostracised for their 'otherness'; their manners, their attitudes, their speech or a hundred other things which mark them out as different. \nAboriginal populations continue to suffer from poor health. They have seven years less life expectancy than the overall Canadian population and almost twice as many infant deaths. While Canada as a nation routinely ranks in the top three on the United Nations Human Development Index,<ref>http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/270/hdr_2010_en_complete_reprint.pdf</ref> its on-reserve Aboriginal population, if scored as a nation, would rank a distant and shocking sixty-third.\"\n\nAs [[Phil Fontaine]] National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, points out, racism in Canada today is for the most part, a covert operation. Its central and most distinguishing characteristic is the vigour with which it is consistently denied. There are many who argue that Canada's endeavours in the field of human rights and its stance against racism have only resulted in a \"more politically correct population who have learnt to better conceal their prejudices\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/b9p1qzffl466/privilege/|title=Privilege|work=prezi.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> In effect, the argument is that racism in Canada is not being eliminated, but rather is becoming more covert, more rational and perhaps more deeply imbedded in our institutions. \nThat racism is alive is evidenced by the recent referendum in British Columbia by which the provincial government is asking the white majority to decide on a mandate for negotiating treaties with the Indian minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2002/33.html|title=Kajlich, Helena --- \"The British Columbia Treaty Referendum: An Appropriate Democratic Exercise?\" [2002] IndigLawB 33; (2002) 5(17) Indigenous Law Bulletin 11|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The results of the referendum will be binding,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtleisland.org/news/news-bctreaty-referendum1.htm|title=British Columbia Treaty referendum|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> the government having legislatively committed itself to act on these principles if more than 50% of those voting reply in the same way.

This policy was enforced with the support of various Christian churches, who ran many of the schools. Over the course of the system's existence, approximately 30% of native children, roughly some 150,000, were placed in residential schools nationally, with the last school closing in 1996. There has long been controversy about the conditions experienced by students in the residential schools. While day schools for First Nations, Metis, and Inuit children always far outnumbered residential schools, a new consensus emerged in the early 21st century that the latter schools did significant harm to Aboriginal children who attended them by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, undergoing forced sterilization for some students, and by exposing many of them to physical leading to sexual abuse by staff members, and other students, and dis-enfranchising them forcibly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Harper |title=Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |website=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |language=en |date=June 11, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516080220/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the government started a number of initiatives to address the effects of the Indian residential school. In March 1998, the government made a Statement of Reconciliation and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. In the fall of 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution process was launched, which was a process outside of court providing compensation and psychological support for former students of residential schools who were physically or sexually abused or were in situations of wrongful confinement. On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet and in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates. A [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] ran from 2008 through to 2015 in order to document past wrongdoing in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past.<ref>{{cite web|title=14.12 Elimination of Racial and Ethnic Stereotyping, Identification of Groups|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-srch?lang=eng&srchtxt=indigenous&cur=2&nmbr=2&lettr=14&info0=14.12#zz14|website=Translation Bureau|publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=April 30, 2017|language=en|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Algeria==\n{{main|Pacification of Algeria}}\n\nFrench political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (1805\u201359) supported colonization in general, and in particular the colonization of Algeria. In several speeches on France's foreign affairs, and in two official reports presented to the National Assembly in March 1847 on behalf of an ad hoc commission, he also repeatedly commented on and analysed the issue in his voluminous correspondence. In short, De Tocqueville developed a theoretical basis for French expansion in North Africa.<ref>See De la colonie en Alg\u00e9rie, Complexe, Brussels, 1988, and Nous et les Autres, Seuil, Paris, 1989, \"Tocqueville\", pp 219-234.</ref> He even studied the Koran, sharply concluding that the religion of Muhammad was \"the main cause of the decadence ... of the Muslim world\". His opinions are also instructive about the early years of the French conquest and how the colonial state was first set up and organized. De Tocqueville emerged as an early advocate of \"total domination\" in Algeria and subsequent \"devastation of the country\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, pp 699 and 706.</ref>  On 31 January 1830 when Charles X captured Algiers the French state thus began what became the institutional racism directed at the Kabyle, or Berbers, of Arab descent in north Africa. The [[Dey of Algiers]] had insulted the monarchy by slapping the French ambassador with a fly whisk and the French used this pretext to invade, and also put an end to [[piracy]] in the vicinity. The unofficial objective was to restore the prestige of the French crown and gain a foothold in North Africa, thereby preventing the British gaining advantage over France in the Mediterranean. The [[July Monarchy]], which came to power in 1831, inherited this burden. The next 9 years saw the indigenous population subjected to the [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|might]] of the French army. By 1840 more conservative elements gained control of the government and they dispatched General Thomas Bugeaud, the newly appointed governor of the colony, to [[French Algeria|Algeria]], marking the real start of the country's conquest. The methods employed were atrocious. The army deported villagers en masse; massacred the men and raped women; took the children hostage, stole livestock and harvests and destroyed orchards. De Tocqueville wrote, \"I believe the laws of war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks.\"<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie in Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes, Paris, Gallimard, Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade, 1991, pp 704 and 705.</ref> He added: \"In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept.\"<ref>In a work that seeks to defend the army's excesses, Pierre Montagnon wrote of the victims: \"500,000? A million? The truth must lie somewhere between these figures. Anything less would be to play down a terrible reality,\" La conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie, Paris, Pygmalion, 1986, p 414. If we compare these figures with historian Denise Bouche's estimate of the total population in 1830 at \"about three million people\", the scale of the massacres becomes clearer; see her Histoire de la colonisation fran\u00e7aise, volume 2, Paris, Fayard, 1998, p 23.</ref> He also advocated that \"all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria\".<ref>Olivier LeCour Grandmaison (2001). \"Tocqueville et la conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie\" (in French). La Mazarine.</ref> [[Marshal Bugeaud]], who was the first governor-general as he was also heading the civil gov't, was rewarded by the King for the conquest, having instituted the [[French conquest of Algeria|systemic]] use of torture and following a \"[[scorched earth]]\" policy against the Arab population.\n\n===Land grab===\n\nOnce the conquest of Algiers was accomplished soldier-politician [[Bertrand Clauzel]] and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, which triggered a [[land rush]]. He became governor general in 1835 and used his office to make private investments in land, encouraging bureaucrats and army officers in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Merchants with influence in the government also saw profit in land speculation which resulted in expanding the French occupation. Large agricultural tracts were carved out, factories and businesses began exploiting cheap local labor and also to benefit from laws and edicts that gave control to the French. The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control. By 1843, De Tocqueville intended to protect and extend expropriation by the [[rule of law]]. He therefore advocated setting up special courts, based on what he called \"summary\" procedure, to carry out massive expropriation for the benefit of French and other European settlers who would thus be able to purchase land at an attractive price and live in villages that the colonial government had equipped with fortifications, churches, schools and even fountains. His belief, which framed his writings and influenced state actions, was that the local people, who had been driven out by the army and robbed of their land by the judges, would gradually die out.\n\nThe French colonial state, as he conceived it and as it took shape in Algeria, was a two-tiered organization, quite unlike the regime in mainland France. It introduced two different political and legal systems which, in the last analysis, were based on racial, cultural and religious distinctions. According to De Tocqueville, the system that should apply to the colonizers would enable them alone to hold property and travel freely, but would deprive them of any form of political freedom, which should be suspended in Algeria. \"There should therefore be two quite distinct legislations in Africa, for there are two very separate communities. There is absolutely nothing to prevent us treating Europeans as if they were on their own, as the rules established for them will only ever apply to them\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, p 752.</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeats of the Muslim army in the 1840s colonization continued apace. By 1848, Algeria was populated by 109,400 Europeans, only 42,274 of which were French.<ref>Sessions, Jennifer (2011). By Sword and Plow: France and the Conquest of Algeria.

The [[Colonialism|colonials]] imposed more and higher taxes on [[Muslims]] than on [[Europeans]].<ref>Alistair Horne, page 63 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> The Muslims, in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the French conquest, also paid new taxes, from which the colons were normally exempted. In 1909, for instance, [[Muslims]], who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria's income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. And colons controlled how these revenues would be spent. As a result, colon towns had handsome municipal buildings, paved streets lined with trees, fountains and statues, while Algerian villages and rural areas benefited little if at all from tax revenues.\n\n===In education===\n\nThe colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for Algerian Muslims, who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading, writing, and engage in religious studies. Not only did the state appropriate the habus lands (the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions, including schools) in 1843, but colon officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population. In 1892, more than five times as much was spent for the education of Europeans as for Muslims, who had five times as many children of school age. Because few Muslim teachers were trained, Muslim schools were largely staffed by French teachers. Even a state-operated [[madrasa]]h often had French faculty members. Attempts to institute [[bilingual]], [[bicultural]] schools, intended to bring Muslim and European children together in the classroom, were a conspicuous failure, rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870. According to one estimate, fewer than 5% of Algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870. As late as 1954 only one Muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen was receiving formal schooling.<ref>Alistair Horne, pages 60-61 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> Efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of Muslims along with European students in the French school system as part of France's \"civilizing mission\" in Algeria. The curriculum was entirely French and allowed no place for Arabic studies, which were deliberately downgraded even in Muslim schools. Within a generation, a class of well-educated, gallicized Muslims \u2013 the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|\u00e9volu\u00e9s]] (literally, the evolved ones) \u2013 had been created.\n\n===Enfranchisement===\nFollowing its conquest of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as \"quasi-apartheid\".<ref>\"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s as a colony.

Institutional racism had its early roots here due to interactions between these islanders who had Melanesian origins and depended on the sea for sustenance whose land rights were abrogated; and later the Australian Aboriginal peoples whose children were removed from their families by Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stolengenerations123.wikispaces.com/Emergence+of+the+child+removal+policy|title=stolengenerations123 - Emergence of the child removal policy|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The removals occurred in the period between approximately 1909 and 1969.

In the remote communities, the report cited 71% of the population in these remote discrete indigenous communities lacked access to public transportation and 78% of the communities were more than 50 miles from the nearest hospital. Although English is the official language of Australia, many indigenous Australians do not speak it as a primary language and the lack of printed materials that are translated into the Aboriginal languages and the non-availability of translators form a barrier to adequate health care for the Aborigines.

[[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]] used the term as a description of \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\", which \"can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lawrence/Story/0,,941167,00.html \"Metropolitan police still institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 22 April 2003</ref> Sir William's definition is almost identical to Stokely Carmichael's original definition some forty years earlier. Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton 1967 were black power activists and first used the term 'institutional racism' to describe the consequences of a societal structure that was stratified into a racial hierarchy that resulted in layers of discrimination and inequality for minority ethnic people in housing, income, employment, education and health (Garner 2004:22).<ref name=\"Blagg2008\">{{cite book|last=Blagg|first=Harry|title=Crime, Aboriginality and the Decolonisation of Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojyQTjn8FFgC&pg=PA9|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Hawkins Press|isbn=978-1-876067-19-9|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Stephen Lawrence#The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report|Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report]], and the public's response to it, were among the major factors that forced the [[Metropolitan Police]] to address its treatment of ethnic minorities. More recently, the former [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Ian Blair|Sir Ian Blair]] said that the British news media are institutionally racist,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm \"Met chief accuses media of racism\"], [[BBC]], 26 January 2006</ref> a comment that offended journalists, provoking angry responses from the media, despite the [[National Black Police Association (UK)|National Black Police Association]] welcoming Blair's assessment.<ref>[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1696070,00.html?gusrc=rss \"Met chief labels media institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 27 January 2006</ref>\n\nThe report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holdaway | first1 = Simon | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Megan | year = 2006 | title = Institutional Racism after Macpherson: An Analysis of Police Views | url = | journal = Policing and Society | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 349\u2013369 | doi = 10.1080/10439460600967885 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], said there was some justification in claims that the Metropolitan Police Service is institutionally racist.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33025853|title=Met acknowledges 'some justification' to claims the force is 'racist'|publisher=BBC News |date=5 June 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal conviction===\nWhile problems with the treatment of minorities in criminal investigations were found institutional, another aspect of criminal conviction crossed the line, affecting both white and black convicts. For 7 years, the courts in the U.K. handed down sentences for minor crimes that resulted in virtual life in prison. By 2012, the use of [[Imprisonment for public protection|IPP]] sentence guidelines were curtailed, however, three years after the sentences were abolished, more than three fourths of the 4,612 IPP prisoners still jailed in the system have passed the minimum sentence term set by the court. 200 more have been in prison for nearly a decade \u2013 despite being given a minimum sentence of less than two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-vice-news-investigates-the-uks-4500-prisoners-doing-life-for-minor-crimes|title=Exclusive: VICE News Investigates the UK's 4,500 Prisoners Doing Life for Minor Crimes|date=|work=VICE News|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> These guidelines were introduced to keep criminals behind bars until they were no longer deemed a risk to the public, but where their crimes did not warrant a fixed life sentence. Although they were designed for the most dangerous offenders, IPP sentences were given out for relatively minor crimes including affray (fighting in public), minor criminal damage worth less than 20 pounds, and shoplifting. They were ended in 2012 after the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that all prisoners had the right to know how long they were being held for. UK courts stopped handing out the sentences, but the ban did nothing to impact those already serving an IPP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/free-the-remaining-ipp-prisoners?source=twitter-share-button|title=Free the remaining Ipp prisoners.|date=|work=Campaigns by You|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a kafkaesque turn, many cannot be released as they cannot complete the courses required as a condition of release due to them not being offered, and paperwork to conclude parole hearings is not prepared before the hearings, only after the hearing is concluded due to lack of paperwork.

Those marked as black were further discriminated against differentially, with Africans facing more extreme forms of exclusion and exploitation than those marked as coloured or Indian. One such example of institutional racism in South Africa is [[Natives Land Act, 1913]], which reserved 90% of land for white use and the Native Urban Areas Act of 1923 controlled access to urban areas, which suited commercial farmers who were keen to hold labour on their land. Africans, who formed the majority of the population, were relegated to barren\nrural reserves, which later became homelands.<ref>Bozalek, Vivienne. \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vivienne_Bozalek/publication/258185153_The_Effect_of_Institutional_Racism_on_Student_Family_Circumstances_A_Human_Capabilities_Perspective/links/545bacb90cf249070a7a7a7e.pdf The Effect of Institutional Racism on Student Family Circumstances: A Human Capabilities Perspective].\" South African Journal of Psychology 40.4 (2010): 487-494.

When the differential access becomes integral to institutions, it becomes common practice, making it difficult to rectify. Eventually, this racism dominates public bodies, private corporations, public and private universities, and is reinforced by the actions of conformists and newcomers. Another difficulty in reducing institutionalized racism is that there is no sole, true identifiable perpetrator. When racism is built into the institution, it emerges as the collective action of the population.\n\nProfessor James M. Jones postulates three major types of racism: personally mediated, [[Internalized racism|internalized]], and institutionalized.<ref>Jones, J. M. (1997). ''Prejudice and Racism'' (2nd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Personally mediated racism includes the specific social attitudes inherent to racially prejudiced action ([[bigotry|bigoted]] differential assumptions about abilities, motives, and the intentions of others according to), [[discrimination]] (the differential actions and behaviours towards others according to their race), [[stereotyping]], commission, and omission (disrespect, suspicion, devaluation, and dehumanization). [[Internalized racism]] is the acceptance, by members of the racially [[stigmatized]] people, of negative perceptions about their own abilities and intrinsic worth, characterized by low [[self-esteem]], and low esteem of others like them. This racism can be manifested through embracing \"whiteness\" (e.g. [[Social stratification|stratification]] by skin colour in non-white communities), self-devaluation (e.g., racial slurs, nicknames, rejection of ancestral culture, etc.), and resignation, helplessness, and hopelessness (e.g., [[dropping out]] of school, [[abstention|failing to vote]], engaging in health-risk practices, etc.).\n\nPersistent negative [[stereotype]]s fuel institutional racism, and influence [[interpersonal relations]]. Racial stereotyping contributes to patterns of [[racial segregation#United States|racial residential segregation]] and [[redlining]], and shape views about crime, crime policy, and welfare policy, especially if the contextual information is stereotype-consistent.<ref>[http://www2.asanet.org/centennial/race_ethnicity_health.pdf Race, Ethnicity, and the Health of Americans.

One example of the difference is public school budgets in the U.S. (including local levies and bonds) and the quality of teachers, which are often correlated with property values: rich neighborhoods are more likely to be more 'white' and to have better teachers and more money for education, even in public schools. [[restrictive covenants|Restrictive housing contracts]] and bank lending policies have also been listed as forms of institutional racism. Other examples sometimes described as institutional racism are [[racial profiling]] by security guards and police, use of stereotyped racial caricatures, the under- and misrepresentation of certain racial groups in the [[mass media]], and race-based barriers to gainful employment and professional advancement. Additionally, differential access to goods, services, and opportunities of society can be included within the term ''institutional racism'', such as unpaved streets and roads, inherited socio-economic disadvantage, and \"standardized\" tests (each ethnic group prepared for it differently; many are poorly prepared).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aaup.org/article/why-standardized-tests-have-standardized-postracial-ideology#.W7JDamhKjIU|title=Why Standardized Tests Have Standardized Postracial Ideology {{!}} AAUP|website=aaup.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>\n\nSome [[sociology|sociological]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.strategicpractice.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/GPP_4FacesOfPower.pdf | title=The Four Faces of Power | last=Healey | first=Richard | last2=Hinson| first2=Sandra}}</ref> investigators distinguish between institutional racism and \"structural racism\" (sometimes called structured [[racialization]]).<ref>[http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/docs/NewSR-brochure-FINAL.pdf Kirwan Institute brochure]</ref> The former focuses upon the norms and practices within an institution, the latter upon the ''interactions'' among institutions, interactions that produce [[racialized]] outcomes against non-white people.<ref name=\"esdc.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|title=Snapshot of racialized Poverty in Canada|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161211143715/http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/communities/reports/poverty_profile/snapshot.shtml|archive-date=11 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> An important feature of structural racism is that it cannot be reduced to individual [[prejudice]] or to the single function of an institution.\n\n== United States ==\n\n=== In housing and loan ===\n[[File:NOLA16Sep13 Iberville Fence.JPG|thumb|Iberville Housing Projects in New Orleans, Louisiana]]\nInstitutional racism in the housing sector can be seen as early as the 1930s with the [[Home Owners' Loan Corporation]]. Banks would determine a neighborhood's risk for loan default and [[Redlining|redline]] neighborhoods that were at high risk of default. These neighborhoods tended to be African American neighborhoods, whereas white-middle-class Americans were able to receive housing loans.

A settlement with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Dept]] and the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] was the largest in the history of both agencies, topping $33 million in restitution for the practice from New Jersey's largest savings bank. The bank had been accused of steering clear of minority neighborhoods and favoring white suburban borrowers in granting loans and mortgages, finding that of the approximately 1900 mortgages made in 2014 only 25 went to black applicants. The banks' executives denied bias, and the settlement came with adjustments to the banks business practices. This followed other successful efforts by the federal, state and city officials in 2014 to expand lending programs directed at minorities, and in some cases to force banks to pay penalties for patterns of redlining in Providence, R.I.; St. Louis, Mo.; Milwaukee, WI.; Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.  The Justice Dept also has more active redlining investigations underway,<ref>Rachel Witkowski (8 May 2015).

''National Mortgage News''.</ref> and officials have stated to reporters that \"redlining is not a thing of the past\". It has evolved into a more politically correct version, where bankers do not talk about denying loans to blacks openly. The justice department officials noted that some banks have quietly institutionalized bias in their operations. They have moved their operations out of minority communities entirely, while others have moved in to fill the void and compete for clients. Such management decisions are not the stated intent, it is left unspoken so that even the bank's other customers are unaware that it is occurring. The effect on minority communities can be profound as home ownership, a prime source of neighborhood stability and economic mobility can affect its vulnerability to blight and disrepair. In the 1960s and 1970s laws were passed banning the practice; its return is far less overt, and while the vast majority of banks operate legally, the practice appears to be more widespread as the investigation revealed a vast disparity in loans approved for blacks vs whites in similar situations.<ref>Long banned, mortgage bias returns as issue, ''New York Times'' article, Saturday, October 1, 2015, pg 1</ref>\n\nStudies in major cities such as Los Angeles and Baltimore show that communities of color have lower levels of access to parks and green space.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wolsh|first1=Jennifer|last2=Wilson|first2=John P.|last3=Fehrenbach|first3=Jed|title=Parks and Park Funding in Los Angeles: An Equity Mapping Analysis|url=http://lusk.usc.edu/sites/default/files/working_papers/Wolch.parks_.pdf|website=University of Southern California}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Boone|first1=Christopher|last2=Buckley|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Grove|first3=J.

The Justice Dept, following a 20-month investigation based on 33,000 cases over three years, reported that black youths were treated more harshly than whites and that all low-income youths, regardless of race, were deprived of their basic constitutional rights. Youths who encountered law enforcement got little or no chance to challenge detention or get any help from lawyers. With only one public defender assigned to juveniles in a county of one million, that legal aide handled 394 cases in 2014. The investigation was unrelated to the notorious case which roiled St. Louis, beginning before the police shooting of the unarmed black youth.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grossman |first=Andrew |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ferguson-police-accused-of-racial-bias-by-federal-investigation-1425411657 |title=Ferguson Police, Courts Accused of Racial Bias by Justice Department Probe |publisher=WSJ |date=2015-03-03 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref> The failure to grant access to counsel brought to light the practice of an informal process which could let offenders off with a warning or having them enter into diversion programs in lieu of  being charged in court. But to be accepted into the informal process, offenders had to admit to guilt, which runs afoul of the right not to incriminate oneself in criminal proceedings. The investigation following Michael Brown's shooting found an enormous disparity in the way juvenile cases were handled, with blacks being 47% more likely than whites to be put through the formal criminal proceedings. It also found them more likely to be held in detention, and also subsequently sentenced to incarceration once the case was finished. They were also more likely to be detained for violating parole from a previous case.<ref>\"The US finds racial Bias in a court in Missouri\", ''New York Times'' August 1, 2015, Nat'l news</ref>\n\nThe county did not cooperate fully with the Justice Dept and the St. Louis Family Court declined to comment, as did the state court system, of which it is a part.

In most state courts, the public defender's office decides who is poor enough to merit representation; in St. Louis Family Court the judge or court commissioner, sometimes based on different standards, decides who gets access to counsel. Most troubling to the justice official was the continuing use of court officials to recite complicated statutory language about the alleged crimes, then leading the defendants through \"formulaic 'do you understand' and yes/no questions.\" Judges made no effort to find out if the pleas were coerced, whether the child had any criminal intent or especially, did they fully understand the consequences of pleading guilty to the charges. Their competency to take part in their own defense was never established and the legal aide in the cases examined never challenged a probable cause finding, hired an expert witness or challenged hearsay evidence or leading questions and most cases ended with the child pleading guilty. The Civil Rights Division (of  the Justice Dept) began four investigations beginning in 2013 delving into juvenile justice systems in Miss., Tenn., Texas, and Missouri and while settlements were reached it has had to file suit to overcome the disparities in criminal convictions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/doj-report-critical-st-louis-county-family-court-32805053 |title=U.S. News &#124; National News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2015-10-16 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\nCoupled with [[zero-tolerance]] discipline in schools, a \"one size fits all solution\" decried by the [[American Bar Association]], black and Latino youth are more likely to encounter negative contact with law enforcement and accrue violations, which leads to fines and failure to pay, which in turn leads to warrants and/or probation violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/opinion/schoolkids-in-handcuffs.html|title=Schoolkids in Handcuffs|last=The Editorial Board|date=4 November 2015|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> This cycle has been shown to put children, particularly low-income minorities, in the [[school-to-prison pipeline]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/what-school-prison-pipeline |title=What is the School-to-Prison Pipeline? &#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-03-11 |accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\n====Judicial misconduct====\n{{See also|Judicial misconduct}}\n\nIn 2010, two Washington state supreme court justices, Richard Sanders and James Johnson, were baffled at a court meeting to determine the fate of $25,000 in funding for various boards and commissions. They stated that there was too much African American representation in the prison population because African Americans are known to commit a number crimes and not because of their race. A black lawyer says she was shocked to hear two justices, [[Richard B. Sanders]] and Johnson, refer to a former legal aid lawyer's assertions in a report using the phrase ''poverty pimp''. Shirley Bondon, a state Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) manager who oversaw court programs critical of the legal system, told the justices that she believed there was racial \"bias in the criminal-justice system, from the bottom up.\" The response from Justice Saunders was critical of blacks, stating that he didn't believe the barriers existed, except for poverty because it might restrict the ability to afford an attorney. [[James M. Johnson (judge)|James M. Johnson]], who was noted as the most conservative judge on the court, agreed, noting that African Americans commit them [crimes] against their own communities, to which Bondon objected, requesting a closed-door meeting with the court.

The men were subsequently released based on a pre-trial motion from the defense, claiming that the federal government had no basis for charging them, as no federal law was broken. Arizona officials never initiated criminal proceedings in state court against those responsible for the deportation of workers and their lost wages and other losses. The Justice Department appealed, but in [[United States v. Wheeler (1920)|United States v. Wheeler]], 254 U.S. 281 (1920), Chief Justice [[Edward Douglass White]] wrote for an 8-to-1 majority that the U.S. Constitution did not empower the federal government to enforce the rights of the deportees. Rather it \"necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress, and egress.\" Only in a case of \"state discriminatory action\" would the federal government have a role to play. By this calculated reasoning, the officials situated at the Supreme Court erred in not taking the side that in today's legal lexicon had every right to seek justice and redress, not only for the stolen wages, union busting, false imprisonment and other crimes, but for the inherent right not to be forcibly removed from your home by men with guns and shipped in cattle cars across state lines as many homeowners were. That 8 of the 9 supreme court justices concurred and based on anti-radical speech sentiment at the time (post WWI anti-union and IWW)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://depts.washington.edu/antiwar/WW1_reds.shtml |title=World War I antiwar movement |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date= |access-date=2015-10-26}}</ref> leads to the conclusion that the government gave the company cover to remove the workers, many of whom were Mexicans advocating for better pay and working condition, to a place in the next state closer to the border with the admonition ''never to return''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.desertexposure.com/200707/200707_wobblies.php|title=Desert Exposure Wobblies July 2007|author=|date=|website=DesertExposure.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}</ref> That few deportees returned and those that contested the deportations lost their cases to have their homes returned to [[Necessity (criminal law)|necessity]], and that in 1966 Finally, in [[United States v.

Mitchell Palmer]] and others advocated for a peacetime equivalent of the [[Sedition Act of 1918|Sedition Act]], using the Bisbee events as a justification. They stated that the only reason the company representatives and local law enforcement had taken the law into their own hands was that the government lacked the power to suppress radical sentiment directly. If the government was armed with appropriate legislation and the threat of long prison terms, private citizens would not feel the need to act. Writing in 1920, Harvard Professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] mocked that view: \"Doubtless some governmental action was required to protect pacifists and extreme radicals from mob violence, but incarceration for a period of twenty years seems a very queer kind of protection.<ref>Zechariah Chafee, Jr., Freedom of Speech (NY: Harcourt, Brace, and Howe, 1920), 45-46.</ref> That this was considered [[vigilante]] actions by private citizens duly deputized by the local sheriff gives no weight to the racist component directed towards those of Mexican descent in Arizona, New Mexico, and  Texas, who were being systematically forced from their homes in the US beginning in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pqmyk|title=Mexican Americans and Repatriation|date=|work=tshaonline.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Lynching of people of Mexican Descent====\n\n{{Main|Porvenir massacre (1918)}}\nVigilante actions against Mexicans in the southwest had been documented from the 1850s to 1930s of men, women and children, many of them American citizens; who were burned, shot, hung, whipped or mutilated due to racist terror. Thousands were killed by white settlers and gold prospectors to drive them off their land or steal their claims using false charges to gin up mob actions. Many of the killings took place in front of hundreds who encouraged mobs to remove the men from jails to lynch them. In Texas the [[Texas Ranger Division|Rangers]] were implicated by archeological digs at the sites of one of the massacres that took place near the U.S. Army razed village of Porvenir near the Mexican border in Marfa, Texas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rimrockpress.com/blog/index.php?entry=entry151216-162435|title=PORVENIR MASSACRE ARCHAEOLOGY MOST REVEALING|last=Justice|first=Glenn|date=2017-04-21|website=Glenn's Texas History Blog|access-date=}}</ref> Many of the state sanctioned killings which occurred in Texas have been removed from public view and recent efforts to increase awareness have been stymied by state commissions on historic places.

She was later over-ruled by the head of the State Historical Commission, who brokered a deal to also erect markers at Anglo ranches that were victims of suspected Mexican [[Villistas]], which may also have been a response to the extrajudicial killings by the Rangers and Ranchers.<ref>\"1919 Ranger Investigation\".

Strikers became targets of [[agent provocateurs]] who infiltrated meetings of \"communist labor\" and anti-war activists. After the Bisbee deportations became exposed in the press, Americans were divided about the treatment of illegal aliens, who were purported communists. Former President Theodore Roosevelt opined in the press that the Bisbee miners \"had it coming, as they were hell-bent on havoc!\" The Dept of Justice went from advocating for persons deprived of rights and liberty by state actors to detaining them under dubious warrants and suspicion of radicalism. The [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]] that fueled institutional racism in the 1920s against Russian Jews and other Eastern European immigrants was a backlash to the 1917 Bolshevik revolution in Russia and a [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombing campaign]]  early in 1919 by Italian anarchists advocating the overthrow of the government. The result was the infamous [[Palmer raids]], ostensibly a deportation measure to remove dangerous aliens. In 1919 Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] began a series of raids cooked up to remove radicals and anarchists from the US. Warrants were requested from compliant officials in the [[United States Department of Labor|Labor Dept]], and a number of foreign nationals caught up in the sweeping raids were eventually deported. As only the department of labor had the legal right to deport aliens, they did object to the methods; nevertheless, under [[color of law]], the raids began on November 7, 1919. It was led by a 24-year-old [[J. Edgar Hoover]]  heading a new division of the Justice Department's [[Bureau of Investigation]], called the General Intelligence Division. Armed with responsibility for investigating the programs of radical groups and identifying their members, the raids began with agents of the Bureau of Investigation, together with local police, executing a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the [[Union of Russian Workers]] in 12 cities.\n\nNewspaper accounts reported some were \"badly beaten\" during the arrests. Many later swore they were threatened and beaten during questioning. Government agents cast a wide net, bringing in some American citizens, passers-by who admitted being Russian, some not members of the Russian Workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/toamericanpeople00natiuoft/toamericanpeople00natiuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of \"To the American people; report upon the illegal practices of the United States Department of justice\"|date=|work=archive.org|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Others were teachers conducting night school classes in space shared with the targeted radical groups. Arrests far exceeded the number of warrants. Of 650 arrested in New York City, the government managed to deport just 43. Hoover organized the next raids. He successfully persuaded the Department of Labor to ease its insistence on promptly alerting those arrested of their right to an attorney. Instead, Labor issued instructions that its representatives could wait until after the case against the defendant was established, \"in order to protect government interests.\"<ref name=\"proprocedure.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.proprocedure.com/labor_history/content8.php|title=Labor History|date=|work=proprocedure.com|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> Less openly, Hoover decided to interpret Labor's agreement to act against the Communist Party to include a different organization, the [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]]. Finally, despite the fact that Secretary of Labor [[William B. Wilson]] insisted that more than membership in an organization was required for a warrant, Hoover worked with more compliant Labor officials and overwhelmed Labor staff to get the warrants he wanted. Justice Department officials, including Palmer and Hoover, later claimed ignorance of such details.\n\nThe Justice Department launched a series of raids on January 2, 1920, with follow-up operations over the next few days. Smaller raids extended over the next six weeks. At least 3,000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted \"clear cases of brutality\". Some cases in Boston included torture, where detainees were placed in a 'hot box' above a furnace and given one glass of water and a slice of bread a day and kept there for 50 hours. The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of Ohio were \"publicity gestures\" designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope. Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation. In a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Louis Freeland Post]], who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal. Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the [[Immigration Act of 1918]].\nAt a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor Wilson to fire Post, but Secretary Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should \"not let this country see red.\" Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President's \"admonition,\" because Palmer \"was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages.\"<ref name=\"Shogan2013\">{{cite book|last=Shogan|first=Robert|title=The Battle of Blair Mountain: The Story of America's Largest Labor Uprising|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVmypbQvHwAC&pg=PA62|date=20 August 2013|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-7867-3594-5|pages=62\u2013}}</ref>\n\n=====Other=====\nOn May 28, 1920, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] published its \"Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice\",<ref>{{cite web | url=http://debs.indstate.edu/n277t6_1920.pdf | title=Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice | publisher=ACLU | date=May 28, 1920}}</ref> which carefully documented the Justice Department's unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by [[agents provocateurs]], and unlawful incommunicado detention.

Many other minorities also suffered from institutional racism. One example is immigration policies against Chinese. The intensified job competition during the 1870s on the West Coast between Chinese workers and Whites invoked anti-Chinese movement. The first Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed to prohibit Chinese immigrating to the United States, resulting in only 10 Chinese immigrants into the U.S. in 1887.

In 1954 while the [[Bracero program]] was in force, the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] used force to repatriate 1 million Mexicans. It was a system of tactical control and cooperation within the U.S. Border Patrol and alongside the Mexican government and was called [[Operation Wetback]]. With the growing diplomatic and security issues surrounding illegal border crossings, the INS increased its raids and apprehensions beginning in the early 1950s leading up to Operation Wetback. Those apprehended were often deported without the opportunity to recover their property in the US or contact family and were stranded without food or employment when they entered Mexico. Deported Mexicans faced extreme conditions and were sometimes left in the desert; 88 deported workers died in 112-degree heat in July 1955. Most were sent by ship to [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]] or transported by land to southern Mexican cities. During the entirety of the Operation, border recruitment of illegal workers by American growers continued due largely to the inexpensiveness of illegal labor and the desire of growers to avoid the bureaucratic obstacles of the Bracero program; the continuation of illegal immigration despite the efforts of Operation Wetback was largely responsible for the failure of the program.<ref>Kevin Starr, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7GvgN0y7yI4C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Endangered Dreams: The Great Depression in California] (1997) p. 261. {{ISBN|0195118022}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the House of Representatives congresspersons [[Hilda Solis]] and [[Luis Gutierrez]] called for an apology from the U.S. Government for the Repatriation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-04-04-1930s-deportees-cover_x.htm|title=U.S. urged to apologize for 1930s deportations - USATODAY.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> This has not occurred to date.

Authorized at the federal level in 1871, it came about due to reforms of the [[spoils system]] in place since the 1830s, and abuses of the post-Civil War era, when Congress authorized the president to appoint a Civil Service Commission and prescribe regulations for admission to public service. A dis-satisfied office-seeker assassinated President Garfield in 1881 and Congress was motivated to pass the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]] in 1883 which firmly established civil service. During reconstruction, this enabled the federal government to provide jobs for newly freed blacks in the south (primarily the Postal Service) where no other employment opportunities existed for them. Since the inception of the merit system in 1881, the numbers of blacks in federal civil service positions rose from 0.057 to 5.6% by 1910.

Following this, cities consulted with their attorneys and as a result, [[Racial integration|Integration]] began. This was replaced in turn by institutional racism, the practice of upholding the letter of the law, but not the spirit, in an effort to prevent minority hires from gaining ground in titles where they were disproportionately underrepresented, such as Police and Fire depts, and in management positions.<ref>{{cite web |first1=Cynthia |last1=Brown |first2=Jack |last2=Maskell |title=Hatch Act Restrictions on Federal Employees' Political Activities in the Digital Age |url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R44469.pdf |work=[[Congressional Research Service]] |page=4 |date=April 13, 2016 |accessdate= December 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Post-integration period====\n\nAround the country in the 1950s, blacks found common cause in challenging [[employment discrimination]], and the colored newspapers took up the cause. Economically, jobs were becoming scarce for minorities during the post-war years as returning servicemen reclaimed the manufacturing and factory base. Civil Service looked to be a reasonable alternative to blacks returning from WWII service overseas and black officers leaving the newly desegregated armed services.  In Los Angeles in the 1950s, the [[NAACP]] fueled an integration campaign in the [[California Eagle]] and petitioned the fire commission to provide more jobs in the LAFD. When the Fire Chief Engineer John Alderson attempted to integrate the department, the resistance to integration created so-called 'Hate Houses' and resulted in the formation of [[The Stentorians]] as a protective force of guardians to protect minority firefighters. New York had previously experienced their own revelations when the [[Vulcan Society]] appeared before the city council and demanded the elimination of 'the black bed' in firehouses for the black firemen. At that hearing in 1944, the NYC council chambers filled with FDNY brass on one side and black firefighters protesting the lack of promotional opportunities and racial harassment on the other.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, integration began and segregation was replaced by institutional racism, which took the form much the same way it did when blacks first got hired before and during WWI. Blacks once appointed to a civil service position were subjected to isolation, ostracism, outright hostility and separate quarters. After 1956, the first black hires to the LAFD after integration unfairly failed to finish academy training. The Vulcan Society in New York mentored many blacks but progress was slow, with hiring not reflected in mirroring the population of the cities served until the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] when the numbers of minority hiring increased. The [[U.S. Department of Labor]] in the 1970s began enforcing racial quotas during the Nixon administration that mandated black hiring, but it was the lawsuits of the 1970s which exploded the imposition of Consent Decrees across the country forcing the diversity of the hard to integrate titles. In 1971 the [[Vulcan Blazers]] of the Baltimore, Maryland fire dept filed a groundbreaking lawsuit that resulted in the appointment of blacks to positions of officers up to assistant chief when the court ruled there had been discrimination in promotions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-12-06/html/CREC-2011-12-06-pt1-PgE2184-3.htm|title=Congressional Record, Volume 157 Issue 186 (Tuesday, December 6, 2011)|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Other minority groups followed their lead and also took to the courts. In 2009 the City of Baltimore paid $4.6 Million to settle a case of discrimination filed by minority policemen alleging discrimination.

W. Bush]] attempted to eliminate [[affirmative action]] during his term of office. He ordered the use of quotas, preferences, set-asides on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin be abolished in hiring. Congress responded with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which only covered the terms for settling cases where discrimination had previously been confirmed. It had been near impossible to prove a case of [[institutional discrimination]] in the courts,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/491/164|title=Patterson v. McLean Credit Union|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/16/us/excerpts-from-opinions-on-scope-of-rights-act.html|title=Excerpts From Opinions on Scope of Rights Act|first=Special To The New York|last=Times|date=16 June 1989|accessdate=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref> and many other cases were terminated upon imposition of a [[consent decree]]. While President [[George H. W. Bush]]'s attempt failed, it fueled the rise in 1996 of the [[California Proposition 209]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/13/california-affirmative-action-ban-proposition-209_n_1274448.html|title=California Affirmative Action Ban, Proposition 209, Challenged in Court|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> a ballot initiative abolishing affirmative action in California universities, to counteract what Institutionalized Racism. [[Affirmative action]] is where members of a minority group get preferential treatment over the majority rather than being treated as equals. This closed down the avenues [[affirmative action]] initiatives had opened for blacks to have race counted as a factor when accounting for different rates of acceptance to Universities and consequently in employment discrimination lawsuits that sought redress from discriminatory hiring. This is where the arguments for redress for past wrongs under the 'catchup provisions' no longer worked in favor of claimants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/dec/03/news/mn-50304|title=Judge Upholds Key Affirmative Action Laws|work=latimes|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Proposition 209 has withstood challenges but in 2013 the California Senate passed Amendment #5 \u2013 which if implemented would have reversed 209 had its main sponsor in the Senate not retracted it before final passage. By 2014 the UCLA Board of Regents came out publicly against 209 after reviewing the loss of minorities in university admissions after 209 was implemented.\n\nThese ballot initiatives spread around the country primarily in [[red states]]. In 2003 the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] had ruled on affirmative action programs at the [[University of Michigan]] in ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'' and [[Grutter v. Bollinger]]; the rulings found the affirmative action program was unconstitutional for the way it was applied, but ambiguously said it could continue to use affirmative action. This strengthened the campaign against racial preferences and proponents pressed ahead with more ballot initiatives under the theory that affirmative action programs were no longer needed. The tide against further passage of such discriminatory ballot box institutional racism didn't abate until the 2008 election cycle when efforts by [[Ward Connerly]], the chairman of the [[American Civil Rights Institute]], a national non-profit organization founded to oppose racial and gender preferences,<ref name=\"acri\">{{cite web |title=About the American Civil Rights Institute |url=http://acri.org/about-acri/|work=American Civil Rights Institute |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> failed to get ballot measures passed in 3 states, was rejected by voters in another, and only in Nebraska got passage to add one last state banning affirmative action as a remedy for past discrimination. His critics condemned Connerly's reasoning, saying he failed to see the extent of past racism on African Americans and Hispanics; and that contemporary institutionalized racism is pervasive and powerful, and that affirmative action can overcome the residual effects of past institutional racism on people of color. Advocates of [[Affirmative Action]] programs denied that these were '[[racial quotas]]' as that was seen as divisive and under [[color of law]], but affirmative action goals fell to this onslaught and subsequent [[reverse discrimination]] lawsuits ended the practice. Connerly, for his part, stated \"I think that in some quarters, many parts of the country, a white male is really disadvantaged ... Because we have developed this notion of women and minorities being so disadvantaged and we have to help them, that we have, in many cases, twisted the thing so that it's no longer a case of equal opportunity. It's a case of putting a fist on the scale.\"<ref name=\"Attack\">{{cite news |title=Attacking Affirmative Action |date=August 29, 2008 |work=NOW on PBS |publisher=PBS |url=https://www.pbs.org/now/shows/434/index.html |accessdate=2009-04-28 }}</ref> His [[multi-racial]] background caused conservatives to back his cause as he was perceived to be both black and anti-affirmative action.\n\n=== In education ===\n[[Standardized testing]] has also been considered a form of institutional racism, because it is believed to be biased in favor of people from particular socio-cultural backgrounds. Some minorities have consistently tested worse than whites on virtually all standardized tests, even after controlling for socioeconomic status, while others have tested consistently better. The cause of the achievement gaps between black, Hispanic, white and Asian students has yet to be fully elucidated.\n\n==== In higher education ====\nIn the 1960s, students of color started attending colleges and universities in record numbers after the passage of the Civil Rights and Higher Education Acts.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aft.org/news/preserving-civil-rights-higher-education-act|title=Preserving civil rights in the Higher Education Act|date=2018-04-30|work=American Federation of Teachers|access-date=2018-09-30|language=en}}</ref> However, the obstacles of integration in predominantly white institutions of higher education led to unforeseen obstacles for faculty and students of color working and studying in such environments. According to a review of educational research, tension and violence followed, one reason being the lack of preparedness of many colleges and universities to teach a diversity of students.<ref name=\"Engberg\">{{cite journal|year=2004|title=Improving Intergroup Relations in Higher Education: A Critical Examination of the Influence of Educational Interventions on Racial Bias|url=|journal=American Educational Research Association|volume=74|issue=4|pages=473\u2013524|doi=10.3102/00346543074004473|last1=Engberg|first1=M.

Board of Education]] was ruled in 1954, actual integration did not completely occur until many years later; the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held multiple hearings on the desegregation of schools, continuously they maintained that [[Brown v.

The underlying issue of minority presence of college campuses occurs. In 2008, the [[National Center for Education Statistics]] reported that while enrollment of minorities and students of color had risen, white enrollment still held the majority on average, accounting for 63 percent of undergraduate college and university students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2010/2010015/indicator6_24.asp|title=Status and Trends in the Education of Racial and Ethnic Minorities|website=nces.ed.gov|language=EN|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While this varies based on the region, state, and elite status, in general the majority of colleges and universities in the United States are predominantly white. According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] there has also been a rise in hate crimes on college campuses; 1250 hate crimes in 2016, up 25 percent from 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/After-2016-Election-Campus/242577|title=After 2016 Election, Campus Hate Crimes Seemed to Jump.

According to the [[U.S. Department of Education,]] being prepared for college is integral to whether or not a student is successful.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/offices/OPE/AgenProj/report/theme1a.html|title=ED.gov|website=www2.ed.gov|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> While the government offers college preparation programs for minority and low-income students, programs such as [[GEAR UP]] and [[Federal TRIO Programs]] help prepare students for college to better ensure their success and retention,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/programs/gearup/index.html|title=Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP)|date=2018-06-08|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-10-14}}</ref> the access to these programs is relatively limited. While programs such as [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have grown since conception, there is still work that needs to be done if more minority students are expected to attend and succeed in a post-secondary institution. Due to availability of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] being subjective based on where geographically a student may be, the benefits are not completely being felt be the targeted communities. However, the positive effects of [[Federal TRIO Programs]] have been pretty bolstering\u2014more minorities and low-income individuals are prepared when going to post-secondary institutions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rti.org/impact/analysis-support-federal-trio-programs|title=Analysis Support for the Federal TRIO Programs|date=2016-06-10|work=RTI|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>\n\nInstitutionalized racism in higher education has received little national attention, even though it is a relevant issue affecting many colleges and universities. Despite efforts to improve the situation on college and university campuses, such as implementing [[affirmative action]] plans, anti-black racism and violence continue to occur.<ref>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/William_Smith57/publication/247752199_Assume_the_Position_You_Fit_the_Description_Psychosocial_Experiences_and_Racial_Battle_Fatigue_Among_African_American_Male_College_Students/links/54ef02da0cf2e55866f3daf4/Assume-the-Position-You-Fit-the-Description-Psychosocial-Experiences-and-Racial-Battle-Fatigue-Among-African-American-Male-College-Students.pdf</ref> The effects of this violence extend beyond the incident itself. According to a U.S. study in Baltimore, racism has a correlation with health complications, such as high systolic blood pressure.<ref name=\":22\">{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/racism-impacts-your-health-84112|title=Racism impacts your health|last=Timothy|first=Roberta K.|work=The Conversation|access-date=2018-10-14|language=en}}</ref>  Likewise, a study held from 1997 to 2003 found that racism led to higher rates of breast cancer.<ref name=\":22\" /> While this extends beyond education, it could illustrate why many minorities and students of color would feel uneasy putting themselves into an environment that could potentially garner more racism.<ref name=\":22\" /> While illustrations of institutional racism on college campuses can be found in newspapers and blogs, there are other places to learn more about these incidents. Aside from the media, one source that can be used to keep up to date on institutional racism in higher education is ''[[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]]'' (JBHE). This journal aims to provide as much information as possible about anti-black institutional racism. JBHE publishes resources, statistics, and current reports of race-related actions on college and university campuses.<ref name=\":04\" /> For example, JBHE reported on the [[2015 University of Oklahoma Sigma Alpha Epsilon racism incident]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.jbhe.com/2015/03/video-shows-university-of-oklahoma-students-singing-racist-song/|title=Video Shows University of Oklahoma Students Singing Racist Song|date=2015-03-09|work=The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education|access-date=2017-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Other media resources where reports on racial incidents on college campuses can be found is [[Inside Higher Ed]] and [[Southern Poverty Law Center|the Southern Poverty Law Center]]\n\nIn 2016, the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] released a report on crime in schools.

Institutions of higher education were often traditionally known as Predominantly White Institutions (PWI's).<ref>Christopher Brown II, M., & Elon Dancy II, T., 2010</ref> These institutions are now challenged to improve their diversity efforts and create policies that address the root cause of negative racial climates on PWI campuses. It is estimated that by 2010, 40% of high school graduates would be non-white.<ref name=\"rankin\">{{cite journal | last1 = Rankin | first1 = S. R. | last2 = Reason | first2 = R.

Universities and colleges that have identified diversity as one of their priorities should plan how to strategically and in a sensitive manner create a campus climate in which all students, in particular students of color in a PWI, do not have to risk feeling unsafe, discriminated against, marginalized or tokenized to obtain a post-secondary degree.\n\nData has shown that students of color and White students have different perceptions of campus racial climates. In a survey of 433 undergraduate students at one institution found that, in comparison to White students, students of color felt differently about campus policies. White students were more often to describe their campus racial climate as positive, while students of African descent rated it as negative. Findings indicate that students of color experience harassment that is, \"offensive, hostile, or intimidating\" at higher rates than White students, which interferes with their learning. Further, \"students of color perceived the climate as more racist and less accepting than did White students, even though White students recognized racial harassment at similar rates as students of color\".<ref name=\"rankin\" /> In addition, many African American students have a hard time to fit in a white predominant colleges because of the fear of \"becoming white.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tyson|first1=Will|title=Social Segregation by Race at Predominantly White Universities|journal=Southern Sociological Society|date=2001|id={{ProQuest|61748890}}}}</ref>\n\nWhite students also felt more positive about their classroom experience and the way professors presented various viewpoints in the curriculum, about institutional policies as well as recruitment and retention of student of color. Students of African descent and other students of color felt the campus environment was not friendly and that they had been targets of racism. In another study of 5,000 first year students at 93 institutions, White students were more likely to agree with the statement that  \"racial discrimination is no longer a problem\" than students of color.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> White students were also more likely to feel that the campus climate is improving in comparison to students of color. White students felt the campus climate was non-racist, friendly, and respectful while students of color felt that it was racist, hostile, and disrespectful.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> Research has shown that racial diversification in colleges and universities, without intentional education about systemic racism and the history of race in the United States, can lead to creating a racial campus climate that is oppressive towards students of color.  There needs to be, \"intentional education interventions related to the changing racial composition of college students [which] would likely influence how the climate of an environment changes\".<ref name=\"rankin\" />\n\nIf institutional racism is to be addressed in institutes of higher education, different types of interventions need to be created, in particular, interventions created specifically for the academy. Rankin and Reason's research concluded that for intervention to be effective, faculty would need to be used as socializing agents on campus, in particular, because intellectual and behavioral norms on most campuses are set by faculty and, these norms have a heavy impact on campus climate.<ref name=\"rankin\" /> An example of students trying to change racial campus climate is the Being Black at the University of Michigan [[#BBUM]] moment. The Black Student Union is organizing and collaborating with organizations to bring attention to the racial climate at the [[University of Michigan]] and how it is affecting all students.<ref>Vega, T.

One example of this is required coursework through the departments of African/African-American Studies, Xicano studies, Asian-American studies, Arab American studies, and Native American studies alongside the History department. Research has shown that curricular diversity is positively associated with intergroup attitudes, decreased racial prejudice and intergroup understanding, and attitudes toward campus diversity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lopez | year = 2004 | title = Chang, 2002, Springer, Palmer, Terenzini, Pascarella, & Nora, 1996, as cited in Denson, N., & Chang, M.

Newly acquired freedom founded a growth in African American participation in politics. This period of increased African American participation, from 1867 to 1877, is known as [[Reconstruction Era|Radical Reconstruction]] or [[Black Reconstruction]].  Despite the increase in African American participation in politics, Radical Reconstruction is not mentioned as an example of how black politics strive to be. There are very distinct viewpoints concerning this time period.  \nSome believed that corruption had run rampart in the South with the introduction of newly freed slaves into legislation and a great deal of attention was given to the negativity that surrounded the introduction of black faces into government. The Reconstruction of South Carolina particularly was under scrutiny as the legislatures were predominantly black. The happenings in the South Carolina legislature were described negatively and seen as pro- black and significantly focused on issues that only pertained to blacks. Attention was solely focused on the misgivings occurring within legislature such as, \"unethical appropriation of state funds by members of the legislature\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company Inc.|location=United States of America}}</ref> and other unethical and illegal acts committed by both black and white legislatures in South Carolina.  Another set of issues brought up was the multitude of expensive decorative items and embellishments that were purchased for the refurbishment of the State House.  White legislatures were generally left out of the criticisms, despite their own contributions, and were referred to as victims of corruption due to the influence of black people.\nOthers believed that Black Reconstruction was not to blame for all corruption in legislation.  This faction of people saw the constructive debates and conversations that flowed within the southern legislations.  They were also more receptive to the positive aspects and characteristics of black legislatures that were displayed during their time in office.\nDespite the amount of eager participants, this period eventually led to a decline in black participation in politics.  The backlash of those against increase of black participation in politics effectively began to cause the number of participants to stop and then decline.  Today, despite past involvement, black participation in politics is low.  Black participation is not a common occurrence in comparison to overall participation and is often celebrated when a black candidate or politician does particularly well in their political endeavors.  This decline is attributed to a white counterattack of the Black Reconstruction movement.  Many methods were used to dissuade blacks from taking office.  One of the most prominent was violence.  An example of that would be the Ku Klux Klan, a secretive group whose members all believed in white supremacy.  The lynching, beatings, and intimidation of black people helped to hasten the decline of black participation in politics. Coercion was also another method used to dissuade black participation in politics, particularly voting.  Threats of loss jobs and refusal of medical care are some of the coercion methods employed.  Coercion did not play as big of a role as direct physical violence however it did serve to further hinder the growth of black participation in politics.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladenburg|first1=Thomas|last2=McFeely|first2=William|title=The Black Man in the Land of Equality|date=1969|publisher=Hayden Book Company, INC|location=New York|oclc=53860}}</ref>  These methods helped to forge a political system that has a scarce amount of minorities in office.\n\n==== Representation ====\nBlack representation in Congress had been scarce with less than eight Blacks in Congress per Congressional periods since the [[41st Congress|end of the Civil War]] up until the [[91st Congress|Nixon era]] when there were 11 Black representatives (ten in the House and one in the Senate).

This led to an emphasis on the acquisition of Aboriginal lands in exchange for the putative benefits of European society and their associated Christian religions. British control of Canada (the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]) began when they exercised jurisdiction over the first nations and it was by Royal Proclamation that the first piece of legislation the British government passed over First Nations citizens assumed control of their lives. It gave recognition to the Indians tribes as First Nations living under Crown protection.\n\nIt was after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|treaty of Paris In 1763]], whereby France ceded all claims in present-day Canada to Britain, that King George III of Great Britain issued this Royal Proclamation specifying how the Indigenous in the [[Monarchy of Canada|crown]] colony were to be treated. It is the most significant pieces of legislation regarding the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]'s relationship with Aboriginal people. This Royal Proclamation recognized Indian owned lands and reserved to them all use as their hunting grounds. It also established the process by which the [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]] could purchase their lands, and also laid out basic principles to guide the Crown when making treaties with the First Nations. The Proclamation made Indian lands transferred by treaty to be Crown property, and stated that indigenous title is a collective or communal rather than a private right so that individuals have no claim to lands where they lived and hunted long before the British came.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cidh.org/countryrep/Indigenous-Lands09/Chap.V-VI.htm|title=Indigenous and Tribal People's Rights Over Their Ancestral Lands and Natural Resources|author=|date=|website=cidh.org|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Indian Acts===\n\nIn 1867, the [[British North America Acts|British North America Act]] made [[Indian Reserve (1763)|land reserved for Indians]] a [[Monarchy of Canada|Crown]]  responsibility.

Despite the evident detriment to the M\u00e9tis, speculation was rampant and done in collusion with the distribution of scrip.  While this does not necessarily preclude a malicious intent by the federal government to consciously 'cheat' the M\u00e9tis, it illustrates their apathy towards the welfare of the M\u00e9tis, their long-term interests, and the recognition of their Aboriginal title.  But the point of the policy was to settle land in the North-West with agriculturalists, not keep a land reserve for the M\u00e9tis.

Indigenous people could gain the right to vote and become Canadian citizens, \"persons\" under the law, by voluntarily assimilating into European/Canadian society.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/An_Act_to_encourage_the_gradual_Civilization_of_the_Indian_Tribes_in_this_Province,_and_to_amend_the_Laws_respecting_Indians|title=An Act to encourage the gradual Civilization of the Indian Tribes in this Province, and to amend the Laws respecting Indians|via=Wikisource}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eco.canadiana.ca/view/oocihm.9_07030|title=Bill : an act to encourage the gradual civiliza... - cover - Early Canadiana Online|author=Canadiana|date=|work=canadiana.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> \nIt was hoped that indigenous peoples would renounce their native heritage and culture and embrace the 'benefits' of civilized society. Indeed, from the 1920s to the 1940s some Natives did give up their status in order to receive the right to go to school, vote or to drink. However, voluntary enfranchisement proved a failure when few natives took advantage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://signatoryindian.tripod.com/routingusedtoenslavethesovereignindigenouspeoples/id10.html|title=2. 1857 - Gradual civilization of the Indian tribes- Enfranchisement Scheme|work=signatoryindian.tripod.com|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref>\nIn 1920 a law was passed to authorize enfranchisement without consent, and many Aboriginal peoples were involuntarily enfranchised. Natives automatically lost their Indian status under this policy and also if they became professionals such as doctors or ministers, or even if they obtained university degrees, and with it, their right to reside on the reserves.\n\nThe enfranchisement requirements particularly discriminated against Native women, specifying in Section 12 (1)(b) of the Indian Act that an Indian status woman marrying a non Indian man would lose her status as an Indian, as would her children. In contrast non Indian women marrying Indian men would gain Indian status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-31|title=Bill C-31 (Historical)|date=|work=openparliament.ca|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n[[Duncan Campbell Scott]], the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, neatly expressed the sentiment of the day in 1920:\n\"Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question and no Indian Department\"\nThis aspect of enfranchisement was addressed by passage of Bill C-31 in 1985,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca/bill_c-31/|title=Bill C-31|website=indigenousfoundations.web.arts.ubc.ca}}</ref> where the discriminatory clauses of the Indian Act was removed, and Canada officially gave up the goal of enfranchising Natives.\n\n===Residential schools===\n\nWith the goal of civilizing and Christianizing Aboriginal populations, a system of 'industrial schools' was developed in the 19th century which combined academic studies with \"more practical matters\" and schools for Natives began to appear in the 1840s. From 1879 on these schools were modelled after the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School|Carlisle Indian School]] in Pennsylvania, whose motto was \"[[Kill the Indian, Save the Man|Kill the Indian in him and save the man]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waynekspear.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/residential-schools.gif|title=Image of students|author=|date=|website=wordpress.com|accessdate=27 March 2018}}</ref> It was felt that the most effective weapon for \"killing the Indian\" in them, was to remove children from their Native supports and so Native children were taken away from their homes, their parent, their families, friends and communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/canada/indian-residential-school-truth-and-reconciliation-c|title=Indian Residential School Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada|work=Cultural Survival|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\nThe 1876 Indian Act gave the federal government responsibility for Native education and by 1910 residential schools dominated the Native education policy. The government provided funding to religious groups such as the Catholic, Anglican, United Church and Presbyterian churches to undertake Native education. By 1920, attendance by natives was made compulsory and there were 74 residential schools operating nationwide. Following the ideas of [[Clifford Sifton|Sifton]] and others like him, the academic goals of these schools were \"dumbed down\". As [[Duncan Campbell Scott]] stated at the time, they didn't want students that were \"made too smart for the Indian villages\":<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danielnpaul.com/IndianResidentialSchools.html|title=Indian Residential Schools - Cultural Genocide|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\"To this end the curriculum in residential schools has been simplified and the practical instruction given is such as may be immediately of use to the pupil when he returns to the reserve after leaving school.\"\n\nThe funding the government provided was generally insufficient and often the schools ran themselves as \"self-sufficient businesses\", where 'student workers' were removed from class to do the laundry, heat the building or perform farm work. Dormitories were often poorly heated and overcrowded, and the food was less than adequately nutritious. A 1907 report, commissioned by [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|Indian Affairs]], found that in 15 prairie schools there was a death rate of 24%.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\">{{cite web|url=http://waynekspear.com/2010/03/10/indian-residential-schools-2/|title=Indian Residential Schools|work=Wayne K. Spear - Writer|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> Indeed, a deputy superintendent general of Indian Affairs at the time commented:\n\"It is quite within the mark to say that fifty percent of the children who passed through these schools did not benefit from the education which they had received therein.\"\nWhile the death rate did decline in later years, death would remain a part of the residential school tradition. The author of that report to the [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada|BNA]], [[Peter Bryce|Dr. P.H. Bryce]], was later removed and in 1922 published a pamphlet<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storyofnationalc00brycuoft#page/n5/mode/2up|title=The story of a national crime : being an appeal for justice to the Indians of Canada; the wards of the nation, our allies in the Revolutionary War, our brothers-in-arms in the Great War|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> that came close to calling the governments indifference to the conditions of the Indians in the schools 'manslaughter'.<ref name=\"waynekspear.com\"/>\n\nThe worst aspect of Canada's residential schools, and that which anthropologists [[John Steckley|Steckley]] and Cummins said \"might readily qualify as the single-worst thing that Europeans did to Natives in Canada\" was the endemic abuses;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/steckley-john/signed|title=Steckley John, Signed|date=12 July 1981|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> emotional, physical and sexual, for which they are now known. Punishments were often brutal and cruel, sometimes even life-threatening or life-ending.

Criminal and civil suits against the government and the churches began in the late 1980s and shortly thereafter the last residential school closed. By 2002 the number of lawsuits had passed 10,000. In the 1990s, beginning with the United Church, the churches that ran the residential schools began to issue formal apologies. And in 1998 the Canadian government issued the Statement of [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Reconciliation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|title=TRC|accessdate=12 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304082611/http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=3|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and committed $350 million in support of a community-based healing strategy to address the healing needs of individuals, families and communities arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. The money was used to launch the Aboriginal Healing Foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ahf.ca|title=Announcements - Aboriginal Healing Foundation|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n<!-- ===Conclusion===\n\nThe overt institutional racism of the past has clearly had a profoundly devastating and lasting effect on visible minorities and Aboriginal communities throughout Canada. European cultural norms have imposed themselves on Native populations in Canada, and Aboriginal communities continue to struggle with foreign systems of governance, of justice, of education, and of livelihood. Visible Minorities struggle with education, employment and negative contact with the legal system across Canada.\n\nPerhaps most palpable is the dysfunction and familial devastation caused by residential schools. Hutchins states;<ref name=\"tolerance.cz\"/> \"Many of those who attended residential schools have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from such symptoms as panic attacks, insomnia, and uncontrollable or unexplainable anger. Many also suffer from alcohol or drug abuse, sexual inadequacy or addiction, the inability to form intimate relationships, and eating disorders. Three generations of Native parents lost out on learning important parenting skills usually passed on from parent to child in caring and nurturing home environments, and the abuse suffered by students of residential schools has begun a distressing cycle of abuse within many Native communities.\" The lasting legacy of residential schools is but only one facet of the problem.<ref>Canada's Forced Schooling of Aboriginal Children Was 'Cultural Genocide,' Report Finds\". NY Times. 2 June 2015. Retrieved 2 June 2015</ref>\n\nThe hutchins report continues; \"Aboriginal children continue to struggle with mainstream education in Canada. For some Indian students, English remains a second language, and many lack parents with sufficient education themselves to support them. Moreover, education in Canada is premised on a written tradition, quite different from the oral tradition of Native communities. For others, it is simply that they are ostracised for their 'otherness'; their manners, their attitudes, their speech or a hundred other things which mark them out as different. \nAboriginal populations continue to suffer from poor health. They have seven years less life expectancy than the overall Canadian population and almost twice as many infant deaths. While Canada as a nation routinely ranks in the top three on the United Nations Human Development Index,<ref>http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/reports/270/hdr_2010_en_complete_reprint.pdf</ref> its on-reserve Aboriginal population, if scored as a nation, would rank a distant and shocking sixty-third.\"\n\nAs [[Phil Fontaine]] National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, points out, racism in Canada today is for the most part, a covert operation. Its central and most distinguishing characteristic is the vigour with which it is consistently denied. There are many who argue that Canada's endeavours in the field of human rights and its stance against racism have only resulted in a \"more politically correct population who have learnt to better conceal their prejudices\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/b9p1qzffl466/privilege/|title=Privilege|work=prezi.com|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> In effect, the argument is that racism in Canada is not being eliminated, but rather is becoming more covert, more rational and perhaps more deeply imbedded in our institutions. \nThat racism is alive is evidenced by the recent referendum in British Columbia by which the provincial government is asking the white majority to decide on a mandate for negotiating treaties with the Indian minority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/2002/33.html|title=Kajlich, Helena --- \"The British Columbia Treaty Referendum: An Appropriate Democratic Exercise?\" [2002] IndigLawB 33; (2002) 5(17) Indigenous Law Bulletin 11|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The results of the referendum will be binding,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtleisland.org/news/news-bctreaty-referendum1.htm|title=British Columbia Treaty referendum|publisher=|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> the government having legislatively committed itself to act on these principles if more than 50% of those voting reply in the same way.

This policy was enforced with the support of various Christian churches, who ran many of the schools. Over the course of the system's existence, approximately 30% of native children, roughly some 150,000, were placed in residential schools nationally, with the last school closing in 1996. There has long been controversy about the conditions experienced by students in the residential schools. While day schools for First Nations, Metis, and Inuit children always far outnumbered residential schools, a new consensus emerged in the early 21st century that the latter schools did significant harm to Aboriginal children who attended them by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, undergoing forced sterilization for some students, and by exposing many of them to physical leading to sexual abuse by staff members, and other students, and dis-enfranchising them forcibly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harper |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Harper |title=Statement of apology to former students of Indian Residential Schools |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |website=Indian and Northern Affairs Canada |accessdate=May 7, 2017 |language=en |date=June 11, 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516080220/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100015644/1100100015649 |archivedate=May 16, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nStarting in the 1990s, the government started a number of initiatives to address the effects of the Indian residential school. In March 1998, the government made a Statement of Reconciliation and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. In the fall of 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution process was launched, which was a process outside of court providing compensation and psychological support for former students of residential schools who were physically or sexually abused or were in situations of wrongful confinement. On June 11, 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet and in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates. A [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] ran from 2008 through to 2015 in order to document past wrongdoing in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past.<ref>{{cite web|title=14.12 Elimination of Racial and Ethnic Stereotyping, Identification of Groups|url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-srch?lang=eng&srchtxt=indigenous&cur=2&nmbr=2&lettr=14&info0=14.12#zz14|website=Translation Bureau|publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada|accessdate=April 30, 2017|language=en|year=2017}}</ref>\n\n==Algeria==\n{{main|Pacification of Algeria}}\n\nFrench political thinker [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] (1805\u201359) supported colonization in general, and in particular the colonization of Algeria. In several speeches on France's foreign affairs, and in two official reports presented to the National Assembly in March 1847 on behalf of an ad hoc commission, he also repeatedly commented on and analysed the issue in his voluminous correspondence. In short, De Tocqueville developed a theoretical basis for French expansion in North Africa.<ref>See De la colonie en Alg\u00e9rie, Complexe, Brussels, 1988, and Nous et les Autres, Seuil, Paris, 1989, \"Tocqueville\", pp 219-234.</ref> He even studied the Koran, sharply concluding that the religion of Muhammad was \"the main cause of the decadence ... of the Muslim world\". His opinions are also instructive about the early years of the French conquest and how the colonial state was first set up and organized. De Tocqueville emerged as an early advocate of \"total domination\" in Algeria and subsequent \"devastation of the country\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, pp 699 and 706.</ref>  On 31 January 1830 when Charles X captured Algiers the French state thus began what became the institutional racism directed at the Kabyle, or Berbers, of Arab descent in north Africa. The [[Dey of Algiers]] had insulted the monarchy by slapping the French ambassador with a fly whisk and the French used this pretext to invade, and also put an end to [[piracy]] in the vicinity. The unofficial objective was to restore the prestige of the French crown and gain a foothold in North Africa, thereby preventing the British gaining advantage over France in the Mediterranean. The [[July Monarchy]], which came to power in 1831, inherited this burden. The next 9 years saw the indigenous population subjected to the [[Abdelkader El Djezairi|might]] of the French army. By 1840 more conservative elements gained control of the government and they dispatched General Thomas Bugeaud, the newly appointed governor of the colony, to [[French Algeria|Algeria]], marking the real start of the country's conquest. The methods employed were atrocious. The army deported villagers en masse; massacred the men and raped women; took the children hostage, stole livestock and harvests and destroyed orchards. De Tocqueville wrote, \"I believe the laws of war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks.\"<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie in Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes, Paris, Gallimard, Biblioth\u00e8que de la Pl\u00e9iade, 1991, pp 704 and 705.</ref> He added: \"In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept.\"<ref>In a work that seeks to defend the army's excesses, Pierre Montagnon wrote of the victims: \"500,000? A million? The truth must lie somewhere between these figures. Anything less would be to play down a terrible reality,\" La conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie, Paris, Pygmalion, 1986, p 414. If we compare these figures with historian Denise Bouche's estimate of the total population in 1830 at \"about three million people\", the scale of the massacres becomes clearer; see her Histoire de la colonisation fran\u00e7aise, volume 2, Paris, Fayard, 1998, p 23.</ref> He also advocated that \"all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria\".<ref>Olivier LeCour Grandmaison (2001). \"Tocqueville et la conqu\u00eate de l'Alg\u00e9rie\" (in French). La Mazarine.</ref> [[Marshal Bugeaud]], who was the first governor-general as he was also heading the civil gov't, was rewarded by the King for the conquest, having instituted the [[French conquest of Algeria|systemic]] use of torture and following a \"[[scorched earth]]\" policy against the Arab population.\n\n===Land grab===\n\nOnce the conquest of Algiers was accomplished soldier-politician [[Bertrand Clauzel]] and others formed a company to acquire agricultural land and, despite official discouragement, to subsidize its settlement by European farmers, which triggered a [[land rush]]. He became governor general in 1835 and used his office to make private investments in land, encouraging bureaucrats and army officers in his administration to do the same. This development created a vested interest among government officials in greater French involvement in Algeria. Merchants with influence in the government also saw profit in land speculation which resulted in expanding the French occupation. Large agricultural tracts were carved out, factories and businesses began exploiting cheap local labor and also to benefit from laws and edicts that gave control to the French. The policy of limited occupation was formally abandoned in 1840 for one of complete control. By 1843, De Tocqueville intended to protect and extend expropriation by the [[rule of law]]. He therefore advocated setting up special courts, based on what he called \"summary\" procedure, to carry out massive expropriation for the benefit of French and other European settlers who would thus be able to purchase land at an attractive price and live in villages that the colonial government had equipped with fortifications, churches, schools and even fountains. His belief, which framed his writings and influenced state actions, was that the local people, who had been driven out by the army and robbed of their land by the judges, would gradually die out.\n\nThe French colonial state, as he conceived it and as it took shape in Algeria, was a two-tiered organization, quite unlike the regime in mainland France. It introduced two different political and legal systems which, in the last analysis, were based on racial, cultural and religious distinctions. According to De Tocqueville, the system that should apply to the colonizers would enable them alone to hold property and travel freely, but would deprive them of any form of political freedom, which should be suspended in Algeria. \"There should therefore be two quite distinct legislations in Africa, for there are two very separate communities. There is absolutely nothing to prevent us treating Europeans as if they were on their own, as the rules established for them will only ever apply to them\".<ref>Alexis de Tocqueville, Travail sur l'Alg\u00e9rie, op cit, p 752.</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeats of the Muslim army in the 1840s colonization continued apace. By 1848, Algeria was populated by 109,400 Europeans, only 42,274 of which were French.<ref>Sessions, Jennifer (2011). By Sword and Plow: France and the Conquest of Algeria.

The [[Colonialism|colonials]] imposed more and higher taxes on [[Muslims]] than on [[Europeans]].<ref>Alistair Horne, page 63 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> The Muslims, in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the French conquest, also paid new taxes, from which the colons were normally exempted. In 1909, for instance, [[Muslims]], who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria's income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. And colons controlled how these revenues would be spent. As a result, colon towns had handsome municipal buildings, paved streets lined with trees, fountains and statues, while Algerian villages and rural areas benefited little if at all from tax revenues.\n\n===In education===\n\nThe colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for Algerian Muslims, who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading, writing, and engage in religious studies. Not only did the state appropriate the habus lands (the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions, including schools) in 1843, but colon officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population. In 1892, more than five times as much was spent for the education of Europeans as for Muslims, who had five times as many children of school age. Because few Muslim teachers were trained, Muslim schools were largely staffed by French teachers. Even a state-operated [[madrasa]]h often had French faculty members. Attempts to institute [[bilingual]], [[bicultural]] schools, intended to bring Muslim and European children together in the classroom, were a conspicuous failure, rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870. According to one estimate, fewer than 5% of Algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870. As late as 1954 only one Muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen was receiving formal schooling.<ref>Alistair Horne, pages 60-61 \"A Savage War of Peace\", {{ISBN|0-670-61964-7}}</ref> Efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of Muslims along with European students in the French school system as part of France's \"civilizing mission\" in Algeria. The curriculum was entirely French and allowed no place for Arabic studies, which were deliberately downgraded even in Muslim schools. Within a generation, a class of well-educated, gallicized Muslims \u2013 the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|\u00e9volu\u00e9s]] (literally, the evolved ones) \u2013 had been created.\n\n===Enfranchisement===\nFollowing its conquest of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] controlled Algeria in 1830, for well over a century France maintained [[colonial rule]] in the territory which has been described as \"quasi-apartheid\".<ref>\"Algeria was in fact a colony but constitutionally was a part of France and not thought of in the 1950s as a colony.

Institutional racism had its early roots here due to interactions between these islanders who had Melanesian origins and depended on the sea for sustenance whose land rights were abrogated; and later the Australian Aboriginal peoples whose children were removed from their families by Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stolengenerations123.wikispaces.com/Emergence+of+the+child+removal+policy|title=stolengenerations123 - Emergence of the child removal policy|accessdate=12 July 2015}}</ref> The removals occurred in the period between approximately 1909 and 1969.

In the remote communities, the report cited 71% of the population in these remote discrete indigenous communities lacked access to public transportation and 78% of the communities were more than 50 miles from the nearest hospital. Although English is the official language of Australia, many indigenous Australians do not speak it as a primary language and the lack of printed materials that are translated into the Aboriginal languages and the non-availability of translators form a barrier to adequate health care for the Aborigines.

[[William Macpherson (judge)|Sir William Macpherson]] used the term as a description of \"the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture or ethnic origin\", which \"can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people\".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/lawrence/Story/0,,941167,00.html \"Metropolitan police still institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 22 April 2003</ref> Sir William's definition is almost identical to Stokely Carmichael's original definition some forty years earlier. Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton 1967 were black power activists and first used the term 'institutional racism' to describe the consequences of a societal structure that was stratified into a racial hierarchy that resulted in layers of discrimination and inequality for minority ethnic people in housing, income, employment, education and health (Garner 2004:22).<ref name=\"Blagg2008\">{{cite book|last=Blagg|first=Harry|title=Crime, Aboriginality and the Decolonisation of Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ojyQTjn8FFgC&pg=PA9|date=1 January 2008|publisher=Hawkins Press|isbn=978-1-876067-19-9|page=9}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Stephen Lawrence#The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report|Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report]], and the public's response to it, were among the major factors that forced the [[Metropolitan Police]] to address its treatment of ethnic minorities. More recently, the former [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Ian Blair|Sir Ian Blair]] said that the British news media are institutionally racist,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/4651368.stm \"Met chief accuses media of racism\"], [[BBC]], 26 January 2006</ref> a comment that offended journalists, provoking angry responses from the media, despite the [[National Black Police Association (UK)|National Black Police Association]] welcoming Blair's assessment.<ref>[http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,14173,1696070,00.html?gusrc=rss \"Met chief labels media institutionally racist\"], [[The Guardian]], 27 January 2006</ref>\n\nThe report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Holdaway | first1 = Simon | last2 = O'Neill | first2 = Megan | year = 2006 | title = Institutional Racism after Macpherson: An Analysis of Police Views | url = | journal = Policing and Society | volume = 16 | issue = 4| pages = 349\u2013369 | doi = 10.1080/10439460600967885 }}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, the [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Metropolitan Police Commissioner]], [[Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe]], said there was some justification in claims that the Metropolitan Police Service is institutionally racist.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-33025853|title=Met acknowledges 'some justification' to claims the force is 'racist'|publisher=BBC News |date=5 June 2015|accessdate=22 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Criminal conviction===\nWhile problems with the treatment of minorities in criminal investigations were found institutional, another aspect of criminal conviction crossed the line, affecting both white and black convicts. For 7 years, the courts in the U.K. handed down sentences for minor crimes that resulted in virtual life in prison. By 2012, the use of [[Imprisonment for public protection|IPP]] sentence guidelines were curtailed, however, three years after the sentences were abolished, more than three fourths of the 4,612 IPP prisoners still jailed in the system have passed the minimum sentence term set by the court. 200 more have been in prison for nearly a decade \u2013 despite being given a minimum sentence of less than two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-vice-news-investigates-the-uks-4500-prisoners-doing-life-for-minor-crimes|title=Exclusive: VICE News Investigates the UK's 4,500 Prisoners Doing Life for Minor Crimes|date=|work=VICE News|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> These guidelines were introduced to keep criminals behind bars until they were no longer deemed a risk to the public, but where their crimes did not warrant a fixed life sentence. Although they were designed for the most dangerous offenders, IPP sentences were given out for relatively minor crimes including affray (fighting in public), minor criminal damage worth less than 20 pounds, and shoplifting. They were ended in 2012 after the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that all prisoners had the right to know how long they were being held for. UK courts stopped handing out the sentences, but the ban did nothing to impact those already serving an IPP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/free-the-remaining-ipp-prisoners?source=twitter-share-button|title=Free the remaining Ipp prisoners.|date=|work=Campaigns by You|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn a kafkaesque turn, many cannot be released as they cannot complete the courses required as a condition of release due to them not being offered, and paperwork to conclude parole hearings is not prepared before the hearings, only after the hearing is concluded due to lack of paperwork.

Those marked as black were further discriminated against differentially, with Africans facing more extreme forms of exclusion and exploitation than those marked as coloured or Indian. One such example of institutional racism in South Africa is [[Natives Land Act, 1913]], which reserved 90% of land for white use and the Native Urban Areas Act of 1923 controlled access to urban areas, which suited commercial farmers who were keen to hold labour on their land. Africans, who formed the majority of the population, were relegated to barren\nrural reserves, which later became homelands.<ref>Bozalek, Vivienne. \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vivienne_Bozalek/publication/258185153_The_Effect_of_Institutional_Racism_on_Student_Family_Circumstances_A_Human_Capabilities_Perspective/links/545bacb90cf249070a7a7a7e.pdf The Effect of Institutional Racism on Student Family Circumstances: A Human Capabilities Perspective].\" South African Journal of Psychology 40.4 (2010): 487-494.
