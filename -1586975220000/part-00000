It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on January 13, 2008. The episode follows [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] as he saves the life of the owner of a [[fast-food restaurant]] and the owner gives him a lifetime supply of free burgers. After eating 30 burgers in a row Peter suffers a massive [[stroke]] and tries to take revenge on the restaurant.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]] and it was directed by [[Brian Iles]]. This is one of the episodes that did not have show creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s work in post-production because he was participating in the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007\u2013present)|Writers Guild of America strike]]. The episode guest starred [[Max Burkholder]], Denis Martel and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]]. Recurring voice actors [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Ralph Garman]], [[Mark Hentemann]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[Alec Sulkin]], [[Lisa Wilhoit]] and [[John Viener]] also made appearances. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] starts collecting [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]]'s mail (he calls it \"black guy mail\") while the latter is out of town. After looking through one of Cleveland's magazines devoted to mustaches, Peter decides to grow one. It quickly becomes his most prized possession, and he pretends that it gives him special abilities; for instance, convinced he can now speak Italian, he angers an Italian butcher with his mock Italian gibberish.\n\nPeter and Brian walk past McBurgertown and it's on fire. Firefighters notice Peter's mustache and give him a fire hose. Peter is reluctant to risk injury rescuing a man trapped in the building, but rationalizes \"With great mustache comes great responsibility.\" He rescues the manager from the fire, but is devastated that his mustache has been burned off. The manager later visits the Griffins to thank Peter with a lifetime supply of burgers. At the grand re-opening, Peter drowns his sense of loss with 30 burgers, causing a [[stroke]] that paralyzes the left half of his body.\n\nUnhappy about the pace of his recovery, Peter walks into a [[stem cell research]] center; he is cured of his stroke in only five minutes. Peter then tries to sue McBurgertown for causing his stroke. [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] points out that it was Peter's own fault for overindulging. Peter loses the trial because the company has more lawyers, he offered the judge a cheap bribe, and because he has no evidence that McBurgertown was at fault.\n\nStill wanting revenge, Peter drags Brian to the corporate headquarters. Peter claims that he and Brian are wealthy [[Asia]]n businessmen and asks for a tour. The company grants his request. Looking for evidence of wrongdoing that he can use, Peter asks about a room labeled \"restricted\". The tour guide says that room is off-limits, then excuses himself for a 30-minute bathroom break. Peter breaks his word that he would not go in the room, and finds that it is a slaughterhouse. Peter and Brian befriend a talking genetically-engineered cow who describes the horrors the company has inflicted. Brian offers a deal to set the cow free in exchange for the cow's help exposing McBurgertown. Realizing that Peter and Brian broke their promise, the tour guide sends two security men after them.\n\nFleeing the building in a madcap chase set to [[The Monkees]]' \"[[Pleasant Valley Sunday]]\", the cow reveals McBurgertown's practices and the bad health effects of its food to the media. The company suffers a blow from which it might not recover. The cow thanks Peter for helping.\n\nIn the [[B story]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] and Brian wager that Stewie can disguise himself as a [[high school|high-schooler]] and become the most popular kid in less than a week. Using the name \"Zac Sawyer\", Stewie easily wins over Connie D'Amico and her clique, winning the bet. Connie and \"Zac\" drive to Anal Point to have sex, but Connie laughs at the size of his [[penis]] and drives off. The next day at school, Stewie is ostracized by everyone for his \"baby penis\". Stewie concedes defeat and asks Connie for one last kiss. When Connie's eyes are closed, Stewie takes off his clothes and kisses her. He proclaims her to be a [[pedophile]] and she is arrested immediately by school security.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Seth MacFarlane by Gage Skidmore 5.jpg|right|140px|thumb|alt=A man with black short hair and a black shirt, with tan skin, laughs into a microphone while leaning forward.|[[Seth MacFarlane]] did not participate in the post-production of the episode.]]\n\nThe episode was written by [[Wellesley Wild]], who has been with the show since its [[Family Guy (season 4)|fourth season]].<ref name=ya/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew;_ylt=ApqUwltmQ..ERF8wJh8qBou9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Petarded|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109002623/https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/petarded/episode/17739/castcrew |archivedate=2007-01-09}}</ref> It was directed by [[Brian Iles]], who would direct the episode \"[[Back to the Woods (Family Guy)|Back to the Woods]]\" later this season.<ref name=ya>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/mcstroke/episode/157506;_ylt=Aj0yzAdZjYuZ6igH69L.9xG9v9EF|title=Family Guy: McStroke|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://tv.yahoo.com/family-guy/show/back-to-the-woods/episode/161341/castcrew;_ylt=AtX213WuR0YvUFb3PmFlJmS9v9EF|title=Family Guy: Back to the Woods|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and James Purdun acted as supervising directors for the episode.<ref name=ya/>\n\nThis is one of the episodes of ''Family Guy'' that was released after the show's creator, [[Seth MacFarlane]], joined the [[Writers Guild of America strike (2007\u2013present)|Writers Guild of America strike]].<ref name= tvs/> MacFarlane participated in the writing process and did record the voices of the characters he normally plays for the episode, but he did not approve or participate in any post-production done to the episode.<ref name= tvs/>\n\nIn addition to the regular cast, actors [[Camille Guaty]], Denis Martel, [[Ted McGinley]] and [[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n]] guest starred in the episode (Montalb\u00e1n would one year later guest star in the episode \"[[Moon Over Isla Island]]\" on MacFarlane's other show, ''[[American Dad]]'').<ref name=ya/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/family-guy-2008/episode-9-season-6/mcstroke/100148|title=Family Guy Episode: \"McStroke\"|magazine=TV Guide|accessdate=September 29, 2012}}</ref> Recurring voice actors [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Ralph Garman]], writer [[Mark Hentemann]], writer [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], writer [[Alec Sulkin]], [[Lisa Wilhoit]] and writer [[John Viener]] made minor appearances in the episode.<ref name=ya/>\n\n==Cultural references==\nThe episode featured various references to the popular culture.

The Nevada local also reached the highest membership level in a right to work state in the history of the SEIU (more than 70% union wide), leading to unprecedented success in Nevada including achieving fully employer-paid family healthcare, preventing the rollback of public pensions, stopping and in some cases reversing two-tier collective bargaining agreements, and using an approach to contract negotiations that gives every worker the right to sit in on their workplace negotiations.<ref>{{cite news|last=Coolican|first=Patrick|title=New face of labor has heart, drive|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2006/dec/10/new-face-of-labor-has-heart-drive/|date=December 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her career at SEIU, McAlevey completed a doctorate in [[sociology]] at the Graduate Center, CUNY under the supervision of [[Frances Fox Piven]].<ref name=\"diss\">{{cite thesis |last=McAlevey |first=Jane F. |date=2015 |title=No Shortcuts: A Case for Organizing |type=PhD |page=iii |publisher=Graduate Center, CUNY |docket= |oclc= 949906889 |id={{ProQuest|1689441854}} }}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*''Raising Expectations and Raising Hell, My Decade Fighting for the Labor Movement'', {{ISBN|9781781683156}}, published by Verso in 2012.\n*''[[No Shortcuts|No Shortcuts: Organizing for Power in the New Gilded Age]]'', {{ISBN|9780190624712}}, published by [[Oxford University Press]] in 2016.\n*''[[A Collective Bargain: Unions, Organizing, and the Fight for Democracy]]'', {{ISBN|9780062908599}}, published by [[Ecco Press]] in 2020.<ref name=\"ClimateJobs2020\">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Alleen |title=The Climate Movement Doesn\u2019t Know How to Talk With Union Members About Green Jobs |url=https://theintercept.com/2020/03/09/climate-labor-movements-unions-green-new-deal/ |accessdate=12 March 2020 |work=The Intercept |date=9 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://janemcalevey.com/ (Official Website)]\n* [https://www.thenation.com/authors/jane-mcalevey-0 Jane McAlevey's Page on ''The Nation'']\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McAlevey, Jane}}\n[[Category:American trade unionists]]\n[[Category:1964 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:University at Buffalo alumni]]\n[[Category:Graduate Center, CUNY alumni]]\n", "name_user": "DrJuana", "label": "safe", "comment": "added latest appearance on a featured podcast", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_McAlevey"}
