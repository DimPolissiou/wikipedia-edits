Aside from disco, [[funk]], [[smooth jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], and [[soul music|soul]] remained popular throughout the decade. It is this influx of popular music that soon transformed int [[rock and roll]] during the Early 1970s. [[Rock music]] played an important part in the Western musical scene, with [[punk rock]] thriving throughout the mid to late 1970s.\n\n<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/american-punk-rock-t555</ref> Other subgenres of rock, particularly [[glam rock]], [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock|progressive]], [[art rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] achieved various amounts of success. Other genres such as [[reggae]] were innovative throughout the decade and grew a significant following.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/contemporary-reggae-d7729</ref> [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]] emerged during this decade,<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/explore/metastyle/hip-hop-urban-d4483</ref> but was slow to start and did not become significant until the late 1980s. [[classical music|Classical]] began losing a little momentum; however, through invention and theoretical development, this particular genre gave rise to [[Experimental music|experimental classical]] and [[minimalist music]] by classical composers. A subgenre of classical, [[film score]]s, remained popular with movie-goers. Alongside the popularity of [[experimental music]], the decade was notable for its contributions to [[electronic music]], which rose in popularity with the continued development of [[synthesizer]]s and [[harmonizer]]s; more composers embraced this particular genre, gaining the notice of listeners who were looking for something new and different. Its rising popularity, mixed with the popular music of the period, led to the creation of [[synthpop]]. [[Pop music|Pop]] also had a popularity role in the 1970s.\n\nIn [[Asia]], music continued to follow varying trends. In [[Japan]], the decade saw several musical phases, including the highly popular [[frat music|folk]]-influenced ''[[f\u014dku]]'', as well as greater experimentation with [[electronic music]], ranging from developments in [[synthpop]], [[electro (music)|electro]], and [[Electronic Dance Music]], created through different Japanese artists and bands such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].<ref>http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/</ref>\n\nIn [[Latin America]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] movement peaked in popularity and was adopted as the music of the [[hippie]], [[Liberation Theology]], and [[New Left]] movements. [[Cumbia]] music began its internationalization as regional scenes rose outside Colombia. [[Merengue music|Merengue]] experienced mainstream exposure across [[Latin America]] and the southern US border states.\n\nIn [[Africa]], especially [[Nigeria]], the genre known as [[Afrobeat]] gained a following throughout the 1970s.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/afro-beat-d338</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn an essay published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|\"The decade is of course an arbitrary schema itself\u2014time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts\u2014money, say\u2014the category does take on a reality of its own once people figure out how to put it to work. 'The '60s are over,' a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an [[elitist]] withdrawal from the messy concert and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in [[FM radio]] and [[album era|album rock]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php|title=CG 70s: The Decade|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1980|website=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=April 6, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Christgau, the decade also saw greater fragmentation along stylistic lines because of the rise of [[semipopular music]]: \"It goes back to whenever arty types began to find 'the best' rock worthy of attention in the '60s, but in the '60s tolerance was the rule; it was easier to name rough substyles\u2014say [[British invasion]], [[folk-rock]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], and [[soul music|soul]]\u2014than to analyze their separate audiences (even racial distinctions were fuzzy). Not until 1968 or 1969, when it became a hippie commonplace to dismiss soul as 'commercial' and when [[bubblegum music|bubblegum]] and 'white blues' developed into clear categories, did the breakdown really begin.

During the first half of the decade, British acts such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], [[Black Sabbath]] were at the height of their international fame, particularly in the United States. By the second half of the decade, many other acts had also achieved stardom, namely, [[Alice Cooper]], [[AC/DC]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Van Halen]] and [[Ted Nugent]].\n\n[[Arena rock]] grew in popularity through rock acts such as [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and [[The Who]].\n\n[[Psychedelic rock]] declined in popularity after the deaths of [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]], the self-imposed seclusion of [[Syd Barrett]] from Pink Floyd, and the break-up of [[The Beatles]] in 1970.\n\n=== Country rock and Southern rock ===\n\n[[File:Eagles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]]]\n[[Country rock]], formed from the fusion of [[rock music]] with [[country music]], gained its greatest commercial success in the 1970s, beginning with non-country artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Gram Parsons]], and [[The Byrds]]. By the mid-1970s, [[Linda Ronstadt]], along with other newer artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[The Eagles]], were enjoying mainstream success and popularity that continues to this day. The Eagles themselves emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' (1976).<ref name=Tawa2005>N.

Some of the Canadian new wave groups included [[Rough Trade (band)|Rough Trade]], [[The Payolas]] and [[Martha and the Muffins]]. After the success of British [[synthpop]] acts in the U.S. such as [[Gary Numan]] and [[the Buggles]], a number of American bands also began experimenting with [[synthesizer]]s. In the early 1980s, bands from the United Kingdom became immensely popular in the U.S., and this phenomenon became known as the [[Second British Invasion]] which mainly consisted of British new wave and synthpop acts, therefore broadening the definition of \"new wave\".\n\n===Punk rock===\n\n[[File:Johnny Ramone.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Ramones]]'s lead guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] performing in Toronto, 1977]]\nThe mid-1970s saw the rise of [[punk music]] from its [[protopunk]]-[[garage band]] roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Ramones]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] were some of the earliest American punk rock acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain [[punk fashion]] and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. Blondie quickly lost their punk roots going on to become a pop/ska/reggae band.\n\n===Blues rock===\n\nBlues rock remains popular, with [[Eric Clapton]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[George Thorogood]] seeing the greatest success. [[Freddie King]] started moving from straight blues to blues rock since the genre was now mostly popular among white audiences. Stress from nonstop touring resulted in his death at the age of 42 in 1976.\n\n===Soft rock and pop===\n\nSome of the more notable pop/[[soft rock]] groups during the 1970s were the [[Carpenters (band)|Carpenters]], the [[Jackson 5]], [[Seals & Crofts]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[Captain & Tennille]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], [[Bay City Rollers]], and [[The Osmonds]].\n\nSoloists who characterized the pop music of the era included [[Barry Manilow]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[James Taylor]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Barry White]], and [[Rod Stewart]].  Female soloists who epitomized the 1970s included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Helen Reddy]].\n\nSome of the most popular music acts of the day got their own network television variety shows, which were very popular in the 70s. Acts like [[Sonny & Cher]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[John Denver]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], husband and wife team [[Captain & Tennille]], brother and sister [[Donny & Marie Osmond]].\n\n[[File:Billy Joel - Perth 7 November 2006.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Billy Joel]] performing in Perth Western Australia in 2006]]\n[[Soft rock]] was prominently featured on many [[Top 40]] and [[contemporary hit radio]] stations throughout the 1970s. Soft rock often used [[acoustic instrument]]s and placed emphasis on [[melody]] and [[harmonies]]. Major soft rock artists of the 1970s included [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[America (band)|America]], the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]], whose ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]'' (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade.<ref>P.

[[Bob Dylan]]'s 1975\u20131976 [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] reunited him with a number of folk-rock acts from his early days of performing, most notably [[Joan Baez]], who returned to the charts in 1975 with \"[[Diamonds & Rust]]\".\n\nSome of the most successful singers and songwriters were: [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Jim Croce]], [[John Denver]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Barry Gibb]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Carole King]], [[Elton John]], [[Don McLean]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], and [[Harry Chapin]]\u2014 some had previously been primarily songwriters but began releasing albums and songs of their own. King's album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'' became one of the top-selling albums of the decade, and the song \"[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]\" became one of the 1970s biggest songs. McLean's 1971 song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]],\" inspired by [[The Day the Music Died|the death of Buddy Holly]], became one of popular music's [[Songs of the Century|most-recognized songs of the 20th century]], thanks to its abstract and vivid storytelling, which center around \"The Day the Music Died\" and popular music of the rock era.\n\nThe early 1970s marked the departure of [[Diana Ross]] from [[The Supremes]] and the break-up of [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[The Beatles]]. All continued hugely successful recording careers throughout the decade. Some of their songs are that among the hits of the early 1970s: Simon & Garfunkel's \"[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]\", Simon's solo hit \"[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]\", The Beatles  \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", Paul McCartney's \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\", George Harrison's \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and Ross' \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\" .<ref name=\"Cue sheet\">\"Top Fifty Hits of the 1970s\", [[American Top 40]], Watermark Inc.

Primarily an African-American genre, it was characterized by the heavy use of bass and \"wah-wah\" pedals. Rhythm was emphasized over melody. Artists such as [[James Brown]], [[The Meters]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] pioneered the genre. It then spawned artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]], [[The Brothers Johnson]], [[Kool & The Gang]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]], [[King Floyd]], [[Tower of Power]], [[Ohio Players]], [[The Commodores]], [[War (U.S. band)|War]], [[Confunkshun]], [[Gap Band]], [[Slave (band)|Slave]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], the [[Bar-Kays]], [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], and many more. Other popular artists with the mainstream were [[Bill Withers]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[The Stylistics]], [[The Fifth Dimension]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Temptations]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Barry White]] and [[Issac Hayes]].\n\nThe 1970s saw African-American audiences shift away from genres like rock and blues which had originally been invented and dominated by black musicians. While blues performers like [[B.B. King]] and [[Albert King]] remained successful, they changed to a mostly white audience. Soul, R&B, and funk became the predominate music styles among black artists and audiences.\n\n[[Roberta Flack]] had two of the biggest hits of the decade with \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\", from the Clint Eastwood movie ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''; and \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song|Killing Me Softly]]\". Both were # 1 hits on the pop charts and she became the first artist and the only female artist to win back to back [[Grammy Award]]s for Record of the Year.<ref>http://thedropfm/roberta-flack-wins-record-of-the-year-grammy-two-years-in-a-row-black-history-month/{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref> [[Stevie Wonder]] who topped the charts five times during the decade with songs such as \"[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]\" and \"[[Sir Duke]]\" had a unique treble.

The band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, both had some solo success in the early part of the decade. Jermaine with top 10 hit \"[[Daddy's Home (song)|Daddy's Home]]\"<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/song/daddys-home-mt0008476579.</ref> and Michael topped the charts with \"[[Ben (song)|Ben]]\" theme song to the movie.

As well as [[The Staple Singers]] with \"[[I'll Take You There]]\" and \"[[Let's Do It Again (song)|Let's Do It Again]]\" theme song to a 1975 [[Sidney Poitier]]/[[Bill Cosby]] movie. [[The Sylvers]] with \"[[Boogie Fever]]\" and [[The Emotions]] with \"[[Best of My Love (The Emotions song)|Best of My Love]]\".\n\nThe Emotions were a girl group which were still popular in soul music, [[Honey Cone]] had a chart topping hit with \"[[Want Ads]]\", as did [[Labelle]] with \"[[Lady Marmalade]]\" and [[A Taste of Honey (band)|A Taste of Honey]] with \"[[Boogie Oogie Oogie]]\". Other examples of the girl group were [[Love Unlimited]] and [[The Three Degrees]] who scored a number two pop hit with \"[[When Will I See You Again]]\" but topped the chart when they teamed with Mother, Sister, Father, Brother (MSFB) on the Sound of Philadelphia (TSOP).<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/great-r-b-female-groups-in-the-70smw0000039791.</ref>\n\nThe Commodores were another group that played from a diverse repertoire, including R&B, funk, and pop. [[Lionel Richie]], who went on to even greater success as a solo artist in the 1980s, fronted the group's biggest 1970s hits, including \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\", \"[[Three Times a Lady]]\", and \"[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]\".\n\n===Country===\n[[File:Willie Nelson Promotional Photo - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Willie Nelson]] became one of the most popular country music artists during the 1970s.]]\nA number of styles defined country music during the 1970s decade. At the beginning of the decade, the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]] \u2014 an offshoot of the earlier \"Nashville Sound\" of the late 1950s and early 1960s \u2014 and the honky-tonk fused [[Bakersfield Sound]] were some of the more popular styles.\n\nThe countrypolitan sound \u2014 a polished, streamlined sound featuring string sections, background vocals and crooning lead vocalists \u2014 was popularized by artists including [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Dottie West]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and others, achieving their successes through such songs as \"[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden]]\", \"[[Snowbird (song)|Snowbird]]\", and others. The Bakersfield sound, first popularized in the early 1960s, continued its peak in popularity through artists such as [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]].\n\nBut other styles began to emerge during the 1970s. One of the more successful styles was \"[[outlaw country]]\", a type of music blending the traditional and honky tonk sounds of country music with [[rock music|rock]] and [[blues|blues music]], and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period. The leaders of the movement were [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]], although others associated with the movement were [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Jessi Colter]], [[Tompall Glaser]], [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] and [[Billy Joe Shaver]]. The efforts of Jennings, Nelson, Colter and Glaser were encapsulated in the 1976 album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''.\n\nAlthough country gospel was never really the in thing in music. The 1970s saw the rise of \"the most awarded act in the history of country music.\"  That group being [[The Statler Brothers]], who literally dominated country music the entire decade.\n\nThe [[country pop]] sound was a successor to the countrypolitan sound of the early 1970s. In addition to artists such as Murray and Campbell, several artists who were not initially marketed as country were enjoying crossover success with country audiences through radio airplay and sales. The most successful of these artists included [[The Bellamy Brothers]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[B. J. Thomas]] and [[Kenny Rogers]]. Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, was named Female Vocalist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]] in 1974, sparking a debate that continues to this day \u2014 what is country music? A group of traditional-minded artists, troubled by this trend, formed the short-lived [[Association of Country Entertainers]], in an attempt to bring back traditional honky-tonk sounds to the forefront, setting the stage for the [[neotraditional country]] revival that would become particularly prominent in the early 1980s. The debate continued into 1975, a year where six songs reached No. 1 on both the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts. Things came to a head when, at that year's CMA Awards, Rich \u2014 the reigning Entertainer of the Year, and himself a crossover artist \u2014 presented the award to his successor, \"my good friend, Mr. John Denver.\" His statement, taken as sarcasm, and his setting fire to the envelope (containing Denver's name) with a cigarette lighter were taken as a protest against the increasing pop style in country music (this despite Rich himself having made his name with songs that crossed over from country into the pop and adult contemporary charts).\n\nBy the later half of the 1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a highly successful traditional-minded country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to crossover to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"[[Here You Come Again (song)|Here You Come Again]]\", which peaked at No. 1 country and No. 3 pop. Of her 25 career No. 1 hits, 11 of them came during the 1970s. Parton, also became the female country music artist to host her own variety show, ''[[Dolly!]],'' which aired during the 1976\u201377 season. Rogers, the former lead singer of [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]], followed up a successful career in pop, rock and folk music by switching to country music. Like Parton, whom he would record with in the 1980s and thereafter, Rogers enjoyed a long series of successful songs that charted on both the Hot Country Singles and Billboard Hot 100 charts; the first of the lot was \"[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]],\" a No. 1 country and No. 5 pop hit. [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] were some of the other artists who also found success on both the country and pop charts with their records as well.\n\nThe most successful of the female artist in the 1970s was [[Loretta Lynn]], releasing her best selling album ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (album)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' in 1970. She gained a total of seven number one albums, and 20 number one hit singles including her biggest hit single, 1970s \"Coal Miner's Daughter,\" which went on to sell more than 500,000 copies to date. Several of Lynn's siblings gained national recording contracts, and it was her youngest sister, Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb), who would become by far the most successful. Although she has recorded and/or performed traditional country, Gayle's primary style was country pop, and by forging her own path rather than mimicking her famous sister's style, she had several tremendously successful songs, most notably \"[[Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue]].\" Lynn also recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] multiple times during the 1970s, and had five No. 1 singles together, including \"[[After the Fire Is Gone]].\" Like Lynn, Twitty had family\u2014in this case, his children\u2014who also recorded and had songs make the top 40 of the Billboard country chart, but none of them had sustained, long-term success.\n\nBesides Lynn-Twitty duet pairing, there were other notable duet pairings during the 1970s, including [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]. Married in 1968, the two had their first duet hit together in 1972 with \"Take Me\" (a remake of Jones' 1965 solo hit), and went on to have three No. 1 hits together. The two went through an acrimonious divorce in 1975, due in part to Jones' increasingly erratic behavior worsened by substance abuse problems, but the two did continue recording together afterward, releasing their most successful hit, the ironic \"[[Golden Ring (song)|Golden Ring]]\" (a song about how a wedding ring is meaningless without true love) in 1976. As a solo artist, Jones continued to maintain his hold as the premiere honky-tonk artist of the genre, recording songs of broken relationships (\"[[The Grand Tour (song)|The Grand Tour]],\" \"[[The Door (George Jones song)|The Door]]\" and \"[[Her Name Is]]\") and bitterness (\"These Days I Barely Get By\"), but the aforementioned substance abuse and behavioral issues restrained his own success and by the end of the decade, his life was wildly out of control.\n\nThe 1970s continued a trend toward a proliferation of No. 1 hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart. In 1970, there were 23 songs that reached the top spot on the chart, but by the mid-1970s, more than 40 titles rotated in and out of the top spot for the first time in history. The trend temporarily reversed itself by the late 1970s, when about 30 to 35 songs reached the pinnacle position of the chart annually.\n\nThe decade saw the deaths of several country music performers, many who would come to be regarded as [[classic country|classic stars]] of the genre. The year 1975 was a particularly difficult year for the genre, as three key performers \u2013 [[Bob Wills]], [[George Morgan (singer)|George Morgan]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]\u2014all died within a two-month timespan. In 1977, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bing Crosby]], two performers not directly identified as country but were vastly influential in and/or had substantial successes and fanbases in the genre, died within six weeks of each other. Within a seven-month time span from October 1978 to May 1979, four other notable performers died: [[Mel Street]], a relative newcomer whose honky tonk stylings made him one of the decade's most promising new artists; [[Maybelle Carter|\"Mother\" Maybelle]] and [[Sara Carter]], of the pioneering [[Carter Family]]; and [[Lester Flatt]], an early bluegrass pioneer who formed a successful partnership with [[Earl Scruggs]].\n\n===Other developments===\nThe decade saw commercial success for [[blue-eyed soul]] artists, such as [[David Bowie]] who released the successful albums ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'' (1975), which included the number one hit \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\", and ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976).\n\nIn the second half of the decade, a 1950s nostalgia movement prompted the [[Rockabilly#Revival|Rockabilly Revival]] fad. [[The Stray Cats]] led the revival into the early 1980s. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] participated through their hit \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". Also symbolizing this trend was the hit movie ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1978, starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]].\n\nTying in with the nostalgia craze, several stars of the late 1950s and early 1960s successfully revived their careers during the early- to mid-1970s after several years of inactivity. The most successful of these were [[Ricky Nelson]] (\"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]\", 1972), [[Paul Anka]] (\"[[(You're) Having My Baby]]\", 1974), [[Neil Sedaka]] (\"[[Laughter in the Rain]]\" and \"[[Bad Blood (Neil Sedaka song)|Bad Blood]]\", both 1975), and [[Frankie Valli]] as both a solo artist (1975's \"[[My Eyes Adored You]]\") and with [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]] (1976's \"[[December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)]]\"). In addition, [[Perry Como]]\u2014one of the most successful pre-rock era artists\u2014enjoyed continued success, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale (as most of his fans were adults who grew up during the 1940s and early 1950s, and not the rock record-buying youth); his most successful hits of the decade were \"[[Somos Novios (It's Impossible)|It's Impossible]]\" (1970) and the Don McLean song \"[[And I Love Her So]]\" (1973).\n\nTwo of popular music's most successful artists died within eight weeks of each other in 1977. [[Elvis Presley]], the best-selling singer of all time, died on August 16, 1977.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,337778,00.html | work=Time | first=Jessica | last=Reaves | title=Person of the Week: Elvis Presley | date=August 15, 2002}}</ref> Presley's funeral was held at [[Graceland]], on Thursday, August 18, 1977.\n\n[[Bing Crosby]], who sold about half a billion records, died October 14, 1977.

It is Pink Floyd's most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide. It has twice been remastered and re-released, and has been covered in its entirety by several other acts.

Major synthpop bands around this time included [[Gary Numan]] and [[Tubeway Army]], [[the Buggles]], [[the Human League]], and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]. Other successful British new wave bands in the late 1970s included [[the Police]], [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[XTC]], [[the Cure]], [[the Stranglers]], [[Joy Division]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].\n\n====Punk rock====\nThe mid-1970s saw the rise of [[punk music]] from its [[protopunk]]-[[garage band]] roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]] were some of the earliest British acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Groups like the Clash were noted for the experimentation of style, especially that of having strong [[ska]] influences in their music. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain [[punk fashion]] and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. The [[Sex Pistols]] caused a major sensation in 1977 and were the first serious challenge to the established rock groups like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, although the punk era in Britain lasted only three years and effectively ended with the Pistols' breakup.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Australia and New Zealand ==\n[[File:The Bee Gees.png|left|200px|thumb|[[Bee Gees]], 1968]]\n[[File:ACDC-Hughes-long ago.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[AC/DC]], August 1979]]\nThe mid-to-late 1970s Australian band [[AC/DC]] became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia, scoring a string of hits, albums and singles. They made their international debut in 1976 with High Voltage. The band quickly became successful outside their home country; the ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' album from 1979 peaked at number 13 on the [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart and they would continue as one of the most popular rock groups in the world through the following decade.\n\n[[The Bee Gees]] were an English-Australian group which consisted of brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]], and [[Robin Gibb]] \u2014 was a successful harmonic act as the 1970s dawned. Aside from the chart-topping ''How Can You Mend a Broken Heart'' in 1971, the brothers did not make much impact in the US during the first half of the decade and most of their record sales were in Europe, especially on the continent. With the failure of their 1973 album ''[[Life in a Tin Can]]'', the Bee Gees appeared washed up. But in 1975, they rebounded with ''[[Main Course (album)|Main Course]]'' which added more of a beat to their songs and they began embracing the new disco sound in their next album ''[[Children Of The World]]'' (1976). The musical movie ''Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) finally propelled the Bee Gees to global superstar status with ''[[Stayin' Alive]]'', ''[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]'' and ''[[Night Fever]]'' (from the [[Saturday Night Fever]] soundtrack). The Gibbs' youngest brother, [[Andy Gibb|Andy]], was a sensation with his own solo career. He made occasional appearances with his brothers and hit the jackpot with his songs ''[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]'' and ''[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]]''.\n\nThe most successful Australian female artist of the decade, [[Olivia Newton-John]], became a leading singer in the 1970s in both the [[popular music|popular]] and [[country music|country]] genres and realized several number one hits, including the songs, ''[[Let Me Be There]]'' and ''[[I Honestly Love You]]'' for which she received three [[Grammy Award|Grammys]].\n\nAdditional top music acts in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] included: [[Little River Band]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]], [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], [[John Paul Young]], [[Marcia Hines]], [[Jon English]], [[Richard Clapton]], [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]], [[Hush (band)|Hush]] and the [[Ted Mulry Gang]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Latin America, Caribbean and Africa==\n[[File:Jose_azul.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Jose Jose]]]]\n1970 [[Jose Jose]] jumped to fame when he sang \"[[El Triste]]\" at the [[Festival Mundial de la Canci\u00f3n Latina|Festival de la Canci\u00f3n Latina]]. He didn't win the prestigious singing contest but his performance was so memorable that fans across Latin America considered him the actual winner.\n\n===Rock===\nIn the 1970s, [[rock en Espa\u00f1ol]] began to emerge (especially in Argentina), and as imitation bands became fewer, rock music started to develop more independently from the outside, although many rock bands still preferred to sing in English. The Argentine defeat in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 followed by the fall of the military junta that year diminished need of Nueva Canci\u00f3n as protest music there in favour of other styles.\n\n===Reggae and AfroBeat===\n[[File:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Bob Marley]], 1980]]\n[[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]], a band started by [[Bob Marley]], [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] in 1963 which used to play [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] music during the 1960s, became popular in the [[Caribbean]], Europe and Africa since the early 1970s after they started playing [[reggae]] music. Later on, the band became very popular in the U.S. The Wailers broke up in 1974 with each of the three main members going on to pursue solo careers. Despite the break-up, Marley continued recording music under the name Bob Marley & The Wailers. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\", from the ''[[Natty Dread]]'' album. The success of the album ''[[Exodus (Bob Marley & The Wailers album)|Exodus]]'' (1977), which included the major international hits \"[[Jamming (song)|Jamming]]\", \"[[Turn Your Lights Down Low]]\", and \"[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]\", propelled Marley to international stardom.\n\nIn addition to the Wailers, other significant pioneers include [[Prince Buster]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Jackie Mittoo]], and several others.\n\n[[Fela Kuti|Fela Anikulapo Kuti]], or simply Fela, was a Nigerian human rights activist, political maverick, multi-instrumentalist, musician and pioneer of the [[Afrobeat]] music genre. He has been called \"superstar, singer, musician, Panafricanist, polygamist, mystic, legend.\" During the height of his popularity, he was often hailed as one of Africa's most \"challenging and charismatic music performers.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Nueva canci\u00f3n===\n[[File:Mercedes Sosa, 1967.jpg|thumb|[[Mercedes Sosa]] performing.]]\nDuring the 1970s in [[Latin America]], the 1960s music influence remained strong and two styles developed from it one that followed the European and North American trends and [[Nueva Canci\u00f3n]] that focused on the renewal of [[folklore]] including [[Andean music]] and [[cueca]]. Some bands such as [[Los Jaivas]] from Chile mixed both streams and created a syncretism between folklore and [[progressive rock]]. The Nueva Canci\u00f3n movement got an even more marked protest association after all countries in the [[Southern Cone]] became (or were already) military dictatorships in the 1970s. In Chile, the Nueva canci\u00f3n styles developed through the 1970s would remain popular until the [[Chilean transition to democracy|return to democracy]] in 1990.\n\n===Cumbia===\nIt was during the 1970s the [[cumbia]] became widely popular outside Colombia. Several bands brought Cumbia to Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Chile places that later became major scenes for further developments of cumbia music. While Nueva Canci\u00f3n was the music of the [[New Left]] and the rock developments of Argentina reflected the European oriented youth, cumbia became widely popular among the large poor sectors of Latin American countries, to such degree that it came to be associated with shantytowns and low-prestige Native American populations.\n\n===Salsa and merengue===\n[[Salsa music]] developed in the 1960s and 1970s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The [[merengue music]] experienced during the late 1970s was a golden age of productivity characterized by the rise of a new generation of musicians.\n\n==Other trends==\nThe commercial cinemas around the world tended to imitate nuances of disco beats in their movies to present their movies as western and upbeat. These included the increasingly popular [[kung-fu]] movies in far [[East Asia]] and [[Bollywood]] movies from India. These trends are essential in proving that commercial cinemas were a beneficial investment for the community.

Aside from disco, [[funk]], [[smooth jazz]], [[jazz fusion]], and [[soul music|soul]] remained popular throughout the decade. It is this influx of popular music that soon transformed int [[rock and roll]] during the Early 1970s. [[Rock music]] played an important part in the Western musical scene, with [[punk rock]] thriving throughout the mid to late 1970s.\n\n<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/american-punk-rock-t555</ref> Other subgenres of rock, particularly [[glam rock]], [[hard rock]], [[progressive rock|progressive]], [[art rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] achieved various amounts of success.

[[classical music|Classical]] began losing a little momentum; however, through invention and theoretical development, this particular genre gave rise to [[Experimental music|experimental classical]] and [[minimalist music]] by classical composers. A subgenre of classical, [[film score]]s, remained popular with movie-goers. Alongside the popularity of [[experimental music]], the decade was notable for its contributions to [[electronic music]], which rose in popularity with the continued development of [[synthesizer]]s and [[harmonizer]]s; more composers embraced this particular genre, gaining the notice of listeners who were looking for something new and different. Its rising popularity, mixed with the popular music of the period, led to the creation of [[synthpop]]. [[Pop music|Pop]] also had a popularity role in the 1970s.\n\nIn [[Asia]], music continued to follow varying trends. In [[Japan]], the decade saw several musical phases, including the highly popular [[frat music|folk]]-influenced ''[[f\u014dku]]'', as well as greater experimentation with [[electronic music]], ranging from developments in [[synthpop]], [[electro (music)|electro]], and [[Electronic Dance Music]], created through different Japanese artists and bands such as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]].<ref>http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/</ref>\n\nIn [[Latin America]] and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], the [[Nueva canci\u00f3n]] movement peaked in popularity and was adopted as the music of the [[hippie]], [[Liberation Theology]], and [[New Left]] movements. [[Cumbia]] music began its internationalization as regional scenes rose outside Colombia. [[Merengue music|Merengue]] experienced mainstream exposure across [[Latin America]] and the southern US border states.\n\nIn [[Africa]], especially [[Nigeria]], the genre known as [[Afrobeat]] gained a following throughout the 1970s.<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/afro-beat-d338</ref>\n\n== Overview ==\nIn an essay published in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] wrote:\n\n{{quote|\"The decade is of course an arbitrary schema itself\u2014time doesn't just execute a neat turn toward the future every ten years. But like a lot of artificial concepts\u2014money, say\u2014the category does take on a reality of its own once people figure out how to put it to work. 'The '60s are over,' a slogan one only began to hear in 1972 or so, mobilized all those eager to believe that idealism had become passe, and once they were mobilized, it had. In popular music, embracing the '70s meant both an [[elitist]] withdrawal from the messy concert and [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] scene and a profiteering pursuit of the lowest common denominator in [[FM radio]] and [[album era|album rock]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/bk-cg70/decade.php|title=CG 70s: The Decade|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|year=1980|website=robertchristgau.com|accessdate=April 6, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to Christgau, the decade also saw greater fragmentation along stylistic lines because of the rise of [[semipopular music]]: \"It goes back to whenever arty types began to find 'the best' rock worthy of attention in the '60s, but in the '60s tolerance was the rule; it was easier to name rough substyles\u2014say [[British invasion]], [[folk-rock]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]], and [[soul music|soul]]\u2014than to analyze their separate audiences (even racial distinctions were fuzzy).

During the first half of the decade, British acts such as [[Deep Purple]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], [[Black Sabbath]] were at the height of their international fame, particularly in the United States. By the second half of the decade, many other acts had also achieved stardom, namely, [[Alice Cooper]], [[AC/DC]], [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Van Halen]] and [[Ted Nugent]].\n\n[[Arena rock]] grew in popularity through rock acts such as [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]], [[Styx (band)|Styx]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]] and [[The Who]].\n\n[[Psychedelic rock]] declined in popularity after the deaths of [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Janis Joplin]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[The Doors]], the self-imposed seclusion of [[Syd Barrett]] from Pink Floyd, and the break-up of [[The Beatles]] in 1970.\n\n=== Country rock and Southern rock ===\n\n[[File:Eagles.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eagles (band)|The Eagles]]]]\n[[Country rock]], formed from the fusion of [[rock music]] with [[country music]], gained its greatest commercial success in the 1970s, beginning with non-country artists such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Gram Parsons]], and [[The Byrds]]. By the mid-1970s, [[Linda Ronstadt]], along with other newer artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[The Eagles]], were enjoying mainstream success and popularity that continues to this day.

Some of the Canadian new wave groups included [[Rough Trade (band)|Rough Trade]], [[The Payolas]] and [[Martha and the Muffins]]. After the success of British [[synthpop]] acts in the U.S. such as [[Gary Numan]] and [[the Buggles]], a number of American bands also began experimenting with [[synthesizer]]s. In the early 1980s, bands from the United Kingdom became immensely popular in the U.S., and this phenomenon became known as the [[Second British Invasion]] which mainly consisted of British new wave and synthpop acts, therefore broadening the definition of \"new wave\".\n\n===Punk rock===\n\n[[File:Johnny Ramone.jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Ramones]]'s lead guitarist [[Johnny Ramone]] performing in Toronto, 1977]]\nThe mid-1970s saw the rise of [[punk music]] from its [[protopunk]]-[[garage band]] roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Ramones]], [[Patti Smith]], and [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] were some of the earliest American punk rock acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain [[punk fashion]] and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. Blondie quickly lost their punk roots going on to become a pop/ska/reggae band.\n\n===Blues rock===\n\nBlues rock remains popular, with [[Eric Clapton]], [[ZZ Top]], and [[George Thorogood]] seeing the greatest success. [[Freddie King]] started moving from straight blues to blues rock since the genre was now mostly popular among white audiences. Stress from nonstop touring resulted in his death at the age of 42 in 1976.\n\n===Soft rock and pop===\n\nSome of the more notable pop/[[soft rock]] groups during the 1970s were the [[Carpenters (band)|Carpenters]], the [[Jackson 5]], [[Seals & Crofts]], [[The Doobie Brothers]], [[Hall & Oates]], [[Bread (band)|Bread]], [[Captain & Tennille]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], [[Bay City Rollers]], and [[The Osmonds]].\n\nSoloists who characterized the pop music of the era included [[Barry Manilow]], [[Andy Gibb]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Elton John]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[Cat Stevens]], [[James Taylor]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Barry White]], and [[Rod Stewart]].  Female soloists who epitomized the 1970s included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Roberta Flack]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Rita Coolidge]], [[Olivia Newton-John]] and [[Helen Reddy]].\n\nSome of the most popular music acts of the day got their own network television variety shows, which were very popular in the 70s. Acts like [[Sonny & Cher]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[John Denver]], [[Tony Orlando and Dawn]], husband and wife team [[Captain & Tennille]], brother and sister [[Donny & Marie Osmond]].\n\n[[File:Billy Joel - Perth 7 November 2006.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Billy Joel]] performing in Perth Western Australia in 2006]]\n[[Soft rock]] was prominently featured on many [[Top 40]] and [[contemporary hit radio]] stations throughout the 1970s.

[[Bob Dylan]]'s 1975\u20131976 [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] reunited him with a number of folk-rock acts from his early days of performing, most notably [[Joan Baez]], who returned to the charts in 1975 with \"[[Diamonds & Rust]]\".\n\nSome of the most successful singers and songwriters were: [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Jim Croce]], [[John Denver]], [[Neil Diamond]], [[Barry Gibb]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Carole King]], [[Elton John]], [[Don McLean]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], and [[Harry Chapin]]\u2014 some had previously been primarily songwriters but began releasing albums and songs of their own. King's album ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'' became one of the top-selling albums of the decade, and the song \"[[It's Too Late (Carole King song)|It's Too Late]]\" became one of the 1970s biggest songs. McLean's 1971 song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]],\" inspired by [[The Day the Music Died|the death of Buddy Holly]], became one of popular music's [[Songs of the Century|most-recognized songs of the 20th century]], thanks to its abstract and vivid storytelling, which center around \"The Day the Music Died\" and popular music of the rock era.\n\nThe early 1970s marked the departure of [[Diana Ross]] from [[The Supremes]] and the break-up of [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[The Beatles]]. All continued hugely successful recording careers throughout the decade. Some of their songs are that among the hits of the early 1970s: Simon & Garfunkel's \"[[Bridge Over Troubled Water]]\", Simon's solo hit \"[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]\", The Beatles  \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]\", Paul McCartney's \"[[Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey]]\", George Harrison's \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\", and Ross' \"[[Ain't No Mountain High Enough]]\" .<ref name=\"Cue sheet\">\"Top Fifty Hits of the 1970s\", [[American Top 40]], Watermark Inc.

Primarily an African-American genre, it was characterized by the heavy use of bass and \"wah-wah\" pedals. Rhythm was emphasized over melody. Artists such as [[James Brown]], [[The Meters]], [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]] pioneered the genre. It then spawned artists such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]], [[The Brothers Johnson]], [[Kool & The Gang]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]], [[King Floyd]], [[Tower of Power]], [[Ohio Players]], [[The Commodores]], [[War (U.S. band)|War]], [[Confunkshun]], [[Gap Band]], [[Slave (band)|Slave]], [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]], the [[Bar-Kays]], [[Zapp (band)|Zapp]], and many more. Other popular artists with the mainstream were [[Bill Withers]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[Three Dog Night]], [[The Stylistics]], [[The Fifth Dimension]], [[Marvin Gaye]], [[The Temptations]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Barry White]] and [[Issac Hayes]].\n\nThe 1970s saw African-American audiences shift away from genres like rock and blues which had originally been invented and dominated by black musicians. While blues performers like [[B.B. King]] and [[Albert King]] remained successful, they changed to a mostly white audience. Soul, R&B, and funk became the predominate music styles among black artists and audiences.\n\n[[Roberta Flack]] had two of the biggest hits of the decade with \"[[The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face]]\", from the Clint Eastwood movie ''[[Play Misty for Me]]''; and \"[[Killing Me Softly with His Song|Killing Me Softly]]\".

The band served as the launching pad for the solo careers of their lead singers Jermaine and Michael, both had some solo success in the early part of the decade. Jermaine with top 10 hit \"[[Daddy's Home (song)|Daddy's Home]]\"<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/song/daddys-home-mt0008476579.</ref> and Michael topped the charts with \"[[Ben (song)|Ben]]\" theme song to the movie.

Other examples of the girl group were [[Love Unlimited]] and [[The Three Degrees]] who scored a number two pop hit with \"[[When Will I See You Again]]\" but topped the chart when they teamed with Mother, Sister, Father, Brother (MSFB) on the Sound of Philadelphia (TSOP).<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/great-r-b-female-groups-in-the-70smw0000039791.</ref>\n\nThe Commodores were another group that played from a diverse repertoire, including R&B, funk, and pop. [[Lionel Richie]], who went on to even greater success as a solo artist in the 1980s, fronted the group's biggest 1970s hits, including \"[[Easy (Commodores song)|Easy]]\", \"[[Three Times a Lady]]\", and \"[[Still (Commodores song)|Still]]\".\n\n===Country===\n[[File:Willie Nelson Promotional Photo - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Willie Nelson]] became one of the most popular country music artists during the 1970s.]]\nA number of styles defined country music during the 1970s decade. At the beginning of the decade, the [[Nashville sound|countrypolitan]] \u2014 an offshoot of the earlier \"Nashville Sound\" of the late 1950s and early 1960s \u2014 and the honky-tonk fused [[Bakersfield Sound]] were some of the more popular styles.\n\nThe countrypolitan sound \u2014 a polished, streamlined sound featuring string sections, background vocals and crooning lead vocalists \u2014 was popularized by artists including [[Lynn Anderson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Anne Murray]], [[Dottie West]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and others, achieving their successes through such songs as \"[[Rose Garden (Lynn Anderson song)|(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden]]\", \"[[Snowbird (song)|Snowbird]]\", and others. The Bakersfield sound, first popularized in the early 1960s, continued its peak in popularity through artists such as [[Buck Owens]] and [[Merle Haggard]].\n\nBut other styles began to emerge during the 1970s. One of the more successful styles was \"[[outlaw country]]\", a type of music blending the traditional and honky tonk sounds of country music with [[rock music|rock]] and [[blues|blues music]], and mixed with the anger of an alienated subculture of the nation during the period. The leaders of the movement were [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]], although others associated with the movement were [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[David Allan Coe]], [[Jessi Colter]], [[Tompall Glaser]], [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] and [[Billy Joe Shaver]]. The efforts of Jennings, Nelson, Colter and Glaser were encapsulated in the 1976 album ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]''.\n\nAlthough country gospel was never really the in thing in music. The 1970s saw the rise of \"the most awarded act in the history of country music.\"  That group being [[The Statler Brothers]], who literally dominated country music the entire decade.\n\nThe [[country pop]] sound was a successor to the countrypolitan sound of the early 1970s. In addition to artists such as Murray and Campbell, several artists who were not initially marketed as country were enjoying crossover success with country audiences through radio airplay and sales. The most successful of these artists included [[The Bellamy Brothers]], [[Charlie Rich]], [[John Denver]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Marie Osmond]], [[B. J. Thomas]] and [[Kenny Rogers]]. Newton-John, an Australian pop singer, was named Female Vocalist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]] in 1974, sparking a debate that continues to this day \u2014 what is country music? A group of traditional-minded artists, troubled by this trend, formed the short-lived [[Association of Country Entertainers]], in an attempt to bring back traditional honky-tonk sounds to the forefront, setting the stage for the [[neotraditional country]] revival that would become particularly prominent in the early 1980s. The debate continued into 1975, a year where six songs reached No. 1 on both the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles]] and [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] charts. Things came to a head when, at that year's CMA Awards, Rich \u2014 the reigning Entertainer of the Year, and himself a crossover artist \u2014 presented the award to his successor, \"my good friend, Mr. John Denver.\" His statement, taken as sarcasm, and his setting fire to the envelope (containing Denver's name) with a cigarette lighter were taken as a protest against the increasing pop style in country music (this despite Rich himself having made his name with songs that crossed over from country into the pop and adult contemporary charts).\n\nBy the later half of the 1970s, [[Dolly Parton]], a highly successful traditional-minded country artist since the late 1960s, mounted a high-profile campaign to crossover to pop music, culminating in her 1977 hit \"[[Here You Come Again (song)|Here You Come Again]]\", which peaked at No. 1 country and No. 3 pop. Of her 25 career No. 1 hits, 11 of them came during the 1970s. Parton, also became the female country music artist to host her own variety show, ''[[Dolly!]],'' which aired during the 1976\u201377 season. Rogers, the former lead singer of [[The First Edition (band)|The First Edition]], followed up a successful career in pop, rock and folk music by switching to country music. Like Parton, whom he would record with in the 1980s and thereafter, Rogers enjoyed a long series of successful songs that charted on both the Hot Country Singles and Billboard Hot 100 charts; the first of the lot was \"[[Lucille (Kenny Rogers song)|Lucille]],\" a No. 1 country and No. 5 pop hit. [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Ronnie Milsap]], [[Eddie Rabbitt]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]] were some of the other artists who also found success on both the country and pop charts with their records as well.\n\nThe most successful of the female artist in the 1970s was [[Loretta Lynn]], releasing her best selling album ''[[Coal Miner's Daughter (album)|Coal Miner's Daughter]]'' in 1970. She gained a total of seven number one albums, and 20 number one hit singles including her biggest hit single, 1970s \"Coal Miner's Daughter,\" which went on to sell more than 500,000 copies to date. Several of Lynn's siblings gained national recording contracts, and it was her youngest sister, Crystal Gayle (born Brenda Gail Webb), who would become by far the most successful. Although she has recorded and/or performed traditional country, Gayle's primary style was country pop, and by forging her own path rather than mimicking her famous sister's style, she had several tremendously successful songs, most notably \"[[Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue]].\" Lynn also recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] multiple times during the 1970s, and had five No. 1 singles together, including \"[[After the Fire Is Gone]].\" Like Lynn, Twitty had family\u2014in this case, his children\u2014who also recorded and had songs make the top 40 of the Billboard country chart, but none of them had sustained, long-term success.\n\nBesides Lynn-Twitty duet pairing, there were other notable duet pairings during the 1970s, including [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]. Married in 1968, the two had their first duet hit together in 1972 with \"Take Me\" (a remake of Jones' 1965 solo hit), and went on to have three No. 1 hits together. The two went through an acrimonious divorce in 1975, due in part to Jones' increasingly erratic behavior worsened by substance abuse problems, but the two did continue recording together afterward, releasing their most successful hit, the ironic \"[[Golden Ring (song)|Golden Ring]]\" (a song about how a wedding ring is meaningless without true love) in 1976. As a solo artist, Jones continued to maintain his hold as the premiere honky-tonk artist of the genre, recording songs of broken relationships (\"[[The Grand Tour (song)|The Grand Tour]],\" \"[[The Door (George Jones song)|The Door]]\" and \"[[Her Name Is]]\") and bitterness (\"These Days I Barely Get By\"), but the aforementioned substance abuse and behavioral issues restrained his own success and by the end of the decade, his life was wildly out of control.\n\nThe 1970s continued a trend toward a proliferation of No. 1 hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart. In 1970, there were 23 songs that reached the top spot on the chart, but by the mid-1970s, more than 40 titles rotated in and out of the top spot for the first time in history. The trend temporarily reversed itself by the late 1970s, when about 30 to 35 songs reached the pinnacle position of the chart annually.\n\nThe decade saw the deaths of several country music performers, many who would come to be regarded as [[classic country|classic stars]] of the genre. The year 1975 was a particularly difficult year for the genre, as three key performers \u2013 [[Bob Wills]], [[George Morgan (singer)|George Morgan]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]\u2014all died within a two-month timespan. In 1977, [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Bing Crosby]], two performers not directly identified as country but were vastly influential in and/or had substantial successes and fanbases in the genre, died within six weeks of each other. Within a seven-month time span from October 1978 to May 1979, four other notable performers died: [[Mel Street]], a relative newcomer whose honky tonk stylings made him one of the decade's most promising new artists; [[Maybelle Carter|\"Mother\" Maybelle]] and [[Sara Carter]], of the pioneering [[Carter Family]]; and [[Lester Flatt]], an early bluegrass pioneer who formed a successful partnership with [[Earl Scruggs]].\n\n===Other developments===\nThe decade saw commercial success for [[blue-eyed soul]] artists, such as [[David Bowie]] who released the successful albums ''[[Young Americans (album)|Young Americans]]'' (1975), which included the number one hit \"[[Fame (David Bowie song)|Fame]]\", and ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976).\n\nIn the second half of the decade, a 1950s nostalgia movement prompted the [[Rockabilly#Revival|Rockabilly Revival]] fad. [[The Stray Cats]] led the revival into the early 1980s. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] participated through their hit \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". Also symbolizing this trend was the hit movie ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' in 1978, starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Olivia Newton-John]].\n\nTying in with the nostalgia craze, several stars of the late 1950s and early 1960s successfully revived their careers during the early- to mid-1970s after several years of inactivity. The most successful of these were [[Ricky Nelson]] (\"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]\", 1972), [[Paul Anka]] (\"[[(You're) Having My Baby]]\", 1974), [[Neil Sedaka]] (\"[[Laughter in the Rain]]\" and \"[[Bad Blood (Neil Sedaka song)|Bad Blood]]\", both 1975), and [[Frankie Valli]] as both a solo artist (1975's \"[[My Eyes Adored You]]\") and with [[The Four Seasons (band)|The Four Seasons]] (1976's \"[[December 1963 (Oh, What A Night)]]\"). In addition, [[Perry Como]]\u2014one of the most successful pre-rock era artists\u2014enjoyed continued success, albeit on a somewhat smaller scale (as most of his fans were adults who grew up during the 1940s and early 1950s, and not the rock record-buying youth); his most successful hits of the decade were \"[[Somos Novios (It's Impossible)|It's Impossible]]\" (1970) and the Don McLean song \"[[And I Love Her So]]\" (1973).\n\nTwo of popular music's most successful artists died within eight weeks of each other in 1977.

Major synthpop bands around this time included [[Gary Numan]] and [[Tubeway Army]], [[the Buggles]], [[the Human League]], and [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]]. Other successful British new wave bands in the late 1970s included [[the Police]], [[Echo & the Bunnymen]], [[Adam and the Ants]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[XTC]], [[the Cure]], [[the Stranglers]], [[Joy Division]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]].\n\n====Punk rock====\nThe mid-1970s saw the rise of [[punk music]] from its [[protopunk]]-[[garage band]] roots in the 1960s and early 1970s. The [[Sex Pistols]], and [[The Clash]] were some of the earliest British acts to make it big in both the United Kingdom and the United States. Groups like the Clash were noted for the experimentation of style, especially that of having strong [[ska]] influences in their music. Punk music has also been heavily associated with a certain [[punk fashion]] and absurdist humour which exemplified a genuine suspicion of mainstream culture and values. The [[Sex Pistols]] caused a major sensation in 1977 and were the first serious challenge to the established rock groups like the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin, although the punk era in Britain lasted only three years and effectively ended with the Pistols' breakup.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Australia and New Zealand ==\n[[File:The Bee Gees.png|left|200px|thumb|[[Bee Gees]], 1968]]\n[[File:ACDC-Hughes-long ago.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[AC/DC]], August 1979]]\nThe mid-to-late 1970s Australian band [[AC/DC]] became one of the most popular and successful acts in Australia, scoring a string of hits, albums and singles. They made their international debut in 1976 with High Voltage. The band quickly became successful outside their home country; the ''[[Highway to Hell]]'' album from 1979 peaked at number 13 on the [[Kent Music Report]] Albums Chart and they would continue as one of the most popular rock groups in the world through the following decade.\n\n[[The Bee Gees]] were an English-Australian group which consisted of brothers [[Barry Gibb|Barry]], [[Maurice Gibb|Maurice]], and [[Robin Gibb]] \u2014 was a successful harmonic act as the 1970s dawned. Aside from the chart-topping ''How Can You Mend a Broken Heart'' in 1971, the brothers did not make much impact in the US during the first half of the decade and most of their record sales were in Europe, especially on the continent. With the failure of their 1973 album ''[[Life in a Tin Can]]'', the Bee Gees appeared washed up. But in 1975, they rebounded with ''[[Main Course (album)|Main Course]]'' which added more of a beat to their songs and they began embracing the new disco sound in their next album ''[[Children Of The World]]'' (1976). The musical movie ''Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) finally propelled the Bee Gees to global superstar status with ''[[Stayin' Alive]]'', ''[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than a Woman]]'' and ''[[Night Fever]]'' (from the [[Saturday Night Fever]] soundtrack). The Gibbs' youngest brother, [[Andy Gibb|Andy]], was a sensation with his own solo career. He made occasional appearances with his brothers and hit the jackpot with his songs ''[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]'' and ''[[Shadow Dancing (song)|Shadow Dancing]]''.\n\nThe most successful Australian female artist of the decade, [[Olivia Newton-John]], became a leading singer in the 1970s in both the [[popular music|popular]] and [[country music|country]] genres and realized several number one hits, including the songs, ''[[Let Me Be There]]'' and ''[[I Honestly Love You]]'' for which she received three [[Grammy Award|Grammys]].\n\nAdditional top music acts in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] included: [[Little River Band]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]], [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]], [[John Paul Young]], [[Marcia Hines]], [[Jon English]], [[Richard Clapton]], [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]], [[Hush (band)|Hush]] and the [[Ted Mulry Gang]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Latin America, Caribbean and Africa==\n\n===Nueva canci\u00f3n===\n\nDuring the 1970s in [[Latin America]], the 1960s music influence remained strong and two styles developed from it one that followed the European and North American trends and [[Nueva Canci\u00f3n]] that focused on the renewal of [[folklore]] including [[Andean music]] and [[cueca]]. Some bands such as [[Los Jaivas]] from Chile mixed both streams and created a syncretism between folklore and [[progressive rock]]. The Nueva Canci\u00f3n movement got an even more marked protest association after all countries in the [[Southern Cone]] became (or were already) military dictatorships in the 1970s. In Chile, the Nueva canci\u00f3n styles developed through the 1970s would remain popular until the [[Chilean transition to democracy|return to democracy]] in 1990.\n\n===Rock===\nIn the 1970s, [[rock en Espa\u00f1ol]] began to emerge (especially in Argentina), and as imitation bands became fewer, rock music started to develop more independently from the outside, although many rock bands still preferred to sing in English. The Argentine defeat in the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 followed by the fall of the military junta that year diminished need of Nueva Canci\u00f3n as protest music there in favour of other styles.\n\n===Reggae and AfroBeat===\n[[File:Bob-Marley-in-Concert Zurich 05-30-80.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Bob Marley]], 1980]]\n[[The Wailers (1963-1974 band)|The Wailers]], a band started by [[Bob Marley]], [[Peter Tosh]] and [[Bunny Wailer]] in 1963 which used to play [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]] music during the 1960s, became popular in the [[Caribbean]], Europe and Africa since the early 1970s after they started playing [[reggae]] music. Later on, the band became very popular in the U.S. The Wailers broke up in 1974 with each of the three main members going on to pursue solo careers. Despite the break-up, Marley continued recording music under the name Bob Marley & The Wailers. In 1975, Marley had his international breakthrough with his first hit outside Jamaica, \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\", from the ''[[Natty Dread]]'' album. The success of the album ''[[Exodus (Bob Marley & The Wailers album)|Exodus]]'' (1977), which included the major international hits \"[[Jamming (song)|Jamming]]\", \"[[Turn Your Lights Down Low]]\", and \"[[One Love (Bob Marley song)|One Love]]\", propelled Marley to international stardom.\n\nIn addition to the Wailers, other significant pioneers include [[Prince Buster]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Jackie Mittoo]], and several others.\n\n[[Fela Kuti|Fela Anikulapo Kuti]], or simply Fela, was a Nigerian human rights activist, political maverick, multi-instrumentalist, musician and pioneer of the [[Afrobeat]] music genre. He has been called \"superstar, singer, musician, Panafricanist, polygamist, mystic, legend.\" During the height of his popularity, he was often hailed as one of Africa's most \"challenging and charismatic music performers.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Cumbia===\nIt was during the 1970s the [[cumbia]] became widely popular outside Colombia. Several bands brought Cumbia to Mexico, Peru, Argentina and Chile places that later became major scenes for further developments of cumbia music. While Nueva Canci\u00f3n was the music of the [[New Left]] and the rock developments of Argentina reflected the European oriented youth, cumbia became widely popular among the large poor sectors of Latin American countries, to such degree that it came to be associated with shantytowns and low-prestige Native American populations.\n\n===Salsa and merengue===\n[[Salsa music]] developed in the 1960s and 1970s by Puerto Rican and [[Cuba]]n immigrants to the [[New York City]] area but did not enter into mainstream popularity in Latin America until the late 1980s. The [[merengue music]] experienced during the late 1970s was a golden age of productivity characterized by the rise of a new generation of musicians.\n\n==Other trends==\nThe commercial cinemas around the world tended to imitate nuances of disco beats in their movies to present their movies as western and upbeat. These included the increasingly popular [[kung-fu]] movies in far [[East Asia]] and [[Bollywood]] movies from India. These trends are essential in proving that commercial cinemas were a beneficial investment for the community.

Ice Cube was the only member of N.W.A who is not from [[Compton, California]] (where it was formed).\n\nBy this point Ice Cube was a full-time member of N.W.A along with [[Dr. Dre]] and [[MC Ren]]. Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. However, towards the end of 1989, Ice Cube found himself at odds with the group's manager, [[Jerry Heller]], after rejecting Heller's proposed contract terms.<ref name=\"Ice Cube 2002\"/>\n\nIce Cube wrote the lyrics to approximately half of both ''Straight Outta Compton'', and Eazy-E's solo album, ''[[Eazy-Duz-It]]'', but he was only paid $32,000 and his contract did not confirm that he was an official member of N.W.A.<ref name=\"Attitude70\">''Ice Cube: Attitude'', Joel McIver, p.70, Foruli Classics, 2012</ref>  This led Ice Cube to leave the group and bring a private lawsuit against Jerry Heller, which was later settled out of court.<ref name=\"Attitude70\"/> In response, the remaining N.W.A members attacked him on the EP ''[[100 Miles and Runnin']]'', and on their next and final album, ''[[Niggaz4Life]]''.\n\n===1989\u2013present: Solo career===\nIn early 1990, Ice Cube recorded his debut solo album, ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'', in New York with [[the Bomb Squad]] ([[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]'s production team). It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\". After 1994, he took a hiatus from music and concentrated on film work and developing the careers of other rap musicians, [[Mack 10]], [[Mr. Short Khop]], [[Kausion]], and [[Da Lench Mob]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nIn 1994, Ice Cube had reunited with former N.W.A member [[Dr. Dre]], who was now part of [[Death Row Records]], in their duet \"Natural Born Killaz\".<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> In 1998, he released his long-awaited fifth solo album, ''[[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)]]''.

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.

Ice Cube wrote Dr. Dre's and Eazy-E's rhymes for the group's landmark album, ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988.

It was released in May 1990 and was an instant hit, riding and contributing to the rising tide of rap's popularity in mainstream society. The album was charged with controversy, and he was accused of misogyny and racism. Subsequently, Ice Cube appointed rapper [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]] (who appeared on ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'') to the head of his own record label and helped produce her debut album, ''[[Make Way for the Motherlode]]''. This was followed by a critically acclaimed role as Doughboy in [[John Singleton]]'s violent crime drama, ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]''. In the same year as ''AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted'', Ice Cube released the acclaimed [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Kill At Will]]'' which sold well, becoming the first hip hop EP to go [[Platinum album|Platinum]].<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/>\n\nHis second album ''[[Death Certificate (album)|Death Certificate]]'' was released in 1991. The album was regarded as more focused, yet even more controversial, and critics accused him again of being anti-white, misogynist, and antisemitic. The album is thematically divided into two sides: the 'Death Side' (\"a vision of where we are today\") and the 'Life Side' (\"a vision of where we need to go\"). It features \"[[No Vaseline]]\", a scathing response to N.W.A<nowiki>'s ''100 Miles and Runnin''</nowiki> as well as \"Black Korea,\" a track regarded by some as prophetic of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]], but also interpreted as racist by many.<ref name=\"Allmusic\"/> Ice Cube toured with [[Lollapalooza]] in 1992, which widened his fan base.<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/Feature_Story/feature_story/0,4120,140252,00.html|title= Chillin' with Cube|accessdate=June 14, 2007|date=February 25, 2000|work=The Guardian |location=UK }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob at the Ranch Bowl 1993-02-10 (ticket).jpg|thumb|right|A ticket from a 1993 Ice Cube concert in Omaha, Nebraska.]]\nIce Cube released his third album, ''[[The Predator (1992 album)|The Predator]]'', in November 1992. Referring specifically to that year's [[1992 Los Angeles riots|Los Angeles riots]], in the first single, \"[[Wicked (Ice Cube song)|Wicked]]\", he rapped \"April 29 was power to the people, and we might just see a sequel\". ''The Predator'' debuted at number one on both the pop and R&B charts, the first album in history to do so. Singles from ''The Predator'' included \"[[It Was a Good Day]]\" and \"[[Check Yo Self]]\", and the songs had a two-part music video. The album was generally well received by critics and remains his most successful release commercially, with over three million copies sold in the US. However, after ''The Predator'', Ice Cube's rap audience diminished. Cube's fourth album ''[[Lethal Injection (album)|Lethal Injection]]'', which was released at the end of 1993 and represented Ice Cube's first attempt at imitating the [[G-Funk]] sound of Dr. Dre's ''[[The Chronic]]'', was not well received by critics. He had more successful hits from ''Lethal Injection'', including \"[[Really Doe (song)|Really Doe]]\", \"[[Bop Gun (One Nation)]]\", \"[[You Know How We Do It]]\" & \"What Can I Do?\".

Some of the album was used to engage in the [[East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry]] of the 1990s. The album's eponymous single reached number 21 on the singles charts, and the album itself was certified [[RIAA Certification|Platinum]] by the end of 1996. With ''Bow Down'', Westside Connection brought their own agenda to the hip hop scene. Ice Cube, Mack 10 and WC had grown tired of being overlooked by most East Coast media outlets; the album was designed to instil a sense of pride in West Coast hip hop fans and to start a larger movement that some people who felt underappreciated might identify with. Songs like \"Bow Down\" and \"Gangstas Make the World Go 'Round\" make reference to this. Ice Cube would also eventually make amends with [[Eazy-E]] shortly before his death in March 1995.\n\nAfter a seven-year hiatus, Westside Connection returned with their second effort ''[[Terrorist Threats]]'' in 2003. The album fared well critically, but its sales fell short of ''Bow Down''. \"Gangsta Nation\" was the only single released from the album, which was produced by [[Fredwreck]] and featured [[Nate Dogg]]; it was a radio hit. After a rift between Ice Cube and Mack 10 about Ice Cube's commitments to film work rather than touring with the group, Westside Connection disbanded.\n\n===1992\u2013present: Collaborations===\nIn 1992, Ice Cube assisted on debut albums from [[Del the Funky Homosapien]] (''[[I Wish My Brother George Was Here]]''), [[Da Lench Mob]] (''[[Guerillas in tha Mist]]'', 1992) and [[Kam (rapper)|Kam]] (''Neva Again'', 1993), all of which enjoyed critical acclaim and some moderate commercial success. He handled most of the production on ''Guerillas in tha Mist''.\n\nIn 1993, Lench Mob member, J-Dee, was sentenced to life imprisonment for attempted murder, and Ice Cube did not produce their next album, ''Planet of tha Apes''. Around this time in 1993, he also worked with [[Tupac Shakur]] on his album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]],'' appearing on the track \"Last Wordz\" with [[Ice-T]]. He also did a song with Dr. Dre for the first time since he left N.W.A: \"[[Natural Born Killaz]]\", for the ''[[Murder Was The Case]]'' soundtrack, and also contributed to the ''[[Office Space]]'' [[Office Space soundtrack|soundtrack]]. He also featured on Kool G Rap's song \"Two To The Head\" from the Kool G Rap & DJ Polo album \"Live And Let Die\". He also collaborated with [[David Bowie]] and [[Trent Reznor]] from [[Nine Inch Nails]] for a remix of Bowie's \"[[I'm Afraid of Americans]]\". Ice Cube appeared on the song \"[[Children of the Korn]]\" by the band [[Korn]], joining them on the [[Family Values Tour 1998]], and they also collaborated on 'Fuck Dying' from [[War & Peace Vol. 1 (The War Disc)|Cube's fifth album]]. He also lent his voice to British DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s solo debut album, ''[[Bunkka]]'', on the track \"Get Em Up\". Ice Cube appeared in several songs in [[WC (rapper)|WC]] [[Guilty by Affiliation]] like \"Keep it 100\", \"80's babies\" and \"Jack and the bean stalk\". Ice Cube also appeared in [[D.A.Z.

According to most sources, he was born in [[Bukhara]]. He is believed to have been of Persian origins and his title ''ad-Darazi'' is Persian - meaning 'the tailor'.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Farhad Daftary|title=Historical Dictionary of the Ismailis|date=30 Dec 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810879706|page=40}}</ref> He arrived in Cairo in 1015, or 1017, after which he joined the newly emerged Druze movement.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Samy Swayd|title=The A to Z of the Druzes|date=27 Jul 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810870024|page=xxxii|edition=annotated}}</ref>\n\nHe was the leader of an army that was sent from Cairo to put down the up-rising of the Unity movement that started in the mountains of Lebanon to unite Christian and Muslim Sunni and Shiah under one God. Ad-Darazi's army was around 200,000 men while the Unity movement that started in the Choufe Mountains of Lebanon and the Houran Mountains of Syria had less than 10,000 men. The two sides met in battle north of Jerusalem. Ad-Darazi army was destroyed and he was captured. As a result of the victory, the Unity movement was called at that time the movement that destroyed the army of the Darazi.\n\nAfter the battle, Ad-Darazi was converted to be one of the early preachers of the Unity faith (which became known as the Druze faith). At that time, the movement enlisted a large number of adherents.<ref name=\"olive\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=kY0oedX32BwC&pg=PA128&dq=Hamza+bin+Ali+druze&ei=hxV-SLTaB4KijgHJvKXtDw&sig=ACfU3U3Joonyh4sX6X3A6xx9ngHmddJ59w#PPA127,M1 The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze By Dr Ruth Westheimer and Gil Sedan]</ref> However, he was later considered a renegade <ref name=\"druze\">[http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html About the Faith of the Mo\u2019wa\u2019he\u2019doon Druze by Moustafa F.

In the ''[[Epistles of Wisdom]]'', [[Hamza ibn Ali ibn Ahmad|Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad]] warns Ad-Darazi, saying, ''\u201cFaith does not need a sword to aid it.\u201d'' However, Ad-Darazi ignored Hamza's warnings and continued to challenge the Imam.

Ad-Darazi's army was around 200,000 men while the Unity movement that started in the Choufe Mountains of Lebanon and the Houran Mountains of Syria had less than 10,000 men. The two sides met in battle north of Jerusalem. Ad-Darazi army was destroyed and he was captured. As a result of the victory, the Unity movement was called at that time the movement that destroyed the army of the Darazi.\n\nAfter the battle, Ad-Darazi was converted to be one of the early preachers of the Unity faith (which became known as the Druze faith). At that time, the movement enlisted a large number of adherents.<ref name=\"olive\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=kY0oedX32BwC&pg=PA128&dq=Hamza+bin+Ali+druze&ei=hxV-SLTaB4KijgHJvKXtDw&sig=ACfU3U3Joonyh4sX6X3A6xx9ngHmddJ59w#PPA127,M1 The Olive and the Tree: The Secret Strength of the Druze By Dr Ruth Westheimer and Gil Sedan]</ref> However, he was later considered a renegade <ref name=\"druze\">[http://www.druze.ca/AboutDruze.html About the Faith of the Mo\u2019wa\u2019he\u2019doon Druze by Moustafa F.

The territorial governor, [[Alexander Ramsey]], and [[Commissioner of Indian Affairs]], Luke Lea, instigated the treaty to gain concessions of the rich agricultural lands in [[Minnesota]] for European-American settlers. The Sioux ceded large tracts of land, from [[Iowa]] north to the Canada\u2013US border. Some bands, such as the Sisseton and Wahpeton, were hesitant to give up so much, yet reluctantly did so; the federal government had shown during the 1825 [[Black Hawk War]] a willingness to fight when the Indian parties were hesitant to negotiate.\n\nIncluded in the treaty stipulations was a monetary amount of $1,665,000 in cash and annuities, with reservations to be established at the Upper Agency near [[Granite Falls, Minnesota]] and another at the Lower Agency near [[Redwood Falls, Minnesota]], stretching from 20 miles in width to about 70 miles in length. The Upper Sioux had territory that contained some of their old villages and was more familiar in term of hunting and fishing. The Lower Agency location required the displacement of many Sioux from their traditional woodland areas and did not satisfy them. At the last minute, the government attached a \"traders-paper\" rider, which allocated $400,000 of the annuities to traders who had claims against the Indians and mixed bloods who would not otherwise share in the benefits, but suffered discrimination in much European-American society.\n\nBy 1858 Dakota leaders went to [[Washington D.C.]] to sign two more treaties, ceding the reservation north of the [[Minnesota River]] (whose boundaries had never been approved by the US Congress). The influx of white settlers, the desire for more land by the federal government, along with its failure to pay the total of the promised annuities, the pressure to conform to Christianized ways, loss of hunting and fishing land, and the overall discontent of the Dakota bands would be the catalysts leading to the plains [[Indian Wars]], which spanned the next 30 years.\n\n==Dakota War of 1862==\nIn August 1862 the unrest among eastern [[Santee Dakota|Santee]] bands came to a climax with open combat against settlers in what would be called [[Dakota War of 1862]], the [[Dakota Conflict]] or [[Sioux Uprising]]. On August 4, 1862 the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands were able to obtain food and supplies from the Indian agency; however, on the 17th the [[Mdewakanton]] and [[Wahpekute]] bands were denied. The US Indian Agent and [[Minnesota]] State Senator [[Thomas J. Galbraith]] refused to distribute supplies without having received payment from the Sioux. At a summit to resolve the matter, Dakota leaders asked trader [[Andrew Myrick]] to back their cause. His answer to them was reportedly insulting.\n\nHis statement outraged the Dakota people. The day before, August 16, annuity monies arrived at [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] for distribution and were sent to [[Fort Ridgely]] on the 17th, but by then it was too late. Historians note actions by four Dakota ''aki-ci-ta'' (warriors) at a settlement at [[Acton Township, Meeker County, Minnesota|Acton]], [[Meeker County]], as the beginning of the conflict. A young ''aki-ci-ta'' reportedly stole eggs from a settler, leading to a confrontation in which five white men were killed. Soon violent conflicts erupted elsewhere around the region. Initially the Dakota had victories at the [[Battle of Redwood Ferry]], their assault on [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]], and the [[Battle of Birch Coulee]], as well as minor losses at the [[Battle of Fort Ridgely]], where the European-Americans incurred heavy losses in their victory there.\n\nSisseton-Wahpeton bands did not participate in the killing of settler families that defined the early conflicts. A majority of the 4,000 members of the two northern tribes, were opposed to the fighting. A large number of Sissetons and Wahpetons had been converted both to farming and Christianity, and had both moral objections and strong reasons of self-interest for keeping peace with the whites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/dakota/Dak_account.html|title=The Dakota Conflict (Sioux Uprsing) Trials of 1862|last=Linder|first=Douglas|website=law2.umkc.edu|accessdate=2016-12-26}}</ref>\n\nDakota ''aki-ci-ta'' laid siege to [[Fort Abercrombie]] for six weeks and disrupted supply lines and shipping from the north and [[Canada]], as well as couriers heading to [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] and [[Fort Snelling]]. Large-scale combat ended on September 26, 1862 when six companies of Minnesota militia and an artillery unit attacked Dakota positions at the [[Battle of Wood Lake]]. Three days later, Dakota forces surrendered at [[Camp Release]], where 269 POWs were released to the troops there led by Col. [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry Sibley]]. Small-scale skirmishes continued in the following weeks. Historians estimate total casualties at 800 to more than 1,000 civilians and military, but the exact numbers have never been determined.\n\nIn the wake of the war, the Dakota were severely punished: a US military court convicted 303 men of war crimes and sentenced them to death. Of the 303, the Army hanged 38 men the day after [[Christmas]], in the largest mass execution in [[United States]] history. Efforts were undertaken to revoke the treaties, abolish the reservation, and expel remaining Dakota people from Minnesota entirely. Bounties of $25 were put on any Dakota found within the boundaries, with the exception of 208 families of Mdewakanton, who were considered \"friendly\". Soon after, additional conflicts in what were known as the [[Indian Wars]] broke out to the south and west, ending finally with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890 and the defeat of the Sioux.\n\nIn 1866, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], then supervising the Indian agents and reservations appointed [[Gabriel Renville]] 1824\u20131892, chief scout for General Sibley, as head chief of the Sisseton-Wahpeton bands.

On August 4, 1862 the Sisseton and Wahpeton bands were able to obtain food and supplies from the Indian agency; however, on the 17th the [[Mdewakanton]] and [[Wahpekute]] bands were denied. The US Indian Agent and [[Minnesota]] State Senator [[Thomas J. Galbraith]] refused to distribute supplies without having received payment from the Sioux. At a summit to resolve the matter, Dakota leaders asked trader [[Andrew Myrick]] to back their cause. His answer to them was reportedly insulting.\n\nHis statement outraged the Dakota people. The day before, August 16, annuity monies arrived at [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] for distribution and were sent to [[Fort Ridgely]] on the 17th, but by then it was too late. Historians note actions by four Dakota ''aki-ci-ta'' (warriors) at a settlement at [[Acton Township, Meeker County, Minnesota|Acton]], [[Meeker County]], as the beginning of the conflict. A young ''aki-ci-ta'' reportedly stole eggs from a settler, leading to a confrontation in which five white men were killed. Soon violent conflicts erupted elsewhere around the region. Initially the Dakota had victories at the [[Battle of Redwood Ferry]], their assault on [[New Ulm, Minnesota|New Ulm]], and the [[Battle of Birch Coulee]], as well as minor losses at the [[Battle of Fort Ridgely]], where the European-Americans incurred heavy losses in their victory there.\n\nSisseton-Wahpeton bands did not participate in the killing of settler families that defined the early conflicts. A majority of the 4,000 members of the two northern tribes, were opposed to the fighting. A large number of Sissetons and Wahpetons had been converted both to farming and Christianity, and had both moral objections and strong reasons of self-interest for keeping peace with the whites.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/dakota/Dak_account.html|title=The Dakota Conflict (Sioux Uprsing) Trials of 1862|last=Linder|first=Douglas|website=law2.umkc.edu|accessdate=2016-12-26}}</ref>\n\nDakota ''aki-ci-ta'' laid siege to [[Fort Abercrombie]] for six weeks and disrupted supply lines and shipping from the north and [[Canada]], as well as couriers heading to [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]] and [[Fort Snelling]]. Large-scale combat ended on September 26, 1862 when six companies of Minnesota militia and an artillery unit attacked Dakota positions at the [[Battle of Wood Lake]]. Three days later, Dakota forces surrendered at [[Camp Release]], where 269 POWs were released to the troops there led by Col. [[Henry Hastings Sibley|Henry Sibley]]. Small-scale skirmishes continued in the following weeks. Historians estimate total casualties at 800 to more than 1,000 civilians and military, but the exact numbers have never been determined.\n\nIn the wake of the war, the Dakota were severely punished: a US military court convicted 303 men of war crimes and sentenced them to death. Of the 303, the Army hanged 38 men the day after [[Christmas]], in the largest mass execution in [[United States]] history. Efforts were undertaken to revoke the treaties, abolish the reservation, and expel remaining Dakota people from Minnesota entirely. Bounties of $25 were put on any Dakota found within the boundaries, with the exception of 208 families of Mdewakanton, who were considered \"friendly\". Soon after, additional conflicts in what were known as the [[Indian Wars]] broke out to the south and west, ending finally with the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]] in 1890 and the defeat of the Sioux.\n\nIn 1866, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]], then supervising the Indian agents and reservations appointed [[Gabriel Renville]] 1824\u20131892, chief scout for General Sibley, as head chief of the Sisseton-Wahpeton bands.

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \\Lambda_{ij}, U_0,  t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD)<ref>Vysotsky, M.

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus<ref>A.

This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in [[statistical thermodynamics]] has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy ''E'' over ''N'' identical systems.\n[[Carath\u00e9odory]] linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn 1865, Clausius named the concept of {{mvar|S}}, \"the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system,\" ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) after the Greek word for 'transformation'.<ref name=Gil399>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |authorlink1=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill |url-access=registration |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |p=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill/page/399 399]}}</ref>  He gives \"transformational content\" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" ({{lang|de|W\u00e4rme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of the word ''energy'', as he found the concepts nearly \"analogous in their physical significance.\"<ref name=Gil399/> This term was formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} ('work') by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae]]}} ('transformation').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene f\u00fcr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant.

For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \\Lambda_{ij}, U_0,  t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S.

The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD)<ref>Vysotsky, M.

This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus<ref>A.

This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems.
