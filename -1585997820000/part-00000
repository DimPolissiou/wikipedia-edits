A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to certain subunits of the virus. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the [[ACE2 enzyme]] receptor.

''Brotherhood of the Bat'' features a future in which Ra's al Ghul discovers the Batcave following [[Bruce Wayne]]'s death, and outfits the League of Assassins in variant Batman costumes based on [[Batman: Knight Gallery|Wayne's rejected designs]]. Talia and Bruce's son join the Brotherhood in his father's costume, to destroy it from within. <ref>''Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat''</ref>\n\nIn ''Kingdom Come'' (1996) by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], which functioned as a possible future to the canon of the time, the child of Batman and Talia is named '''Ibn al Xu'ffasch''', literally \"Son of the Bat\", and a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s inner circle.

He was eventually recruited by [[Rip Hunter]] to try to stop a madman named [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]] from altering his history. He works with several other heroes of his generation \u2013 [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash]], the daughter of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Wally West]]); Nightstar and [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], the son of [[Plastic Man]].\n\nIn ''League of Batmen'' (2001), the sequel to ''Brotherhood of the Bat'', Tallant leads his own team of variant Batmen to combat the plague that was al Ghul's legacy. During the battle, Tallant discovers that his grandfather is the one who murdered his father and then cloned him. Ra's even sent the clone to murder his own daughter. Because the deaths of his parents at Ra's's hands, Tallant has completed following his father's tragic path as Batman. The new Dark Knight desires justice for his parents along with trying to stop his grandfather, while having to battle his father's murderous double.\n\nGrant Morrison's story titled ''Batman and Son'' (2006) expands upon the ''Son of the Demon'' storyline as part of a remodeling of Batman's personality after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In Morrison's version, the child Damian Wayne is the result of a tryst between Batman and Talia, during which the Dark Knight claims he was drugged when they were at the [[Tropic of Cancer]], though Morrison later admitted the claim of drugging was a canonical error on his part. Since then however in issues of the Morrison penned ''Batman Incorporated'', the drugging is reaffirmed and is once again part of Damian's origin.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2 #2 (June 2012)</ref> \n\nThe final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2008) designates the ''Kingdom Come'' alternate universe as Earth-22, thus making the Ibn al Xu'ffasch version part of the [[DC Multiverse]] and Damian Wayne's parallel universe counterpart. ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #22 (2009) reveals that he would eventually marry [[Nightstar (comics)|Nightstar (Mar'i Grayson)]] with whom he would have a daughter and son.\n\n==Fictional Character Biography==\n\n===''Batman and Son''===\n{{Main|Batman and Son}}\n[[File:Proto-Robin (Damian Wayne).png|right|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne in ''Batman'' #658 (December 2006). Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\nDamian's origin is unknown to Batman. Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb, Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]]. He becomes a talented martial artist before his teenage years, at which time Talia reveals Damian's existence to Bruce Wayne and leaves him in Batman's custody in an effort to disrupt Batman's work.\n\nPrecocious, spoiled, and violent, Damian battles [[Tim Drake]], whom he wants to replace as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and sucker punches Tim off the stuffed [[Tyrannosaurus]] in the [[Batcave]] when Tim stops fighting to help him. Damian then escapes, dons a variant Robin costume made of [[Jason Todd]]'s old tunic and mask and assorted League of Assassin gear, and gets into a fight with and decapitates the villainous Spook. Although misguided, Damian seems to genuinely want to aid Bruce's war on crime as he is Bruce's son and wants his approval. Unfortunately, because of how he was raised, Damian lacks any sort of common sense in regards to social behavior, and believes that in order to be accepted by his father, he must kill any rivals, which included Tim Drake. This troubles his relationship with Batman, who vows never to kill. However, because of his possible paternity to Damian, Batman, on some levels, is optimistic by the chance of fatherhood. \n\nEventually, Batman confronts Talia to confirm Damian's true identity, but both Talia and Damian are soon caught in an explosion. They survive the explosion. However, Damian's badly injured body requires transplants of harvested organs, which his mother orders her physicians to carry out. Damian makes a full recovery.<ref>''Batman'' #665</ref>\n\n===''The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul}}\nBeginning in ''Batman Annual #26 (\"Head of the Demon\")'', Talia takes Damian to the Australian [[Outback]], where he is tutored in the secret history of his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. Talia is unaware that a former servant of Ra's, named White Ghost, plans to use Damian as a shell for the soul of Ra's to return to Earth. This process would, of course, kill Damian. Talia is able to save her son from his fate at the last minute.\n\nRa's is still able to return, but as a rotting, shambling undead corpse, still needing Damian to stabilize his form. Damian flees to alert Batman, but is pursued by his evil grandfather. Upon entering [[Wayne Manor]], Damian attempts to relay to ([[Tim Drake]]) the fact that Ra's has returned. Tim, suspicious of Damian's intentions, does not believe his story and begins a fist fight. Damian flees and encounters Alfred. Before he can effectively relay his news, he is attacked by Tim, who perceives Damian's attempt to help a tripping Alfred as an attack, and renews their battle. As they fight, members of the League of Assassins approach the manor with the intention of killing all others within and bringing Damian back to Ra's alive. Damian and Tim fight side-by-side against Ra's and his minions. Their collaboration is hindered by their very different philosophies of battle. Damian is willing to betray Tim at any moment for his own safety. Ra's captures the two and tells Batman that he will use one of them for his own body. Batman offers his own body instead.\n\nRa's refuses the offer, feeling that he needs someone of a younger age. The choices are Tim or Damian. Batman offers a third alternative: \"Fountain of Essence\" which contains the qualities of a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Batman and Ra's go in search of the fountain, leaving Tim, Damian, [[Nightwing]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Talia to battle the [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]]. Damian leaves his mother and Tim to an unknown fate, while he goes off to be with his father. He ends up captured by Ra's and nearly loses his life. Batman and the others manage to save him, and Talia takes her son and escapes.\n\nA subsequent conversation between Tim and Alfred implies that Batman has carried out a DNA test on Damian. Alfred says Bruce intended to tell him the results when the time was right. At this, Tim realizes that Damian is indeed Bruce's son, and exclaims \"The son of Satan is my brother?\"<ref>\"Did he do a paternity test on Damian? You know, like a DNA test... He had to, right? Alfred? -Tim Drake \"He insisted he would tell you the results himself when the time was right.\" -Alfred \"So you know. You both know and nobody is going to tell me?\" -Tim Drake \"It's not my place to say, young sir. Forgive me.\" -Alfred \"The son of Satan is my brother?\" -Tim Drake. Dialogue post-midway through comic book (\"son of Satan\" likely in reference to ''The Omen'' franchise). \"Morrison, Grant. ''Batman #676''. DC Comics, Inc., 2008</ref>\n\n===''Batman R.I.P.''===\n{{Main|Batman R.I.P.}}\nPrior to the start of Grant Morrison's \"[[Batman R.I.P.]]\" story arc in ''Batman'' #675, Damian senses that someone is out to get Batman. In response to this, Talia begins formulating a plan involving Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], whom Talia and Damian rescue from a booby-trapped Wayne Manor while in search of Batman, who is insane and has gone missing.\n\nDamian and Alfred race to aid Batman against the Black Glove in a commandeered [[Batmobile]]. Damian, who is driving, knocks an ambulance off a bridge without any sign of remorse or even concern. When Alfred reprimands him, Damian retorts with a backhanded threat. The only occupant of the ambulance was the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\n\n===''Battle for the Cowl''===\n{{Main|Batman: Battle for the Cowl}}\nIn ''Nightwing'' #153 (2009), Damian is shown being left in the care of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and trained by [[Dick Grayson]] (alias Nightwing).\n\nUpon the start of ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'', it appears that Damian is now residing in Gotham, and living under the command of Nightwing (to an extent). Where before Damian portrayed an arrogant and vicious personality, it appears the \"death\" of his father has regressed him to a more childlike mindset, as demonstrated when he takes the Batmobile joy-riding with an older girl. This is discovered by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], who ejects the girl and takes control of the Batmobile, intent on taking Damian home. The car is blindsided by [[Killer Croc]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who prepare to kill Damian. The older girl (Damian's companion) is later eaten by Killer Croc.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1 (2009)</ref> Damian is saved by Nightwing who ends up being cornered by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s men, until a murderous figure appears stating that he is Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd). Although shot by Todd, Damian recovers and saves Tim Drake from falling to death inside Jason's Batcave.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #2 (2009)</ref> When Grayson hangs up his Nightwing mantle to become the newest Batman, he chooses Damian to assume the mantle of Robin by his side.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''Batman: Reborn''===\n{{Main|Batman: Reborn}}\nDespite becoming Robin to Grayson's Batman, Damian reveals that he cares little for his older brother and has no respect for him as Batman and that the latter would have to earn it. In an act of defiance, Damian decides to make the Robin mantle independent from that of Batman and decides to stop [[Doctor Phosphorus|Dr. Phosphorus]] from breaking into [[Project Cadmus]], but fails miserably and is saved by Dick. Dick then begins to train Damian as to how to properly become the new Robin and the two develop their own unique crime fighting style. Damian then begins to mock Tim Drake for not being chosen as Robin, causing Tim to severely beat Damian, only to be stopped by Dick.\n\nAfter Tim leaves, Damian starts engaging in chess games with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], visiting him secretly against Dick's orders. When Elliot asked why Damian is visiting him behind the Bat-family's back, Damian shrugs it off as a desire to keep Elliot company. Elliot surmises that Damian is rather using the resemblance to Bruce to \"spend time with [his] old man\". Dick and Damian then encounter a villain called [[Professor Pyg]], who has created an army called Dollotrons. Dick and Damian take the entire army down and begin to form a brotherly relationship. Damian blames himself for being unable to save a single Dollotron, a girl named Sasha, but unbeknownst to him, the girl is taken in by Jason Todd, who had shot Damian,<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol.3 #3 (2009)</ref> thereby becoming the new Robin's opposite number in Red Hood's no-holds-barred war against crime (Red Hood's maxim is \"let the punishment fit the crime\").<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #4 (2009)</ref>\n\nDamian and Dick then attack Firefly, who is attempting to kill Black Mask. Victor Zsasz defeats Robin and rescues Black Mask while Dick takes down Firefly. These events cause Hush to escape, causing Damian to grow a further hatred for the criminal. Damian is present when Dick is inducted into the JLA, upon hearing, Damian demands to be inducted along with Dick, but his demands are promptly ignored. Damian is once again saved by Dick, with the assistance of Azrael, after a man named Amon tries to sacrifice him. Sasha, now dubbed Scarlet by Todd, returns and attacks Robin, as Jason attacks Dick, the two duos battle it out until the arrival of the Flamingo, who temporarily paralyzes Damian. Talia fixes Damian's spine, but puts in a monitor connected to his brain allowing her to control his every movement.\n\nAs Dick and Damian go through various events together, such as against the Black Mask, the Blackest Night and a rogue Batman clone-corpse, the two bond even more, prompting Talia to give over control of the monitor to [[Deathstroke]] who tries to use it to kill Dick. Working together, Dick and Damian manage to stop Deathstroke. As Dick cares little for the financial problems of Wayne Enterprises, despite inheriting it from Bruce along with Tim, Damian decides to involve himself and manages to impress the board of directors. While he does not file a lawsuit against Dick, due to Grayson not being named the heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]], but rather a high-ranking member, he does against Tim, who was named the heir to Wayne Enterprises.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #10 (March 2010)</ref>\n\n===''Red Robin''===\nDamian's second year as Robin begins with a bang, as he chooses this time to pick a fight against his predecessor [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Tim, who has been keeping a list of criminals and tasks he calls the Hit List, attracts Damian's fury when he hacks the Hit List and discovers a hidden layer of allies to the Bat-Family considered potential threats by Tim. Damian finds himself on this list. During a stakeout mission, Damian slices off Tim's line, causing him to fall from a great height. He survives, and Tim pulls Damian into an all-out brawl that begins with their quarry escaping, and ending in front of the theater where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. The two are stopped by [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], who chastises them both for fighting in front of the theater where Batman was born. The two then enter into a grudging truce for the remainder of Damian's appearances in the series. Dick suggests changing the Hit List password to [[Cousin Oliver#Notable Recurring characters|Cousin Oliver]], as Damian has little to no interest in pop culture references and would never guess it. Dick noted that his name is not on the list and Tim asserts it's because Dick is the only one who Tim trusts implicitly.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nAfter Bruce's skull was taken from his grave, Damian and Dick decide to bring the rest of his skeleton, along with those of Damian's paternal grandparents, to their base beneath Wayne Tower. Damian is quite shaken by the sight of the bones of his family. On the way to the cave, Dick's body is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], at whom Damian lashes out in confusion. Deadman then possesses and leaves Damian's body, subsequently passing his knowledge of the attack of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] onto him. The two heroes then prepare for the Black Lanterns' assault on Gotham.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (August 2009)</ref> After raiding the Army Reserve National Guard Armory, Dick, Damian, and the arriving Tim Drake, are able to save Commissioner Gordon, Oracle, and the surviving police officers at Gotham Central from the reanimated versions of the original Dark Knight's deceased rogues gallery members. However, they then find themselves in a horrific encounter with the parents of Dick Grayson and Tim Drake reanimated as Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #2 (November 2009)</ref> Dick and Tim send Damian with the Gordons to their underground base while they battle the Black Lanterns. Dick eventually orders Damian through their comm-links to send one of his Wingers with [[Mr. Freeze]]'s gun. Grayson uses the weapon to cryogenically suspend himself and Tim, forcing the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life of them. Deadman later revives the former Boy Wonders.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===Return of Bruce Wayne===\nTalia begins to clone Damian as she realizes that her son has completely sided with Dick Grayson and the Bat-Family. Damian finally stands up for his Robin mantle, telling Talia that being Robin was the best thing that he had ever done, and Talia does not need to save him from something he chooses to be. Talia then shows Damian a cloned version of himself, whom she sees as Damian's younger brother. Talia admits to Damian, that even though she loves him, she is too much of a perfectionist to admire him for choosing a path that defies her this blatantly, and he is therefore no longer welcome, and will be considered an enemy of the House of al Ghul. Damian defiantly replies that he hopes to be a worthy one. Damian (as Robin) is then seen teaming up with Dick and Alfred to begin their own search for Bruce Wayne.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #12 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring a confrontation with a returned minor villain the Getaway Genius, Damian is initially angry that Grayson failed to capture the foe \u2013 as well as the implication that his father failed as well during the Genius' original run back when Grayson was Robin \u2013 but when Dick explains to him that Bruce let the Genius go because he discovered that the Genius' robberies were only him stealing medicines that he needed so that he could live long enough to see his daughter grow up, Damian realises that he never really knew his father as a person, and admits that there was more to him than Batman.<ref>''Batman'' #703</ref>\n\nAfter Grayson's confidant Oberon Sexton is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise, Damian tortures the villain by savagely beating him with a crowbar in order to get information, considering it to be self-defense since the Joker planned to attack him.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #13 (2010)</ref> However, the Clown Prince of Crime's apparent helplessness is revealed to be another ruse and he incapacitates Damian with his hidden Joker venom. The villain intends to use Damian and Dick in his fight against their common enemies: the Black Glove. Help arrives in the form of the original Batman. After Bruce Wayne helps Dick and Damian defeat the Black Glove and the Joker, Wayne accepts his son in addition to his role as Robin.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #16 (November 2010)</ref> Despite Bruce's parental responsibilities to Damian, he decides that he prefers Damian to continue working with Dick (who maintains the Batman mantle and whom Bruce sees as a positive role model for his son) rather than being with himself primarily, due to his plans with ''[[Batman Incorporated|Batman Inc.]]''<ref>''Batman: The Return'' one-shot (Jan. 2011)</ref>\n\n===Teen Titans===\nDamian joins the Teen Titans when Dick Grayson concludes that the team needs a Robin, while also feeling that Damian would benefit from the friendship of other heroes, having progressed to the point where he can be trusted not to kill if left 'unsupervised'.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #88</ref> Although Wonder Girl objects to this decision, Grayson convinces her to let Damian stay on the team as he needs Damian to learn that he can trust others not to betray him, only for his temper to jeopardize his first mission with the team when he attacks an opponent just after [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] had convinced him to calm down, provoking their new foe into starting his wave of destruction again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #89</ref> Robin eventually begins to develop a friendship with [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who initially reaches out to Damian due to their similar upbringings (Ravager's father being the notorious assassin, [[Deathstroke]]).<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #91</ref> Tim Drake eventually comes to the Titans for help after a robotic duplicate of [[Calculator (comics)|the Calculator]] attempts to murder his close friend, [[Tamara Fox|Tam Fox]], and decides to rejoin the team once the mission is completed. Damian chooses to leave the team upon Drake's return, reasoning that the Teen Titans do not need two Robins, and realizing that his teammates prefer to work with Tim. Upon returning to Gotham, Damian tells Dick that even though he had been brought to the Titans in order to find friends, he did not need to, as he already had one, Grayson himself.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #92</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cassandra Cain|Blackbat]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]'s predecessor, returns to Gotham, she and Damian are partnered together during a stake-out to catch the Architect, a new villain obsessed with destroying Gotham landmarks. Damian berates Blackbat and mocks her for being sent to Hong Kong by his father, but she ultimately saves his life by rescuing him from the exploding [[Iceberg Lounge]].<ref>''Batman: Gates of Gotham''</ref> Afterwards, the two work together to stop the bomber from destroying a massive bridge, saving dozens of lives in the process.<ref>''Batman: Gates of Gotham'' #2</ref>\n\nRobin and a group of other ex-Titans later head to [[Titans Tower]] to help the team during a battle against [[Superboy-Prime]] and the [[Legion of Doom]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #99</ref> During the battle, Robin destroys one of Prime's evil [[Match (DC Comics)|Superboy doppelg\u00e4ngers]] by using a [[Kryptonite]] blade.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #100</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n[[File:Damian-Wayne-BRv25.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #5 (March 2012). Art by Patrick Gleason.]]\nFollowing the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" story arc, Bruce Wayne was returned by writers as being the only [[Batman]] in 2011's [[the New 52]] relaunch of DC Comics. [[Dick Grayson]] was returned to his previous role as [[Nightwing]], and Damian still serves as his father's vigilante partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. After reading the letter written by his father from an alternate timeline, the Dark Knight decides that it is time to take steps to put his past behind him. He tries to teach Damian the same values his parents have instilled within him as he finally assumes his role as a father.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)</ref> However, despite Bruce's attempts to build a relationship with his son, Damian remains distant from his father, which Alfred worries about. Although this relationship is further strained when Damian seemingly leaves Wayne Manor to join the villain [[Morgan Ducard|Nobody]], it turns out this was a ruse by Damian to bring down Nobody. Although Damian eventually kills Nobody in front of Bruce, they are able to work through the incident by beginning to actively understand and respect one another as father and son. Bruce goes so far as to conceal the event from Dick and Tim, leading Alfred to comment to Bruce that he has become \"quite the overprotective parent\".\n\nIn Batman-related issues of the New 52 taking place after Batman issue #14 ([[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]'s return to comics), Damian was portrayed as being very interested in fighting his father's arch foe. He seemed to always be eager to take on the Joker, and repeatedly assumes that bad things happening in Gotham are related to the Joker in some way, in hopeful anticipation of an encounter with him. In ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #15, Damian defies his father's orders to remain in the [[Batcave]] and investigates Alfred's kidnapping. The investigation leads to Gotham Zoo where Damian is captured by Joker. Joker accuses Damian and the other members of Batman's family of being a burden that prevents Batman from being the best foe for Joker. Joker tells Damian that his and Batman's greatest fear is being responsible for the other's death. Joker then presents Damian with Batman in Joker makeup, and states that Damian must kill Batman before Batman kills him.{{sfn|Tomasi|February 2013}} Unwilling to kill his father, Damian chooses death, but the Joker kills Batman before he can deal a fatal blow. Damian passes out from [[Joker venom]] and Batman is revealed to be a fake; as Damian recovers from the toxin, the Joker presents him with a cloche. The Joker is eventually defeated by Batman, but the trust between Batman and the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] is shattered.\n\nDuring the \"Leviathan\" story arc, when his mother Talia puts a price on his head and is targeted by the most dangerous and skilled assassins, Bruce faked Damian's death and secluded him in the Batcave in order to protect him while he goes undercover to confront Talia and her minions. But against his father's wishes he escapes, donning a new costume under the name of Redbird.<ref>''Batman: Incorporated'' #3 (September 2012)</ref>\n\nAlong with the mysterious Wingman and most of the Bat-family, Damian manages to rescue his father and defeat most of the League of Shadows. However, Batman explains that the temporary defeat of the League will not stop a larger force to attack later and destroy the city, so he came to the extreme decision that the only solution possible is for Damian to return to his mother, a decision that caused an emotional reaction on Damian like never before.\n\n====Death====\nDamian is killed battling a brutal enemy, the Heretic (an adult Damian clone) in issue number 8 of the second volume of the ''[[Batman, Inc.]]'' comic book, which went on sale February 27, 2013. According to the story's writer, [[Grant Morrison]]: \"He saves the world. He does his job as Robin. He dies an absolute hero\".<ref>{{cite web|title=DC killing off Batman's 'Boy Wonder' Damian Wayne in new comic book|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/holy_hit_job_robin_eats_it_kZ9EWvYlw10mf4wS324GhN|work=New York Post|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Batman's side-kick Robin to be killed off in next DC Comics issue|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57571321/batmans-side-kick-robin-to-be-killed-off-in-next-dc-comics-issue/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the comic, Damian is fighting hordes of [[Leviathan (DC Comics)|Leviathan]] henchmen in the lobby of Wayne Tower when Nightwing comes to rescue him. Behind cover, the two briefly reminisce about their time together as Batman and Robin before resuming the defense. When the Heretic arrives and knocks Nightwing out, Damian bravely fights him. However, the Heretic eventually gains the upper hand and impales Damian through the chest, the sword piercing Damian's heart and resulting in Damian dying almost instantly. Minutes after Damian's death, Batman arrives and sees Damian's dead body. Angered, he and a revived Nightwing battle the Heretic, but are eventually forced to retreat with Red Robin, and Damian's body. After holding a private funeral for the fallen Boy Wonder, Bruce vows to avenge his son's death.\n\nThe later storyline, ''Requiem'', deals with the aftermath of Damian's death and Batman's thirst for revenge against Talia as well as his own increasingly unbalanced mental state resulting from this loss. He is buried next to Bruce Wayne's parents, Damian's paternal grandparents. Batman is also unwilling to accept his son's death, and begins seeking the means to resurrect Damian at the cost of his relationships with his friends and allies, and keeps his death a secret from public in anticipation that his resurrection would succeed.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #19 (April 2013)</ref><ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #20 (May 2013)</ref> Damian's absence has also been causing a conflict between his father and his acting instructor, [[Carrie Kelley]], who is determined to find out what has happened to him, leading her to realize that the Waynes are harboring a secret.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #19 (April 2013)</ref>\n\nWhen Batman and Nightwing finally re-confront Heretic, they overpower him, and the clone suffers a brutal beating from both in retaliation for Damian's death. Batman, despite desiring to kill his son's murderer more than anything and Nightwing making no attempts of stopping his mentor, spares the villain's life after seeing his resemblance to Damian, realizing the clone is what is left of his son. However, Talia later kills the Heretic for his failure to kill Batman, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #12 (July 2013)</ref> But Talia is killed following the duel by [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Webb]], and it is later revealed that Damian's body was stolen from the Manor cemetery by the League of Assassins along with Talia's for plans against Batman in addition to make their resurrections. It has also been shown that Ra's al Ghul has begun to engineer more clones of Damian.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #13 (August 2013)</ref>\n\n====Road to Resurrection====\nAfter being preoccupied with a series of cases in Gotham, Batman begins his attempt to reclaim Damian's body despite Ra's claim that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and grandson. Batman continues his pursuit out of his distrust towards Ra's. After defeating Damian's half-aquatic clones with [[Aquaman]], Batman seeks [[Wonder Woman]]'s help in chasing Ra's to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].<ref>''Batman and Aquaman'' vol. 2 #29 (March 2014)</ref> Though Ra's attempts to resurrect Damian alongside Talia in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island in addition to brainwash his grandson into joining him afterwards, instead Ra's discovers that it is a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterwards.<ref>''Batman and Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #30 (April 2014)</ref>\n\nAfter Batman and [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] locate Ra's and the bodies, they are too late as Ra's has successfully had them placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread of Damian's fate.<ref>''Batman and Frankenstein'' vol. 2 #31 (May 2014)</ref> The resurrections fail, leaving Ra's to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret allowing Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra's in combat, Batman reclaims Damian's body and threatens his son's maternal grandfather that if he steals his son's body again, he will kill him in retaliation. They later encounter [[Darkseid]]'s elite member [[Glorious Godfrey]], setting in motion the ''Robin Rises'' story arc.<ref>''Batman and Ra's al Ghul'' vol. 2 #32 (June 2014)</ref>\n\n====Return====\nLater, Godfrey's reason for coming to Earth is revealed; to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian. After detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside Damian's body, Godfrey escapes with Damian's corpse back to Apokolips, despite assistance from the Justice League. Angered, Batman once again vows to retrieve his son's corpse.<ref>''Robin Rises: Omega'' one-shot (July 2014)</ref>\n\nBatman enters and accesses the Justice League Watchtower to use his unstable exosuit known as the Hellbat armor designed by Batman himself and the Justice League members to engage large scale threats.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #33 (July 2014)</ref> He then activates the Boom Tube to Darkseid's homeworld, Apokolips, to retrieve Damian's corpse.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #34 (August 2014)</ref> Batman successfully retrieves his son's corpse as he and his family team return to Earth via the Boom Tube directly to the Batcave after successfully escaping the clutches of Darkseid and his Parademons. After this, Batman uses the Chaos Shard on his son's corpse, which has been infused with Darkseid\u2019s Omega Sanction. With Batman facing two choices of whether to resurrect Damian or his parents, he chooses his son, granting Damian's true resurrection. As Damian and Batman embrace, Batman collapses from exhaustion.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #37 (December 2014)</ref>\n\nHowever, before the team can celebrate, the Boom Tube used to return to Earth was not closed and Darkseid's son Kalibak arrives and attacks the team. During the fight, Kalibak beats the team nearly to death, when suddenly Damian knocks out Kalibak with a powerful uppercut; discovering that due to the Chaos Shard he has gained superhuman abilities. While Damian fights Kalibak, Batman remotely controls the Batwing and sends it crashing into Kalibak, sending him back through the Boom Tube and then closes the portal. Damian then reunites with his father and his family team. In the aftermath, Damian is tested by Batman on how to control his new power abilities before Damian returns to the role as Robin.<ref>''Robin Rises: Alpha'' one-shot (December 2014)</ref> With help from the Justice League, Batman discovers that Damian's new powers do not last, and he eventually relies on his natural abilities once more.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #40 (March 2015)</ref>\n\n[[File:Damian Wayne Rebirth.png|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in [[DC Rebirth]]; art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, and Lex Sinclair]]\n\n====''Robin: Son of Batman''====\nAfter the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'' that resulted in Bruce Wayne's disappearance, Damian, as Robin, sets out on a globe-spanning journey to forge his own destiny and make amends for all of his wrongdoings in his own series, titled ''Robin: Son of Batman''. Along his journey, he crosses paths with Ra's and Talia al Ghul, Deathstroke, and a new character named Maya Ducard, daughter of the late villain, NoBody. Damian plays a particular role in ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]'' when the Bat-Family is pitted against Mother, a ruthless woman who believes that she can make her 'children' stronger by putting them through intense trauma. Returning to assist his fellow Robins as the crisis reaches its conclusion, Damian helps Dick, Jason and Tim regain confidence in themselves after Mother decimates their initial efforts against her by recalling a conversation he had with Bruce where Bruce noted that he is proud of how all three of the other Robins have different strengths, Bruce wanting his partners to find their own paths rather than blindly follow his own example.<ref>''Batman & Robin Eternal'' #22</ref>\n\nDamian is also a major player in the ''[[Robin War]]'' event, where he, Agent 37 (Dick Grayson), Red Hood, and Red Robin organize a street gang called \"Robins\" to defeat the Court of Owls with reluctant aid from Jim Gordon, who is now Batman. In the climax, the Court manipulates Damian into joining them so they can use him to recruit Agent 37. Dick does join in order to save Damian and end the war. In the aftermath, Robin forms an unlikely partnership with his mother Talia.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAs part of the [[DC Rebirth]], Damian is featured in three titles: ''Teen Titans'', where he becomes the team's leader in order to defeat Ra's al Ghul and succeed Red Robin (Tim Drake) as leader, ''Super Sons'', co-starring with [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jon Kent]], the son of Superman and the new Superboy and ''Nightwing'', where he will have a supporting role.\n===Teen Titans Rebirth===\nOn his 13th birthday Damian is sent a package by his grandfather Ra's al Ghul, which contains a dead robin. After a meeting with his mother Talia, he discovers that it is a warning from his cousin Mara al Ghul, who has chosen him as her prey as part of an initiation ritual that she must undertake in order to properly join the League of Assassins. Mara has been made leader of a group known as the Demon's Fist, which was originally supposed to be led by Damian, but became hers when he chose to leave the League. They, too, have chosen targets that they must hunt down in order to ascend to the League. Damian decides to collect the other Demon's Fist's targets in order to form the new Teen Titans; this includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], [[Beast Boy]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]].\n\nAfter the events of ''Justice League: No Justice'', the Titans disband. In his subsequent struggle with organized crime in Gotham and a mysterious crime lord known as The Other, Damian assembles a new team of Titans, consisting of Kid Flash (the only old team member to join), Kid Flash's friend and kid genius Roundhouse, [[Emiko Queen|Red Arrow]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo's]] daughter Crush, and the immortal [[Jinn|spirit creature]] Djinn.<ref>''Teen Titans Special'' #1 (2018), ''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> This new team faces initial difficulties because of Red Arrow's criticism and the individualistic tendencies of several members. During a case in which [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] nearly detonates a nuclear device, Robin uses the ring to which Djinn is bound to grant her the use of her full powers to avert the crisis, and returns it afterwards, refusing to assume mastery over her. This earns him Djinn's trust, which gradually begins to turn into a mutual romantic attraction.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #21 (August 2018)</ref> However, what Damian does not tell his teammates is that a deep cellar of the Titans' headquarters, a former juvenile detention facility, serves him as a secret dungeon to lock away the most dangerous criminals he captures for good, including [[Deathstroke]], Gizmo, [[Brother Blood]], [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and [[Atomic Skull#Joseph Martin|Atomic Skull]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> \n\nHis teammates are also unaware that he is working with [[Jason Todd]], who goes by the alias Outlaw<ref>Lobdell, Scott (w), Woods, Pete (a), Peteri, Troy (let), Marie Javins, Rob Levin (ed). \"Outlaw, Part One\" ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' 26 (November, 2018), New York: DC Comics</ref>. Due to a miscommunication, Damian can no longer trust him, which ultimately leads them to cut ties.\n\nEventually, Kid Flash discovers the secret prison,<ref>''Teen Titans'' #28 (March 2019)</ref> and Crush, who [[LGBT themes in comics|has fallen for Djinn]], kisses her, showing her the kind of genuine affection which Damian in his grimness never really did.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #29 (April 2019)</ref> When the other Titans find out, and when Red Arrow kills Deathstroke,<ref>''Deathstroke'' #43</ref> conflict erupts within the team until [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], looking for Crush, crashes in.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #30-32 (May-July 2019)</ref> Djinn defeats him by altering his memory, and proceeds to do so with the other criminals Damian captures, giving them new, harmless identities.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #33 (August 2019)</ref>\n\n===Super Sons===\nIn this book Robin is teamed up with Superman's son Jonathan Kent. Together they team and become the Super Sons. In the first volume Damian and Jon team up to defeat Kid Amazo. Kid Amazo was a person affected by the Amazo virus a virus that grants humans powers. They defeat him and Damian decides to train Jon. Batman gives them an underwater base which later gets destroyed. Currently the team is over due to changes made to Jon's character.<ref>Superman #8 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Skills and Abilities==\nHaving been trained by the [[League of Assassins]] since birth, Damian is already an expert in martial arts and in wielding a wide range of weaponry. Despite his age, Damian has taken on and bested trained fighters like Talia Al Ghul, Red Hood (Jason Todd), Red Robin (Tim Drake), and the Joker, amongst others. He was also trained in the disciplines of forensics, acrobatics, criminology, disguise and escapology. Damian is skilled in mimicking voices and speech patterns of others accurately, as he was able to imitate his father's and Tim Drake's voices in order to bypass the Batcave's voice-recognition security systems.<ref name=\"Batman #658\"/> Damian is shown to have highly advanced engineering skills, as he was able to complete his father's plans of building a flying Batmobile, the construction of which Alfred described as \"being an endless source of frustration to Damian's father\". Damian is also a capable businessman despite his young age, being involved with [[Wayne Enterprises]] and its board members. He also has been trained in numerous weapons as shown in the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref>''Batman: Blackest Night'' vol 1 #2</ref> Damian possessed superpowers similar to that of Superman following his resurrection, though this was short-lived. However, he is shown to possess healing abilities and powers in the future.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Robin (Damian Wayne).jpg|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne on the cover of ''Batman and Robin'' #1 (August 2009). Art by J.G. Jones.]]\nAfter stealing [[Jason Todd]]'s Robin tunic and mask from his memorial case, Damian's unofficial appearance as Robin was wearing them over his black and white League of Assassins bodysuit with a grayish hood and cape. He carried a pair of [[brass knuckles]], which he incorporated as part of this costume, and would also carry a sword.\n\nAfter Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian's role as Robin, while a standard Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit was replaced with a black survival suit, the grayish cape with a yellow \"para-cape\" which grants him a [[gliding]] capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more arsenal and gadgetry, a black hood, and flexible green gloves and boots.\n\nAs of age 13, Damian was short for his age and had few other markers of impending puberty, in [[Super-Sons|Super Sons]] it was a running joke that he was frequently mistaken as younger than ten-year-old [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jonathan Kent]].\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\nReferences in current continuity have been made to the future of Bruce and Talia's son.\n\n* In ''[[DC One Million]]'' (1999), written by Grant Morrison, a Batman from the 853rd Century references a Dark Knight's battle with Two-Face-Two, which ''Batman'' #700 (2010) depicts with Damian Wayne.<ref>''Batman'' #700</ref>\n* In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' vol. 3 #18 (2006), when the Teen Titans were transported 10 years into the future, a graveyard full of deceased Batman allies and villains is depicted.

This version is a stark departure from his original counterpart: his father remains [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) but his mother is [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle), bears no intent to kill at all and acts much more like his father and his costume is similar to [[Tim Drake]]'s second Robin costume. Initially portrayed as being reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps, he tells his parents that he does not want them to plot out his own life for him. But after his parents are killed by [[Joker (character)|Joker Jr.]], Damian takes up the Robin mantle and fights alongside [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] (Dick Grayson). Ultimately, the two bring Joker Jr. and the original Joker to justice and save Gotham from a poison gas attack. It shows that Damian goes on to fight the Club of Villains, Flamingo and [[Professor Pyg]]. The episode ends with Dick passing on the Batman mantle to Damian, who is then shown fighting crime with his own child (voiced by Sebastian Bader) as the new Robin. The pair are seen fighting the mutants from ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', a reference which is further established by the new Robin's resemblance to the Robin ([[Carrie Kelley]]) from that comic. It ultimately turns out that the episode's events were part of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s book 'The Knights of Tomorrow'. This episode was based on a comic book story from the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in which Batman was married to [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] with their son [[Alternate versions of Robin|Bruce Wayne Jr.]]<ref>''Batman'' #131</ref>\n* The character is referenced in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!

In \"Finding Mr. Right\", in an effort to improve his reputation, he appears on a talk show and lies that [[Harley Quinn]] agreed to be his arch-enemy. Offended, Harley kidnaps him and dangles him over a tank with [[King Shark]] in it. When he confesses he lied, Harley reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain, humiliating him. King Shark goes berserk when he smells blood and nearly kills him, but his father Batman rescues him. The Joker then kidnaps him and Batman saves him again. Batman comforts him and says he can wait until he is ready for his own nemesis. In the season two premiere, \"New Gotham\", Damian took up the mantle of Batman after he disappeared in the chaos caused by Joker's destruction of Gotham during the season one finale despite not being old enough to do so.\n\n===Film===\n* Damian Wayne has a major role in ''[[Son of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Stuart Allan]].\n* Damian Wayne also appears in ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'' as a sequel to ''Son of Batman'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.\n* Damian Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', a sequel to ''Son of Batman'' and ''Batman vs. Robin'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.

''Brotherhood of the Bat'' features a future in which Ra's al Ghul discovers the Batcave following [[Bruce Wayne]]'s death, and outfits the League of Assassins in variant Batman costumes based on [[Batman: Knight Gallery|Wayne's rejected designs]]. Talia and Bruce's son join the Brotherhood in his father's costume, to destroy it from within. <ref>''Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat''</ref>\n\nIn ''Kingdom Come'' (1996) by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], which functioned as a possible future to the canon of the time, the child of Batman and Talia is named '''Ibn al Xu'ffasch''', literally \"Son of the Bat\", and a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s inner circle.

He was eventually recruited by [[Rip Hunter]] to try to stop a madman named [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]] from altering his history. He works with several other heroes of his generation \u2013 [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash]], the daughter of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Wally West]]); Nightstar and [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], the son of [[Plastic Man]].\n\nIn ''League of Batmen'' (2001), the sequel to ''Brotherhood of the Bat'', Tallant leads his own team of variant Batmen to combat the plague that was al Ghul's legacy. During the battle, Tallant discovers that his grandfather is the one who murdered his father and then cloned him. Ra's even sent the clone to murder his own daughter. Because the deaths of his parents at Ra's's hands, Tallant has completed following his father's tragic path as Batman. The new Dark Knight desires justice for his parents along with trying to stop his grandfather, while having to battle his father's murderous double.\n\nGrant Morrison's story titled ''Batman and Son'' (2006) expands upon the ''Son of the Demon'' storyline as part of a remodeling of Batman's personality after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In Morrison's version, the child Damian Wayne is the result of a tryst between Batman and Talia, during which the Dark Knight claims he was drugged when they were at the [[Tropic of Cancer]], though Morrison later admitted the claim of drugging was a canonical error on his part. Since then however in issues of the Morrison penned ''Batman Incorporated'', the drugging is reaffirmed and is once again part of Damian's origin.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2 #2 (June 2012)</ref> \n\nThe final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2008) designates the ''Kingdom Come'' alternate universe as Earth-22, thus making the Ibn al Xu'ffasch version part of the [[DC Multiverse]] and Damian Wayne's parallel universe counterpart. ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #22 (2009) reveals that he would eventually marry [[Nightstar (comics)|Nightstar (Mar'i Grayson)]] with whom he would have a daughter and son.\n\n==Fictional Character Biography==\n\n===''Batman and Son''===\n{{Main|Batman and Son}}\n[[File:Proto-Robin (Damian Wayne).png|right|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne in ''Batman'' #658 (December 2006). Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\nDamian's origin is unknown to Batman. Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb, Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]]. He becomes a talented martial artist before his teenage years, at which time Talia reveals Damian's existence to Bruce Wayne and leaves him in Batman's custody in an effort to disrupt Batman's work.\n\nPrecocious, spoiled, and violent, Damian battles [[Tim Drake]], whom he wants to replace as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and sucker punches Tim off the stuffed [[Tyrannosaurus]] in the [[Batcave]] when Tim stops fighting to help him. Damian then escapes, dons a variant Robin costume made of [[Jason Todd]]'s old tunic and mask and assorted League of Assassin gear, and gets into a fight with and decapitates the villainous Spook. Although misguided, Damian seems to genuinely want to aid Bruce's war on crime as he is Bruce's son and wants his approval. Unfortunately, because of how he was raised, Damian lacks any sort of common sense in regards to social behavior, and believes that in order to be accepted by his father, he must kill any rivals, which included Tim Drake. This troubles his relationship with Batman, who vows never to kill. However, because of his possible paternity to Damian, Batman, on some levels, is optimistic by the chance of fatherhood. \n\nEventually, Batman confronts Talia to confirm Damian's true identity, but both Talia and Damian are soon caught in an explosion. They survive the explosion. However, Damian's badly injured body requires transplants of harvested organs, which his mother orders her physicians to carry out. Damian makes a full recovery.<ref>''Batman'' #665</ref>\n\n===''The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul}}\nBeginning in ''Batman Annual #26 (\"Head of the Demon\")'', Talia takes Damian to the Australian [[Outback]], where he is tutored in the secret history of his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. Talia is unaware that a former servant of Ra's, named White Ghost, plans to use Damian as a shell for the soul of Ra's to return to Earth. This process would, of course, kill Damian. Talia is able to save her son from his fate at the last minute.\n\nRa's is still able to return, but as a rotting, shambling undead corpse, still needing Damian to stabilize his form. Damian flees to alert Batman, but is pursued by his evil grandfather. Upon entering [[Wayne Manor]], Damian attempts to relay to ([[Tim Drake]]) the fact that Ra's has returned. Tim, suspicious of Damian's intentions, does not believe his story and begins a fist fight. Damian flees and encounters Alfred. Before he can effectively relay his news, he is attacked by Tim, who perceives Damian's attempt to help a tripping Alfred as an attack, and renews their battle. As they fight, members of the League of Assassins approach the manor with the intention of killing all others within and bringing Damian back to Ra's alive. Damian and Tim fight side-by-side against Ra's and his minions. Their collaboration is hindered by their very different philosophies of battle. Damian is willing to betray Tim at any moment for his own safety. Ra's captures the two and tells Batman that he will use one of them for his own body. Batman offers his own body instead.\n\nRa's refuses the offer, feeling that he needs someone of a younger age. The choices are Tim or Damian. Batman offers a third alternative: \"Fountain of Essence\" which contains the qualities of a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Batman and Ra's go in search of the fountain, leaving Tim, Damian, [[Nightwing]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Talia to battle the [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]]. Damian leaves his mother and Tim to an unknown fate, while he goes off to be with his father. He ends up captured by Ra's and nearly loses his life. Batman and the others manage to save him, and Talia takes her son and escapes.\n\nA subsequent conversation between Tim and Alfred implies that Batman has carried out a DNA test on Damian. Alfred says Bruce intended to tell him the results when the time was right. At this, Tim realizes that Damian is indeed Bruce's son, and exclaims \"The son of Satan is my brother?\"<ref>\"Did he do a paternity test on Damian? You know, like a DNA test... He had to, right? Alfred? -Tim Drake \"He insisted he would tell you the results himself when the time was right.\" -Alfred \"So you know. You both know and nobody is going to tell me?\" -Tim Drake \"It's not my place to say, young sir. Forgive me.\" -Alfred \"The son of Satan is my brother?\" -Tim Drake. Dialogue post-midway through comic book (\"son of Satan\" likely in reference to ''The Omen'' franchise). \"Morrison, Grant. ''Batman #676''.

In response to this, Talia begins formulating a plan involving Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], whom Talia and Damian rescue from a booby-trapped Wayne Manor while in search of Batman, who is insane and has gone missing.\n\nDamian and Alfred race to aid Batman against the Black Glove in a commandeered [[Batmobile]]. Damian, who is driving, knocks an ambulance off a bridge without any sign of remorse or even concern. When Alfred reprimands him, Damian retorts with a backhanded threat. The only occupant of the ambulance was the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\n\n===''Battle for the Cowl''===\n{{Main|Batman: Battle for the Cowl}}\nIn ''Nightwing'' #153 (2009), Damian is shown being left in the care of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and trained by [[Dick Grayson]] (alias Nightwing).\n\nUpon the start of ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'', it appears that Damian is now residing in Gotham, and living under the command of Nightwing (to an extent). Where before Damian portrayed an arrogant and vicious personality, it appears the \"death\" of his father has regressed him to a more childlike mindset, as demonstrated when he takes the Batmobile joy-riding with an older girl. This is discovered by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], who ejects the girl and takes control of the Batmobile, intent on taking Damian home.

The older girl (Damian's companion) is later eaten by Killer Croc.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1 (2009)</ref> Damian is saved by Nightwing who ends up being cornered by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s men, until a murderous figure appears stating that he is Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd). Although shot by Todd, Damian recovers and saves Tim Drake from falling to death inside Jason's Batcave.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #2 (2009)</ref> When Grayson hangs up his Nightwing mantle to become the newest Batman, he chooses Damian to assume the mantle of Robin by his side.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''Batman: Reborn''===\n{{Main|Batman: Reborn}}\nDespite becoming Robin to Grayson's Batman, Damian reveals that he cares little for his older brother and has no respect for him as Batman and that the latter would have to earn it. In an act of defiance, Damian decides to make the Robin mantle independent from that of Batman and decides to stop [[Doctor Phosphorus|Dr. Phosphorus]] from breaking into [[Project Cadmus]], but fails miserably and is saved by Dick. Dick then begins to train Damian as to how to properly become the new Robin and the two develop their own unique crime fighting style. Damian then begins to mock Tim Drake for not being chosen as Robin, causing Tim to severely beat Damian, only to be stopped by Dick.\n\nAfter Tim leaves, Damian starts engaging in chess games with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], visiting him secretly against Dick's orders. When Elliot asked why Damian is visiting him behind the Bat-family's back, Damian shrugs it off as a desire to keep Elliot company. Elliot surmises that Damian is rather using the resemblance to Bruce to \"spend time with [his] old man\". Dick and Damian then encounter a villain called [[Professor Pyg]], who has created an army called Dollotrons. Dick and Damian take the entire army down and begin to form a brotherly relationship. Damian blames himself for being unable to save a single Dollotron, a girl named Sasha, but unbeknownst to him, the girl is taken in by Jason Todd, who had shot Damian,<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol.3 #3 (2009)</ref> thereby becoming the new Robin's opposite number in Red Hood's no-holds-barred war against crime (Red Hood's maxim is \"let the punishment fit the crime\").<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #4 (2009)</ref>\n\nDamian and Dick then attack Firefly, who is attempting to kill Black Mask. Victor Zsasz defeats Robin and rescues Black Mask while Dick takes down Firefly. These events cause Hush to escape, causing Damian to grow a further hatred for the criminal. Damian is present when Dick is inducted into the JLA, upon hearing, Damian demands to be inducted along with Dick, but his demands are promptly ignored. Damian is once again saved by Dick, with the assistance of Azrael, after a man named Amon tries to sacrifice him. Sasha, now dubbed Scarlet by Todd, returns and attacks Robin, as Jason attacks Dick, the two duos battle it out until the arrival of the Flamingo, who temporarily paralyzes Damian. Talia fixes Damian's spine, but puts in a monitor connected to his brain allowing her to control his every movement.\n\nAs Dick and Damian go through various events together, such as against the Black Mask, the Blackest Night and a rogue Batman clone-corpse, the two bond even more, prompting Talia to give over control of the monitor to [[Deathstroke]] who tries to use it to kill Dick. Working together, Dick and Damian manage to stop Deathstroke. As Dick cares little for the financial problems of Wayne Enterprises, despite inheriting it from Bruce along with Tim, Damian decides to involve himself and manages to impress the board of directors. While he does not file a lawsuit against Dick, due to Grayson not being named the heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]], but rather a high-ranking member, he does against Tim, who was named the heir to Wayne Enterprises.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #10 (March 2010)</ref>\n\n===''Red Robin''===\nDamian's second year as Robin begins with a bang, as he chooses this time to pick a fight against his predecessor [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Tim, who has been keeping a list of criminals and tasks he calls the Hit List, attracts Damian's fury when he hacks the Hit List and discovers a hidden layer of allies to the Bat-Family considered potential threats by Tim. Damian finds himself on this list. During a stakeout mission, Damian slices off Tim's line, causing him to fall from a great height. He survives, and Tim pulls Damian into an all-out brawl that begins with their quarry escaping, and ending in front of the theater where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. The two are stopped by [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], who chastises them both for fighting in front of the theater where Batman was born. The two then enter into a grudging truce for the remainder of Damian's appearances in the series. Dick suggests changing the Hit List password to [[Cousin Oliver#Notable Recurring characters|Cousin Oliver]], as Damian has little to no interest in pop culture references and would never guess it. Dick noted that his name is not on the list and Tim asserts it's because Dick is the only one who Tim trusts implicitly.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nAfter Bruce's skull was taken from his grave, Damian and Dick decide to bring the rest of his skeleton, along with those of Damian's paternal grandparents, to their base beneath Wayne Tower. Damian is quite shaken by the sight of the bones of his family. On the way to the cave, Dick's body is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], at whom Damian lashes out in confusion. Deadman then possesses and leaves Damian's body, subsequently passing his knowledge of the attack of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] onto him. The two heroes then prepare for the Black Lanterns' assault on Gotham.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (August 2009)</ref> After raiding the Army Reserve National Guard Armory, Dick, Damian, and the arriving Tim Drake, are able to save Commissioner Gordon, Oracle, and the surviving police officers at Gotham Central from the reanimated versions of the original Dark Knight's deceased rogues gallery members. However, they then find themselves in a horrific encounter with the parents of Dick Grayson and Tim Drake reanimated as Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #2 (November 2009)</ref> Dick and Tim send Damian with the Gordons to their underground base while they battle the Black Lanterns.

Grayson uses the weapon to cryogenically suspend himself and Tim, forcing the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life of them. Deadman later revives the former Boy Wonders.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===Return of Bruce Wayne===\nTalia begins to clone Damian as she realizes that her son has completely sided with Dick Grayson and the Bat-Family. Damian finally stands up for his Robin mantle, telling Talia that being Robin was the best thing that he had ever done, and Talia does not need to save him from something he chooses to be. Talia then shows Damian a cloned version of himself, whom she sees as Damian's younger brother. Talia admits to Damian, that even though she loves him, she is too much of a perfectionist to admire him for choosing a path that defies her this blatantly, and he is therefore no longer welcome, and will be considered an enemy of the House of al Ghul. Damian defiantly replies that he hopes to be a worthy one. Damian (as Robin) is then seen teaming up with Dick and Alfred to begin their own search for Bruce Wayne.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #12 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring a confrontation with a returned minor villain the Getaway Genius, Damian is initially angry that Grayson failed to capture the foe \u2013 as well as the implication that his father failed as well during the Genius' original run back when Grayson was Robin \u2013 but when Dick explains to him that Bruce let the Genius go because he discovered that the Genius' robberies were only him stealing medicines that he needed so that he could live long enough to see his daughter grow up, Damian realises that he never really knew his father as a person, and admits that there was more to him than Batman.<ref>''Batman'' #703</ref>\n\nAfter Grayson's confidant Oberon Sexton is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise, Damian tortures the villain by savagely beating him with a crowbar in order to get information, considering it to be self-defense since the Joker planned to attack him.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #13 (2010)</ref> However, the Clown Prince of Crime's apparent helplessness is revealed to be another ruse and he incapacitates Damian with his hidden Joker venom. The villain intends to use Damian and Dick in his fight against their common enemies: the Black Glove. Help arrives in the form of the original Batman. After Bruce Wayne helps Dick and Damian defeat the Black Glove and the Joker, Wayne accepts his son in addition to his role as Robin.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #16 (November 2010)</ref> Despite Bruce's parental responsibilities to Damian, he decides that he prefers Damian to continue working with Dick (who maintains the Batman mantle and whom Bruce sees as a positive role model for his son) rather than being with himself primarily, due to his plans with ''[[Batman Incorporated|Batman Inc.]]''<ref>''Batman: The Return'' one-shot (Jan. 2011)</ref>\n\n===Teen Titans===\nDamian joins the Teen Titans when Dick Grayson concludes that the team needs a Robin, while also feeling that Damian would benefit from the friendship of other heroes, having progressed to the point where he can be trusted not to kill if left 'unsupervised'.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #88</ref> Although Wonder Girl objects to this decision, Grayson convinces her to let Damian stay on the team as he needs Damian to learn that he can trust others not to betray him, only for his temper to jeopardize his first mission with the team when he attacks an opponent just after [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] had convinced him to calm down, provoking their new foe into starting his wave of destruction again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #89</ref> Robin eventually begins to develop a friendship with [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who initially reaches out to Damian due to their similar upbringings (Ravager's father being the notorious assassin, [[Deathstroke]]).<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #91</ref> Tim Drake eventually comes to the Titans for help after a robotic duplicate of [[Calculator (comics)|the Calculator]] attempts to murder his close friend, [[Tamara Fox|Tam Fox]], and decides to rejoin the team once the mission is completed. Damian chooses to leave the team upon Drake's return, reasoning that the Teen Titans do not need two Robins, and realizing that his teammates prefer to work with Tim. Upon returning to Gotham, Damian tells Dick that even though he had been brought to the Titans in order to find friends, he did not need to, as he already had one, Grayson himself.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #92</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cassandra Cain|Blackbat]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]'s predecessor, returns to Gotham, she and Damian are partnered together during a stake-out to catch the Architect, a new villain obsessed with destroying Gotham landmarks.

Art by Patrick Gleason.]]\nFollowing the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" story arc, Bruce Wayne was returned by writers as being the only [[Batman]] in 2011's [[the New 52]] relaunch of DC Comics. [[Dick Grayson]] was returned to his previous role as [[Nightwing]], and Damian still serves as his father's vigilante partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. After reading the letter written by his father from an alternate timeline, the Dark Knight decides that it is time to take steps to put his past behind him. He tries to teach Damian the same values his parents have instilled within him as he finally assumes his role as a father.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)</ref> However, despite Bruce's attempts to build a relationship with his son, Damian remains distant from his father, which Alfred worries about. Although this relationship is further strained when Damian seemingly leaves Wayne Manor to join the villain [[Morgan Ducard|Nobody]], it turns out this was a ruse by Damian to bring down Nobody. Although Damian eventually kills Nobody in front of Bruce, they are able to work through the incident by beginning to actively understand and respect one another as father and son. Bruce goes so far as to conceal the event from Dick and Tim, leading Alfred to comment to Bruce that he has become \"quite the overprotective parent\".\n\nIn Batman-related issues of the New 52 taking place after Batman issue #14 ([[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]'s return to comics), Damian was portrayed as being very interested in fighting his father's arch foe. He seemed to always be eager to take on the Joker, and repeatedly assumes that bad things happening in Gotham are related to the Joker in some way, in hopeful anticipation of an encounter with him. In ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #15, Damian defies his father's orders to remain in the [[Batcave]] and investigates Alfred's kidnapping. The investigation leads to Gotham Zoo where Damian is captured by Joker. Joker accuses Damian and the other members of Batman's family of being a burden that prevents Batman from being the best foe for Joker. Joker tells Damian that his and Batman's greatest fear is being responsible for the other's death. Joker then presents Damian with Batman in Joker makeup, and states that Damian must kill Batman before Batman kills him.{{sfn|Tomasi|February 2013}} Unwilling to kill his father, Damian chooses death, but the Joker kills Batman before he can deal a fatal blow. Damian passes out from [[Joker venom]] and Batman is revealed to be a fake; as Damian recovers from the toxin, the Joker presents him with a cloche. The Joker is eventually defeated by Batman, but the trust between Batman and the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] is shattered.\n\nDuring the \"Leviathan\" story arc, when his mother Talia puts a price on his head and is targeted by the most dangerous and skilled assassins, Bruce faked Damian's death and secluded him in the Batcave in order to protect him while he goes undercover to confront Talia and her minions. But against his father's wishes he escapes, donning a new costume under the name of Redbird.<ref>''Batman: Incorporated'' #3 (September 2012)</ref>\n\nAlong with the mysterious Wingman and most of the Bat-family, Damian manages to rescue his father and defeat most of the League of Shadows. However, Batman explains that the temporary defeat of the League will not stop a larger force to attack later and destroy the city, so he came to the extreme decision that the only solution possible is for Damian to return to his mother, a decision that caused an emotional reaction on Damian like never before.\n\n====Death====\nDamian is killed battling a brutal enemy, the Heretic (an adult Damian clone) in issue number 8 of the second volume of the ''[[Batman, Inc.]]'' comic book, which went on sale February 27, 2013. According to the story's writer, [[Grant Morrison]]: \"He saves the world. He does his job as Robin.

Behind cover, the two briefly reminisce about their time together as Batman and Robin before resuming the defense. When the Heretic arrives and knocks Nightwing out, Damian bravely fights him. However, the Heretic eventually gains the upper hand and impales Damian through the chest, the sword piercing Damian's heart and resulting in Damian dying almost instantly. Minutes after Damian's death, Batman arrives and sees Damian's dead body. Angered, he and a revived Nightwing battle the Heretic, but are eventually forced to retreat with Red Robin, and Damian's body. After holding a private funeral for the fallen Boy Wonder, Bruce vows to avenge his son's death.\n\nThe later storyline, ''Requiem'', deals with the aftermath of Damian's death and Batman's thirst for revenge against Talia as well as his own increasingly unbalanced mental state resulting from this loss. He is buried next to Bruce Wayne's parents, Damian's paternal grandparents. Batman is also unwilling to accept his son's death, and begins seeking the means to resurrect Damian at the cost of his relationships with his friends and allies, and keeps his death a secret from public in anticipation that his resurrection would succeed.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #19 (April 2013)</ref><ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #20 (May 2013)</ref> Damian's absence has also been causing a conflict between his father and his acting instructor, [[Carrie Kelley]], who is determined to find out what has happened to him, leading her to realize that the Waynes are harboring a secret.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #19 (April 2013)</ref>\n\nWhen Batman and Nightwing finally re-confront Heretic, they overpower him, and the clone suffers a brutal beating from both in retaliation for Damian's death. Batman, despite desiring to kill his son's murderer more than anything and Nightwing making no attempts of stopping his mentor, spares the villain's life after seeing his resemblance to Damian, realizing the clone is what is left of his son. However, Talia later kills the Heretic for his failure to kill Batman, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #12 (July 2013)</ref> But Talia is killed following the duel by [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Webb]], and it is later revealed that Damian's body was stolen from the Manor cemetery by the League of Assassins along with Talia's for plans against Batman in addition to make their resurrections. It has also been shown that Ra's al Ghul has begun to engineer more clones of Damian.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #13 (August 2013)</ref>\n\n====Road to Resurrection====\nAfter being preoccupied with a series of cases in Gotham, Batman begins his attempt to reclaim Damian's body despite Ra's claim that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and grandson. Batman continues his pursuit out of his distrust towards Ra's. After defeating Damian's half-aquatic clones with [[Aquaman]], Batman seeks [[Wonder Woman]]'s help in chasing Ra's to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].<ref>''Batman and Aquaman'' vol. 2 #29 (March 2014)</ref> Though Ra's attempts to resurrect Damian alongside Talia in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island in addition to brainwash his grandson into joining him afterwards, instead Ra's discovers that it is a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterwards.<ref>''Batman and Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #30 (April 2014)</ref>\n\nAfter Batman and [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] locate Ra's and the bodies, they are too late as Ra's has successfully had them placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread of Damian's fate.<ref>''Batman and Frankenstein'' vol. 2 #31 (May 2014)</ref> The resurrections fail, leaving Ra's to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret allowing Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra's in combat, Batman reclaims Damian's body and threatens his son's maternal grandfather that if he steals his son's body again, he will kill him in retaliation. They later encounter [[Darkseid]]'s elite member [[Glorious Godfrey]], setting in motion the ''Robin Rises'' story arc.<ref>''Batman and Ra's al Ghul'' vol. 2 #32 (June 2014)</ref>\n\n====Return====\nLater, Godfrey's reason for coming to Earth is revealed; to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian. After detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside Damian's body, Godfrey escapes with Damian's corpse back to Apokolips, despite assistance from the Justice League. Angered, Batman once again vows to retrieve his son's corpse.<ref>''Robin Rises: Omega'' one-shot (July 2014)</ref>\n\nBatman enters and accesses the Justice League Watchtower to use his unstable exosuit known as the Hellbat armor designed by Batman himself and the Justice League members to engage large scale threats.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #33 (July 2014)</ref> He then activates the Boom Tube to Darkseid's homeworld, Apokolips, to retrieve Damian's corpse.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #34 (August 2014)</ref> Batman successfully retrieves his son's corpse as he and his family team return to Earth via the Boom Tube directly to the Batcave after successfully escaping the clutches of Darkseid and his Parademons. After this, Batman uses the Chaos Shard on his son's corpse, which has been infused with Darkseid\u2019s Omega Sanction. With Batman facing two choices of whether to resurrect Damian or his parents, he chooses his son, granting Damian's true resurrection. As Damian and Batman embrace, Batman collapses from exhaustion.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #37 (December 2014)</ref>\n\nHowever, before the team can celebrate, the Boom Tube used to return to Earth was not closed and Darkseid's son Kalibak arrives and attacks the team. During the fight, Kalibak beats the team nearly to death, when suddenly Damian knocks out Kalibak with a powerful uppercut; discovering that due to the Chaos Shard he has gained superhuman abilities. While Damian fights Kalibak, Batman remotely controls the Batwing and sends it crashing into Kalibak, sending him back through the Boom Tube and then closes the portal. Damian then reunites with his father and his family team. In the aftermath, Damian is tested by Batman on how to control his new power abilities before Damian returns to the role as Robin.<ref>''Robin Rises: Alpha'' one-shot (December 2014)</ref> With help from the Justice League, Batman discovers that Damian's new powers do not last, and he eventually relies on his natural abilities once more.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #40 (March 2015)</ref>\n\n[[File:Damian Wayne Rebirth.png|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in [[DC Rebirth]]; art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, and Lex Sinclair]]\n\n====''Robin: Son of Batman''====\nAfter the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'' that resulted in Bruce Wayne's disappearance, Damian, as Robin, sets out on a globe-spanning journey to forge his own destiny and make amends for all of his wrongdoings in his own series, titled ''Robin: Son of Batman''. Along his journey, he crosses paths with Ra's and Talia al Ghul, Deathstroke, and a new character named Maya Ducard, daughter of the late villain, NoBody. Damian plays a particular role in ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]'' when the Bat-Family is pitted against Mother, a ruthless woman who believes that she can make her 'children' stronger by putting them through intense trauma. Returning to assist his fellow Robins as the crisis reaches its conclusion, Damian helps Dick, Jason and Tim regain confidence in themselves after Mother decimates their initial efforts against her by recalling a conversation he had with Bruce where Bruce noted that he is proud of how all three of the other Robins have different strengths, Bruce wanting his partners to find their own paths rather than blindly follow his own example.<ref>''Batman & Robin Eternal'' #22</ref>\n\nDamian is also a major player in the ''[[Robin War]]'' event, where he, Agent 37 (Dick Grayson), Red Hood, and Red Robin organize a street gang called \"Robins\" to defeat the Court of Owls with reluctant aid from Jim Gordon, who is now Batman. In the climax, the Court manipulates Damian into joining them so they can use him to recruit Agent 37. Dick does join in order to save Damian and end the war. In the aftermath, Robin forms an unlikely partnership with his mother Talia.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAs part of the [[DC Rebirth]], Damian is featured in three titles: ''Teen Titans'', where he becomes the team's leader in order to defeat Ra's al Ghul and succeed Red Robin (Tim Drake) as leader, ''Super Sons'', co-starring with [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jon Kent]], the son of Superman and the new Superboy and ''Nightwing'', where he will have a supporting role.\n===Teen Titans Rebirth===\nOn his 13th birthday Damian is sent a package by his grandfather Ra's al Ghul, which contains a dead robin. After a meeting with his mother Talia, he discovers that it is a warning from his cousin Mara al Ghul, who has chosen him as her prey as part of an initiation ritual that she must undertake in order to properly join the League of Assassins. Mara has been made leader of a group known as the Demon's Fist, which was originally supposed to be led by Damian, but became hers when he chose to leave the League. They, too, have chosen targets that they must hunt down in order to ascend to the League. Damian decides to collect the other Demon's Fist's targets in order to form the new Teen Titans; this includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], [[Beast Boy]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]].\n\nAfter the events of ''Justice League: No Justice'', the Titans disband. In his subsequent struggle with organized crime in Gotham and a mysterious crime lord known as The Other, Damian assembles a new team of Titans, consisting of Kid Flash (the only old team member to join), Kid Flash's friend and kid genius Roundhouse, [[Emiko Queen|Red Arrow]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo's]] daughter Crush, and the immortal [[Jinn|spirit creature]] Djinn.<ref>''Teen Titans Special'' #1 (2018), ''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> This new team faces initial difficulties because of Red Arrow's criticism and the individualistic tendencies of several members. During a case in which [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] nearly detonates a nuclear device, Robin uses the ring to which Djinn is bound to grant her the use of her full powers to avert the crisis, and returns it afterwards, refusing to assume mastery over her. This earns him Djinn's trust, which gradually begins to turn into a mutual romantic attraction.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #21 (August 2018)</ref> However, what Damian does not tell his teammates is that a deep cellar of the Titans' headquarters, a former juvenile detention facility, serves him as a secret dungeon to lock away the most dangerous criminals he captures for good, including [[Deathstroke]], Gizmo, [[Brother Blood]], [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and [[Atomic Skull#Joseph Martin|Atomic Skull]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> \n\nHis teammates are also unaware that he is working with [[Jason Todd]], who goes by the alias Outlaw<ref>Lobdell, Scott (w), Woods, Pete (a), Peteri, Troy (let), Marie Javins, Rob Levin (ed). \"Outlaw, Part One\" ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' 26 (November, 2018), New York: DC Comics</ref>. Due to a miscommunication, Damian can no longer trust him, which ultimately leads them to cut ties.\n\nEventually, Kid Flash discovers the secret prison,<ref>''Teen Titans'' #28 (March 2019)</ref> and Crush, who [[LGBT themes in comics|has fallen for Djinn]], kisses her, showing her the kind of genuine affection which Damian in his grimness never really did.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #29 (April 2019)</ref> When the other Titans find out, and when Red Arrow kills Deathstroke,<ref>''Deathstroke'' #43</ref> conflict erupts within the team until [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], looking for Crush, crashes in.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #30-32 (May-July 2019)</ref> Djinn defeats him by altering his memory, and proceeds to do so with the other criminals Damian captures, giving them new, harmless identities.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #33 (August 2019)</ref>\n\n===Super Sons===\nIn this book Robin is teamed up with Superman's son Jonathan Kent. Together they team and become the Super Sons. In the first volume Damian and Jon team up to defeat Kid Amazo. Kid Amazo was a person affected by the Amazo virus a virus that grants humans powers. They defeat him and Damian decides to train Jon. Batman gives them an underwater base which later gets destroyed. Currently the team is over due to changes made to Jon's character.<ref>Superman #8 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Skills and Abilities==\nHaving been trained by the [[League of Assassins]] since birth, Damian is already an expert in martial arts and in wielding a wide range of weaponry. Despite his age, Damian has taken on and bested trained fighters like Talia Al Ghul, Red Hood (Jason Todd), Red Robin (Tim Drake), and the Joker, amongst others. He was also trained in the disciplines of forensics, acrobatics, criminology, disguise and escapology. Damian is skilled in mimicking voices and speech patterns of others accurately, as he was able to imitate his father's and Tim Drake's voices in order to bypass the Batcave's voice-recognition security systems.<ref name=\"Batman #658\"/> Damian is shown to have highly advanced engineering skills, as he was able to complete his father's plans of building a flying Batmobile, the construction of which Alfred described as \"being an endless source of frustration to Damian's father\". Damian is also a capable businessman despite his young age, being involved with [[Wayne Enterprises]] and its board members. He also has been trained in numerous weapons as shown in the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref>''Batman: Blackest Night'' vol 1 #2</ref> Damian possessed superpowers similar to that of Superman following his resurrection, though this was short-lived. However, he is shown to possess healing abilities and powers in the future.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Robin (Damian Wayne).jpg|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne on the cover of ''Batman and Robin'' #1 (August 2009). Art by J.G.

This version is a stark departure from his original counterpart: his father remains [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) but his mother is [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle), bears no intent to kill at all and acts much more like his father and his costume is similar to [[Tim Drake]]'s second Robin costume. Initially portrayed as being reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps, he tells his parents that he does not want them to plot out his own life for him. But after his parents are killed by [[Joker (character)|Joker Jr.]], Damian takes up the Robin mantle and fights alongside [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] (Dick Grayson). Ultimately, the two bring Joker Jr. and the original Joker to justice and save Gotham from a poison gas attack. It shows that Damian goes on to fight the Club of Villains, Flamingo and [[Professor Pyg]]. The episode ends with Dick passing on the Batman mantle to Damian, who is then shown fighting crime with his own child (voiced by Sebastian Bader) as the new Robin. The pair are seen fighting the mutants from ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', a reference which is further established by the new Robin's resemblance to the Robin ([[Carrie Kelley]]) from that comic. It ultimately turns out that the episode's events were part of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s book 'The Knights of Tomorrow'. This episode was based on a comic book story from the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in which Batman was married to [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] with their son [[Alternate versions of Robin|Bruce Wayne Jr.]]<ref>''Batman'' #131</ref>\n* The character is referenced in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!

He is seen in the episode \"Kid Napped\". \n* Damian Wayne makes his debut appearance, as cameo, in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'' episode \"Rescue Op\" as a newborn, held by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]]. This implies that he was born in the two-year time gap between this season and the previous ''Invasion'' season, that Batman and Talia had had their affair during that time.\n* Damian makes his web television debut as the current Robin in the adult animated series ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Jacob Tremblay]].<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/07/harley-quinn-dc-universe-kaley-cuoco-tca-patrick-schumacker-1202651411/</ref> He is portrayed as a spoiled brat whom most characters don't take seriously. In \"Finding Mr. Right\", in an effort to improve his reputation, he appears on a talk show and lies that [[Harley Quinn]] agreed to be his arch-enemy. Offended, Harley kidnaps him and dangles him over a tank with [[King Shark]] in it. When he confesses he lied, Harley reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain, humiliating him. King Shark goes berserk when he smells blood and nearly kills him, but his father Batman rescues him. The Joker then kidnaps him and Batman saves him again. Batman comforts him and says he can wait until he is ready for his own nemesis. In the season two premiere, \"New Gotham\", Damian took up the mantle of Batman after he disappeared in the chaos caused by Joker's destruction of Gotham during the season one finale despite not being old enough to do so.\n\n===Film===\n* Damian Wayne has a major role in ''[[Son of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Stuart Allan]].\n* Damian Wayne also appears in ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'' as a sequel to ''Son of Batman'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.\n* Damian Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', a sequel to ''Son of Batman'' and ''Batman vs. Robin'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.

Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentors rigorously.\n\nThough initially popular while he was Robin, the character as written by [[Jim Starlin]] was not well received by fans following the revamping of his origin by [[Max Allan Collins]] in ''Batman'' #408\u2013409. This negative reception led to DC Comics holding a telephone [[Opinion poll|poll]] in 1988's \"[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]\" storyline to determine whether or not the character would die at the hands of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], Batman's nemesis. The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. Subsequent ''Batman'' stories dealt with Batman's guilt over not having been able to save him.\n\nTodd was resurrected in 2005's \"[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]\" story arc and became the new Red Hood, an [[antihero]] with a willingness to use lethal force and weapons. Since his return, he operates as the Red Hood in current DC Comics continuity.<ref>''Countdown''</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Todd as #23 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nBy the time [[Len Wein]] took over as editor of DC Comics' ''Batman'' titles in 1982, [[Dick Grayson]] had largely moved on to starring as the leader of the young superhero team the [[Teen Titans]] in DC's ''New Teen Titans'' title. However, with the character no longer featured in ''Batman'' comics, the disadvantages of telling ''Batman'' stories without the character to act as a sounding board for the protagonist became apparent.<ref name=\"daniels pg 147\">Daniels, Les. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. {{ISBN|0-8118-4232-0}}, pg. 147</ref> Jason Todd was created as Dick Grayson's replacement as Robin. The character debuted in ''Batman'' #357 (March 1983) and made his first full appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #525 (April 1983), but it wasn't until later that year when he would appear in costume as Robin in ''Batman'' #366 (Dec 1983) when he showed up towards the end of the story to help Batman fight the Joker.\n\nFollowing the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC took the opportunity to [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] many of its properties. The character was completely revamped. According to [[Dennis O'Neil]], who took over as Batman editor in 1986, \"[The fans] did hate him. I don't know if it was fan craziness\u2014maybe they saw him as usurping Dick Grayson's position. Some of the mail response indicated that this was at least on some people's minds.\"<ref>Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William. \"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil.\" ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''.

O'Neil settled on using the poll to determine the fate of the second Robin. O'Neil said, \"The logical candidate was Jason because we had reason to believe that he wasn't that popular anyway. It was a big enough stunt that we couldn't do it with a minor character.\"<ref>Pearson; Uricchio. \"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil\". p. 22</ref> Even though Jason Todd was unpopular with readers, O'Neil could not decide what to do with the character, so he opted to present the choice to the readership.<ref name=\"daniels pg 160\" />\n\nThe vote was set up in the four-part story \"A Death in the Family\" that was published in ''Batman'' #426\u2013429 in 1988. At the end of ''Batman'' #427, Jason was beaten by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and left to die in an explosion. The inside back cover of the issue listed two 1\u2013900 numbers that readers could call to vote for the character's death or survival. Within the 36-hour period allotted for voting, the poll received 10,614 votes. The verdict in favor of the character's death won by a slim 72-vote margin of 5,343 votes to 5,271.<ref name=\"postscript\">O'Neil, Dennis. \"Postscript\". ''Batman: A Death in the Family''. DC Comics, 1988. {{ISBN|0-930289-44-7}}</ref> The following issue, ''Batman'' #428, was published featuring Todd's death. Years later, O'Neil said it was possible that hundreds of votes in the \"Jason Dies\" line came from a single person, adding a large degree of uncertainty to the honesty of results regarding a poll designed to determine the character's popularity. \"I heard it was one guy, who programmed his computer to dial the thumbs down number every ninety seconds for eight hours, who made the difference\", O'Neil said in a ''Newsarama'' interview conducted alongside writer Judd Winick during the \"Under The Hood\" arc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/robin2.html |title=Robin II |publisher=Titans Tower |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2010-12-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211052930/http://titanstower.com/source/whoswho/robin2.html |archivedate=2011-02-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\nO'Neil would later repeat the claim with further specifics: \"I heard it was a lawyer who was using a Macintosh and lived in California\u2014I obviously don't have hard information on this, but I heard someone out there programmed his computer to dial it every couple of minutes, and since there was only about 65 votes that made the difference, if that story is true, that guy, that guy killed Jason Todd!\"<ref>''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'' Blu-ray featurette, ''Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd''</ref>\n\nDespite the poll results, O'Neil noted, \"We did the deed, and we got a blast of hate mail and a blast of negative commentary in the press.\"<ref>Daniels, p. 161</ref> A few comics creators voiced their displeasure at the event. Writer/artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], who had worked on ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', said, \"To me the whole killing of Robin thing was probably the ugliest thing I've seen in comics, and the most cynical.\"<ref>Sharrett, Christopher. \"Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller\". ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, p. 41</ref> However, DC stood behind the outcome of the poll. O'Neil was quoted on the back cover of ''A Death in the Family'' trade paperback collecting the story with Todd's death as saying, \"It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.\"<ref>''A Death in the Family'' trade paperback</ref> O'Neil would later regret his comment.<ref>\"If I had to do it again, I would certainly have kept my mouth shut.\"\u2014[[Dennis O'Neil]], ''Who Killed Robin? An Interactive Whodunit'', from ''DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes, by Les Daniels''</ref>\n\nThere was a degree of discontinuity between the ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'' titles with regards to the portrayal of Jason. A great deal of adventures occurred post-Crisis which fit with the circus acrobat era and in some cases ran simultaneously in ''Detective'' as the street kid origin was being laid out in ''Batman''. This led to a blackout of almost any Robin appearances in ''Detective''. This became especially apparent after his death. Eleven months passed between Jason's death in ''Batman'' #428 and the first mention of his passing in ''Detective Comics'' #606.\n\nIn 1989, Denny O'Neil, Marv Wolfman and Pat Broderick would introduce [[Tim Drake]] as the third Robin. Mindful of the poor reception Jason received from readers, O'Neil arranged for a more nuanced introduction in which Tim first introduced himself to Dick Grayson and impressed the former Robin with his skills and was revealed to share a history with Grayson. [[Batman]] himself would slowly grow to accept Tim as his new partner, although the memory of Jason would play a heavy part in how Batman trained Tim in the months building up to his official appearance as Robin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Vaneta|title=Why They Endure: Pros On TIM DRAKE's Rise Up the Bat-Ranks|url=http://www.newsarama.com/7111-why-they-endure-pros-on-tim-drake-s-rise-up-the-bat-ranks.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=24 February 2011}}</ref><ref>''Batman'' #457 (December 1990)</ref>\n\n===\"Hush\" and reintroduction===\nPrior to the release of ''Batman'' #617 (September 2003), a page of art from the issue by artist [[Jim Lee]] circulated the Internet, apparently revealing the mystery villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], who was the focus of Lee and writer [[Jeph Loeb]]'s \"[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]\" storyline, as a resurrected Jason. The following month's ''Batman'' #618 (October 2003) revealed that the appearance of Todd was in fact a ruse by the villain [[Clayface]] under the direction of the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]] and Hush. Loeb explained, \"I always liked Jason, liked the idea that Batman had a Robin who died in the line of duty and how that would motivate anyone to continue their quest. It would also be the most recent, most painful thing he had to endure. That's why Hush played the card\u2014to get inside Batman's head...

Commenting on the direction and utilization of Jason Todd in the storyline, writer and artist [[Tony Daniel]] has stated that, from this point on, Jason is a \"[[bona fide]]\" villain:<ref name=IGN1>{{cite web | first=Dan | last=Phillips | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/972/972153p1.html | title=Behind Batman: Battle for the Cowl Part Two | work=[[IGN]] | date=April 13, 2009 | accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|At this point [Jason] is beyond the point of no return in terms of ever being considered even remotely a hero. What I wanted to do here is put him in a place that he can't come back from. The things that he does here in Battle for the Cowl are things that can never really be forgiven. The only outcome would have to be imprisonment or something worse. But from this point on for Jason the gray area between good and bad has disappeared. It's crystal clear now that he is on the dark side.}}\n\nTimothy Drake eventually takes up the bat mantle when Dick Grayson refuses to and sets off to fight Todd, who easily defeats him. Grayson then comes to the rescue and refuses to believe Todd when he claims he has killed Drake, which he has not since current Robin Damian Wayne rescued Drake at the last moment. They battle and Grayson eventually defeats Todd, who says that he will be seen again.\n\n===The Outlaws===\nOn June 6, 2011,<ref name=\"Red Hood IGN\" /> as part of DC Comics' line-wide revamp initiative, it was announced Jason Todd will headline his own title in the guise of the Red Hood. Todd acts as leader of the Outlaws, a group of antiheroes that \"have several different exciting characters from the DC Universe \u2013 some we've seen before and some we haven't,\" Batman Group Editor Mike Marts said.<ref name=\"Red Hood IGN\" /> The group includes [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]. ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' debuted in September 2011, written by [[Scott Lobdell]] and with art by [[Kenneth Rocafort]].<ref name=\"Red Hood IGN\">{{cite web | last=Esposito | first=Joey | title=Exclusive: Dick Grayson Returns as Nightwing | url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/117/1172824p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=2011-06-06}}</ref> The series has focused on Jason Todd's redemption, and introduced a simplified version of his origin story as the Red Hood in ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0, a special prequel issue between #12 and #13.\n\n''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' was later rebooted as part of DC's [[DC Rebirth|Rebirth]] event. This series starred a new lineup of Outlaws: Todd, [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall]] and [[Bizarro]], who were touted as a darker counterpart to the [[Trinity (comic book)|Trinity]]. This lineup lasted for 25 issues, after which Todd briefly reunited with Harper and then went solo. Todd later rescues [[Bunker (comics)|Bunker]] and joins forces with a new Wingman to take over Penguin's [[Iceberg Lounge]].\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Pre-''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\nThe initial version of Jason \"Jay\" Todd from before ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' had an origin that was similar to the 1940 origin of the original [[Dick Grayson|Robin]] (Dick Grayson).<ref name=\"daniels pg 147\" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Sunde|first=Eric|title=Dusting Off Jason Todd|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/03/03/dusting-off-jason-todd|publisher=IGN|accessdate=4 November 2012|date=3 March 2006}}</ref> Originally, he is the son of circus acrobats (Joseph Todd and Trina Todd, killed by a criminal named [[Killer Croc]]) and is later adopted by Bruce Wayne.<ref>''Batman'' #357\u2013358, ''Detective Comics'' Vol. 1 #526</ref> Distinguished by strawberry blond hair, Todd is wearing various pieces of Dick Grayson's old childhood disguises as costume to fight crime until Grayson presents him with a Robin costume of his own. At that point, Todd dyes his hair black, and in later stories blossoms under Batman's tutelage.\n\nFor a time Natalia Knight, the criminal also known as [[Nocturna (DC Comics)|Nocturna, Mistress of the Night]] is a stabilizing influence in his life; she becomes his [[surrogacy|surrogate mother]] and even adopts the young Todd. [[Catwoman]] would be a frequent guest star during this era as she wrestled with the role of hero and as a love interest for Batman which led to clashes with the boy feeling left out.\n\nIn the [[Alan Moore]] epic ''Superman Annual'' #11, \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", Batman and Todd join [[Wonder Woman]] at the [[Fortress of Solitude]] to celebrate [[Superman]]'s birthday. They arrive only to find Superman incapacitated by a mysterious creature and [[Mongul]] there to battle the heroes. Todd as Robin saves Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman from Mongul by unleashing Mongul's own hallucination-causing creature on the tyrant himself.\n\nTodd also tackled the drug problem in his school, hauling in the local dealers who were muscled up with [[Two-Face]]. One of the more memorable moments of this era occurred in ''Detective Comics'' #569 when Batman forbade Jason from using \"Holy!\" puns.\n\n===Post-''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n====Origin====\nFollowing the revamp due to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Jason Todd is recast as a young street orphan who first encounters [[Batman]] while attempting to steal the tires off the [[Batmobile]] in [[Crime Alley]], the very place where Batman's parents were murdered years before. The son of Willis Todd and Catherine Todd, Jason lives on the East end of [[Gotham City]] in the Park Row district called Crime Alley. Catherine was a drug addict who died of an overdose some time before he began living on the street. Willis, a former medical student, was working as hired muscle for [[Two-Face]] and had disappeared suspiciously following a botched assignment. Bruce Wayne sees to it that Todd is placed in a school for troubled youths, which turns out to be Ma Gunn's School for Crime. Jason earns the Robin mantle a short while later by helping Batman apprehend the gang of thieves. However, Todd does not wear the Robin costume until six months of training.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #410 (August 1987)</ref> Batman notes that while Todd doesn't possess [[Dick Grayson]]'s natural athleticism and acrobatic skills, he can become a productive crimefighter by channeling his rage. He also believes that if he doesn't help the boy, Todd will eventually become part of the \"criminal element\".\n\nIn the revamp period, Todd is portrayed as the \"rebel\" Robin. He smokes, swears, and fights authority. He is prone to defying Batman's orders, sometimes to success (bringing in the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] singlehandedly) and sometimes failure (botching a raid on a drug lab by jumping the gun too soon). Todd also aided Batman while Gotham City was temporarily overrun by [[Deacon Blackfire]] as shown in ''[[Batman: The Cult]]''.\n\nThe most controversial moment prior to his death occurred in ''Batman'' #424 when serial rapist Felipe Garzonas escapes prosecution due to his father's [[diplomatic immunity]]. One of his victims, a girl named Gloria, hangs herself amid the threat of a third rape from Felipe. Todd discovers her hanging and makes a beeline for Felipe, ahead of Batman, who arrived just in time to see Felipe take a 22-story fall to his death, with Todd as Robin at the edge of the balcony. Todd maintains \"I guess I spooked him. He slipped.\" This highlights an earlier exchange in ''Batman'' #422 where he uses excessive force on a pimp about to slash one of his working girls and Todd asks Batman if it would have been big loss if he had killed him. It is left ambiguous whether Todd killed him.\n\nIn ''Batman'' #425, the Dynamic Duo is challenged by Felipe's father, who kidnaps [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] in retaliation for his son's death. Batman is instructed to meet the kidnappers at a city junkyard and to bring Robin. Batman does not wish to involve Todd and keeps this information from him. However, Robin senses something is wrong and hides in the Batmobile's trunk as Batman heads to the junkyard. There, Batman is unable to reach Gordon, surrounded by Garzonas' men, and Todd intervenes, saving Batman from a close call. Machine gun fire breaks out and Gordon is wounded in the arm. All of the henchmen die, and Garzonas is finally crushed by a pile of junk cars.\n\n====Death====\n{{Main|Batman: A Death in the Family}}\n[[File:The Death of Jason Todd.jpg|thumb|upright|Batman carries Jason Todd's body in ''Batman'' #428 (1988): \"A Death in the Family\". Art by [[Jim Aparo]]]]\nIn 1988's \"A Death in the Family\" storyline, Jason Todd discovers that Catherine Todd was not his biological mother, and runs away to find the woman who gave birth to him. After following a number of leads, including an [[Israel]]i [[Mossad]] agent and [[Lady Shiva|Shiva Woo-San]], Todd finally tracks his biological mother Sheila Haywood to [[Ethiopia]], where she works as an aid worker. While Todd is overjoyed to be reunited with his real mother, he soon discovers that she is being [[blackmail]]ed by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] using her to provide him with medical supplies. Sheila herself has been [[embezzlement|embezzling]] from the aid agency and as part of the cover-up, she hands her own son, having arrived as Robin, over to Joker. Joker beats the boy brutally with a crowbar, and then leaves him and Sheila in the warehouse with a [[time bomb]]. Sheila and Jason try desperately to get out of the warehouse but are still inside as the bomb goes off. Batman arrives too late to save them, and finds Jason's lifeless body in the rubble. Sheila lives just long enough to tell Batman that Jason died trying to protect her. The bodies are taken back to [[Gotham City]] for burial. Todd's death haunts Batman ever since, as he considers it his greatest failure. He keeps the second Robin's uniform on display in the [[Batcave]] as a reminder.\n\n====Return from the grave====\nYears later, while trying to discover the identity of a [[Hush (comics)|mysterious figure]] plotting against him, Batman discovers that [[Tim Drake]], Jason's successor as Robin, has been kidnapped. He confronts the kidnapper, and is stunned to discover that he is apparently an adult Todd, standing at his own desecrated grave site. Batman subdues this mystery \"Jason\" and discovers that it is only [[Clayface]] impersonating Todd, concluding that \"Jason's\" greater physical age was to hide the flaws in Clayface's impersonation by allowing him to partially mimic Nightwing's combat skills. However, Todd's actual body is missing from its grave.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]] (w), [[Lee, Jim]] (p), [[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]] (i). ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' #10\u201311 (2001). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed that Todd had indeed died at the hands of the Joker. However, when [[Superboy-Prime]] alters reality from the paradise dimension in which he is trapped\u2014his punches against the barrier keeping him from the rest of the universe causing temporal ripples\u2014Jason Todd is restored to life, breaks out of his coffin, and is eventually hospitalized; because he wandered so far from his grave before his discovery, no connection was ever drawn between the two events. Todd never turns up on any missing persons reports\u2014as he was never 'missing'\u2014nor can he be identified since no prints are on file for him. After spending a year in a coma and subsequently another year as an [[amnesia]]c vagrant, he is taken by [[Talia al Ghul]] after a small-time crook recognizes him as Robin due to his combat skills on the street.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" />\n\nTalia took Todd in out of her love for Batman, while her father [[Ra's al Ghul]] was interested in the secret behind his resurrection. The [[League of Assassins]] tracked and eliminated everyone in Gotham who knew of Todd's resurrection to prevent Batman from finding out. They also interrogated Joker's henchmen who were with him during Todd's murder, in hopes to find out how the boy could have survived.<ref>''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #1 (August 2010)</ref> Talia later restored Todd's health and memory by immersing him in a [[Lazarus Pit]] in which her father was also bathing and helped him escape the House of al Ghul.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" /> It is suggested by Ra's that the power of the pit resulted in Todd's mental instability. Ra's refers to Todd as a \"curse\" and a \"pestilence\" unleashed on the planet, saying that madness may affect him for \"hours, months, or decades\".\n\nUsing the money from Talia and infuriated by her statement that he \"remains unavenged\", Todd paid a group of mercenaries to help him return to Gotham. Upon arriving, he enacts a plan to get revenge on Batman, whom he resents for refusing to kill the Joker and thus avenge his death.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" />\n\n====The Lost Days====\nJason Todd creates a false [[arms trafficking]] of advanced military arsenal, knowing that Batman would respond. This provides Jason an opportunity to plant a bomb beneath the Batmobile while Batman is on a stakeout for the arms deal. Batman enters the car and is at Jason's mercy, detonator in hand. However, Todd realizes that if he went through with it, his former mentor would never know about his return nor the identity of his killer. Todd instead decides to kill Batman directly by traveling across the globe in search of a similar, but deadlier type of training to Bruce Wayne's own in order to prepare for that day.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" /><ref>''[[Red Hood: The Lost Days]]'' #2 (September 2010)</ref> For years, Todd learns various skills from various masters, assassins, mercenaries, and aviators around the globe, including guns, poisons and [[antitoxin]]s, [[martial arts]], [[acrobatics]], and bomb-making. Upon learning that the man training him in lethal combat is also the leader of a child sex slave ring, Jason frees the latest shipment of children and takes them to a local embassy, then returns to the training compound and poisons his new mentor for his crimes. Upon being questioned by Talia al Ghul, Todd says it was not murder but rather that he \"put down a reptile\".<ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #3 (October 2010)\">''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #3 (October 2010)</ref> Jason has since repeated the same pattern of killing his teachers when finding them guilty after he has finished with his training.\n\nDuring his journey, Jason discovers his Robin replacement was Timothy \"Tim\" Drake, which further torments him. He also learns that the man teaching him bomb-making is involved in a Russian mafia-backed deal meant to push the resources of British law enforcement away from mob crime and onto [[Islamic extremist]] terrorism with a framed bombing plot. Todd manages to hunt down the gang and safely detonate the bombs. Ironically, the only surviving member of the gang offers Jason the possibility of a large government payday in exchange for his life, because he knows where a very wanted man is. That wanted man turns out to be the Joker.<ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #3 (October 2010)\"/><ref>''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #4 (November 2010)</ref><ref>''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #5 (December 2010)</ref>\n\nAfter learning of the Joker's arms deal in [[Los Angeles]] for another terrorism scheme against Gotham, Jason begins to stalk the villain as a masked assassin. After successfully capturing Joker (who fails to recognize him), Jason contemplates burning his killer alive after dousing with gasoline. However, Jason realizes that he does not simply want Joker to die, but desires to punish the villain with Batman. Jason spares Joker and decides to wait for the right opportunity.<ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #6\">''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #6 (January 2011)</ref> Jason also admits to Talia that he has already deduced that the reason she finances his training is to stall him from killing Batman, but he has no desire to kill his former mentor anymore. Talia then gives Todd the idea to be the Batman that Gotham needs. She also hires the same carpenters who built Jason's casket and had them build a replica of it (the original was destroyed and beyond repair after Jason emerged from it). Todd enters into a pact with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] and the [[Riddler]]. He confirms to Hush that Riddler is correct that Bruce Wayne is Batman. As Hush, Riddler and Jason collaborate, Jason initially confronts Batman at his own gravesite. Jason then [[Retroactive continuity|switches places]] with Clayface in order to observe Batman from afar. When Batman expresses no [[remorse]] for sparing Joker's life after the second Robin was killed, Todd is further angered and takes up his murderer's [[Red Hood|original mantle]]. After she initiated a [[takeover]] of [[Kord Enterprises|Kord Industries]] for him, Talia gives Jason a flame dagger (a replica of the one Ra's al Ghul often carried) and a red helmet as gifts, and they become his signature weapon and mask.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\"/><ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #6\" />\n\n====Red Hood====\n[[File:JasonTodd.png|thumb|upright|Jason Todd as [[Red Hood]] in ''Batman'' #638. Art by [[Doug Mahnke]]]]\nShortly after the events of \"[[Batman: War Games|War Games]]\" and just before \"[[War Crimes (comics)|War Crimes]]\", Jason Todd reappears in [[Gotham City]] as the [[Red Hood]].<ref name=b635>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #635 (February 2005)</ref> He hijacks a shipment of [[Kryptonite]] from [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and in the midst of a battle with Batman, Nightwing and [[Mr. Freeze]], Red Hood gives them the Kryptonite back, and tells them he has gotten what he truly wanted: a \"lay of the land\". Shortly afterward, Red Hood finds the Joker (driven out of Gotham by Hush) and beats him with a crowbar just as Joker had beaten Jason. Despite the violence of the beating, Jason spares Joker, intending to use him later against Batman.\n\nRed Hood assumes control over several gangs in Gotham City and starts a one-man war against Black Mask's criminal empire. Overall, he strives to take over Gotham's gangs, control their activities, and to kill Joker in revenge for his own death. In his new role as Gotham's most powerful crime lord, he repeatedly comes to blows with Batman and several of his [[List of Batman supporting characters|allies]]. A Robin mask is found in the [[Batmobile]], which never belonged to Dick or Tim, but is of the style that Todd wore as Robin, suggesting that he'd been [[stalking]] Batman.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #630 (July 2004)</ref> After their encounter in the cemetery, Batman becomes obsessed with the possibility of resurrection from the dead, secretly aware that it was really Jason he fought, and seeks advice from allies such as [[Superman]] and [[Green Arrow]], both of whom have died and returned to life. Around this time, Batman discovers that the empty coffin buried at Jason's gravesite is a replica of what he bought. Nevertheless, Batman keeps Jason's Robin costume in its memorial display case in the Batcave; when [[Alfred Pennyworth]] asks if he wants the costume removed, Batman sadly replies that the return of Todd \"doesn't change anything at all\".<ref name=\"Batman #641 (June 2005)\">''Batman'' (vol. 1) #641 (June 2005)</ref>\n\nActing on his obsession with Tim Drake, Todd breaks into [[Titans Tower]] to confront the third Robin, thus revealing the truth of their encounter at the cemetery to his successor. Having learned that Tim occasionally defeat the Joker by himself, Jason seeks to best him in combat. Wearing his own redesigned Robin costume, Todd quickly immobilizes the other [[Teen Titans]] and strikes Drake down in the Tower's Hall of Fallen Titans. Furious that no memorial statue was made for him (despite his short tenure as a Titan), he demands that Drake tell him if he is really as good as Todd has been told. Drake says \"Yes\" and passes out. As he leaves, he tears the 'R' emblem from Drake's chest, though he later admits that Drake has talent. Todd is also left wondering if perhaps he would have been a better Robin and better person had he have had a life like Drake's and friends like the Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #29 (December 2005)</ref>\n\nTodd eventually kidnaps and holds Joker hostage, luring Batman to [[Gotham City#Geography|Crime Alley]], the site of their first meeting. Despite their now-antagonistic relationship, Batman desperately wants to help Todd, and intends to atone for his own failures. Todd asks Batman why he has not avenged his death by killing Joker, a psychopath who has murdered countless people and crippled [[Barbara Gordon|one of their best friends]], arguing that Batman should have done it \"because he took me away from you\". Batman admits that he has often fantasized about taking the Joker somewhere private to [[torture]] for weeks before finally killing the maniac, but says that he refuses to go to that place. Todd then offers Batman an ultimatum: he will kill Joker unless Batman kills Todd first. Holding Joker at gunpoint, he throws a pistol to Batman and begins to count to three while standing behind Joker, leaving Batman with only a headshot if he wants to stop Todd pulling the trigger. At the last moment, Batman throws a [[batarang]] at Todd, which bounces off a pipe and sinks into his neck causing him to drop his gun. Joker takes advantage of the situation, detonating nearby explosives that engulf the platform and send them plunging into the bay.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\"/><ref>''[[Batman: Under the Hood]]'' (''Batman'' #635\u2013641, 645\u2013650)</ref>\n\n====Nightwing====\nJason Todd resurfaces following the \"[[One Year Later]]\" period, patrolling the streets of [[New York City]] as a murderous version of [[Nightwing]]. However, Jason shows no intention of giving up the Nightwing persona when confronted by Dick Grayson, and continues to taunt his predecessor by wearing the costume and suggesting that the two become a crime-fighting team. Not long after the two Nightwings meet up, Todd is captured and imprisoned by local mobsters Barry and Buddy Pierce. Grayson reluctantly rescues him, and the two join forces to defeat the Pierce Brothers. Shortly afterward, Todd leaves New York City and the Nightwing mantle to Grayson, along with a telegram telling Grayson he has returned to normal and still considers himself a gift from Batman.<ref>''Nightwing'' #118\u2013122 (2006)</ref>\n\n====Red Hood again====\nJason Todd resumes his persona as the Red Hood and appears in several issues of \"Green Arrow\" alongside [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] as part of a gun-running organization, which brings Batman to [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. Jason's true motives are shown in the third part as he kidnaps [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia Dearden]] in an effort to dissolve her partnership with Green Arrow, feeling that they are kindred spirits, cast down by society and at odds with their mentors. The two fight while Todd discusses the insanity of heroes for placing child sidekicks in danger. Mia is deeply troubled by the discussion, but ultimately decides to remain with [[Green Arrow]].\n\nAt the start of ''Countdown'', Todd rescues a woman from [[Duela Dent]].<ref>''Countdown'' #51 (May 2007)</ref> After a [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] shoots and kills Duela, he attempts to kill Jason, but is stopped by a second Monitor. This second Monitor apologizes to Jason before they both disappear, leaving Jason alone with Duela's body. Later, at Duela's funeral, Jason hides until all of the Teen Titans have left except [[Donna Troy]]. Jason tells her what happened the night of Duela's death, and about the dueling Monitors. He knows that both he and Donna Troy have come back from the dead, even already deducing that his resurrection has something do with [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plans during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and wonders which of them is next on the Monitor's hit list. The two are then attacked by the [[Forerunner (DC Comics)|Forerunner]], but before she can kill them, the apologetic Monitor stops her, and recruits Jason and Donna for a mission to the Palmerverse, a section of the Nanoverse discovered by [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], in an attempt to find Palmer. During the trip, Jason takes it upon himself to name the Monitor \"Bob\". Jason seems to have a romantic interest in Donna, and is shown to be visibly disgruntled when her old boyfriend [[Kyle Rayner]] joins their group as they take their tour to the 52 [[Earth]]s which comprise the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]].\n\n====Red Robin====\n[[File:Red Robin Todd.jpg|thumb|upright|Jason Todd taking the role of [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]]]]\nA teaser image released to promote ''Countdown'' showed a figure resembling [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]] among assembled heroes in poses symbolic of their roles in the series. After a series of [[Countdown to Final Crisis#Promotional campaign|contradictory statements]] about this figure, executive editor [[Dan DiDio]] firmly stated in the July 2007 DC Nation column that the figure is Jason Todd. The Red Robin costume, originally designed by [[Alex Ross]] for the 1996 ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series and worn by the Earth-22 Dick Grayson, is seen in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #16 in the Earth-51 Batman's base of operations; it is revealed that Earth-51 became the peaceful world it is because the Batman of this Earth killed all the supervillains after his Jason was killed by the Joker. In issue #14, Jason dons the Red Robin suit\u2014described by Earth-51's Batman as something he was going to give Todd's counterpart when he was older\u2014and goes into battle alongside Earth-51 Batman. During a battle with a group of Monarch's soldiers, Earth-51 Batman is killed by the [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] of [[Earth-Three#New Multiverse|Earth-3]], deeply affecting Jason. In his grief, Todd kills an alternate version of the Joker, also involved in Batman's killing, who then mocks his loss, vacating alongside Donna, Ray and Kyle to the planet [[Apokolips]] before Earth-51's destruction.\n\nAfter the group is sent back to Earth, Todd leaves the group and returns to his crimefighting ways. When the Morticoccus virus is released from [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]'s body, he is forcibly brought back to the group by Kyle, much to his dismay. When the Challengers return to New Earth, Todd disposes of his Red Robin costume and abandons the rest of the group, though they go on to declare to the Monitors that they are now the monitors of the Monitors. Todd and Drake are confronted by another Red Robin in ''Robin'' #177, whose identity is initially a mystery but later turns out to be [[General (DC Comics)|Ulysses Armstrong]]. Due to a combination of Red Robin's involvement and a gun-toting gang member, Todd was shot in the leg and arrested by police. Upon the resolution of the gang war in Gotham, Drake under a pseudonym visited Todd in prison to give him the [[Justice League]] access code to release himself from prison. Todd is booked under a pseudonym (John Doe), due to there being no identifiable prints on file for any member of the main bat heroes as well as Jason is still legally dead.<ref>''Robin'' (vol. 4) #182 (March 2009)</ref> Following his escape, Todd continues on the mend, and is summoned by Tim Drake to come to the Batcave, where Batman has left a Last Will and Testament statement for him. After hearing the statement in private, Todd prepares to leave, not revealing what he was told, although he does pause before his old costume and the tattered remains of Batman's, he is clearly sad.<ref>''Robin'' (vol. 4) #183 (April 2009)</ref>\n\n====Batman====\nJason Todd reappeared in the \"[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]\" series. Dressed in a version of a Batman costume, Todd is also living/operating out of an abandoned Gotham subway system. His inner monologue reveals that he had always wanted to eventually replace Batman, and thinks it was a bad idea for Batman to become a public figure, rather than an [[urban legend]].\n\nAfter stabbing Tim Drake in the chest with a batarang, he and Dick Grayson battle down in the subway.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl'' #2 (April 2009)</ref> Nightwing still wants to save Todd, but Todd refuses the offer, and instead allows himself to fall off a speeding subway into the Gotham River, while stating they would see each other again soon. This allowed Grayson to officially take up the mantle of Batman.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl'' #3 (May 2009)</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed in ''Battle for the Cowl'' that Bruce Wayne's last words to Jason were of regret at how he had obviously overlooked the young man's deep emotional problems. He thought he could do what could never be done for him and 'make him whole'. His message goes on to plead that Todd get psychiatric help, a notion that the latter rejects. It is suggested by Dick Grayson that Todd was infuriated by Wayne's last words, a reaction that led him to becoming monstrous, murdering Batman in that same arc. Plus, it aggravated his hatred towards the Bat-family, as he repeatedly attempts to kill members of it.\n\n====Red Hood and Scarlet====\nIn the second story arc of ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Philip Tan]], Jason Todd retakes the Red Hood mantle after losing his bid to become the new Batman. With the goal of making the very concept of Batman obsolete, he puts a lot of effort into [[public relations]]: he drastically alters his Red Hood costume to look more like a traditional superhero outfit and recruits his own sidekick Scarlet.( He also is balding). In their war on crime, Red Hood and Scarlet freely kill criminals, villains, and anyone who gets in their way, even the police. He leaves behind a calling card which states \"let the punishment fit the crime\". He describes his vendetta against Grayson as \"the revenge of one crazy man in a mask on another crazy man in a mask\".<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #3 (October 2009)</ref><ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #4 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nTodd has reappeared with red hair, claiming that he is a natural red-head and that Bruce Wayne had him dye his hair black in order to look like Dick Grayson (as in his pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] origins). He also claims the white streak of hair that he got is from being resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, though the white streak disappears again.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #5 (December 2009)</ref> In the issue, Todd is characterized as increasingly unstable and his idea of \"finishing off\" Batman and Robin now consists of stripping them down to their underwear and exposing their identities via webcam activated by a phone poll [a nod by Morrison to his own death poll]. A fight between Batman, Robin, and the Flamingo \u2013 a foreign hitman hired by a Mexican cartel after Red Hood killed their operative in Gotham \u2013 ends with Jason burying Flamingo in debris with a bulldozer. Flamingo is assumed dead, although Commissioner Gordon reports that his body cannot be recovered from beneath the rubble.\n\nGrayson offers to rehabilitate Todd who, in a moment of clarity, tells Grayson it is too late for him, and how he tried to be what Batman wanted, \"but this world... this dirty, twisted, cruel and ugly dungheap had... other plans for me\". He then proceeds to fall back into his hero persona, ranting how he did what Batman never did. He \"defeated his archenemy\". Todd is arrested by Gordon who informs him that the reason he has always worked with Batman is that Batman never violates the law \"where it counts\". As Gordon leads him away, Todd tauntingly asks Grayson why he has not put Wayne's corpse into a Lazarus Pit to bring him back, citing his own resurrection from its bath.

Bruce Wayne as Batman visits him there to inform Jason he's in Arkham for his own protection. Jason points out he's passed all the psychological tests repeatedly and there is no reason to keep him in what he calls Batman's \"kennel of freaks\". It is also revealed that, like Tim, Jason was also aware that Batman survived his encounter with Darkseid. Jason is transferred to a Gotham prison and upon his arrival, the suicide rate spikes amongst top incarcerated crime figures there. Several homicides occur due to many botched attempts on Jason's life by inmates with a grudge against Red Hood's tactics. Jason escalates things further by poisoning the cafeteria, killing 82 and sickening 100 more inmates. He is immediately transferred back to Arkham but is broken out of the paddy wagon by a group of mercenaries.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #23 (July 2011)</ref> The mercs reveal they are under orders to bring Jason to the person that hired them and that he is in no danger. Jason breaks free and fights them off all the same as Batman and Robin arrive. Once the hired guns are subdued they reveal their employer has captured Scarlet, Jason's former sidekick. Dick, Damian, and Jason go to one of the Red Hood's weapon caches where he assembles a composite costume made from his biker and \"superhero\" Red Hood attire. The three intend to rescue Scarlet.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #24 (August 2011)</ref> After Batman and Robin defeat the mercs, Red Hood rescues Scarlet and escapes using the helicopter.

In this new timeline, Jason's new origin is revealed in a special ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0 (November 2012) issue, which changes the manner in which Batman first met Todd (stealing medicine from [[Leslie Thompkins]], after she had treated him from a brutal beating). The back-up introduces a massive [[retcon]] in which the Joker is responsible for orchestrating the major moments of Todd's life such as his father's imprisonment and death, his mother's overdose, his introduction to Thompkins and his adoption of the Robin identity. Considering the Joker is the one narrating this segment, it is open to debate whether he is telling the truth or not. Though only lightly touched on, his resurrection is also simplified: he is resurrected after he is placed into the Lazarus Pit by Talia al Ghul.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0</ref>\n\n====The Outlaws====\n{{main|Red Hood and the Outlaws}}\n[[File:Robin Jason Todd.jpg|thumb|200px|Jason Todd as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0 (November 2012). Art by Brett Booth]]\nFollowing the events of the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline, the DC universe was relaunched, with Red Hood becoming the leader of the Outlaws in their own series, part of the [[The New 52|New 52]] line of comics. The team also includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]]. Instead of being trained by various men after his return from the dead, Jason Todd was trained by an order of warriors known as the All Caste.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #3(January 2012)</ref> He was a part of the order for an unknown amount of time before he was exiled, partly of his own will.<ref name=rata2>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #2 (December 2011)</ref> After his exile, he became Red Hood and came to be odds with Dick Grayson, Starfire's ex-lover and his Robin predecessor. He soon tires of Gotham and leaves, gathering the group together; after breaking out Roy from a Middle Eastern prison, he brings Roy up to speed on things. The two start on very friendly terms. Roy and Starfire are in a sexual relationship. However, Starfire makes it clear to Roy that it is only physical, with no emotional ties. Essence, a fellow exiled member of the All Caste whom Jason knows, appears to him, but is invisible to others. She sets Jason on a mission to hunt down a group known as \"The Untitled\", telling him of people missing organs before death without any sign of removal, which is their calling card. To top it off, Essence shows that the order of the All Caste, the people most qualified to handle the situation, have been slaughtered, leaving her and Jason as the only known survivors.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #1 (November 2011)</ref> After finding out he's no longer the killer he once was, Jason brings his group to the All Caste headquarters, the Hundred Acres of All, where they discover the bodies are returning to life as zombies. Jason is forced to destroy the bodies of his teachers and friends. Afterwards, he pays his respects, swearing vengeance for them.<ref name=rata2 /> He is led on a wild goose chase across the globe. Eventually, he comes across an Untitled, who was in hiding, who tells him that they were set up, but still fights him. Jason kills the creature, strengthening his resolve.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #5 (March 2012)</ref>\n\nTodd has also been revealed to be a member of [[Batman, Incorporated]], initially operating under the name of Wingman, an agent based in Europe. Wingman temporary allies himself with [[Damian Wayne]], who is using the name \"Redbird\" at the time. Batman, Inc is at war with an organisation named Leviathan, headed by Talia al Ghul, Damian's mother and the woman responsible for reviving Jason, but in the present she seeks to destroy Batman and has put a bounty on their son's head. Alfred Pennyworth refers to Jason as wanting \"to be redeemed\" through his membership.<ref>''Batman Inc'' #7</ref> Later, however, the Wingman ruse is exposed and Todd returns to being Red Hood. While he recalls his days as Wingman as a failure, Bruce Wayne is nevertheless proud of him. Following the events of ''[[Death of the Family]]'', Bruce and Alfred care for a sick Jason in the Manor, culminating in a warm embrace between Jason and his father figure as he regains consciousness, suggesting that their animosity might finally be put to rest.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #18 (2013)</ref> After Jason recovers and in the wake of Damian's death, Batman partners with Jason for the first time since Jason's days as Robin. Batman brings Jason on a mission in Ethiopia to punish some of Damian's other would-be assassins, and while there he also takes him to the place of his death in the hopes Jason can provide insights into his resurrection so that he might apply the method to Damian. Jason is hurt by Batman's manipulation, and the two share harsh words and exchange blows, shattering their newfound relationship.<ref>''Batman and Red Hood'' #20</ref> Later however, the pair come together, united by the ties of family. Jason teams up with Batman, Batgirl, [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] to rescue Damian's body from [[Apokolips]]. They are successful, and Damian is resurrected, sharing a warm reunion with Jason and the family.<ref>''Robin Rises: Alpha'' #1</ref>\n\nFollowing the traumas of ''Death of the Family'', Damian's death, and his betrayal by Batman, Jason returns to the All-Caste and has his memories wiped so that he may be at peace. He is 'rescued' by Starfire and Arsenal, but does not regain his memories.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #20</ref> He subsequently learns of his history from Starfire's computer, which states Red Hood has made 83 confirmed kills. Jason refuses to believe from Starfire and Arsenal that he had been on a path towards redemption, and abandons his teammates.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws Annual'' #1</ref>\n\n====Red Hood/Arsenal====\n[[File:RedHood2016.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Jason Todd as [[Red Hood]] on the cover of ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' vol. 2, #1 (October 2016).

The series eventually ended coinciding with the [[DC Rebirth]] event.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===DC Comics Rebirth===\n====Red Hood and the Outlaws====\n\nThe [[DC Rebirth]] introduced the revival of ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' with a second volume released in August 2016. Jason Todd's backstory is altered to resemble his original meeting with Batman occurring while trying to steal tires from the Batmobile. Jason's mother is already dead by now and his father is serving a life sentence in prison, so he has been living on the streets. Batman at first tries helping him by enrolling him in Ma Gunn's boarding school, trying to give him a home. However he does not realise that Ma Gunn is actually using the school as a cover to recruit young delinquents into her own criminal gang. When Batman discovers this, he takes down Ma Gunn, with help from Jason.\n\nBatman then takes him in and raises him as the new Robin, though realizes early on that Jason has a violent streak. After Jason is killed by the Joker and resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, he goes on to become the Red Hood, straining his relationship with Batman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29041-dc-rebirth-first-look-red-hood-the-outlaws-retells-jason-batmans-1st-meeting.html|title=DC REBIRTH First Look: RED HOOD & THE OUTLAWS Retells JASON & BATMAN\u2019s 1st Meeting|website=Newsarama.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> The new team consists of Jason Todd as [[Red Hood]], the disgraced Amazon warrior named [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], and the [[Superman]] clone called [[Bizarro]]. This team is referred to as DC's \"Dark Trinity\" in comparison to the new Trinity series included in [[DC Rebirth]] which follows [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. The team would stay together until Red Hood and the Outlaws #25-26, where Jason went solo after his team disappeared and the title was changed to Red Hood: Outlaw. He also later appears in [[Year of the Villain]] and Event Leviathan #2.\n\n==Abilities and equipment==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Skills and abilities===\nTo become Robin, Jason Todd was trained by Bruce Wayne, just as Dick Grayson was, rigorously training him in [[acrobatics]], detective work, strategy, and [[martial arts]]. After his resurrection, he expands on his training by learning from people of the same caliber as those who trained his ex-mentor Batman, becoming highly skilled in the aforementioned fields by the time he reaches his adulthood. Jason's fighting style emphasizes brutality, speed, and strength, incorporating [[Aikido]], [[Capoeira]], [[Karate]], [[Kickboxing]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Ninjutsu]], [[Savate]], [[Silat]], and [[Taekwondo]]. With an extensive knowledge of Batman's tactics, Jason can anticipate most of his former mentor's actions and counter them.\n\nThrough Talia al Ghul's access to [[Kord Enterprises|Kord Industries]],<ref name=b635 /><ref>''Batman Annual'' (vol. 1) #1 (Summer 1961)</ref> as well as being [[LexCorp]]'s former CEO,<ref>Rucka, Greg (w), Eaglesham, Dale (p), Kryssing, Ray (i),  Comicraft (let), Mike Carlin (ed). \"Most Suitable Person\" ''President Luthor Secret Files and Origins'' (March, 2001), New York: DC Comics</ref> Jason has access to high-level civilian and military-grade [[weapon]]ry including [[firearm]]s such as pistols, machine guns, shotguns, etc. He also has access to [[explosive material|explosives]], [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], and advanced computer equipment and gadgetry. However, his dagger (which resembles a [[kris]] and is a replica of one of Ra's al Ghul's knives) still remains as his preferred weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat; it can cut through Batman's armor and arsenal. He also has some lethally sharpened [[shuriken]]s based on Batman's batarang designs as throwing weapons.\n\n===Firearms===\nHaving been trained by Batman, Jason Todd has perfect aim when using batarangs and later, firearms.  To increase his skill with firearms, he went a step further than Batman on his journey around the world to learn from masters how to kill a target with different types of guns.  His weapons of choice are a pair of customized [[IWI Jericho 941]]s, fitted with extra picatinny rails and mini red dot sights.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\n\n===''The Dark Knight Returns''===\n{{main|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns}}\n''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which was published before \"A Death in the Family\", references Jason Todd. Jason Todd is implied to have died in the line of duty, although the exact details are not given. It is implied that Todd's death was a contributing factor to Batman's retirement. When Batman allows [[Carrie Kelley]] to assume the mantle of Robin, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] objects, citing Todd as a reason. Batman responds by stating \"I will never forget Jason. He was a good soldier. He honored me. But the war goes on.\"\n\nThe details of Jason's death is revealed in the comic book one-shot ''Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade,'' by the first series' author [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] with [[Brian Azzarello]], and art by [[John Romita, Jr.]] Romita reveals that the Joker, like in the \"A Death in the Family\" story arc, plays an important role in Jason Todd's demise in Miller's Dark Knight Universe.

At first, Jason refuses to take orders from Nightwing or work with the other Robins, but Damian threatens him by telling him that he knows his fate and can make it happen sooner than expected, referencing his death in the comics. Nightwing notes that Jason fights aggressively, like he's angry at the world and doesn't hold back.\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\n{{main|Flashpoint (comics)}}\nAn alternate version of Jason appears in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' timeline, where, among other changes, Bruce Wayne was killed as a child and thus never became Batman. Here Jason is portrayed as a former drug-addict and follower of [[Brother Blood]] who eventually turned his life around and became a priest. He still died, but was eventually resurrected and recovered from it physically and mentally.<ref>''Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''A World Without Young Justice''===\nIn this alternate timeline, there appeared a version of Jason.

Despite his reckless nature, Dick chose Jason as his successor when he temporarily left S.H.I.E.L.D. to attend college. As Moonwing, he made a careless mistake, which resulted in a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's death, causing him to be dismissed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Jason became furious and blamed his mentors. He was then caught in an explosion when the villain Hyena detonated a bomb intended to kill Bruce and [[Wolverine (character)|Dark Claw]]. Despite his body never being recovered, S.H.I.E.L.D. presumed he was dead, but he survived and his body was recovered by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], who replaced his damaged body parts with robotic parts, transforming him into [[Deathlok]]. He then participated in a coup to help [[Catwoman|Madame Cat]] overthrow the Supreme Leader of Hydra, [[Lex Luthor]] a.k.a. Green Skull. Afterwards, he swore allegiance to her. Later, when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents launched an attack on HYDRA's base, Deathlok was sent to confront them, where he spotted his former mentor, Moonwing and attacked him from behind. He then revealed that he's been waiting a long time to kill both Dick and Bruce. He then unmasked Moonwing and accused him and Bruce of abandoning him. He then began strangling Dick, but before he could kill him Colonel [[Nick Fury]] and [[Sgt. Rock|Sergeant Joe Rock]] commandeered an aircraft and shot Deathlok several times in the back. Despite feeling sorry for Jason, Dick left Jason to die again so he could continue the attack on the HYDRA base.<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1</ref> This is noteworthy as this version  of the character was introduced nine years before the canon Jason was resurrected as Red Hood.\n\n===''Batman: Arkham Knight''===\n{{main|Batman: Arkham}}\n\nJason Todd, as the [[Arkham Knight]], is featured in the tie-in comics to the ''Batman: Arkham'' video game series.

Kate called him her \"pettirojo\" (Robin) and her \"Capucho Rojo\" (Red Hood). Jas\u00f3n was the rebellion's mascot, often carrying their flag and using his street smarts to help Kate and Renee in various scenarios. He is eventually shot and killed by [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] during one of their battles. Batwoman told Huntress of his story in an attempt to convince her not to risk her life so often through rebellion.<ref>''DC Bombshells'' #16</ref>\n\nIn the ''Bombshells United'' storyline, Kate Kane and Renee Montoya meet Talia al Ghul and Cheetah in an underground labyrinth.

He is later convinced by Damian to turn against Ra's when Ra's takes it too far by using Amazo to slaughter millions.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #46</ref>\n\n===''Batman: White Knight''===\nIn the ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'' continuity, Jason Todd took the mantle of Robin before Dick Grayson did, and in some point of the story, he was captured and tortured by the Joker, who was trying to make him tell him Batman's secret identity. Harley Quinn stopped him before he could kill Jason and called Batman for help. But when they returned to the hideout, Todd had disappeared. They couldn't find him and Jason was presumed dead. Some time later, after the Joker's cured from his insanity, Harleen tells him about Jason, and Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) says that he can't remember what happened to Todd. Dick tells Barbara that Jason was Bruce's favorite.<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref> Later, Jack reveals to Batman that he remembered what he did with Jason after he tortured him. Jack reveals that Jason eventually broke from the torture and said \"I wish I'd never met Bruce Wayne\", and that Joker let Jason go free.  Batman then asks why Jason never returned to him, Jack says that the Joker was jealous of Robin for knowing who Batman was and Jason hated him so much for making him Robin that he disappeared.<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #7</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n{{See also|Robin in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n<!-- Do NOT add Red-X from the 2004 TEEN TITANS cartoon.

Jason first met [[Batman]] when he stole the [[Batmobile]]'s tires in Crime Alley. The Dark Knight then pitied Jason and took him in to take up the Robin mantle after Dick Grayson became Nightwing. Though gifted in both mind and body, time passed and Jason grew increasingly violent, not understanding why his mentor did not kill the criminals they faced. When [[Ra's al Ghul]] hired the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to distract the Dynamic Duo, Robin sought to kill the Joker while Batman fought the villain's goons. However, the Joker had set a trap and captured Jason before brutally beating him with a crowbar. The Joker then left Jason's severely injured body in a warehouse set to explode. Before Batman could get to him in time, Jason perished in the explosion. Feeling guilt for inadvertently causing Jason's death, Ra's retrieved his body and resurrected him with a [[Lazarus Pit]]. However, the effects drove Jason insane, and subsequently disappeared after escaping Ra's compound. Five years later, he returns to Gotham City under the Red Hood alias, convincing all of Gotham's gangsters to join him in overtaking Gotham's most powerful crime lord [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. After encountering Batman and Nightwing, Red Hood's taunting reveals his knowledge of the Dark Knight's secret identity, and Batman eventually learns that his former partner had returned from the dead under the Joker's former criminal identity. Red Hood then attacked the Black Mask, prompting the crime lord to break the Joker out of prison to help due to his difficulty to infiltrate his killer's heavily guarded cell. After capturing the Joker, Jason lures Batman to an abandoned building where the three of them exchange words. Jason states that he forgave Batman for not saving him, but is angered that Batman had allowed the Joker to live, and continue murdering for years after his death; Todd thinks his own death should have been the final straw. After Batman disarms Jason, the former Boy Wonder activates explosives placed throughout the building, resulting in Batman apprehending the Joker once more. After the explosion, Jason's body is nowhere to be found, leaving his fate ambiguous.\n* Jason Todd has a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]''. A picture of Robin's beaten body is shown in the Batcave.\n* Three boys named Dick, Jason and Tim appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham by Gaslight (film)|Batman: Gotham by Gaslight]]'' trying to rob a couple before being stopped by Batman. Jason is voiced by [[Grey Griffin]].\n* A Feudal Japan version of Red Hood appears in the anime film ''[[Batman Ninja]]'', voiced by [[Akira Ishida]] and [[Yuri Lowenthal]] in Japanese and English respectively.\n* The Jason Todd version of Red Hood appears as the main antagonist turned supporting protagonist of the 2019 [[Lego]]-themed animated film ''[[Lego DC Batman: Family Matters]]'', voiced by [[Jason Spisak]]. Rather than being kidnapped and murdered by the Joker, Jason simply left Batman after believing that he didn't care about him and later took on the Red Hood persona. In the film, Red Hood teams up with [[Two-Face]] to get revenge on Batman and places 5 bombs throughout Gotham, challenging the Bat-Family to get them all. While they succeed, Red Hood kidnaps each of them and takes over the Batcave. When Batman arrives, he deduces that Jason is Red Hood and apologizes to him. Making amends with Batman, Jason releases the Bat-Family and reveals that the bombs contained confetti. He later helps Batman take down Two-Face.\n\n===Video games===\n\n* The Red Hood appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/LEGOBatmanGame/status/525763210696470528/photo/1]</ref>\n* The Red Hood appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Cameron Bowen reprising his role.\n\n====''Batman: Arkham'' series====\n* Jason Todd appears as the titular villain of [[Rocksteady Studios]]' ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' (2015), voiced again by [[Troy Baker]]. Rather than being killed during his tenure as Robin, this version was captured and tortured by the Joker in an abandoned wing of [[Arkham Asylum]] years prior to the events of the series' [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|first installment]]. After a year of torment, the Joker fractured Jason's psyche by revealing to him that he had been replaced in the role of Robin by [[Tim Drake]]. Eventually, the Joker brands Jason, and films a video in which he \"kills\" him, which he then sends to Batman to torment him over his failure of saving Jason. However, the Joker secretly provided Jason with a [[body armor]] so that he would survive the gunshot and would later go on to exact his revenge on Batman for abandoning him. This eventually becomes true, as Jason later escapes from Arkham and adopts the \"'''[[Arkham Knight]]'''\" persona, becoming a highly skilled mercenary for hire and even creating his own legion of mercenaries called the Militia. During the events of ''Arkham Knight'', which take place roughly one year after the Joker's [[Batman: Arkham City|death]], Arkham Knight strikes a partnership with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and aids him with his plans of destroying Gotham City with his fear toxin, in the hopes of finally exacting his revenge on Batman. Eventually, after several encounters where the Arkham Knight is shown to know all of Batman's secrets and weaknesses, as well as several flashbacks of Jason's torture and apparent death at the hands of the Joker, Batman confronts the mysterious villain after he has kidnapped [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]], where the Arkham Knight finally unmasks himself as Jason and prepares to kill Batman once and for all. Batman and Jason then engage in a battle, with the former emerging victorious, although he refuses to deliver the final punch to Jason, who then vanishes, abandoning the Arkham Knight persona. Despite this, the Militia continue to operate in Gotham under Scarecrow's command, who ultimately unmasks Batman in front of the world on television and injects him with his fear toxin, but he is rescued by a now redeemed Jason, allowing Batman to defeat and apperhend the villain once and for all. At the end of the game, Batman seemingly commits suicide to keep his loved one safe now that his secret identity has been revealed. \n**Jason later takes on the Red Hood persona, serving as the main playable protagonist of the self-titled \"Red Hood Story Pack\" [[Downloadable content|DLC]] mission, which is set some time after the main story's ending. To honor his former mentor's legacy, Red Hood becomes a ruthless vigilante and begins fighting crime in Gotham on his own, though he is shown to have no problem with executing criminals, with his arsenal consisting of a pair of pistols in a single hit, [[Stun grenade|flashbangs]], and the Zip-Kick (a small grapple hook that allows him to grab and pull himself to enemies). In the DLC, Red Hood hunts down [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]]'s men across Gotham, until eventually learning about his wherabouts and defeating him in a fight. Black Mask then attempts to negotiate with Red Hood, promising him everything, even saying that he will leave Gotham permanently and go anywhere Red Hood tells him to, but Jason ironically responds with \"How about you go to hell\", before throwing him out a window and quipping \"Say hi to Joker from me\" as Black Mask falls to his death.\n**Both of Jason's alter-egos, the Arkham Knight and Red Hood, were later added as playable characters for the game's challenge maps.\n* The scene of Jason Todd's \"death\" in ''Batman: Arkham Knight'' can be viewed in ''[[Batman: Arkham VR]]''.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* The Arkham Knight is playable in the [[mobile app]] version of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/injustice-mobile-game-update-adds-reverse-flash-arkham-knight-survival-mode-more-1477516|date=2015-10-24|accessdate=2015-10-24|last=Parungo|first=Nicolo|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|title=Injustice mobile game update adds Reverse Flash, Arkham Knight, Survival Mode and more}}</ref>\n* The Red Hood appears as a DLC playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Cameron Bowen]]. He is briefly mentioned in the story during [[Damian Wayne]]'s argument with Batman stating that the Joker kept on killing because Batman wouldn't kill. Because of that, the Dark Knight couldn't save [[Lois Lane]], Jason or anyone that Batman held dear.<ref>[https://twitter.com/CameronBowen/status/860582898507718656]</ref> In his single player ending, he refuses to side with Batman or [[Superman]]; while he agrees with Superman that criminals deserve to die, Red Hood doesn't approve of the Man of Steel's dictatorial rule. While the World's Finest are focused on fighting each other, Red Hood focuses on protecting the weak and innocent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote|Batman (comics)#Jason Todd|Jason Todd}}\n* {{Comicbookdb|type=character|id=10855|title=Jason Todd}}\n* [http://www.dcdatabaseproject.com/Red_Hood_%28Jason_Todd%29 Red Hood (Jason Todd)] at the DC Database Project\n\n{{Red Hood}}\n{{Batman characters}}\n{{Robin}}\n{{Dick Grayson}}\n{{Deathstroke}}\n{{The Joker}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Todd, Jason}}\n[[Category:Batman characters]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Don Newton]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Doug Moench]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Gerry Conway]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Judd Winick]]\n[[Category:Comic book sidekicks]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1983]]\n[[Category:DC Comics martial artists]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassins]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional detectives]]\n[[Category:Fictional kidnappers]]\n[[Category:Fictional marksmen and snipers]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in comics]]\n[[Category:Fictional orphans]]\n[[Category:Fictional stalkers]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Fictional vigilantes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:Robin (DC Comics)]]\n[[Category:Red Hood]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox comics character  <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| character name = Jason Todd\n| image          = Red Hood (Jason Todd).png\n| converted      =\n| caption        = Jason Todd as [[Red Hood]] on the cover of ''[[Batman Eternal]]'' #26 (Dec. 2014).

Initially sharing a similar origin to Grayson, subsequent portrayals commonly depict Todd as an orphaned street delinquent, whom Batman attempts to reform and mentors rigorously.\n\nThough initially popular while he was Robin, the character as written by [[Jim Starlin]] was not well received by fans following the revamping of his origin by [[Max Allan Collins]] in ''Batman'' #408\u2013409. This negative reception led to DC Comics holding a telephone [[Opinion poll|poll]] in 1988's \"[[Batman: A Death in the Family|A Death in the Family]]\" storyline to determine whether or not the character would die at the hands of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], Batman's nemesis. The poll ended with a narrow majority of votes in favor of killing Todd, resulting in his death. Subsequent ''Batman'' stories dealt with Batman's guilt over not having been able to save him.\n\nTodd was resurrected in 2005's \"[[Batman: Under the Hood|Under the Hood]]\" story arc and became the new Red Hood, an [[antihero]] with a willingness to use lethal force and weapons. Since his return, he operates as the Red Hood in current DC Comics continuity.<ref>''Countdown''</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[ComicsAlliance]] ranked Todd as #23 on their list of the \"50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Wheeler |first=Andrew |url=http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |title=ComicsAlliance Presents The 50 Sexiest Male Characters in Comics |publisher=[[ComicsAlliance]] |date=2013-02-14 |accessdate=2015-07-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018024021/http://comicsalliance.com/comics-sexiest-male-characters |archivedate=2015-10-18 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\nBy the time [[Len Wein]] took over as editor of DC Comics' ''Batman'' titles in 1982, [[Dick Grayson]] had largely moved on to starring as the leader of the young superhero team the [[Teen Titans]] in DC's ''New Teen Titans'' title. However, with the character no longer featured in ''Batman'' comics, the disadvantages of telling ''Batman'' stories without the character to act as a sounding board for the protagonist became apparent.<ref name=\"daniels pg 147\">Daniels, Les. ''Batman: The Complete History''. Chronicle Books, 1999. {{ISBN|0-8118-4232-0}}, pg. 147</ref> Jason Todd was created as Dick Grayson's replacement as Robin. The character debuted in ''Batman'' #357 (March 1983) and made his first full appearance in ''Detective Comics'' #525 (April 1983), but it wasn't until later that year when he would appear in costume as Robin in ''Batman'' #366 (Dec 1983) when he showed up towards the end of the story to help Batman fight the Joker.\n\nFollowing the 1985 limited series ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', DC took the opportunity to [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] many of its properties. The character was completely revamped. According to [[Dennis O'Neil]], who took over as Batman editor in 1986, \"[The fans] did hate him. I don't know if it was fan craziness\u2014maybe they saw him as usurping Dick Grayson's position. Some of the mail response indicated that this was at least on some people's minds.\"<ref>Pearson, Roberta E.; Uricchio, William. \"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil.\" ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''.

Art by Mike Mignola.]]\nIn 1988, Dennis O'Neil suggested that an audience might be attracted to the comics by being offered the opportunity to influence the creative process.<ref name=\"daniels pg 160\">Daniels, p. 160</ref> Settling on the idea of telephone poll via a [[Premium-rate telephone number#North America|1-900]] number, O'Neil had decided due to discussions with DC Comics president [[Jenette Kahn]] that the poll should not be wasted on something insignificant. O'Neil settled on using the poll to determine the fate of the second Robin. O'Neil said, \"The logical candidate was Jason because we had reason to believe that he wasn't that popular anyway. It was a big enough stunt that we couldn't do it with a minor character.\"<ref>Pearson; Uricchio. \"Notes from the Batcave: An Interview with Dennis O'Neil\". p. 22</ref> Even though Jason Todd was unpopular with readers, O'Neil could not decide what to do with the character, so he opted to present the choice to the readership.<ref name=\"daniels pg 160\" />\n\nThe vote was set up in the four-part story \"A Death in the Family\" that was published in ''Batman'' #426\u2013429 in 1988. At the end of ''Batman'' #427, Jason was beaten by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and left to die in an explosion. The inside back cover of the issue listed two 1\u2013900 numbers that readers could call to vote for the character's death or survival. Within the 36-hour period allotted for voting, the poll received 10,614 votes. The verdict in favor of the character's death won by a slim 72-vote margin of 5,343 votes to 5,271.<ref name=\"postscript\">O'Neil, Dennis. \"Postscript\". ''Batman: A Death in the Family''. DC Comics, 1988. {{ISBN|0-930289-44-7}}</ref> The following issue, ''Batman'' #428, was published featuring Todd's death. Years later, O'Neil said it was possible that hundreds of votes in the \"Jason Dies\" line came from a single person, adding a large degree of uncertainty to the honesty of results regarding a poll designed to determine the character's popularity. \"I heard it was one guy, who programmed his computer to dial the thumbs down number every ninety seconds for eight hours, who made the difference\", O'Neil said in a ''Newsarama'' interview conducted alongside writer Judd Winick during the \"Under The Hood\" arc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.titanstower.com/source/whoswho/robin2.html |title=Robin II |publisher=Titans Tower |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2010-12-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211052930/http://titanstower.com/source/whoswho/robin2.html |archivedate=2011-02-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\nO'Neil would later repeat the claim with further specifics: \"I heard it was a lawyer who was using a Macintosh and lived in California\u2014I obviously don't have hard information on this, but I heard someone out there programmed his computer to dial it every couple of minutes, and since there was only about 65 votes that made the difference, if that story is true, that guy, that guy killed Jason Todd!\"<ref>''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'' Blu-ray featurette, ''Robin's Requiem: The Tale of Jason Todd''</ref>\n\nDespite the poll results, O'Neil noted, \"We did the deed, and we got a blast of hate mail and a blast of negative commentary in the press.\"<ref>Daniels, p. 161</ref> A few comics creators voiced their displeasure at the event. Writer/artist [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], who had worked on ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Batman: Year One]]'', said, \"To me the whole killing of Robin thing was probably the ugliest thing I've seen in comics, and the most cynical.\"<ref>Sharrett, Christopher. \"Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller\". ''The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media''. Routledge: London, 1991. {{ISBN|0-85170-276-7}}, p. 41</ref> However, DC stood behind the outcome of the poll. O'Neil was quoted on the back cover of ''A Death in the Family'' trade paperback collecting the story with Todd's death as saying, \"It would be a really sleazy stunt to bring him back.\"<ref>''A Death in the Family'' trade paperback</ref> O'Neil would later regret his comment.<ref>\"If I had to do it again, I would certainly have kept my mouth shut.\"\u2014[[Dennis O'Neil]], ''Who Killed Robin? An Interactive Whodunit'', from ''DC Comics: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes, by Les Daniels''</ref>\n\nThere was a degree of discontinuity between the ''Batman'' and ''Detective Comics'' titles with regards to the portrayal of Jason. A great deal of adventures occurred post-Crisis which fit with the circus acrobat era and in some cases ran simultaneously in ''Detective'' as the street kid origin was being laid out in ''Batman''. This led to a blackout of almost any Robin appearances in ''Detective''. This became especially apparent after his death. Eleven months passed between Jason's death in ''Batman'' #428 and the first mention of his passing in ''Detective Comics'' #606.\n\nIn 1989, Denny O'Neil, Marv Wolfman and Pat Broderick would introduce [[Tim Drake]] as the third Robin. Mindful of the poor reception Jason received from readers, O'Neil arranged for a more nuanced introduction in which Tim first introduced himself to Dick Grayson and impressed the former Robin with his skills and was revealed to share a history with Grayson. [[Batman]] himself would slowly grow to accept Tim as his new partner, although the memory of Jason would play a heavy part in how Batman trained Tim in the months building up to his official appearance as Robin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Vaneta|title=Why They Endure: Pros On TIM DRAKE's Rise Up the Bat-Ranks|url=http://www.newsarama.com/7111-why-they-endure-pros-on-tim-drake-s-rise-up-the-bat-ranks.html|publisher=Newsarama|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=24 February 2011}}</ref><ref>''Batman'' #457 (December 1990)</ref>\n\n===\"Hush\" and reintroduction===\nPrior to the release of ''Batman'' #617 (September 2003), a page of art from the issue by artist [[Jim Lee]] circulated the Internet, apparently revealing the mystery villain [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], who was the focus of Lee and writer [[Jeph Loeb]]'s \"[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]\" storyline, as a resurrected Jason. The following month's ''Batman'' #618 (October 2003) revealed that the appearance of Todd was in fact a ruse by the villain [[Clayface]] under the direction of the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]] and Hush. Loeb explained, \"I always liked Jason, liked the idea that Batman had a Robin who died in the line of duty and how that would motivate anyone to continue their quest. It would also be the most recent, most painful thing he had to endure. That's why Hush played the card\u2014to get inside Batman's head...

The character's identity was revealed as Jason Todd in ''Batman'' #638. Winick explained that after his initial arc on the ''Batman'' title, he suggested doing \"something big\" to his editors. Specifically, he wanted to bring the character back from the dead. Winick said, \"I was less interested in the how and the why and the what of Jason Todd returning from the dead than I am about what Jason's return will do to Batman.

Grayson then comes to the rescue and refuses to believe Todd when he claims he has killed Drake, which he has not since current Robin Damian Wayne rescued Drake at the last moment.

At that point, Todd dyes his hair black, and in later stories blossoms under Batman's tutelage.\n\nFor a time Natalia Knight, the criminal also known as [[Nocturna (DC Comics)|Nocturna, Mistress of the Night]] is a stabilizing influence in his life; she becomes his [[surrogacy|surrogate mother]] and even adopts the young Todd. [[Catwoman]] would be a frequent guest star during this era as she wrestled with the role of hero and as a love interest for Batman which led to clashes with the boy feeling left out.\n\nIn the [[Alan Moore]] epic ''Superman Annual'' #11, \"[[For the Man Who Has Everything]]\", Batman and Todd join [[Wonder Woman]] at the [[Fortress of Solitude]] to celebrate [[Superman]]'s birthday. They arrive only to find Superman incapacitated by a mysterious creature and [[Mongul]] there to battle the heroes. Todd as Robin saves Wonder Woman, Superman, and Batman from Mongul by unleashing Mongul's own hallucination-causing creature on the tyrant himself.\n\nTodd also tackled the drug problem in his school, hauling in the local dealers who were muscled up with [[Two-Face]]. One of the more memorable moments of this era occurred in ''Detective Comics'' #569 when Batman forbade Jason from using \"Holy!\" puns.\n\n===Post-''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===\n====Origin====\nFollowing the revamp due to ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Jason Todd is recast as a young street orphan who first encounters [[Batman]] while attempting to steal the tires off the [[Batmobile]] in [[Crime Alley]], the very place where Batman's parents were murdered years before. The son of Willis Todd and Catherine Todd, Jason lives on the East end of [[Gotham City]] in the Park Row district called Crime Alley. Catherine was a drug addict who died of an overdose some time before he began living on the street. Willis, a former medical student, was working as hired muscle for [[Two-Face]] and had disappeared suspiciously following a botched assignment. Bruce Wayne sees to it that Todd is placed in a school for troubled youths, which turns out to be Ma Gunn's School for Crime. Jason earns the Robin mantle a short while later by helping Batman apprehend the gang of thieves. However, Todd does not wear the Robin costume until six months of training.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #410 (August 1987)</ref> Batman notes that while Todd doesn't possess [[Dick Grayson]]'s natural athleticism and acrobatic skills, he can become a productive crimefighter by channeling his rage. He also believes that if he doesn't help the boy, Todd will eventually become part of the \"criminal element\".\n\nIn the revamp period, Todd is portrayed as the \"rebel\" Robin. He smokes, swears, and fights authority. He is prone to defying Batman's orders, sometimes to success (bringing in the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] singlehandedly) and sometimes failure (botching a raid on a drug lab by jumping the gun too soon). Todd also aided Batman while Gotham City was temporarily overrun by [[Deacon Blackfire]] as shown in ''[[Batman: The Cult]]''.\n\nThe most controversial moment prior to his death occurred in ''Batman'' #424 when serial rapist Felipe Garzonas escapes prosecution due to his father's [[diplomatic immunity]]. One of his victims, a girl named Gloria, hangs herself amid the threat of a third rape from Felipe. Todd discovers her hanging and makes a beeline for Felipe, ahead of Batman, who arrived just in time to see Felipe take a 22-story fall to his death, with Todd as Robin at the edge of the balcony. Todd maintains \"I guess I spooked him. He slipped.\" This highlights an earlier exchange in ''Batman'' #422 where he uses excessive force on a pimp about to slash one of his working girls and Todd asks Batman if it would have been big loss if he had killed him. It is left ambiguous whether Todd killed him.\n\nIn ''Batman'' #425, the Dynamic Duo is challenged by Felipe's father, who kidnaps [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Gordon]] in retaliation for his son's death. Batman is instructed to meet the kidnappers at a city junkyard and to bring Robin. Batman does not wish to involve Todd and keeps this information from him. However, Robin senses something is wrong and hides in the Batmobile's trunk as Batman heads to the junkyard. There, Batman is unable to reach Gordon, surrounded by Garzonas' men, and Todd intervenes, saving Batman from a close call. Machine gun fire breaks out and Gordon is wounded in the arm. All of the henchmen die, and Garzonas is finally crushed by a pile of junk cars.\n\n====Death====\n{{Main|Batman: A Death in the Family}}\n[[File:The Death of Jason Todd.jpg|thumb|upright|Batman carries Jason Todd's body in ''Batman'' #428 (1988): \"A Death in the Family\". Art by [[Jim Aparo]]]]\nIn 1988's \"A Death in the Family\" storyline, Jason Todd discovers that Catherine Todd was not his biological mother, and runs away to find the woman who gave birth to him. After following a number of leads, including an [[Israel]]i [[Mossad]] agent and [[Lady Shiva|Shiva Woo-San]], Todd finally tracks his biological mother Sheila Haywood to [[Ethiopia]], where she works as an aid worker. While Todd is overjoyed to be reunited with his real mother, he soon discovers that she is being [[blackmail]]ed by the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] using her to provide him with medical supplies. Sheila herself has been [[embezzlement|embezzling]] from the aid agency and as part of the cover-up, she hands her own son, having arrived as Robin, over to Joker. Joker beats the boy brutally with a crowbar, and then leaves him and Sheila in the warehouse with a [[time bomb]]. Sheila and Jason try desperately to get out of the warehouse but are still inside as the bomb goes off. Batman arrives too late to save them, and finds Jason's lifeless body in the rubble. Sheila lives just long enough to tell Batman that Jason died trying to protect her. The bodies are taken back to [[Gotham City]] for burial. Todd's death haunts Batman ever since, as he considers it his greatest failure. He keeps the second Robin's uniform on display in the [[Batcave]] as a reminder.\n\n====Return from the grave====\nYears later, while trying to discover the identity of a [[Hush (comics)|mysterious figure]] plotting against him, Batman discovers that [[Tim Drake]], Jason's successor as Robin, has been kidnapped. He confronts the kidnapper, and is stunned to discover that he is apparently an adult Todd, standing at his own desecrated grave site. Batman subdues this mystery \"Jason\" and discovers that it is only [[Clayface]] impersonating Todd, concluding that \"Jason's\" greater physical age was to hide the flaws in Clayface's impersonation by allowing him to partially mimic Nightwing's combat skills. However, Todd's actual body is missing from its grave.<ref>[[Loeb, Jeph]] (w), [[Lee, Jim]] (p), [[Scott Williams (comics)|Williams, Scott]] (i). ''[[Batman: Hush]]'' #10\u201311 (2001). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed that Todd had indeed died at the hands of the Joker. However, when [[Superboy-Prime]] alters reality from the paradise dimension in which he is trapped\u2014his punches against the barrier keeping him from the rest of the universe causing temporal ripples\u2014Jason Todd is restored to life, breaks out of his coffin, and is eventually hospitalized; because he wandered so far from his grave before his discovery, no connection was ever drawn between the two events. Todd never turns up on any missing persons reports\u2014as he was never 'missing'\u2014nor can he be identified since no prints are on file for him. After spending a year in a coma and subsequently another year as an [[amnesia]]c vagrant, he is taken by [[Talia al Ghul]] after a small-time crook recognizes him as Robin due to his combat skills on the street.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" />\n\nTalia took Todd in out of her love for Batman, while her father [[Ra's al Ghul]] was interested in the secret behind his resurrection. The [[League of Assassins]] tracked and eliminated everyone in Gotham who knew of Todd's resurrection to prevent Batman from finding out. They also interrogated Joker's henchmen who were with him during Todd's murder, in hopes to find out how the boy could have survived.<ref>''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #1 (August 2010)</ref> Talia later restored Todd's health and memory by immersing him in a [[Lazarus Pit]] in which her father was also bathing and helped him escape the House of al Ghul.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" /> It is suggested by Ra's that the power of the pit resulted in Todd's mental instability. Ra's refers to Todd as a \"curse\" and a \"pestilence\" unleashed on the planet, saying that madness may affect him for \"hours, months, or decades\".\n\nUsing the money from Talia and infuriated by her statement that he \"remains unavenged\", Todd paid a group of mercenaries to help him return to Gotham. Upon arriving, he enacts a plan to get revenge on Batman, whom he resents for refusing to kill the Joker and thus avenge his death.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" />\n\n====The Lost Days====\nJason Todd creates a false [[arms trafficking]] of advanced military arsenal, knowing that Batman would respond. This provides Jason an opportunity to plant a bomb beneath the Batmobile while Batman is on a stakeout for the arms deal. Batman enters the car and is at Jason's mercy, detonator in hand. However, Todd realizes that if he went through with it, his former mentor would never know about his return nor the identity of his killer. Todd instead decides to kill Batman directly by traveling across the globe in search of a similar, but deadlier type of training to Bruce Wayne's own in order to prepare for that day.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\" /><ref>''[[Red Hood: The Lost Days]]'' #2 (September 2010)</ref> For years, Todd learns various skills from various masters, assassins, mercenaries, and aviators around the globe, including guns, poisons and [[antitoxin]]s, [[martial arts]], [[acrobatics]], and bomb-making. Upon learning that the man training him in lethal combat is also the leader of a child sex slave ring, Jason frees the latest shipment of children and takes them to a local embassy, then returns to the training compound and poisons his new mentor for his crimes. Upon being questioned by Talia al Ghul, Todd says it was not murder but rather that he \"put down a reptile\".<ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #3 (October 2010)\">''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #3 (October 2010)</ref> Jason has since repeated the same pattern of killing his teachers when finding them guilty after he has finished with his training.\n\nDuring his journey, Jason discovers his Robin replacement was Timothy \"Tim\" Drake, which further torments him. He also learns that the man teaching him bomb-making is involved in a Russian mafia-backed deal meant to push the resources of British law enforcement away from mob crime and onto [[Islamic extremist]] terrorism with a framed bombing plot. Todd manages to hunt down the gang and safely detonate the bombs. Ironically, the only surviving member of the gang offers Jason the possibility of a large government payday in exchange for his life, because he knows where a very wanted man is. That wanted man turns out to be the Joker.<ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #3 (October 2010)\"/><ref>''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #4 (November 2010)</ref><ref>''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #5 (December 2010)</ref>\n\nAfter learning of the Joker's arms deal in [[Los Angeles]] for another terrorism scheme against Gotham, Jason begins to stalk the villain as a masked assassin. After successfully capturing Joker (who fails to recognize him), Jason contemplates burning his killer alive after dousing with gasoline. However, Jason realizes that he does not simply want Joker to die, but desires to punish the villain with Batman. Jason spares Joker and decides to wait for the right opportunity.<ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #6\">''Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #6 (January 2011)</ref> Jason also admits to Talia that he has already deduced that the reason she finances his training is to stall him from killing Batman, but he has no desire to kill his former mentor anymore. Talia then gives Todd the idea to be the Batman that Gotham needs. She also hires the same carpenters who built Jason's casket and had them build a replica of it (the original was destroyed and beyond repair after Jason emerged from it). Todd enters into a pact with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] and the [[Riddler]]. He confirms to Hush that Riddler is correct that Bruce Wayne is Batman. As Hush, Riddler and Jason collaborate, Jason initially confronts Batman at his own gravesite. Jason then [[Retroactive continuity|switches places]] with Clayface in order to observe Batman from afar. When Batman expresses no [[remorse]] for sparing Joker's life after the second Robin was killed, Todd is further angered and takes up his murderer's [[Red Hood|original mantle]]. After she initiated a [[takeover]] of [[Kord Enterprises|Kord Industries]] for him, Talia gives Jason a flame dagger (a replica of the one Ra's al Ghul often carried) and a red helmet as gifts, and they become his signature weapon and mask.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\"/><ref name=\"Red Hood: The Lost Days'' #6\" />\n\n====Red Hood====\n[[File:JasonTodd.png|thumb|upright|Jason Todd as [[Red Hood]] in ''Batman'' #638. Art by [[Doug Mahnke]]]]\nShortly after the events of \"[[Batman: War Games|War Games]]\" and just before \"[[War Crimes (comics)|War Crimes]]\", Jason Todd reappears in [[Gotham City]] as the [[Red Hood]].<ref name=b635>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #635 (February 2005)</ref> He hijacks a shipment of [[Kryptonite]] from [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and in the midst of a battle with Batman, Nightwing and [[Mr. Freeze]], Red Hood gives them the Kryptonite back, and tells them he has gotten what he truly wanted: a \"lay of the land\". Shortly afterward, Red Hood finds the Joker (driven out of Gotham by Hush) and beats him with a crowbar just as Joker had beaten Jason. Despite the violence of the beating, Jason spares Joker, intending to use him later against Batman.\n\nRed Hood assumes control over several gangs in Gotham City and starts a one-man war against Black Mask's criminal empire. Overall, he strives to take over Gotham's gangs, control their activities, and to kill Joker in revenge for his own death. In his new role as Gotham's most powerful crime lord, he repeatedly comes to blows with Batman and several of his [[List of Batman supporting characters|allies]]. A Robin mask is found in the [[Batmobile]], which never belonged to Dick or Tim, but is of the style that Todd wore as Robin, suggesting that he'd been [[stalking]] Batman.<ref>''Batman'' (vol. 1) #630 (July 2004)</ref> After their encounter in the cemetery, Batman becomes obsessed with the possibility of resurrection from the dead, secretly aware that it was really Jason he fought, and seeks advice from allies such as [[Superman]] and [[Green Arrow]], both of whom have died and returned to life. Around this time, Batman discovers that the empty coffin buried at Jason's gravesite is a replica of what he bought. Nevertheless, Batman keeps Jason's Robin costume in its memorial display case in the Batcave; when [[Alfred Pennyworth]] asks if he wants the costume removed, Batman sadly replies that the return of Todd \"doesn't change anything at all\".<ref name=\"Batman #641 (June 2005)\">''Batman'' (vol. 1) #641 (June 2005)</ref>\n\nActing on his obsession with Tim Drake, Todd breaks into [[Titans Tower]] to confront the third Robin, thus revealing the truth of their encounter at the cemetery to his successor. Having learned that Tim occasionally defeat the Joker by himself, Jason seeks to best him in combat. Wearing his own redesigned Robin costume, Todd quickly immobilizes the other [[Teen Titans]] and strikes Drake down in the Tower's Hall of Fallen Titans. Furious that no memorial statue was made for him (despite his short tenure as a Titan), he demands that Drake tell him if he is really as good as Todd has been told. Drake says \"Yes\" and passes out. As he leaves, he tears the 'R' emblem from Drake's chest, though he later admits that Drake has talent. Todd is also left wondering if perhaps he would have been a better Robin and better person had he have had a life like Drake's and friends like the Titans.<ref>''Teen Titans'' (vol. 3) #29 (December 2005)</ref>\n\nTodd eventually kidnaps and holds Joker hostage, luring Batman to [[Gotham City#Geography|Crime Alley]], the site of their first meeting. Despite their now-antagonistic relationship, Batman desperately wants to help Todd, and intends to atone for his own failures. Todd asks Batman why he has not avenged his death by killing Joker, a psychopath who has murdered countless people and crippled [[Barbara Gordon|one of their best friends]], arguing that Batman should have done it \"because he took me away from you\". Batman admits that he has often fantasized about taking the Joker somewhere private to [[torture]] for weeks before finally killing the maniac, but says that he refuses to go to that place. Todd then offers Batman an ultimatum: he will kill Joker unless Batman kills Todd first. Holding Joker at gunpoint, he throws a pistol to Batman and begins to count to three while standing behind Joker, leaving Batman with only a headshot if he wants to stop Todd pulling the trigger. At the last moment, Batman throws a [[batarang]] at Todd, which bounces off a pipe and sinks into his neck causing him to drop his gun. Joker takes advantage of the situation, detonating nearby explosives that engulf the platform and send them plunging into the bay.<ref name=\"BatAnn25\"/><ref>''[[Batman: Under the Hood]]'' (''Batman'' #635\u2013641, 645\u2013650)</ref>\n\n====Nightwing====\nJason Todd resurfaces following the \"[[One Year Later]]\" period, patrolling the streets of [[New York City]] as a murderous version of [[Nightwing]]. However, Jason shows no intention of giving up the Nightwing persona when confronted by Dick Grayson, and continues to taunt his predecessor by wearing the costume and suggesting that the two become a crime-fighting team. Not long after the two Nightwings meet up, Todd is captured and imprisoned by local mobsters Barry and Buddy Pierce. Grayson reluctantly rescues him, and the two join forces to defeat the Pierce Brothers. Shortly afterward, Todd leaves New York City and the Nightwing mantle to Grayson, along with a telegram telling Grayson he has returned to normal and still considers himself a gift from Batman.<ref>''Nightwing'' #118\u2013122 (2006)</ref>\n\n====Red Hood again====\nJason Todd resumes his persona as the Red Hood and appears in several issues of \"Green Arrow\" alongside [[Brick (comics)|Brick]] as part of a gun-running organization, which brings Batman to [[Star City (comics)|Star City]]. Jason's true motives are shown in the third part as he kidnaps [[Speedy (Mia Dearden)|Mia Dearden]] in an effort to dissolve her partnership with Green Arrow, feeling that they are kindred spirits, cast down by society and at odds with their mentors. The two fight while Todd discusses the insanity of heroes for placing child sidekicks in danger. Mia is deeply troubled by the discussion, but ultimately decides to remain with [[Green Arrow]].\n\nAt the start of ''Countdown'', Todd rescues a woman from [[Duela Dent]].<ref>''Countdown'' #51 (May 2007)</ref> After a [[Monitors (comics)|Monitor]] shoots and kills Duela, he attempts to kill Jason, but is stopped by a second Monitor. This second Monitor apologizes to Jason before they both disappear, leaving Jason alone with Duela's body. Later, at Duela's funeral, Jason hides until all of the Teen Titans have left except [[Donna Troy]]. Jason tells her what happened the night of Duela's death, and about the dueling Monitors. He knows that both he and Donna Troy have come back from the dead, even already deducing that his resurrection has something do with [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plans during ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', and wonders which of them is next on the Monitor's hit list. The two are then attacked by the [[Forerunner (DC Comics)|Forerunner]], but before she can kill them, the apologetic Monitor stops her, and recruits Jason and Donna for a mission to the Palmerverse, a section of the Nanoverse discovered by [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]], in an attempt to find Palmer. During the trip, Jason takes it upon himself to name the Monitor \"Bob\". Jason seems to have a romantic interest in Donna, and is shown to be visibly disgruntled when her old boyfriend [[Kyle Rayner]] joins their group as they take their tour to the 52 [[Earth]]s which comprise the [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]].\n\n====Red Robin====\n[[File:Red Robin Todd.jpg|thumb|upright|Jason Todd taking the role of [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]]]]\nA teaser image released to promote ''Countdown'' showed a figure resembling [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]] among assembled heroes in poses symbolic of their roles in the series. After a series of [[Countdown to Final Crisis#Promotional campaign|contradictory statements]] about this figure, executive editor [[Dan DiDio]] firmly stated in the July 2007 DC Nation column that the figure is Jason Todd. The Red Robin costume, originally designed by [[Alex Ross]] for the 1996 ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' limited series and worn by the Earth-22 Dick Grayson, is seen in ''Countdown to Final Crisis'' #16 in the Earth-51 Batman's base of operations; it is revealed that Earth-51 became the peaceful world it is because the Batman of this Earth killed all the supervillains after his Jason was killed by the Joker. In issue #14, Jason dons the Red Robin suit\u2014described by Earth-51's Batman as something he was going to give Todd's counterpart when he was older\u2014and goes into battle alongside Earth-51 Batman. During a battle with a group of Monarch's soldiers, Earth-51 Batman is killed by the [[Ultraman (comics)|Ultraman]] of [[Earth-Three#New Multiverse|Earth-3]], deeply affecting Jason. In his grief, Todd kills an alternate version of the Joker, also involved in Batman's killing, who then mocks his loss, vacating alongside Donna, Ray and Kyle to the planet [[Apokolips]] before Earth-51's destruction.\n\nAfter the group is sent back to Earth, Todd leaves the group and returns to his crimefighting ways. When the Morticoccus virus is released from [[Karate Kid (comics)|Karate Kid]]'s body, he is forcibly brought back to the group by Kyle, much to his dismay. When the Challengers return to New Earth, Todd disposes of his Red Robin costume and abandons the rest of the group, though they go on to declare to the Monitors that they are now the monitors of the Monitors. Todd and Drake are confronted by another Red Robin in ''Robin'' #177, whose identity is initially a mystery but later turns out to be [[General (DC Comics)|Ulysses Armstrong]]. Due to a combination of Red Robin's involvement and a gun-toting gang member, Todd was shot in the leg and arrested by police. Upon the resolution of the gang war in Gotham, Drake under a pseudonym visited Todd in prison to give him the [[Justice League]] access code to release himself from prison. Todd is booked under a pseudonym (John Doe), due to there being no identifiable prints on file for any member of the main bat heroes as well as Jason is still legally dead.<ref>''Robin'' (vol. 4) #182 (March 2009)</ref> Following his escape, Todd continues on the mend, and is summoned by Tim Drake to come to the Batcave, where Batman has left a Last Will and Testament statement for him. After hearing the statement in private, Todd prepares to leave, not revealing what he was told, although he does pause before his old costume and the tattered remains of Batman's, he is clearly sad.<ref>''Robin'' (vol. 4) #183 (April 2009)</ref>\n\n====Batman====\nJason Todd reappeared in the \"[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl|Battle for the Cowl]]\" series. Dressed in a version of a Batman costume, Todd is also living/operating out of an abandoned Gotham subway system. His inner monologue reveals that he had always wanted to eventually replace Batman, and thinks it was a bad idea for Batman to become a public figure, rather than an [[urban legend]].\n\nAfter stabbing Tim Drake in the chest with a batarang, he and Dick Grayson battle down in the subway.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl'' #2 (April 2009)</ref> Nightwing still wants to save Todd, but Todd refuses the offer, and instead allows himself to fall off a speeding subway into the Gotham River, while stating they would see each other again soon. This allowed Grayson to officially take up the mantle of Batman.<ref>''Battle for the Cowl'' #3 (May 2009)</ref>\n\nIt is later revealed in ''Battle for the Cowl'' that Bruce Wayne's last words to Jason were of regret at how he had obviously overlooked the young man's deep emotional problems. He thought he could do what could never be done for him and 'make him whole'. His message goes on to plead that Todd get psychiatric help, a notion that the latter rejects. It is suggested by Dick Grayson that Todd was infuriated by Wayne's last words, a reaction that led him to becoming monstrous, murdering Batman in that same arc. Plus, it aggravated his hatred towards the Bat-family, as he repeatedly attempts to kill members of it.\n\n====Red Hood and Scarlet====\nIn the second story arc of ''[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]]'' by [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Philip Tan]], Jason Todd retakes the Red Hood mantle after losing his bid to become the new Batman. With the goal of making the very concept of Batman obsolete, he puts a lot of effort into [[public relations]]: he drastically alters his Red Hood costume to look more like a traditional superhero outfit and recruits his own sidekick Scarlet.( He also is balding). In their war on crime, Red Hood and Scarlet freely kill criminals, villains, and anyone who gets in their way, even the police. He leaves behind a calling card which states \"let the punishment fit the crime\". He describes his vendetta against Grayson as \"the revenge of one crazy man in a mask on another crazy man in a mask\".<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #3 (October 2009)</ref><ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #4 (November 2009)</ref>\n\nTodd has reappeared with red hair, claiming that he is a natural red-head and that Bruce Wayne had him dye his hair black in order to look like Dick Grayson (as in his pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] origins). He also claims the white streak of hair that he got is from being resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, though the white streak disappears again.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #5 (December 2009)</ref> In the issue, Todd is characterized as increasingly unstable and his idea of \"finishing off\" Batman and Robin now consists of stripping them down to their underwear and exposing their identities via webcam activated by a phone poll [a nod by Morrison to his own death poll]. A fight between Batman, Robin, and the Flamingo \u2013 a foreign hitman hired by a Mexican cartel after Red Hood killed their operative in Gotham \u2013 ends with Jason burying Flamingo in debris with a bulldozer. Flamingo is assumed dead, although Commissioner Gordon reports that his body cannot be recovered from beneath the rubble.\n\nGrayson offers to rehabilitate Todd who, in a moment of clarity, tells Grayson it is too late for him, and how he tried to be what Batman wanted, \"but this world... this dirty, twisted, cruel and ugly dungheap had... other plans for me\". He then proceeds to fall back into his hero persona, ranting how he did what Batman never did. He \"defeated his archenemy\". Todd is arrested by Gordon who informs him that the reason he has always worked with Batman is that Batman never violates the law \"where it counts\". As Gordon leads him away, Todd tauntingly asks Grayson why he has not put Wayne's corpse into a Lazarus Pit to bring him back, citing his own resurrection from its bath. Scarlet flees Gotham, her mask finally falling from her face as she exits the city limits.<ref name=\"Robin' 2009\">''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #6 (January 2010)</ref>\n\nJason files an appeal to be moved from Arkham Asylum where he has been held for observation for the last several months. Bruce Wayne as Batman visits him there to inform Jason he's in Arkham for his own protection. Jason points out he's passed all the psychological tests repeatedly and there is no reason to keep him in what he calls Batman's \"kennel of freaks\". It is also revealed that, like Tim, Jason was also aware that Batman survived his encounter with Darkseid. Jason is transferred to a Gotham prison and upon his arrival, the suicide rate spikes amongst top incarcerated crime figures there. Several homicides occur due to many botched attempts on Jason's life by inmates with a grudge against Red Hood's tactics. Jason escalates things further by poisoning the cafeteria, killing 82 and sickening 100 more inmates. He is immediately transferred back to Arkham but is broken out of the paddy wagon by a group of mercenaries.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #23 (July 2011)</ref> The mercs reveal they are under orders to bring Jason to the person that hired them and that he is in no danger. Jason breaks free and fights them off all the same as Batman and Robin arrive. Once the hired guns are subdued they reveal their employer has captured Scarlet, Jason's former sidekick. Dick, Damian, and Jason go to one of the Red Hood's weapon caches where he assembles a composite costume made from his biker and \"superhero\" Red Hood attire. The three intend to rescue Scarlet.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #24 (August 2011)</ref> After Batman and Robin defeat the mercs, Red Hood rescues Scarlet and escapes using the helicopter. Batman and Robin attempt to chase him, but Red Hood tells them that he planted bombs over Gotham City months ago. Scarlet desires to stay with Red Hood as his partner. Red Hood and Scarlet head towards an unknown destination.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' (vol. 1) #25 (September 2011)</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n====Origin====\nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Jason's new origin is revealed in a special ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0 (November 2012) issue, which changes the manner in which Batman first met Todd (stealing medicine from [[Leslie Thompkins]], after she had treated him from a brutal beating). The back-up introduces a massive [[retcon]] in which the Joker is responsible for orchestrating the major moments of Todd's life such as his father's imprisonment and death, his mother's overdose, his introduction to Thompkins and his adoption of the Robin identity. Considering the Joker is the one narrating this segment, it is open to debate whether he is telling the truth or not. Though only lightly touched on, his resurrection is also simplified: he is resurrected after he is placed into the Lazarus Pit by Talia al Ghul.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0</ref>\n\n====The Outlaws====\n{{main|Red Hood and the Outlaws}}\n[[File:Robin Jason Todd.jpg|thumb|200px|Jason Todd as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] in ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #0 (November 2012). Art by Brett Booth]]\nFollowing the events of the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" storyline, the DC universe was relaunched, with Red Hood becoming the leader of the Outlaws in their own series, part of the [[The New 52|New 52]] line of comics. The team also includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]] and [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]]. Instead of being trained by various men after his return from the dead, Jason Todd was trained by an order of warriors known as the All Caste.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #3(January 2012)</ref> He was a part of the order for an unknown amount of time before he was exiled, partly of his own will.<ref name=rata2>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #2 (December 2011)</ref> After his exile, he became Red Hood and came to be odds with Dick Grayson, Starfire's ex-lover and his Robin predecessor. He soon tires of Gotham and leaves, gathering the group together; after breaking out Roy from a Middle Eastern prison, he brings Roy up to speed on things. The two start on very friendly terms. Roy and Starfire are in a sexual relationship. However, Starfire makes it clear to Roy that it is only physical, with no emotional ties. Essence, a fellow exiled member of the All Caste whom Jason knows, appears to him, but is invisible to others. She sets Jason on a mission to hunt down a group known as \"The Untitled\", telling him of people missing organs before death without any sign of removal, which is their calling card. To top it off, Essence shows that the order of the All Caste, the people most qualified to handle the situation, have been slaughtered, leaving her and Jason as the only known survivors.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #1 (November 2011)</ref> After finding out he's no longer the killer he once was, Jason brings his group to the All Caste headquarters, the Hundred Acres of All, where they discover the bodies are returning to life as zombies. Jason is forced to destroy the bodies of his teachers and friends. Afterwards, he pays his respects, swearing vengeance for them.<ref name=rata2 /> He is led on a wild goose chase across the globe. Eventually, he comes across an Untitled, who was in hiding, who tells him that they were set up, but still fights him. Jason kills the creature, strengthening his resolve.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #5 (March 2012)</ref>\n\nTodd has also been revealed to be a member of [[Batman, Incorporated]], initially operating under the name of Wingman, an agent based in Europe. Wingman temporary allies himself with [[Damian Wayne]], who is using the name \"Redbird\" at the time. Batman, Inc is at war with an organisation named Leviathan, headed by Talia al Ghul, Damian's mother and the woman responsible for reviving Jason, but in the present she seeks to destroy Batman and has put a bounty on their son's head. Alfred Pennyworth refers to Jason as wanting \"to be redeemed\" through his membership.<ref>''Batman Inc'' #7</ref> Later, however, the Wingman ruse is exposed and Todd returns to being Red Hood. While he recalls his days as Wingman as a failure, Bruce Wayne is nevertheless proud of him. Following the events of ''[[Death of the Family]]'', Bruce and Alfred care for a sick Jason in the Manor, culminating in a warm embrace between Jason and his father figure as he regains consciousness, suggesting that their animosity might finally be put to rest.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #18 (2013)</ref> After Jason recovers and in the wake of Damian's death, Batman partners with Jason for the first time since Jason's days as Robin. Batman brings Jason on a mission in Ethiopia to punish some of Damian's other would-be assassins, and while there he also takes him to the place of his death in the hopes Jason can provide insights into his resurrection so that he might apply the method to Damian. Jason is hurt by Batman's manipulation, and the two share harsh words and exchange blows, shattering their newfound relationship.<ref>''Batman and Red Hood'' #20</ref> Later however, the pair come together, united by the ties of family. Jason teams up with Batman, Batgirl, [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] and [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]] to rescue Damian's body from [[Apokolips]]. They are successful, and Damian is resurrected, sharing a warm reunion with Jason and the family.<ref>''Robin Rises: Alpha'' #1</ref>\n\nFollowing the traumas of ''Death of the Family'', Damian's death, and his betrayal by Batman, Jason returns to the All-Caste and has his memories wiped so that he may be at peace. He is 'rescued' by Starfire and Arsenal, but does not regain his memories.<ref>''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' #20</ref> He subsequently learns of his history from Starfire's computer, which states Red Hood has made 83 confirmed kills.

The series eventually ended coinciding with the [[DC Rebirth]] event.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===DC Comics Rebirth===\n====Red Hood and the Outlaws====\n\nThe [[DC Rebirth]] introduced the revival of ''[[Red Hood and the Outlaws]]'' with a second volume released in August 2016. Jason Todd's backstory is altered to resemble his original meeting with Batman occurring while trying to steal tires from the Batmobile. Jason's mother is already dead by now and his father is serving a life sentence in prison, so he has been living on the streets. Batman at first tries helping him by enrolling him in Ma Gunn's boarding school, trying to give him a home. However he does not realise that Ma Gunn is actually using the school as a cover to recruit young delinquents into her own criminal gang. When Batman discovers this, he takes down Ma Gunn, with help from Jason.\n\nBatman then takes him in and raises him as the new Robin, though realizes early on that Jason has a violent streak. After Jason is killed by the Joker and resurrected in the Lazarus Pit, he goes on to become the Red Hood, straining his relationship with Batman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/29041-dc-rebirth-first-look-red-hood-the-outlaws-retells-jason-batmans-1st-meeting.html|title=DC REBIRTH First Look: RED HOOD & THE OUTLAWS Retells JASON & BATMAN\u2019s 1st Meeting|website=Newsarama.com|access-date=2016-05-30}}</ref> The new team consists of Jason Todd as [[Red Hood]], the disgraced Amazon warrior named [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], and the [[Superman]] clone called [[Bizarro]]. This team is referred to as DC's \"Dark Trinity\" in comparison to the new Trinity series included in [[DC Rebirth]] which follows [[Batman]], [[Superman]], and [[Wonder Woman]]. The team would stay together until Red Hood and the Outlaws #25-26, where Jason went solo after his team disappeared and the title was changed to Red Hood: Outlaw. He also later appears in [[Year of the Villain]] and Event Leviathan #2.\n\n==Abilities and equipment==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Skills and abilities===\nTo become Robin, Jason Todd was trained by Bruce Wayne, just as Dick Grayson was, rigorously training him in [[acrobatics]], detective work, strategy, and [[martial arts]]. After his resurrection, he expands on his training by learning from people of the same caliber as those who trained his ex-mentor Batman, becoming highly skilled in the aforementioned fields by the time he reaches his adulthood. Jason's fighting style emphasizes brutality, speed, and strength, incorporating [[Aikido]], [[Capoeira]], [[Karate]], [[Kickboxing]], [[Krav Maga]], [[Ninjutsu]], [[Savate]], [[Silat]], and [[Taekwondo]]. With an extensive knowledge of Batman's tactics, Jason can anticipate most of his former mentor's actions and counter them.\n\nThrough Talia al Ghul's access to [[Kord Enterprises|Kord Industries]],<ref name=b635 /><ref>''Batman Annual'' (vol. 1) #1 (Summer 1961)</ref> as well as being [[LexCorp]]'s former CEO,<ref>Rucka, Greg (w), Eaglesham, Dale (p), Kryssing, Ray (i),  Comicraft (let), Mike Carlin (ed). \"Most Suitable Person\" ''President Luthor Secret Files and Origins'' (March, 2001), New York: DC Comics</ref> Jason has access to high-level civilian and military-grade [[weapon]]ry including [[firearm]]s such as pistols, machine guns, shotguns, etc. He also has access to [[explosive material|explosives]], [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launchers]], and advanced computer equipment and gadgetry. However, his dagger (which resembles a [[kris]] and is a replica of one of Ra's al Ghul's knives) still remains as his preferred weapon of choice for hand-to-hand combat; it can cut through Batman's armor and arsenal. He also has some lethally sharpened [[shuriken]]s based on Batman's batarang designs as throwing weapons.\n\n===Firearms===\nHaving been trained by Batman, Jason Todd has perfect aim when using batarangs and later, firearms.  To increase his skill with firearms, he went a step further than Batman on his journey around the world to learn from masters how to kill a target with different types of guns.  His weapons of choice are a pair of customized [[IWI Jericho 941]]s, fitted with extra picatinny rails and mini red dot sights.\n\n==Alternative versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\n\n===''The Dark Knight Returns''===\n{{main|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns}}\n''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which was published before \"A Death in the Family\", references Jason Todd. Jason Todd is implied to have died in the line of duty, although the exact details are not given. It is implied that Todd's death was a contributing factor to Batman's retirement. When Batman allows [[Carrie Kelley]] to assume the mantle of Robin, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] objects, citing Todd as a reason. Batman responds by stating \"I will never forget Jason. He was a good soldier. He honored me. But the war goes on.\"\n\nThe details of Jason's death is revealed in the comic book one-shot ''Dark Knight Returns: The Last Crusade,'' by the first series' author [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] with [[Brian Azzarello]], and art by [[John Romita, Jr.]] Romita reveals that the Joker, like in the \"A Death in the Family\" story arc, plays an important role in Jason Todd's demise in Miller's Dark Knight Universe.

At first, Jason refuses to take orders from Nightwing or work with the other Robins, but Damian threatens him by telling him that he knows his fate and can make it happen sooner than expected, referencing his death in the comics. Nightwing notes that Jason fights aggressively, like he's angry at the world and doesn't hold back.\n\n===''Flashpoint''===\n{{main|Flashpoint (comics)}}\nAn alternate version of Jason appears in the ''[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]'' timeline, where, among other changes, Bruce Wayne was killed as a child and thus never became Batman. Here Jason is portrayed as a former drug-addict and follower of [[Brother Blood]] who eventually turned his life around and became a priest. He still died, but was eventually resurrected and recovered from it physically and mentally.<ref>''Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint'' #2 (July 2011)</ref>\n\n===''A World Without Young Justice''===\nIn this alternate timeline, there appeared a version of Jason.

Despite his reckless nature, Dick chose Jason as his successor when he temporarily left S.H.I.E.L.D. to attend college. As Moonwing, he made a careless mistake, which resulted in a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent's death, causing him to be dismissed from S.H.I.E.L.D. Jason became furious and blamed his mentors. He was then caught in an explosion when the villain Hyena detonated a bomb intended to kill Bruce and [[Wolverine (character)|Dark Claw]]. Despite his body never being recovered, S.H.I.E.L.D. presumed he was dead, but he survived and his body was recovered by [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]], who replaced his damaged body parts with robotic parts, transforming him into [[Deathlok]]. He then participated in a coup to help [[Catwoman|Madame Cat]] overthrow the Supreme Leader of Hydra, [[Lex Luthor]] a.k.a. Green Skull. Afterwards, he swore allegiance to her. Later, when S.H.I.E.L.D. agents launched an attack on HYDRA's base, Deathlok was sent to confront them, where he spotted his former mentor, Moonwing and attacked him from behind. He then revealed that he's been waiting a long time to kill both Dick and Bruce. He then unmasked Moonwing and accused him and Bruce of abandoning him. He then began strangling Dick, but before he could kill him Colonel [[Nick Fury]] and [[Sgt. Rock|Sergeant Joe Rock]] commandeered an aircraft and shot Deathlok several times in the back. Despite feeling sorry for Jason, Dick left Jason to die again so he could continue the attack on the HYDRA base.<ref>''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1</ref> This is noteworthy as this version  of the character was introduced nine years before the canon Jason was resurrected as Red Hood.\n\n===''Batman: Arkham Knight''===\n{{main|Batman: Arkham}}\n\nJason Todd, as the [[Arkham Knight]], is featured in the tie-in comics to the ''Batman: Arkham'' video game series.

Kate called him her \"pettirojo\" (Robin) and her \"Capucho Rojo\" (Red Hood). Jas\u00f3n was the rebellion's mascot, often carrying their flag and using his street smarts to help Kate and Renee in various scenarios. He is eventually shot and killed by [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] during one of their battles. Batwoman told Huntress of his story in an attempt to convince her not to risk her life so often through rebellion.<ref>''DC Bombshells'' #16</ref>\n\nIn the ''Bombshells United'' storyline, Kate Kane and Renee Montoya meet Talia al Ghul and Cheetah in an underground labyrinth.

He was resurrected by Ra's Al Ghul and began working for Ghul's cause as an impostor Batman. He is later convinced by Damian to turn against Ra's when Ra's takes it too far by using Amazo to slaughter millions.<ref>''Injustice 2'' #46</ref>\n\n===''Batman: White Knight''===\nIn the ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'' continuity, Jason Todd took the mantle of Robin before Dick Grayson did, and in some point of the story, he was captured and tortured by the Joker, who was trying to make him tell him Batman's secret identity. Harley Quinn stopped him before he could kill Jason and called Batman for help. But when they returned to the hideout, Todd had disappeared. They couldn't find him and Jason was presumed dead. Some time later, after the Joker's cured from his insanity, Harleen tells him about Jason, and Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) says that he can't remember what happened to Todd. Dick tells Barbara that Jason was Bruce's favorite.<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #2</ref><ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #3</ref> Later, Jack reveals to Batman that he remembered what he did with Jason after he tortured him. Jack reveals that Jason eventually broke from the torture and said \"I wish I'd never met Bruce Wayne\", and that Joker let Jason go free.  Batman then asks why Jason never returned to him, Jack says that the Joker was jealous of Robin for knowing who Batman was and Jason hated him so much for making him Robin that he disappeared.<ref>''Batman: White Knight'' #7</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n{{See also|Robin in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n<!-- Do NOT add Red-X from the 2004 TEEN TITANS cartoon.

Jason first met [[Batman]] when he stole the [[Batmobile]]'s tires in Crime Alley. The Dark Knight then pitied Jason and took him in to take up the Robin mantle after Dick Grayson became Nightwing. Though gifted in both mind and body, time passed and Jason grew increasingly violent, not understanding why his mentor did not kill the criminals they faced. When [[Ra's al Ghul]] hired the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] to distract the Dynamic Duo, Robin sought to kill the Joker while Batman fought the villain's goons. However, the Joker had set a trap and captured Jason before brutally beating him with a crowbar. The Joker then left Jason's severely injured body in a warehouse set to explode. Before Batman could get to him in time, Jason perished in the explosion. Feeling guilt for inadvertently causing Jason's death, Ra's retrieved his body and resurrected him with a [[Lazarus Pit]]. However, the effects drove Jason insane, and subsequently disappeared after escaping Ra's compound. Five years later, he returns to Gotham City under the Red Hood alias, convincing all of Gotham's gangsters to join him in overtaking Gotham's most powerful crime lord [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]. After encountering Batman and Nightwing, Red Hood's taunting reveals his knowledge of the Dark Knight's secret identity, and Batman eventually learns that his former partner had returned from the dead under the Joker's former criminal identity. Red Hood then attacked the Black Mask, prompting the crime lord to break the Joker out of prison to help due to his difficulty to infiltrate his killer's heavily guarded cell. After capturing the Joker, Jason lures Batman to an abandoned building where the three of them exchange words. Jason states that he forgave Batman for not saving him, but is angered that Batman had allowed the Joker to live, and continue murdering for years after his death; Todd thinks his own death should have been the final straw. After Batman disarms Jason, the former Boy Wonder activates explosives placed throughout the building, resulting in Batman apprehending the Joker once more. After the explosion, Jason's body is nowhere to be found, leaving his fate ambiguous.\n* Jason Todd has a cameo appearance in the 2016 animated film ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke (film)|Batman: The Killing Joke]]''. A picture of Robin's beaten body is shown in the Batcave.\n* Three boys named Dick, Jason and Tim appears in ''[[Batman: Gotham by Gaslight (film)|Batman: Gotham by Gaslight]]'' trying to rob a couple before being stopped by Batman.

Rather than being kidnapped and murdered by the Joker, Jason simply left Batman after believing that he didn't care about him and later took on the Red Hood persona. In the film, Red Hood teams up with [[Two-Face]] to get revenge on Batman and places 5 bombs throughout Gotham, challenging the Bat-Family to get them all. While they succeed, Red Hood kidnaps each of them and takes over the Batcave. When Batman arrives, he deduces that Jason is Red Hood and apologizes to him. Making amends with Batman, Jason releases the Bat-Family and reveals that the bombs contained confetti. He later helps Batman take down Two-Face.\n\n===Video games===\n\n* The Red Hood appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]].<ref>[https://twitter.com/LEGOBatmanGame/status/525763210696470528/photo/1]</ref>\n* The Red Hood appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Cameron Bowen reprising his role.\n\n====''Batman: Arkham'' series====\n* Jason Todd appears as the titular villain of [[Rocksteady Studios]]' ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'' (2015), voiced again by [[Troy Baker]]. Rather than being killed during his tenure as Robin, this version was captured and tortured by the Joker in an abandoned wing of [[Arkham Asylum]] years prior to the events of the series' [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|first installment]]. After a year of torment, the Joker fractured Jason's psyche by revealing to him that he had been replaced in the role of Robin by [[Tim Drake]]. Eventually, the Joker brands Jason, and films a video in which he \"kills\" him, which he then sends to Batman to torment him over his failure of saving Jason. However, the Joker secretly provided Jason with a [[body armor]] so that he would survive the gunshot and would later go on to exact his revenge on Batman for abandoning him. This eventually becomes true, as Jason later escapes from Arkham and adopts the \"'''[[Arkham Knight]]'''\" persona, becoming a highly skilled mercenary for hire and even creating his own legion of mercenaries called the Militia. During the events of ''Arkham Knight'', which take place roughly one year after the Joker's [[Batman: Arkham City|death]], Arkham Knight strikes a partnership with [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] and aids him with his plans of destroying Gotham City with his fear toxin, in the hopes of finally exacting his revenge on Batman. Eventually, after several encounters where the Arkham Knight is shown to know all of Batman's secrets and weaknesses, as well as several flashbacks of Jason's torture and apparent death at the hands of the Joker, Batman confronts the mysterious villain after he has kidnapped [[James Gordon (character)|Commissioner Gordon]], where the Arkham Knight finally unmasks himself as Jason and prepares to kill Batman once and for all. Batman and Jason then engage in a battle, with the former emerging victorious, although he refuses to deliver the final punch to Jason, who then vanishes, abandoning the Arkham Knight persona. Despite this, the Militia continue to operate in Gotham under Scarecrow's command, who ultimately unmasks Batman in front of the world on television and injects him with his fear toxin, but he is rescued by a now redeemed Jason, allowing Batman to defeat and apperhend the villain once and for all. At the end of the game, Batman seemingly commits suicide to keep his loved one safe now that his secret identity has been revealed. \n**Jason later takes on the Red Hood persona, serving as the main playable protagonist of the self-titled \"Red Hood Story Pack\" [[Downloadable content|DLC]] mission, which is set some time after the main story's ending. To honor his former mentor's legacy, Red Hood becomes a ruthless vigilante and begins fighting crime in Gotham on his own, though he is shown to have no problem with executing criminals, with his arsenal consisting of a pair of pistols in a single hit, [[Stun grenade|flashbangs]], and the Zip-Kick (a small grapple hook that allows him to grab and pull himself to enemies). In the DLC, Red Hood hunts down [[Black Mask (character)|Black Mask]]'s men across Gotham, until eventually learning about his wherabouts and defeating him in a fight. Black Mask then attempts to negotiate with Red Hood, promising him everything, even saying that he will leave Gotham permanently and go anywhere Red Hood tells him to, but Jason ironically responds with \"How about you go to hell\", before throwing him out a window and quipping \"Say hi to Joker from me\" as Black Mask falls to his death.\n**Both of Jason's alter-egos, the Arkham Knight and Red Hood, were later added as playable characters for the game's challenge maps.\n* The scene of Jason Todd's \"death\" in ''Batman: Arkham Knight'' can be viewed in ''[[Batman: Arkham VR]]''.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* The Arkham Knight is playable in the [[mobile app]] version of ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com.au/injustice-mobile-game-update-adds-reverse-flash-arkham-knight-survival-mode-more-1477516|date=2015-10-24|accessdate=2015-10-24|last=Parungo|first=Nicolo|publisher=[[International Business Times]]|title=Injustice mobile game update adds Reverse Flash, Arkham Knight, Survival Mode and more}}</ref>\n* The Red Hood appears as a DLC playable character in ''[[Injustice 2]]'', voiced by [[Cameron Bowen]].

Created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Pat Broderick]], he first appeared in [[Batman: Year Three|''Batman'' #436]] (August 1989) as the third character to assume the role of Batman's vigilante partner '''[[Robin (character)|Robin]]'''. Following the events in ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'' in 2009, Drake adopted the alias of '''[[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]'''. In 2019, Tim returned to his original Robin persona in the Wonder Comics relaunch of ''[[Young Justice]]'', but later adopted his current codename '''Drake'''.\n\nAs a young boy, Tim was in the audience the night Dick Grayson's parents were murdered and later managed to discover the identities of Batman and the original Robin through their exploits. After the death of the second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], and witnessing Batman spiral into darkness, Tim was convinced that he should train to become the third Robin.\n\nThe character has been featured in various adaptations, including the animated television series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'', and the video game series ''[[Batman: Arkham]]''. In 2011, Tim Drake was ranked 32nd in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.\n\n==Publication history==\nTim Drake was named after [[Tim Burton]], director of the then-upcoming [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film]], and introduced in 1989's ''Batman: Year Three'' and his origin detailed in ''Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 241 |quote = With the pencils of [George] P\u00e9rez, Jim Aparo, and Tom Grummett, [Marv] Wolfman concocted the five-issue 'A Lonely Place of Dying'...In it, Tim Drake...earned his place as the new Robin.}}</ref> in which he first introduced himself to [[Dick Grayson]] and impressed the former Robin with his skills. This led to Grayson and later [[Alfred Pennyworth]], Bruce Wayne's butler, to support Tim's request to be Batman's new partner. Not wanting to make the same mistake as he did with [[Jason Todd]], Batman had Tim endure an intensive period of training that was never given to his predecessors. Eventually, after Tim rescues Batman from [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], he proves his capability and becomes Robin. ''Batman'' editor Dennis O'Neil hoped that Grayson's approval of Drake would ease reader acceptance of him. Evidently, this approach was successful with the character being so accepted by readers that, after three successful miniseries, the character had his own 183-issue series from 1993 through 2009.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 261: \"\"[Robin] embarked on a solo career, with the help of writer Chuck Dixon and artist Tom Grummett.\"</ref><ref name=\"comic101\">{{cite web|last=Tipton|first=Scott|url=http://www.comics101.com/comics101//?mode=project&action=view&project=Comics%20101&chapter=56|title=Heroes and Villains: Batman, Part IV|date=2003-12-17|publisher=Comics 101 Archive|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> Mike Mullins on ''[[Newsarama]]'' has stated:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout [the entire Robin series], the character of Robin has been captured consistently, showing him to step up to greater and greater challenges. Robin is a character who shows initiative and is driven to do what he views as right. He knows he is living up to a legacy left by Dick Grayson and strives to not disappoint Bruce Wayne, Batman. Tim is a more natural detective than previous Robins and is talented with computers, which allows him to stand in his own unique spotlight. Unlike his predecessors, Tim is not the most proficient combatant and has had to really work on his fighting technique, taking up the bo staff to give him an edge that Batman does not need. Tim almost always seeks to analyze a problem and to outthink his opponent but has shown the ability to win a fight when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mullins|first=Mike|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/040926-Robin.html|title=Reminiscing About Robin: A Look Back in Wonder|date=2009-04-26|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Robin, the character has also been featured prominently in the [[Young Justice]] and 2003 [[Teen Titans]] series. As of June 2009, he took on the new identity of Red Robin, starring in yet another series by the same name.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Introduction===\nTim Drake is the son of [[Jack Drake]] and Janet Drake, coming from the same social class as Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"batmanunauthorized\">{{cite book|title=Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City|last1=Porter|first1=Alan J.|authorlink=Alan J.

Inspired by the heroes' exploits, Tim trained himself in martial arts, acrobatics, detective skills, and scholastics to better himself both physically and intellectually. When Tim reached the age of thirteen, he saw that Batman had grown reckless and violent following the second Robin ([[Jason Todd]])'s murder by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. After his mother's death and his father's paralysis, Drake decided to intervene and Batman eventually enlisted him as the third Robin.\n\n===Robin (1989\u20132009)===\n[[File:Robin Tim Drake.jpg|thumb|Tim Drake's red and black Robin costume in ''Detective Comics'' #829 (May 2007).

He was approached by [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s assassins who were also interested in finding out what happened to Batman. At the same time, [[Tamara Fox|Tamara \"Tam\" Fox]], Lucius Fox's daughter, has been sent to find Tim Drake to bring him back to Gotham. Tim goes to Iraq and manages to discover definitive proof that Bruce was alive and lost in time, but was ambushed by an assassin from the Council of Spiders. He manages to drive himself and Pru (one of the assassins working for Ra's al Ghul, who had become an ally of Tim's) to Tam's hotel room, and they are promptly abducted by the League of Assassins.\n\nAlthough initially reluctant, Tim Drake entered into an alliance with Ra's before nearly bleeding to death due to their encounter with the Council of Spiders. He was put in charge of the [[League of Assassins]] by Ra's and used the time to simultaneously plan how to stop the Council of Spiders and destroy the League of Assassins. After failing to foil all but one of the Council's assassination attempts, Tim realizes that the Council will be attacking the League's base, and realizes that he left Tam in danger at the base. Rushing back to base, he simultaneously manages to delay the Council of Spiders, blow up the League's base, and escape with Tam.\n\nAfter crippling Ra's' League of Assassins, Drake returns to Gotham City to overthrow Ra's plans to use [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] (surgically altered to resemble Bruce Wayne) to gain control of the Wayne family resources and destroy all that Batman held dear by directing his assassins to target all of the Batman's associates. Realizing that these attacks are a smokescreen and that the real target is coercing Hush to sign away Wayne Enterprises, Red Robin decides to confront Ra's head on. He calls upon all of his friends to protect the various targets. Drake has since moved back to Gotham City and reestablished ties with his family and friends.\n\nAfter Bruce Wayne's return, Tim begins to aid his plans for expanding their mission globally with [[Batman, Inc.]]<ref>''Red Robin'' #17 (Jan. 2011)</ref> Tim is eventually appointed as the head of the newest incarnation of the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] that now serve as Batman Inc.'s black-ops wing.<ref>''Batman Inc.'' #6 (May 2011)</ref> Red Robin eventually rejoins the Teen Titans and takes over leadership from [[Cassie Sandsmark|Wonder Girl]].

Art by [[Brett Booth]].]] \nIn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, ''Teen Titans'' #0 revealed Tim Drake's new origin, showing a large departure from his original origin, removing his connections to Dick Grayson's origin story. In the New 52, Tim is a talented athlete and computer genius who comes close to discovering the Batman's identity but never totally figures it out. When Tim finds the Batman and gets rejected for the role of sidekick, he decides to bring the Batman to him, by hacking the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s bank account and donating millions of dollars thus putting his family in danger. The Penguin's goons come after Tim and his family, but the Batman saves them. Tim's parents are forced to go into witness protection, but they believe Tim deserves better and ask Bruce to take care of him for them. The Witness Protection Program renames him \"Tim Drake,\" and he takes on the identity of \"Red Robin\", rather than the identity of \"Robin\", out of respect to Jason Todd. In recent issues he is shown to be a founding member of the Teen Titans as well as their leader, and he shows feelings for Wonder Girl.\n\nTim was unwilling to meet with the rest of the Bat-Family at the Batcave after he was infected with the Joker's new compound \"HA\". He was present when Damian was killed by The Heretic and admitted to Bruce that even though he had a dysfunctional relationship with Damian that he did grieve for him. He was also at the final battle between Batman and The Heretic when [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]] killed her son's clone and blew up Wayne Tower.\n\nTim was also part of the Bat-Family's assembled team which went to Apokolips to retrieve Damian's body. As their mission focused on retrieving Robin, Tim, Jason, and Barbara wore costumes which resembled Damian's colors and each wore a Robin symbol. Following the completion of their mission and the revival of Damian he handed him the Robin symbol on his suit to welcome Damian back to life and to the role of Robin.\n\nIn the pre-Convergence timeline of Futures End, Refugees from Earth-2 are given a signal from Brother Eye, which allow them into the Earth-0 Universe, but start a war when [[Darkseid]] follows them, leading to the deaths of the Teen Titans, except for Drake. Tim abandons his Red Robin mantle and becomes a bartender until an attack by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], where changes to the timeline are made. Brainiac is captured, and Terry McGinnis dies at the hands of Brother Eye's Batman-Joker hybrid. Tim dons the Batman Beyond suit and goes back in time and prevents Brother Eye from sending the signal to Earth-2, creating a new future where there is less destruction, and the events of Convergence and everything afterwards take place. Tim is launched into the new future, 35 years later, where he becomes the new Batman and destroys a weakened Brother Eye.\n\n===DC Rebirth (2016\u2013present)===\nIn Rebirth, Tim Drake still operates under the Red Robin alias. He gains a new and third overall Red Robin suit similar to his first Robin suit except with two \"R\"s as his logo instead of one. It is revealed later on in Detective Comics #965 that Tim Drake's origin story has reverted to that of the original universe, where he discovers Batman and Robin's identities after Jason Todd's death, and became Robin before adopting the Red Robin persona.\n\n[[File:Red Robin (Tim Drake - circa 2018).png|thumb|upright|Tim Drake as [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]] in ''Detective Comics'' #981 (May 2018).

Unable to accept a future where he decides to become Batman, Tim is forced to aid his older-self in evading and containing a freed Doomsday.

Lost in the Multiverse, Young Justice struggles to return home, with Tim taking on the new identity of Drake.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n\n===Combat skills===\nPrior to becoming Robin, Tim Drake had been trained in the martial arts and was already a skilled and abled fighter, while also being trained in fields such as acrobatics, forensics, detective work and criminology. After becoming Robin, Drake managed to hone his fighting skills and eventually became a master hand-to-hand combatant and expert martial artist, being skilled in several fighting styles, such as [[Aikido]],<ref>''Batman Chronicles'' #22 (September 2000)</ref> [[Judo]], [[Karate]],<ref>''Batman'' vol. 1 #442 (December 1989)</ref> [[Savate]],<ref>''Secret Origins 80-Page Giant'' #1 (October 1998)</ref> [[Kung Fu]], [[Ninjutsu]], and [[Tai Chi]]<ref>''Robin'' vol. 2 #103 (August 2002)</ref>  in addition to being trained in [[gymnastics]], and was taught by numerous teachers including Batman, Dick Grayson, and Lady Shiva. Though he has been bested and beaten by other members of the Batfamily; notably Jason, he is shown to be a calculating and cunning combatant. Damian sucker punched Tim in one of their early encounters and that for a time Tim had a habit of holding back when facing off against Damian. When Tim finally decided not to hold back, he easily beat Damian with impunity. Tim has even held his own briefly against Dick Grayson. His weapon of choice is the bo staff. Tim was able to fend off several notorious assassins from the Council of Spiders at once while protecting Tam Fox and also in the end game of his plan to destroy several League of Assassins bases; earning commendation from Ra's al Ghul himself who was watching the fight from afar.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Christopher Yost|Yost, Christopher]]|penciller=Bachs, Ramon|inker=Major, Guy|title=Red Robin|volume=1|issue=4|date=November 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> He managed to survive a potentially fatal encounter with Jason Todd in ''Battle for the Cowl'' by pretending to be dead.

With a special shot, Tim is also inoculated against several toxins the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] has encountered, including Joker Venom, Scarecrow's Fear Toxin, and some of Poison Ivy's pheromones.\n\n===Other skills===\nThe most intellectually gifted of the Robins, Drake has deduced a majority of other heroes' identities, including Flash and Superman. In addition, after foiling Ra's al Ghul's master plan to assassinate everyone Bruce Wayne cared about and ruining the Wayne Family fortune, Ra's has addressed Tim as \"Detective\", a title the villain once only reserved for Bruce Wayne.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Christopher Yost|Yost, Christopher]]|penciller=[[Marcus To|To, Marcus]]|inker=McCarthy, Ray|coinkers=McKenna, Mark|title=Red Robin|volume=1|issue=12|date=July 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> His intellect has enabled him to excel in computer science and a grasp of assorted scientific techniques, including biology, engineering, and genetics, which he has been shown to use in his attempts at re-cloning Superboy.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Tony Daniel|Daniel, Tony S.]]|inker=Conrad, Kevin|coinkers=[[Art Thibert|Thibert, Art]]|title=[[Teen Titans]]|volume=3|issue=34|date=May 2006|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Tim also speaks several languages beyond his native English, including Cantonese,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]]|penciller=[[Marcus To|To, Marcus]]|inker=McCarthy, Ray|coinkers=McKenna, Mark|title=Red Robin|volume=1|issue=13|date=August 2010|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Russian,<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Fabian Nicieza|Nicieza, Fabian]]|penciller=[[Marcus To|To, Marcus]]|inker=McCarthy, Ray|title=Red Robin|volume=1|issue=18|date=February 2011|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> Spanish<ref name=\"redrobin1\" /> and German.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Christopher Yost|Yost, Christopher]]|penciller=Bachs, Ramon|inker=Major, Guy|title=Red Robin|volume=1|issue=3|date=October 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\nEven Nightwing is proud of his skills, saying that he was a better Robin than he was.\n\nDrake, like Dick Grayson and Damian Wayne, has served as leader to the Teen Titans, as well as [[Young Justice]], and was even placed in charge of the rescue efforts of Bl\u00fcdhaven by Superman, following the attack made by Deathstroke and his fellow villains.\n\n==Costumes==\n[[File:Robin (Tim Drake - circa 2005).jpg|thumb|upright|Tim Drake as he appears in ''Supergirl'' vol. 5, #2 (Nov. 2005). Art by Ian Churchill.]]\nTim Drake's original Robin costume had a red torso, yellow stitching and belt, black boots, green short sleeves, gloves, and pants,. He wore a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. This costume was different from that of his predecessors in that it provided increased protection with an armored [[tunic]] and [[gorget]], long boots, an emergency \"R\" [[shuriken]] on his chest in addition to the traditional [[batarang]]s, and a collapsible bo staff as the character's primary weapon.\n\nFollowing ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''52'', Tim Drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend, [[Superboy (Kon-El)]], who died fighting Earth-Prime [[Superman-Prime|Superboy]]. This Robin costume had a red torso, long sleeves, and pants with a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. It also had yellow stitching and belt, and black domino mask, gloves, and boots.\n\nTim Drake resumed the motif of a red and black costume when he took on the identity of [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]. The Red Robin costume consisted of a long-sleeved red tunic, along with black boots, tights, gloves, cape and cowl. It also included a black-and-gold utility belt that carries Drake's weaponry such as his bo staff and throwing discs. After Drake's confrontation with Ra's al Ghul in ''Red Robin'' #12, the costume was slightly altered with spiked gauntlets, a cropped tunic, and a new utility belt.\n\nThe theme of a red and black costume continued in 2011 with Tim Drake's [[the New 52|New 52]] Red Robin outfit. The costume was altered considerably, as it was a single piece red and black costume, with assorted belts on his waist and legs. The full cowl was replaced with a black domino mask, similar to his previous two Robin costume designs. His chest harness was attached to a set of rocket powered wings, designed by Virgil Hawkins a.k.a. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], that allow Red Robin the ability of flight. He continued to use his bo staff and other assorted equipment.\n\nIn the 2016 [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch, Tim Drake maintains the role of Red Robin. This Red Robin costume serves as a homage to his first Robin costume. His costume is returned to a similar look as his original Robin costume consisting of a red torso, yellow utility belt, black pants, and green short sleeves, gloves, and boots. He also has new cape that is black on the outside and yellow on the inside similar to the Robin cape. While his Red Robin suit is similar to his first Robin suit, it has two \"R\"s as his logo instead of one, to show that he is no longer Robin and now Red Robin. The mask is similar to his New 52 domino mask. His bo-staff remains his primary weapon.\n\nWith the revived [[Young Justice]] series, Tim has returned to the identity of Robin.  His new costume shares similarities with his Rebirth suit, however with various adjustments and revisions.  His suit still has the red torso, black pants, and armored sleeves.  However his pants now merge into split-toed boots with green highlights, losing the green leg guards. He's replaced the bulkier arm guards with smaller arm guards with blades similar to Damian Wayne's Robin suit.  His cape, while still black and gold, is now scalloped to looks similar to his OYL later cape. Tim's double-R logo has been replaced with his original single \"R\" logo.  He continues to use a bo-staff as his primary weapon.\n\nLater in Young Justice, Tim adopts the Drake identity and receives a new suit. The Drake suit is primarily brown throughout the body with black on the arms and boots. It also consists of gold lines and patterns all throughout the suit. The suit lacks a cape. The suit has a black wing-shaped domino mask a red utility belt with a gold buckle that has the bat symbol. The logo is on his right pectoral like the Robin logo, but is a red crescent. He continues to use a bo-staff as his primary weapon.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\n\n===''Batman Beyond''===\nSet after the events of ''Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker'', Tim Drake serves as a supporting character in the ongoing ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic book series. It is suggested that, after a series of examinations, he is freed from the Joker's control although the experience has left him with doubts and he continues to struggle to keep his sanity intact. His wife is revealed to have been aware of her husband's heroic and tortured past, and implied to have met Tim and his former mentor at some point before he retires as Robin.\n\nBruce offered Tim a job in his company, which he accepted, after he merged it with Lucius Fox Jr.'s company Foxteca and renamed the company Wayne Incorporated. The condition, that Tim would not get himself involved with the superheroic activities of Bruce, Terry, or the JLU and Bruce would pay for his children's college tuition.<ref>''Batman Beyond Unlimited'' #2 (May 2012)</ref> He is currently working as a communications expert handling satellites and other associated technology.\n\n=== ''Titans Tomorrow'' ===\n{{main|Titans Tomorrow}}\nIn the \"Titans Tomorrow\" story arc during writer [[Geoff Johns]]' run on ''[[Teen Titans]]'', Robin and the rest of the team encounter future versions of themselves from a time after all of their mentors have been killed. As a brutal new Batman, Tim Drake personally hunted down every member of his mentor's Rogues Gallery, turning [[Arkham Asylum]] into a cemetery filled with the graves of the original Batman's enemies, whom Tim killed using the same pistol that [[Joe Chill]] used to murder [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] when Bruce was a child. Tim had difficulty accepting that he could ever adopt such brutal methods as the direct successor to Batman, who always maintained a strict policy against murder. In a final battle culminating in both present and future Titans colliding, the battle ends in a stalemate. Using a Cosmic Treadmill in the adult Tim's Batcave, Robin and his team return home to contemplate the future they've seen.<ref name=\"TTvol3no17\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]]|title=Teen Titans|volume=3|issue=17|date=December 2004|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn this reality, based on the video game of the same name, Tim Drake was a new member of the Teen Titans as Red Robin at the time the Joker's nuclear explosion went off in Metropolis. The Titans tracked down Superboy to the Fortress of Solitude where he attempted to stop Superman. Tim tries lifting the Phantom Zone projector, but cannot because Superman placed a safety cap that weighs a hundred tons. When Superboy is mortally wounded, Tim and the other Titans are sent by Superman to the Phantom Zone.\n\nIn the prequel to ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Tim and the Titans (minus Superboy) are finally rescued by the remaining heroes. But just as he's reuniting with Batman, General Zod escapes the Phantom Zone and kills Tim by piercing his heart with heat vision.\n\n===''DC Bombshells''===\nTim Drake appears in the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity as a former prisoner of Katherine-Webb Kane's orphanage, where he and the others were forced to build robots for Axis supporters. He is eventually rescued by the Batgirls, whom he joins afterwards, wearing a baseball costume similar to his Robin costume on the main earth. He appears close to Alysia Yeoh.<ref>''DC Bombshells'' #7</ref>\n\n===''The New 52: Futures End'' and ''Batman Beyond''===\nIn the ''Futures End'' series, an older Tim Drake takes the role of '''[[Batman]]''' after Terry McGinnis dies. In 2015 Drake stars in the new ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' series. In the series, Tim Drake faked his death during the war between Earth Prime and Earth-2 and became a bar owner by the name of Cal Corcoran. He assisted Terry McGinnis who had come back through time to prevent the creation of Brother Eye. After Terry was killed in action defending Drake from Brother Eye's Batman/Joker Hybrid (a Brother Eye-controlled fusion of Batman and Joker from Terry's timeline) he passed on his futuristic Batsuit to Tim and in his dying wish asked him to become the new Batman and go back through time to prevent the war between Prime Earth and Earth 2, which he believed will prevent the creation of Brother Eye.\n\nHe successfully travels back through time 5 years using a time band and convinces Brother Eye to not send a beacon to attract the surviving hero's of Earth-2 thus preventing the war with Earth 2. Following the completion of his mission Brother Eye sends Tim back to Terry's timeline hoping to find Terry alive so he can return the Batsuit to him. However what he finds is still same future Terry came from realizing that Terrifitech is a constant and Brother Eye cannot be defeated in the past Tim declares that Brother Eye has not won yet.\n\nA few days later Tim stops a break in at a Wayne-Powers facility by Jokers who attempt to steal a critical component that keeps Brother Eye from detecting Gotham City. He later meets up with Terry's brother Matt who is angry at Tim for wearing his brother's costume and in private declares that he should have been the one who succeed Terry as Batman.\n\nFollowing the meeting Tim heads outside Gotham City to an internment camp that holding all people captured by Brother Eye. Before he can break into the facility he is attacked by a Brother Eye converted Superman who attempts to kill him. Knowing he cannot kill Superman A.L.F.R.E.D overloads the Batsuits power reserves, temporally injuring Superman. As a result, the Batsuit deactivates itself leaving Tim in his civilian attire and defenceless against Brother Eye's army. He is then captured and placed in a detention center where he meets Terry's friend Max Gibson and to his surprise Barbara Gordon.\n\nHowever, following DC's Rebirth, Terry McGinnis is back to life and has once again taken the mantle of Batman Beyond. The future New 52 Tim has been erased due to the timeline change.\n\n===''Nightwing: The New Order''===\nIn this alternate reality, Nightwing ends an ongoing feud between superpowered beings by activating a device that depowers ninety percent of the super powered population. This builds to a future where super powers are outlawed and any super powered being must take inhibitor medications or be contained and studied should the medications not work on them. In the year 2040, Tim's retired from his Red Robin days and is now raising his three children. When Dick becomes a fugitive after it is discovered his son Jake had superpowers, Tim uses his computer skills to help Dick locate Jake. Tim believes that Dick made the right choice in depowering the population.<ref>''Nightwing: The New Order''(2017)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n{{See also|Robin in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n*Tim Drake appears as a supporting character in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'', voiced by Cameron Bowen. This iteration's Robin costume is similar to his \"One Year Later\" costume with some modern influences, and he uses a bo-staff as a weapon like in the comics. He is introduced in the episode \"Happy New Year\" as the third version of Robin. In the episode \"Satisfaction\", he is seen observing [[Jason Todd]]'s memorial. Tim is shown as initially hesitant to take on leadership roles, something he feels is somewhat forced on by Nightwing. Despite this, the two are shown to have a brotherly connection to one another. This familial relationship also extends to the more experienced Batgirl. Like [[Dick Grayson]] in season one, Tim is forbidden from revealing his secret identity to the team (wearing concealing sunglasses when out of costume). He shares a brief moment of interaction with [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] during the episode \"Before the Dawn\". In the finale \"Endgame\", it is shown that he is in a relationship with [[Wonder Girl]] after [[Wally West|Kid Flash]]'s demise gave Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him.

[[Batman]]. Created by [[Marv Wolfman]] and [[Pat Broderick]], he first appeared in [[Batman: Year Three|''Batman'' #436]] (August 1989) as the third character to assume the role of Batman's vigilante partner '''[[Robin (character)|Robin]]'''. Following the events in ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'' in 2009, Drake adopted the alias of '''[[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]'''. In 2019, Tim returned to his original Robin persona in the Wonder Comics relaunch of ''[[Young Justice]]'', but later adopted his current codename '''Drake'''.\n\nAs a young boy, Tim was in the audience the night Dick Grayson's parents were murdered and later managed to discover the identities of Batman and the original Robin through their exploits. After the death of the second Robin, [[Jason Todd]], and witnessing Batman spiral into darkness, Tim was convinced that he should train to become the third Robin.\n\nThe character has been featured in various adaptations, including the animated television series ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'', and the video game series ''[[Batman: Arkham]]''. In 2011, Tim Drake was ranked 32nd in [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.\n\n==Publication history==\nTim Drake was named after [[Tim Burton]], director of the then-upcoming [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 film]], and introduced in 1989's ''Batman: Year Three'' and his origin detailed in ''Batman: A Lonely Place of Dying'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 241 |quote = With the pencils of [George] P\u00e9rez, Jim Aparo, and Tom Grummett, [Marv] Wolfman concocted the five-issue 'A Lonely Place of Dying'...In it, Tim Drake...earned his place as the new Robin.}}</ref> in which he first introduced himself to [[Dick Grayson]] and impressed the former Robin with his skills. This led to Grayson and later [[Alfred Pennyworth]], Bruce Wayne's butler, to support Tim's request to be Batman's new partner. Not wanting to make the same mistake as he did with [[Jason Todd]], Batman had Tim endure an intensive period of training that was never given to his predecessors. Eventually, after Tim rescues Batman from [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], he proves his capability and becomes Robin. ''Batman'' editor Dennis O'Neil hoped that Grayson's approval of Drake would ease reader acceptance of him. Evidently, this approach was successful with the character being so accepted by readers that, after three successful miniseries, the character had his own 183-issue series from 1993 through 2009.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Dolan, p. 261: \"\"[Robin] embarked on a solo career, with the help of writer Chuck Dixon and artist Tom Grummett.\"</ref><ref name=\"comic101\">{{cite web|last=Tipton|first=Scott|url=http://www.comics101.com/comics101//?mode=project&action=view&project=Comics%20101&chapter=56|title=Heroes and Villains: Batman, Part IV|date=2003-12-17|publisher=Comics 101 Archive|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref> Mike Mullins on ''[[Newsarama]]'' has stated:\n\n<blockquote>Throughout [the entire Robin series], the character of Robin has been captured consistently, showing him to step up to greater and greater challenges. Robin is a character who shows initiative and is driven to do what he views as right. He knows he is living up to a legacy left by Dick Grayson and strives to not disappoint Bruce Wayne, Batman. Tim is a more natural detective than previous Robins and is talented with computers, which allows him to stand in his own unique spotlight. Unlike his predecessors, Tim is not the most proficient combatant and has had to really work on his fighting technique, taking up the bo staff to give him an edge that Batman does not need. Tim almost always seeks to analyze a problem and to outthink his opponent but has shown the ability to win a fight when necessary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mullins|first=Mike|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/040926-Robin.html|title=Reminiscing About Robin: A Look Back in Wonder|date=2009-04-26|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|accessdate=2010-08-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs Robin, the character has also been featured prominently in the [[Young Justice]] and 2003 [[Teen Titans]] series. As of June 2009, he took on the new identity of Red Robin, starring in yet another series by the same name.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n\n===Introduction===\nTim Drake is the son of [[Jack Drake]] and Janet Drake, coming from the same social class as Bruce Wayne.<ref name=\"batmanunauthorized\">{{cite book|title=Batman Unauthorized: Vigilantes, Jokers, and Heroes in Gotham City|last1=Porter|first1=Alan J.|authorlink=Alan J.

Inspired by the heroes' exploits, Tim trained himself in martial arts, acrobatics, detective skills, and scholastics to better himself both physically and intellectually. When Tim reached the age of thirteen, he saw that Batman had grown reckless and violent following the second Robin ([[Jason Todd]])'s murder by the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]. After his mother's death and his father's paralysis, Drake decided to intervene and Batman eventually enlisted him as the third Robin.\n\n===Robin (1989\u20132009)===\n[[File:Robin Tim Drake.jpg|thumb|Tim Drake's red and black Robin costume in ''Detective Comics'' #829 (May 2007).

He was approached by [[Ra's al Ghul]]'s assassins who were also interested in finding out what happened to Batman. At the same time, [[Tamara Fox|Tamara \"Tam\" Fox]], Lucius Fox's daughter, has been sent to find Tim Drake to bring him back to Gotham. Tim goes to Iraq and manages to discover definitive proof that Bruce was alive and lost in time, but was ambushed by an assassin from the Council of Spiders. He manages to drive himself and Pru (one of the assassins working for Ra's al Ghul, who had become an ally of Tim's) to Tam's hotel room, and they are promptly abducted by the League of Assassins.\n\nAlthough initially reluctant, Tim Drake entered into an alliance with Ra's before nearly bleeding to death due to their encounter with the Council of Spiders. He was put in charge of the [[League of Assassins]] by Ra's and used the time to simultaneously plan how to stop the Council of Spiders and destroy the League of Assassins. After failing to foil all but one of the Council's assassination attempts, Tim realizes that the Council will be attacking the League's base, and realizes that he left Tam in danger at the base. Rushing back to base, he simultaneously manages to delay the Council of Spiders, blow up the League's base, and escape with Tam.\n\nAfter crippling Ra's' League of Assassins, Drake returns to Gotham City to overthrow Ra's plans to use [[Hush (comics)|Hush]] (surgically altered to resemble Bruce Wayne) to gain control of the Wayne family resources and destroy all that Batman held dear by directing his assassins to target all of the Batman's associates. Realizing that these attacks are a smokescreen and that the real target is coercing Hush to sign away Wayne Enterprises, Red Robin decides to confront Ra's head on. He calls upon all of his friends to protect the various targets.

In this new timeline, ''Teen Titans'' #0 revealed Tim Drake's new origin, showing a large departure from his original origin, removing his connections to Dick Grayson's origin story. In the New 52, Tim is a talented athlete and computer genius who comes close to discovering the Batman's identity but never totally figures it out. When Tim finds the Batman and gets rejected for the role of sidekick, he decides to bring the Batman to him, by hacking the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s bank account and donating millions of dollars thus putting his family in danger. The Penguin's goons come after Tim and his family, but the Batman saves them. Tim's parents are forced to go into witness protection, but they believe Tim deserves better and ask Bruce to take care of him for them. The Witness Protection Program renames him \"Tim Drake,\" and he takes on the identity of \"Red Robin\", rather than the identity of \"Robin\", out of respect to Jason Todd. In recent issues he is shown to be a founding member of the Teen Titans as well as their leader, and he shows feelings for Wonder Girl.\n\nTim was unwilling to meet with the rest of the Bat-Family at the Batcave after he was infected with the Joker's new compound \"HA\". He was present when Damian was killed by The Heretic and admitted to Bruce that even though he had a dysfunctional relationship with Damian that he did grieve for him. He was also at the final battle between Batman and The Heretic when [[Talia al Ghul|Talia]] killed her son's clone and blew up Wayne Tower.\n\nTim was also part of the Bat-Family's assembled team which went to Apokolips to retrieve Damian's body. As their mission focused on retrieving Robin, Tim, Jason, and Barbara wore costumes which resembled Damian's colors and each wore a Robin symbol. Following the completion of their mission and the revival of Damian he handed him the Robin symbol on his suit to welcome Damian back to life and to the role of Robin.\n\nIn the pre-Convergence timeline of Futures End, Refugees from Earth-2 are given a signal from Brother Eye, which allow them into the Earth-0 Universe, but start a war when [[Darkseid]] follows them, leading to the deaths of the Teen Titans, except for Drake. Tim abandons his Red Robin mantle and becomes a bartender until an attack by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], where changes to the timeline are made. Brainiac is captured, and Terry McGinnis dies at the hands of Brother Eye's Batman-Joker hybrid. Tim dons the Batman Beyond suit and goes back in time and prevents Brother Eye from sending the signal to Earth-2, creating a new future where there is less destruction, and the events of Convergence and everything afterwards take place. Tim is launched into the new future, 35 years later, where he becomes the new Batman and destroys a weakened Brother Eye.\n\n===DC Rebirth (2016\u2013present)===\nIn Rebirth, Tim Drake still operates under the Red Robin alias. He gains a new and third overall Red Robin suit similar to his first Robin suit except with two \"R\"s as his logo instead of one. It is revealed later on in Detective Comics #965 that Tim Drake's origin story has reverted to that of the original universe, where he discovers Batman and Robin's identities after Jason Todd's death, and became Robin before adopting the Red Robin persona.\n\n[[File:Red Robin (Tim Drake - circa 2018).png|thumb|upright|Tim Drake as [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]] in ''Detective Comics'' #981 (May 2018).

Lost in the Multiverse, Young Justice struggles to return home, with Tim taking on the new identity of Drake.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n\n===Combat skills===\nPrior to becoming Robin, Tim Drake had been trained in the martial arts and was already a skilled and abled fighter, while also being trained in fields such as acrobatics, forensics, detective work and criminology. After becoming Robin, Drake managed to hone his fighting skills and eventually became a master hand-to-hand combatant and expert martial artist, being skilled in several fighting styles, such as [[Aikido]],<ref>''Batman Chronicles'' #22 (September 2000)</ref> [[Judo]], [[Karate]],<ref>''Batman'' vol. 1 #442 (December 1989)</ref> [[Savate]],<ref>''Secret Origins 80-Page Giant'' #1 (October 1998)</ref> [[Kung Fu]], [[Ninjutsu]], and [[Tai Chi]]<ref>''Robin'' vol. 2 #103 (August 2002)</ref>  in addition to being trained in [[gymnastics]], and was taught by numerous teachers including Batman, Dick Grayson, and Lady Shiva. Though he has been bested and beaten by other members of the Batfamily; notably Jason, he is shown to be a calculating and cunning combatant. Damian sucker punched Tim in one of their early encounters and that for a time Tim had a habit of holding back when facing off against Damian. When Tim finally decided not to hold back, he easily beat Damian with impunity. Tim has even held his own briefly against Dick Grayson. His weapon of choice is the bo staff. Tim was able to fend off several notorious assassins from the Council of Spiders at once while protecting Tam Fox and also in the end game of his plan to destroy several League of Assassins bases; earning commendation from Ra's al Ghul himself who was watching the fight from afar.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=[[Christopher Yost|Yost, Christopher]]|penciller=Bachs, Ramon|inker=Major, Guy|title=Red Robin|volume=1|issue=4|date=November 2009|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref> He managed to survive a potentially fatal encounter with Jason Todd in ''Battle for the Cowl'' by pretending to be dead.

With a special shot, Tim is also inoculated against several toxins the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] has encountered, including Joker Venom, Scarecrow's Fear Toxin, and some of Poison Ivy's pheromones.\n\n===Other skills===\nThe most intellectually gifted of the Robins, Drake has deduced a majority of other heroes' identities, including Flash and Superman.

Art by Ian Churchill.]]\nTim Drake's original Robin costume had a red torso, yellow stitching and belt, black boots, green short sleeves, gloves, and pants,. He wore a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. This costume was different from that of his predecessors in that it provided increased protection with an armored [[tunic]] and [[gorget]], long boots, an emergency \"R\" [[shuriken]] on his chest in addition to the traditional [[batarang]]s, and a collapsible bo staff as the character's primary weapon.\n\nFollowing ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' and ''52'', Tim Drake modified his costume to favor a mostly red and black color scheme in tribute to his best friend, [[Superboy (Kon-El)]], who died fighting Earth-Prime [[Superman-Prime|Superboy]]. This Robin costume had a red torso, long sleeves, and pants with a cape that was black on the outside and yellow on the inside. It also had yellow stitching and belt, and black domino mask, gloves, and boots.\n\nTim Drake resumed the motif of a red and black costume when he took on the identity of [[Red Robin (comics)|Red Robin]]. The Red Robin costume consisted of a long-sleeved red tunic, along with black boots, tights, gloves, cape and cowl. It also included a black-and-gold utility belt that carries Drake's weaponry such as his bo staff and throwing discs. After Drake's confrontation with Ra's al Ghul in ''Red Robin'' #12, the costume was slightly altered with spiked gauntlets, a cropped tunic, and a new utility belt.\n\nThe theme of a red and black costume continued in 2011 with Tim Drake's [[the New 52|New 52]] Red Robin outfit. The costume was altered considerably, as it was a single piece red and black costume, with assorted belts on his waist and legs. The full cowl was replaced with a black domino mask, similar to his previous two Robin costume designs. His chest harness was attached to a set of rocket powered wings, designed by Virgil Hawkins a.k.a. [[Static (DC Comics)|Static]], that allow Red Robin the ability of flight. He continued to use his bo staff and other assorted equipment.\n\nIn the 2016 [[DC Rebirth]] relaunch, Tim Drake maintains the role of Red Robin. This Red Robin costume serves as a homage to his first Robin costume. His costume is returned to a similar look as his original Robin costume consisting of a red torso, yellow utility belt, black pants, and green short sleeves, gloves, and boots. He also has new cape that is black on the outside and yellow on the inside similar to the Robin cape. While his Red Robin suit is similar to his first Robin suit, it has two \"R\"s as his logo instead of one, to show that he is no longer Robin and now Red Robin. The mask is similar to his New 52 domino mask. His bo-staff remains his primary weapon.\n\nWith the revived [[Young Justice]] series, Tim has returned to the identity of Robin.  His new costume shares similarities with his Rebirth suit, however with various adjustments and revisions.  His suit still has the red torso, black pants, and armored sleeves.  However his pants now merge into split-toed boots with green highlights, losing the green leg guards. He's replaced the bulkier arm guards with smaller arm guards with blades similar to Damian Wayne's Robin suit.  His cape, while still black and gold, is now scalloped to looks similar to his OYL later cape. Tim's double-R logo has been replaced with his original single \"R\" logo.  He continues to use a bo-staff as his primary weapon.\n\nLater in Young Justice, Tim adopts the Drake identity and receives a new suit. The Drake suit is primarily brown throughout the body with black on the arms and boots. It also consists of gold lines and patterns all throughout the suit. The suit lacks a cape. The suit has a black wing-shaped domino mask a red utility belt with a gold buckle that has the bat symbol. The logo is on his right pectoral like the Robin logo, but is a red crescent. He continues to use a bo-staff as his primary weapon.\n\n==Alternate versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\n\n===''Batman Beyond''===\nSet after the events of ''Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker'', Tim Drake serves as a supporting character in the ongoing ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' comic book series. It is suggested that, after a series of examinations, he is freed from the Joker's control although the experience has left him with doubts and he continues to struggle to keep his sanity intact. His wife is revealed to have been aware of her husband's heroic and tortured past, and implied to have met Tim and his former mentor at some point before he retires as Robin.\n\nBruce offered Tim a job in his company, which he accepted, after he merged it with Lucius Fox Jr.'s company Foxteca and renamed the company Wayne Incorporated. The condition, that Tim would not get himself involved with the superheroic activities of Bruce, Terry, or the JLU and Bruce would pay for his children's college tuition.<ref>''Batman Beyond Unlimited'' #2 (May 2012)</ref> He is currently working as a communications expert handling satellites and other associated technology.\n\n=== ''Titans Tomorrow'' ===\n{{main|Titans Tomorrow}}\nIn the \"Titans Tomorrow\" story arc during writer [[Geoff Johns]]' run on ''[[Teen Titans]]'', Robin and the rest of the team encounter future versions of themselves from a time after all of their mentors have been killed. As a brutal new Batman, Tim Drake personally hunted down every member of his mentor's Rogues Gallery, turning [[Arkham Asylum]] into a cemetery filled with the graves of the original Batman's enemies, whom Tim killed using the same pistol that [[Joe Chill]] used to murder [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] when Bruce was a child. Tim had difficulty accepting that he could ever adopt such brutal methods as the direct successor to Batman, who always maintained a strict policy against murder. In a final battle culminating in both present and future Titans colliding, the battle ends in a stalemate. Using a Cosmic Treadmill in the adult Tim's Batcave, Robin and his team return home to contemplate the future they've seen.<ref name=\"TTvol3no17\">{{Cite comic|writer=[[Geoff Johns|Johns, Geoff]]|penciller=[[Mike McKone|McKone, Mike]]|title=Teen Titans|volume=3|issue=17|date=December 2004|publisher=[[DC Comics]]}}</ref>\n\n===''Injustice: Gods Among Us''===\nIn this reality, based on the video game of the same name, Tim Drake was a new member of the Teen Titans as Red Robin at the time the Joker's nuclear explosion went off in Metropolis. The Titans tracked down Superboy to the Fortress of Solitude where he attempted to stop Superman. Tim tries lifting the Phantom Zone projector, but cannot because Superman placed a safety cap that weighs a hundred tons. When Superboy is mortally wounded, Tim and the other Titans are sent by Superman to the Phantom Zone.\n\nIn the prequel to ''[[Injustice 2]]'', Tim and the Titans (minus Superboy) are finally rescued by the remaining heroes. But just as he's reuniting with Batman, General Zod escapes the Phantom Zone and kills Tim by piercing his heart with heat vision.\n\n===''DC Bombshells''===\nTim Drake appears in the ''[[DC Bombshells]]'' continuity as a former prisoner of Katherine-Webb Kane's orphanage, where he and the others were forced to build robots for Axis supporters. He is eventually rescued by the Batgirls, whom he joins afterwards, wearing a baseball costume similar to his Robin costume on the main earth. He appears close to Alysia Yeoh.<ref>''DC Bombshells'' #7</ref>\n\n===''The New 52: Futures End'' and ''Batman Beyond''===\nIn the ''Futures End'' series, an older Tim Drake takes the role of '''[[Batman]]''' after Terry McGinnis dies. In 2015 Drake stars in the new ''[[Batman Beyond (comics)|Batman Beyond]]'' series. In the series, Tim Drake faked his death during the war between Earth Prime and Earth-2 and became a bar owner by the name of Cal Corcoran. He assisted Terry McGinnis who had come back through time to prevent the creation of Brother Eye. After Terry was killed in action defending Drake from Brother Eye's Batman/Joker Hybrid (a Brother Eye-controlled fusion of Batman and Joker from Terry's timeline) he passed on his futuristic Batsuit to Tim and in his dying wish asked him to become the new Batman and go back through time to prevent the war between Prime Earth and Earth 2, which he believed will prevent the creation of Brother Eye.\n\nHe successfully travels back through time 5 years using a time band and convinces Brother Eye to not send a beacon to attract the surviving hero's of Earth-2 thus preventing the war with Earth 2. Following the completion of his mission Brother Eye sends Tim back to Terry's timeline hoping to find Terry alive so he can return the Batsuit to him. However what he finds is still same future Terry came from realizing that Terrifitech is a constant and Brother Eye cannot be defeated in the past Tim declares that Brother Eye has not won yet.\n\nA few days later Tim stops a break in at a Wayne-Powers facility by Jokers who attempt to steal a critical component that keeps Brother Eye from detecting Gotham City. He later meets up with Terry's brother Matt who is angry at Tim for wearing his brother's costume and in private declares that he should have been the one who succeed Terry as Batman.\n\nFollowing the meeting Tim heads outside Gotham City to an internment camp that holding all people captured by Brother Eye. Before he can break into the facility he is attacked by a Brother Eye converted Superman who attempts to kill him. Knowing he cannot kill Superman A.L.F.R.E.D overloads the Batsuits power reserves, temporally injuring Superman. As a result, the Batsuit deactivates itself leaving Tim in his civilian attire and defenceless against Brother Eye's army. He is then captured and placed in a detention center where he meets Terry's friend Max Gibson and to his surprise Barbara Gordon.\n\nHowever, following DC's Rebirth, Terry McGinnis is back to life and has once again taken the mantle of Batman Beyond. The future New 52 Tim has been erased due to the timeline change.\n\n===''Nightwing: The New Order''===\nIn this alternate reality, Nightwing ends an ongoing feud between superpowered beings by activating a device that depowers ninety percent of the super powered population. This builds to a future where super powers are outlawed and any super powered being must take inhibitor medications or be contained and studied should the medications not work on them. In the year 2040, Tim's retired from his Red Robin days and is now raising his three children. When Dick becomes a fugitive after it is discovered his son Jake had superpowers, Tim uses his computer skills to help Dick locate Jake. Tim believes that Dick made the right choice in depowering the population.<ref>''Nightwing: The New Order''(2017)</ref>\n\n==In other media==\n{{See also|Robin in other media}}\n\n===Television===\n*Tim Drake appears as a supporting character in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice: Invasion]]'', voiced by Cameron Bowen. This iteration's Robin costume is similar to his \"One Year Later\" costume with some modern influences, and he uses a bo-staff as a weapon like in the comics. He is introduced in the episode \"Happy New Year\" as the third version of Robin. In the episode \"Satisfaction\", he is seen observing [[Jason Todd]]'s memorial. Tim is shown as initially hesitant to take on leadership roles, something he feels is somewhat forced on by Nightwing. Despite this, the two are shown to have a brotherly connection to one another. This familial relationship also extends to the more experienced Batgirl. Like [[Dick Grayson]] in season one, Tim is forbidden from revealing his secret identity to the team (wearing concealing sunglasses when out of costume). He shares a brief moment of interaction with [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]] during the episode \"Before the Dawn\". In the finale \"Endgame\", it is shown that he is in a relationship with [[Wonder Girl]] after [[Wally West|Kid Flash]]'s demise gave Wonder Girl the courage to kiss him.

The producers describe this version of the character as grittier and darker, to fit the tone of the series. Robin's costume has also been radically redesigned, incorporating the traditional red and yellow colors, and he shows a more muscled appearance with a short buzz-cut (similar to Robin's hairstyle from ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''). \n* Robin first appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', voiced by [[Troy Baker]]. He makes a brief appearance in the main story of the game, where he rescues Batman from several [[League of Assasins|League of Shadows]] assasins, one of whom Batman is following to find [[Ra's al Ghul]]. After all the assasins but one, who runs away, are defeated, Robin reveals that he was called by [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] to assist Batman on his quest in Arkham City, but Batman declines his help and gives him a sample of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s infected blood that the villain has injected him with, tasking Robin with analyzing it and look after Gotham in his absence. Robin makes no further appearances in the main story, but later returns as the main playable protagonist of the \"Harley Quinn's Revenge\" [[Downloadable content|DLC]] campaign, where he, assisted by Barbara, rescues Batman after he was captured by [[Harley Quinn]] in Arkham City, shortly after the Joker's death at the end of the main story. Robin is also a playable character in all of the challenge maps, and has two additional costumes: his Red Robin costume from the comics, and [[Dick Grayson]]'s Robin costume from ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=Batman: Arkham City \u2013 Everyone Probably Gets Robin|url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2011/06/14/batman-arkham-city-everyone-probably-gets-robin|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n* Robin appears as a [[Boss (gaming)|boss]] in the mobile game ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', a [[prequel]] for ''Batman: Arkham City'', set shortly before the events of that game. While in Arkham City for unknown reasons, Robin was captured by [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] and placed under her mind-control. He was forced to fight Batman when he arrived to apperhend Ivy, but Batman ultimately defeated both of them and released Robin from the mind-control.\n* Robin appears as one of the main characters in ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', voiced by [[Matthew Mercer]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=matthewmercer|author=Matthew Mercer|number=596430660346060800|date=7 May 2015|title=I am extremely proud to announce that I am the voice of Tim Drake (Robin) in #ArkhamKnight!}}</ref> Through the game, both him and Barbara try to convince Batman to allow him to help with taking down [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]], but Batman declines and tasks Robin with finding a cure for the people infected with the Joker's toxic blood, which is slowly turning them into the Joker themselves. After Harley Quinn learns of this, she and her goons attack Batman and Robin's secret hideout at the abandoned Panessa Studios, forcing Batman to temporarly abandon his quest for Scarecrow and come to Robin's aid. Batman and Robin work together and manage to defeat Harley and recapture all the infected people, but one of them, Henry Adams, who pretended to have been sane all along, kills them and then commits suicide, after learning that Batman is also infected with the Joker's blood. Robin locks Batman up for his own good and leaves to stop Scarecrow on his own, but Batman escapes from his containment and locks Robin up instead, for his own safety, when he returns to check on him. At the end of the main story, Scarecrow captures both Robin and Commissioner [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] and forces Batman to surrender to him, unmasking him in front of the world on television, but Batman is able to overcome Scarecrow's fear toxin and defeats the villain, while also mentally resisting his transformation into the Joker and erasing the villain from his mind for good. At the end of the game, Batman seemingly commits suicide to protect all his loved ones now that his secret identity has been revealed, leaving Robin to continue crime fighting in Gotham to maintain his legacy alive; Tim also proposes to Barbara and the two get married. \n**Robin appears in the ''Batgirl: A Matter of Family'' DLC campaign, set before the [[Batman: Arkham Asylum|series' first installment]]. In the DLC, Robin works with Barbara during her days as Batgirl to rescue her father, James Gordon, and several other GCPD officers from the Joker and Harley Quinn at a disfunct oil rig.\n**Robin also serves as the playable protagonist of the ''A Flip of the Coin'' DLC mission, where his [[honeymoon]] with Barbara is cut short after [[Two-Face]] escapes from prison and takes over Hell's Gate Disposal Services, forcing Robin to come and try to apperhend him back. With Barbara's aid, Robin is eventually able to defeat Two-Face and return him to custody, before deciding to cancel his honeymoon with Barbara and return to Gotham to continue fighting crime.\n**Robin was later added as a playable character for the game's challenge maps, with four alternate costumes: his original, ''[[The New 52|New 52]]'', and ''[[One Year Later]]'' appearances, as well as Dick Grayson's Robin costume from [[Batman (TV series)|the classic 1960s ''Batman ''TV series]].\n* Robin makes a brief appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham VR]]'', voiced by [[Tom Austen]].<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web | title=Voice Of Robin / Tim Drake \u2013 Batman <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors | url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Batman/Robin-Tim-Drake/ | work=Behind The Voice Actors | accessdate=September 25, 2017| postscript=.

However, it is revealed at the end of the game that everything was just a nightmare that Batman had under the influence of the Joker's contaminated blood inside him, taking place shortly before the events of ''Arkham Knight''.\n\n====''Injustice'' series====\n* Tim Drake is featured in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. His name is listed on a hit list during [[Deathstroke]]'s outro, and the Red Robin is on an unplayable card in the game's iOS version.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n* The Red Robin makes a cameo appearance in ''[[Injustice 2]]'' in [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]'s ending as one of the lost Teen Titans brought back by Cyborg with [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]'s powers.\n\n==Collected editions==\nIn 1993, a few years after his debut as Robin, DC launched a monthly solo series featuring Tim Drake's adventures as Robin, with Batman appearing as a supporting character.
